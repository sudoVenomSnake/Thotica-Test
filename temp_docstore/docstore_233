After all the testimonies had been voiced and heard, each jury member expressed their personal views, thoughts, and words of wisdom in response to the courageous women and their experiences. Highlights of Jury Statements Women are considered passive, weak, and vulnerable, and traffi cking is rooted in and reinforces these assumptions. Further, cultural and societal norms exacerbate the vulnerability of women, who can be easily abused without invoking public outrage. This is also considered one of the expectations of being a woman.

To combat traffi cking across the borders of the region, all factors that fuel it must be confronted and aggressively dealt with by all countries. For a start, there must be a clear understanding of the root causes of traffi cking in an informal economy.36 Stressing the importance of initiating strict legal action against the perpetrators, the jury pointed to the need to confront the syndicates that buy, sell, and transport women by force, deceit, and coercion, apart from evolving a system to monitor recruiting agencies and their possible links with such international organizations. Access to even basic services is almost non-existent for traffi cked women. Only those who manage to contact certain NGOs have been able to access healthcare, treatment, counselling, and support. But NGOs have limited resources, particularly in such times as the current economic crisis, which is at the same time fuelling the level of traffi cking and HIV infection. Thus, for every woman who is assisted by an NGO, many more are left to fend for themselves, thereby increasing their desperation and vulnerability.37 Reiterating the need to address the roots of the socio-economic context that make women vulnerable to exploitation through progressive and affi rmative action, the jury felt that it was vital to put in place a mechanism for timely and eff ective legal aid for women who suff er extreme dispossession and discrimination. Traffi cking and HIV must be seen in a larger context of migration. For instance, in the Philippines, with one in every three persons who test positive for HIV being an overseas worker, the vulnerabilities related to unsafe migration and mobility call for responses that address the entire spectrum of migration \u2013 from departure to return.38 It is crucial to put in place a range of services, including counselling, restoration, and rehabilitation, for the survivors of traffi cking from the moment that they are rescued. The jury also drew attention to the crucial role that must be played by civil society to help victims and survivors in their empowerment and recovery process, if they are to be prevented from being re-traffi cked. It was a humbling revelation for the jury members that \u201cthe stories of traffi cking were no diff erent from those of slavery and bondage.\u201d Even as the jury members empathized with the pain of the women, they were impressed by their strength and courage to speak out not only for themselves but also for the millions of women who are still in enslavement. 35 Sylvia Marcos, Center for Psycho-ethnological Research, Mexico, and Jury Member, South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. 36 Annette Sykes, lawyer, New Zealand, and Jury Member, South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. 37 Marina Mahatir, member, International Steering Committee, Asia Pacifi c Leadership Forum on HIV and Development, Malaysia, and Jury Member, South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. 38 Esperanza Cabral, Secretary, Department of Social Welfare and Development, Philippines, and Jury Member, South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. 26 According to the jury members, the Court was a truly liberating and healing experience whereby the victims, who made public their \u2018socially shameful\u2019 suff erings, become powerful agents for change.

These vulnerabilities are rooted in the disempowerment that they confront in their daily lives, and are manifestations of the unequal and disturbing social reality that has resulted as a consequence of inequitable economic policies that have impacted on their families, their communities, and their homelands of origin. Most of the traf cked women dream of a better life outside their places of origin. However, the intense poverty and helplessness that compel them to migrate exacerbates their vulnerability to traf cking and HIV. In several countries, traf cked individuals are exploited by the same laws that are meant to protect them; they are treated as \u201cillegal migrants\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d and are often denied their rights and left with few choices. We recommend that: 1. Urgent action be taken to break the cycle of poverty, violence, traf cking, and HIV. This necessitates human rights-sensitive policies and practices that should be complemented by an enabling socio- political and legal environment that empowers women. There is a crucial role for civil society to help victims/survivors and to aid their recovery and empowerment. 2. When crimes against women are reported, there should be strict legal action against the perpetrators. There is also a need to confront the syndicates that buy, sell, and transport women by force, deceit, and coercion. 3. All recruitment agencies for migrant workers that are operating in the South-East Asia and Pacif c regions should be monitored to ensure that the practices conform with human rights norms and protocols and to ensure that their operations do not amount to criminal conduct. 4. There should be continual assessment to ensure that there is no collaboration between multinationals who are served by such agencies and the nations of the region to avoid mutual complicity in the ongoing exploitation of those most vulnerable to human traf cking. 27 JURY STATEMENTS 5. Progressive and af rmative action is needed to address the socio-economic context that makes these women vulnerable to violence, exploitation and traf cking, and HIV. It is vital that a timely and an ef ective legal process be available to prevent dispossession and discrimination. 6. Survivors of traf cking need a range of services, such as counselling and restoration, not only by their own governments and people but also by the governments and peoples across borders. 7. All forms of discrimination, including discrimination against women infected with HIV and their particular needs, wherever it exists, need to be urgently addressed by all actors. 8. States and other institutions recognize civil society organizations and facilitate their increased involvement in promoting af rmative action measures that must be designed \u2013 and ef ectively enforced \u2013 to deal with the socially and culturally constructed disadvantage of women in the areas of traf cking and HIV/AIDS. This cannot stop at formal measures to ensure proper access to justice, but must extend to address the economic and social challenges that arise. 9. All States re-examine their economic policies and remove the priority given to commodif cation of the essential human rights to housing; health care, land, property, and sanitation. These economic policies aggravate the already adverse housing and living conditions, forced evictions, out-casting, and dispossession that women are facing, thereby increasing their vulnerability to traf cking and HIV. 10. There is urgently required a collective, inclusive response to be developed that draws strength from all actors in the South-East Asian region \u2013 including states, institutions, and community leaders \u2013 to f nd appropriate strategies to prevent and eliminate human traf cking, which should be based on human rights principles and empowerment strategies, rather than inappropriately using only law enforcement.

While each of the 22 personal testimonials was intrinsically unique, there were common threads that united them. The first is the extreme violence each endured, equivalent to the cruelty of slavery. The second is the extreme discrimination, with a perverse transfer of guilt from those who perpetuated the violence to those who were their victims. The third is the courage and generosity that underpins the spirit of each one of them, despite all that had been endured. Indeed, one of the most moving experiences of the Court was that almost all those who testified felt that after breaking their silence in public they realized that they had the power and the ability to implement positive change, primarily because they now felt that they were not alone in fighting their battle. The testimonials confirmed that the problems brought about by trafficking and unsafe migration were rooted in poverty, illiteracy, the position and disempowerment of the women within and outside the family, and well organized global networks of traffickers. It was brought out that some of the ways in which the countries of the region deal with human trafficking include stringent laws, strict enforcement, and severe penalties. But these were more to the detriment of the vulnerable women, because most often they are misused or abused by those in authority. The testimonials were so compelling that they served as a challenge to everyone in the Court, including key decision-makers and leaders of the countries of the region, to deal with the roots of trafficking in a way that preserves the rights and dignity of women. The testimonies gave a clarion call to build a strong, collective, and collaborative strategy and to take action across the region. A point that was reiterated in all the testimonies was that a multitude and a multiplicity of events happen to these exploited women, all of which need to be addressed simultaneously on a war-like footing. For this to happen, there is an urgent need to begin a process of dialogue among all the major stakeholders in the region, including those who are working on behalf of women\u2019s rights and sex workers and those working against trafficking and AIDS. While much good work is already being done, unfortunately all too often the various stakeholders work in isolation and are overly compartmentalized. Worse, at times such work can even be at cross-purposes. Acknowledging this, and recognizing that each stakeholder has a sphere of influence that is unique and vital, there is a need for all parties to engage in a dialogue \u2013 sharing their perspectives and identifying key areas that they can address collectively to make a significant difference in the lives of the women and girls who they seek to aid. Key Issues and Challenges It is well established that unsafe or forced migration and trafficking of women and girls are primarily driven by gender inequality that permeates the system at all levels. It is this deep-rooted unequal system that needs to be addressed by laws and policies that govern the societies through economic, social, health, and legal structures. Human rights should be made the central platform to raise voices against trafficking and in support of the free, just, and safe movement of women. But their rights have not been pushed or sufficiently advocated for in the region, and hence they do not find adequate resonance in national policies and laws. Any model of intervention that seeks to address violence against women and trafficking should have human rights at its core; and efforts directed at combating the spread of HIV should be broadened to include such issues as access to justice.39 If trafficking is to be addressed effectively, there is a need to recognize that women\u2019s rights cannot be privatized, compartmentalized, or relegated to domestic policies alone; they should be seen in a transnational context.40 There needs to be coordinated steps by governments not only internally but also externally, through international cooperation, as trafficking largely happens across national borders. 39 Hakan Bjorkman, Country Director, UNDP, Indonesia, in South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. 40 Sykes. 30 Though the anti-trafficking laws implemented in some countries of the region recognize human trafficking and sexual exploitation as crimes, key challenges still remain, which include recognizing and protecting victims; understanding the entire process and ramifications of trafficking; and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd0eedeb-1423-4006-b652-ed8db56d3fd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd0eedeb-1423-4006-b652-ed8db56d3fd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The South-East Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking: From Vulnerability to Free, Just, and Safe Movement - Summary Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca6d216974b23d6757f543b5ff0d56382317996c9f764fed5e948f4d2a0c0d9e"}, "3": {"node_id": "1dba18ec-e032-40e0-a7a4-cc8d35e4f82b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-court-women-hiv-and-human-trafficking-vulnerability-free-just-and-safe-movement-summary-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "187e1a52c4752e1ba2c448ba7c8b2968c63a747f07f14fcc4df1b338de467523"}}, "hash": "028872a508042028f71b822669c2b646a1f6000d7209f8a5306bdfb5e2064c5b", "text": "recognizing and using a rights-based approach.41 In the case of Cambodia, for example, the law targets the trafficker but has no provision to recognize and treat the woman as a victim of trafficking.42 Experiences from the implementation of anti-trafficking laws in the countries of the region show that their implementation has been used in some countries much to the detriment of both trafficked women and sex workers, whose rights, health, and dignity have been severely and in some cases brutally denied.

It is also important to examine the issue of accessing law from various perspectives.43 The linkages among trafficking, sex work, and HIV are so complex that they should not be dealt with from purely an \u2018anti- crime\u2019 perspective, which, if not implemented with care and respect for the rights of all affected women, can worsen rather than improve the situation. This is clearly discernable from the public health impact of inappropriate implementation of anti- trafficking measures, which in some countries has driven the sex industry further underground, making it more difficult to reach trafficked women and girls. Furthermore, it jeopardizes the ability to access HIV prevention and treatment services and to negotiate safe-sex practices with their clients. While anti-trafficking laws are the most obvious legal instruments in dealing with trafficking, they are not necessarily the most important ones. Some indirect criminal and civil laws, such as those on labour, child protection, employment, immigration, and health, have a direct impact on human trafficking. These raise a number of cross-country issues, such as whether national constitutions guarantee rights for non-nationals in a trafficked situation or whether a Cambodian who is trafficked to Thailand could invoke the Thai constitution for protection. The existing systems of the region make it extremely difficult for the public to access information. Under these circumstances, it is an enormous task to get transnational evidence, extra-territorial information, and extradition orders. Most people trafficked do not have access to judicial courts, and even otherwise, it is not clear which courts to access. For instance, it is not clear whether the remedy for children who are trafficked should come from the civil, criminal or juvenile court. Most often, instead of being taken to juvenile courts, which have special procedures for children, they are taken to regular criminal courts. Even juvenile courts are only for children who have done wrong \u2013 not for those who are victims of trafficking. Another important issue that arises during the legal process is the criminalization of victims. This is directly related to the issue of identification: is the individual a victim of trafficking or not? There is thus the need for inter-agency cooperation to help identify victims as distinct from other individuals who may be involved in similar activities, as well as to improve the entire implementation system through capacity building, such as the training of judges and police on issues of migration and trafficking. Specific steps that need to be taken to enhance the implementation of the law include transparent implementation; community participation in implementation; characterizing trafficking in clear terms; criminalizing trafficking but not the victims; protecting victims and their rights (both nationals and non-nationals) in a non-discriminatory manner; setting procedures to identify victims; putting in place a return and reintegration process that meets the needs and demands of the individual; working out compensation and restitution mechanisms; ensuring inter-agency participation and cross-referrals; ensuring cooperation within countries and across borders; and putting in place a mechanism for community cooperation in reviewing and following up cases and providing support. 41 Ly. 42 Ibid. 43 Vitit Muntarbhorn, Professor of Law and former UN Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography, Thailand, and Jury Member, South-East Asia Court of Women, Bali, 2009. 31 THE WAY FORWARD Clearly, laws alone are not enough. What is important is to understand their reach and effect on victims. Currently, laws are imposed from above, but there is a need for evidence-based legislation predicated upon the grassroots experience of, and dialogue among, all groups concerned with the free, just, and safe movement of women and girls.

Conclusion The voices, experiences, knowledge, and wisdom of affected women should be at the centre of any discourse on trafficking and HIV. The best way to do this is to hear them in their own voices. It is important to first understand clearly the different set of issues that have to be addressed while dealing with human trafficking, migration, sex work, and HIV; to study them collectively; to identify those issues that can be addressed immediately; to recognize the local stakeholders who should be involved in dealing with the issues; and to devise ways of addressing them as comprehensively, not individually. A concrete action plan is needed to move this agenda forward. To begin, it would be useful to replicate the Court of Women in other countries of the region, such as Cambodia and Thailand, so as to provide additional opportunities for the victims of trafficking to speak out in a safe public space, as well as to enable all the stakeholders of the country to forge their collective efforts and follow them up with local action plans of their own.

Annexes Contents v The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises We would like to extend our appreciation to Scott Bamber, an independent consultant who carried out the comprehensive assessment of the Women and Wealth Project (WWP) and authored this report. By reviewing an extensive amount of relevant materials; visiting all the existing project sites; interacting with the staff; and interviewing key stakeholders, he was able to capture the essence of WWP, to disaggregate various factors of success and failure, and to provide insights and recommendations for future endeavours. We would also like to thank all the staff members from the women\u2019s groups participating in WWP and all the supporting individuals and organizations including the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand and UNDP Cambodia and India. WWP, together with this assessment, has only been made possible by their dedication to empowering women living with HIV; mitigating the socioeconomic impact of HIV; and collectively pursuing better HIV responses. I would also like to extend our appreciation to the Government of Japan for its funding support for WWP. Although WWP officially ended in December 2011, it is hoped that the spirit, experiences and lessons from this pilot project will continue to live and assist those living with, affected by, and vulnerable to HIV. Clifton Cortez Practice Leader HIV, Health and Development UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre, Bangkok, Thailand Many people helped make this assessment possible, but special acknowledgement should be made of the contribution made by the ladies involved in WWP for their willingness to share their thoughts and opinions, as well as their time, which were greatly appreciated. Particular thanks are also due to Kazuyuki Uji, Clifton Cortez and Pranee Threekul, at UNDP APRC, for their support during the assignment, as well as Mini John for her wonderful help in making arrangements for the site visits and preparation of the business results data. At PDA, Bangkok, Barbara Eagles and Urai Homthawee were very generous with their time and resources, and helped provide a good understanding of the WWP, its benefits, challenges and future directions.

The WWP sought to empower and improve the well-being of women living with HIV through the development of social enterprises that would provide a livelihood and a safe working environment free of stigma and discrimination, build self-confidence and increase community acceptance. Specifically, the project had the following objectives: 1. To provide women living with HIV an opportunity to lead a life with hope, economic security and dignity through the development and operation of small social enterprises; 2. To reduce stigma and discrimination against women living with and affected by HIV through business interactions and raising their status and public perceptions as important income earners and social contributors; 3. To increase public awareness and understanding about HIV, leading to a greater acceptance of people living with HIV. As originally conceived by UNDP, the WWP was intended to provide a sustainable livelihood for women and their families, to relieve the immediate issue of lack of income, and re-build women\u2019s self-confidence and self-esteem through individual and collective empowerment. As well as addressing these core issues, the successful implementation of a social enterprise approach had potential to fund activities of the mother organizations involved. Few other projects of this nature had been attempted in the region, and none on this scale, so the WWP constituted an important pilot project. However, this also meant there was little information to draw on to help in its planning and design and during implementation. UNDP, the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand (PDA \u2013 the implementing agency of the WWP) and the people living with HIV groups involved were in a constant process of learning and improvement. Initially the project was implemented with groups of women living with HIV at four sites in three countries, Cambodia, India and China, in collaboration with networks of women/ people living with HIV. PDA was responsible for overall implementation and management of the project, as well as capacity building activities, commencing with an initial training workshop and exposure visits in Thailand in June-July 2006. An additional site, in Assam, India, was added later under an NGO, the NEDAN Foundation. The model implemented in the Assam site differed from other sites in some important ways: it did not involve direct collaboration with a network of women living with HIV; the beneficiaries consisted of women living with HIV together with other vulnerable women, rather than only women living with HIV; and there was no PDA involvement. At each site, the group involved was encouraged to start a sustainable business enterprise, based on market research and development of a business plan. The Phnom Penh group, consisting of members of the Cambodian Community of Women (CCW), affiliated with the Cambodian People Living with HIV/AIDS Network (CPN+), proposed a garment factory, exeCutive summAry 2 the Modern Dress Sewing Factory (MDSF). In Chennai, India, the Positive Women Network (PWN+) developed a plan for Social Light Communications (SLC), a communication design and print production business. In China, Women\u2019s Wing of AIDS Care China (ACC), planned two businesses, the Positive Candle Works, a candle making business based in Kunming, and the Jasmine Online Exchange, an online used goods seller, in Guangzhou. In Kokrajhar, Assam, India, the NEDAN Foundation supported the development of Weaving Destination (WD), a business that produced high quality hand woven textiles. The Chennai group was the first to commence operations, in August 2006, followed by Cambodia and the China groups at the beginning of 2007. Weaving Destination was the last activity to start, commencing in 2008. In regard to monitoring and evaluation of WWP activities, the different sites provided regular reports to PDA, which were supplemented by information from field visits in compilation of six monthly and annual reports submitted by PDA to UNDP. Site reports included business and financial data that could be used to assess the success of the business aspect of the Project. PDA adapted its \u201cBamboo Ladder\u201d monitoring tool for assessment of women\u2019s empowerment. However, there were no clear overall indicators for measurement of the expected outcomes of the project. In particular, the lack of defined indicators for the second and third objectives of WWP, related to empowerment of the women, and improvement in the social environment, meant that the outcomes in these areas proved difficult to assess. Bearing these considerations in mind, the different businesses experienced varying degrees of success.

These two successes are, however, tempered to some degree by the fact that there are now fewer beneficiaries than previously. While MDSF has struggled to break even throughout most of its existence, the high sales that were seen at certain times during the implementation of the project and the annual net profit (despite being small) achieved for 2010 give a glimpse of the good potential of the project, and what could be achieved should MDSF be able to address some of the key challenges that have limited the success of the business. In particular, the management of MDSF needs to be strengthened in order to clearly define roles, responsibilities and accountability of all staff. The marketing component, which is crucial to the success of the enterprise, needs to be managed by skilled and experienced personnel and supported by a clear marketing strategy that exploits potential markets in the private and government sectors. SLC in Chennai has not been highly successful as a business enterprise to continuously generate sufficient profits for its mother organization (Positive Women\u2019s Network - PWN+) despite strong initial successes; however, it has been successful in empowerment of the women involved, and increasing acceptance of women living with HIV in the community. SLC has made an important contribution to the empowerment of women living with HIV, by demonstrating that women living with HIV have the capacity to acquire skills to operate and manage an enterprise working in a highly competitive area of the private sector. The business model identified an area where high profits could be achieved, as seen during the initial two years of implementation. However, subsequent management difficulties, internal conflicts and a subsequent high turnover of personnel weakened the effectiveness of the enterprise to the point that it appeared close to collapse at one point. Financially, the main benefits from SLC\u2019s business model can be expected to come through utilisation of profits into micro-credit activities or supporting activities of its mother organization, PWN+, rather than from direct employment of women living with HIV in the enterprise itself. However, the early efforts in this direction were premature and for this reason unsuccessful, and only served to worsen the management difficulties. It will require considerable effort and commitment on behalf of SLC and PWN+ to turn the situation around. To do so, it is crucial that the management structure of SLC be revised so that the enterprise can function effectively as a business, including recruitment of skilled and 3 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises experienced marketing staff, greater autonomy in financial management, decision-making, and staff recruitment, and clarification of the role and responsibilities of PWN+ in providing support and management of income generated by SLC. WD in Assam has been highly successful in establishing a sustainable business model, as well as empowering the women involved, and increasing the acceptance of vulnerable women including women living with HIV in the community. While differing from the other WWP sites in that it was not focused directly on women living with HIV, WD has, to date, been the most successful social enterprise under WWP. As a business enterprise, WD established itself quickly and was able to show impressive profits continuously. For more than 2.5 years since its inception, WD has made net profits for every single month and year. The business model selected built on existing skills and expertise of both the beneficiary group, as well as the NGO partner, taking a traditional craft and, through improvement in quality and design, adapting the products to markets at the local, national and international level. Over two years of operations of the business, WD has implemented an effective business model that has made money and has shown benefits for both the women involved and the communities they live in. The reasons why WD has worked so well are the combination of building on an existing skill, good timing, the commitment of the women and other key stakeholders, strong support from an experienced local NGO and the linkage of the social enterprise with effective community development activities. The main challenges faced by WD include the need to adjust the management structure to meet the demands of development and expansion of the scope of the enterprise, with more independence in its management, and recruitment of a marketing officer. This will allow NEDAN to continue its focus on social and community development activities, and reduce time spent on marketing and other activities related to the business side of the project.

While the business opportunities identified were creative and potentially lucrative, the enterprise experienced management difficulties and personal conflicts, which threatened the effective operation of the positive women\u2019s wing of the host organization, leading to closure of the project. Assessment of the second and third objectives of WWP relies largely on qualitative information. While measurement of stigma and discrimination (including self-stigma) has now become a distinct component of M&E in a number of Asian countries, the tools on which this is based only evolved after the initiation of this project. Nevertheless, in all sites, a key achievement of the project has been the empowerment of the women living with HIV involved, increasing their confidence and self-esteem and the recognition by themselves and their communities that they can make an important contribution to their families and society. While hard to measure in concrete terms, information gathered from interviews indicates that the project has also helped increase the acceptance of women living with HIV by their communities, through showing the important contribution that they can make to improve their own well-being, as well as benefit society in general. This has resulted in reduction of stigma and discrimination, an increased feeling of well-being, and the opening of more opportunities for women with improved skills acquired under WWP to re-enter the workforce through employment in other enterprises with higher pay or through self- employment. However, overall the number of women living with HIV who have benefited directly from WWP in terms of employment is low, being around one hundred twenty in total, if we do not count the number of people indirectly benefited such as family members of the women participating in WWP. Some notable successes of the WWP include the creation of a safe and supportive work environment, where workers\u2019 rights are prioritized, and there is sufficient flexibility in working time to allow employees time off for medical appointments, replenishment of HIV medicines, and regular breaks. This recognition of workers\u2019 rights, together with an emphasis on \u201cnatural products\u201d, is also an advantage in terms of accessing certain markets, 4 especially the international tourist market, and the export market to Europe, Japan and the USA. At the same time, however, compliance with Fair Trade requirements means an increased challenge in competing with other local businesses, which did not follow these guidelines. The results of WWP show clearly that successful development and implementation of a business model requires constant support from a strong local NGO with experience in small- scale social enterprise and community development. Initiation of additional activities, such as recycling of the profits of the enterprise, should be approached carefully, ensuring first that the business enterprise is well-established and the NGO or CBO has the capacity to support these activities. Human resource capacity has been a major challenge at all sites. On the whole, in development of the business plans the capacity of the partner to manage the activity tended to be over-estimated, and the availability of women with the level of skills necessary to implement the business plan underestimated. Most people living with HIV organizations are primarily engaged in advocacy and care services and may not have the experience, specific skill sets and organizational structure needed to support small- scale business development programmes. Many women living with HIV have experience in the private sector; however, relatively few have a high education background and the level of specialized skills in design, marketing, finance and marketing necessary to operate a business enterprise by themselves. Training can help address this, but can not really compensate for formal education and experience, and in the case of WWP the effectiveness was compromised by high staff turnover. The most successful site, WD, was the only one that was established in a rural area, built on existing skills of women, and where a local NGO with a strong community development focus and experience in small social enterprises provided support. Development of well-defined management structures and a clear organizational structure, with well-defined staff job descriptions, organograms and accountability, was a further factor that contributed to the success of WD. Where these were lacking, or not implemented, as in Chennai and Cambodia, serious difficulties arose in management. At the same time, for the businesses to be successful, a broader and more pro-active approach to marketing needs to be adopted, involving approaches to the business sector and government agencies, rather than a heavy reliance on the UN and INGO sector as the main point of access to markets. Also, in the long term, changes in management structures are needed to ensure greater autonomy in financial arrangements and human resources,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "825fd126-dd1c-486f-9f5f-029de1d4d936": {"__data__": {"id_": "825fd126-dd1c-486f-9f5f-029de1d4d936", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81e54b870d30820a30e48c85280e362e2b89e05271d3d3cc8beef896bd05050b"}}, "hash": "81e54b870d30820a30e48c85280e362e2b89e05271d3d3cc8beef896bd05050b", "text": "with a view to eventual separation of the business activities from those of the NGO or CBO when ready. Under its responsibilities for management of the implementation of WWP in Cambodia, India and China, PDA recognized the need for provision of technical assistance to strengthen management systems. PDA provided technical assistance in the form of periodical monitoring and onsite training visits, regular communication by phone, email and other means, as well as coordination of training workshops and other input from experts in various areas. Despite these rigorous efforts and continuous support, management problems still occurred. The likely reasons for this are several, including the challenge of close continuity in follow-up resulting from PDA\u2019s remote base in Bangkok, management problems that were beyond the scope, and capacity, of the WWP project to solve as they reflected wider problems in the key partner organizations, and differences in attitude, commitment and motivation among the individual women involved. In terms of the overall design of the WWP, implementation would have benefited considerably had a longer time frame been possible and planned from the outset, rather than approval of a series of extensions. While almost all development projects operate on annual or, at most, biannual, funding cycles, a long-term plan incorporating a longer time frame of five, or at least three, years with annual approval subject to availability of funds, would have helped increase the sense of security and commitment among partners, and enabled better planning for learning and capacity building activities within the project. This might have helped in development of a system for sourcing of materials and services 5 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises from within the project and in better organization of the knowledge management process in the closing phase of the project, helping the networks of women living with HIV involved assess and increase their ownership of the project outcomes, and summarize the key lessons for sharing more widely. Again, however, given the reality of the funding cycle, this was a timing factor beyond the control of the Project. The WWP reaffirms several key lessons. The first of these is that, given the opportunity and with technical and financial support, women living with HIV can identify viable business opportunities, and design and implement business models to exploit them. However, in all but one site, the WWP has not succeeded in creating a sustainable social enterprise model, and the one successful site differs from the others in several important ways. Based on this assessment, it appears that in order for the social enterprises developed by women living with HIV and other vulnerable women to be sustainable, strong and on-going local technical support is needed from people or organizations with experience in social enterprise and community development. A further lesson is that having an understanding of the situation faced by people living with HIV and expertise in areas such as advocacy, as exemplified by people living with HIV networks, does not necessarily translate into capacity to provide strong support for social enterprises run by women living with HIV. By the time UNDP funding comes to a close by end of 2011, the WWP initiative will have lasted a total of six years. In view of the large number of women living with HIV in the region, WWP, as one of the few initiatives to address their socio-economic situation in a systematic way, remains important. It is recommended that a number of concrete steps be taken to move forward in order to consolidate achievements and ensure that the lessons are shared. These include: 1. Strengthen the management structure and marketing capacity of the social enterprises; 2. Explore the possibility of on-going technical and financial support for the social enterprises through local NGOs with strong capacity and experience in social enterprise and community development; 3. The lessons-learned from the WWP should be effectively used and widely disseminated to inform future socio-economic empowerment initiatives within and beyond Asia. 6 This report summarizes an assessment made of the Women and Wealth Project (WWP), an activity supported by United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre (UNDP APRC) from 2006-2011. Based on the main objectives of the WWP, the key overall question addressed in this assessment is: How effective has the Women and Wealth Project been in terms of achieving (i) the economic empowerment of women living with HIV; (ii) the personal and social empowerment of women living with HIV; and (iii) the improvement of the social and community environment for people living with HIV?

These were: (i) what are the main strengths and weaknesses of the project and each social enterprise? (ii) what have been the most important challenges faced? (iii) what have been the key lessons from implementation in each site? (iv) what are the prospects for sustainability of the WWP initiative after the cessation of UNDP/PDA support at the end of 2011? and (v) what broad recommendations can be made in terms of future support for socio-economic empowerment initiatives with women living with HIV? This report addresses the first four of these questions, with the last being considered in a separate report1 that compares the WWP to other similar initiatives in the region. Owing to the nature of the WWP objectives, the methodology used in assessment is based largely on the use of qualitative research methods. Where available, quantitative data is used. However, as the project design did not place great emphasis on quantitative indicators, such data is limited mainly to the business aspects of the project. There were three main sources of data for the assessment, consisting of documentary information, interviews with stakeholders and observations made in the course of site visits by a consultant. Documentary information included reports prepared by the different sites, PDA and UNDP and other project documents, news articles and media reports, video documentaries, and a literature review. Interviews were undertaken with beneficiaries, consultants, business partners, and other stakeholders at the country and regional level, in Bangkok and during visits made to each of the project sites. Site visits were conducted during the period 18 April \u2013 May 2011. These consisted of a visit to Modern Dress Sewing Factory, Phnom Penh, (18-23 April); Weaving Destination, Assam, (24-28 April); and Social Light Communication, Chennai, (28 April \u2013 1 May). A list of people met in each location, including Bangkok, is included in the Annex. A focus group discussion was held with MDSF staff in Phnom Penh and three focus group discussions, two with WD beneficiaries and staff and one with NEDAN staff, in Assam. Personal observations were also recorded by the consultant in the course of a visit made to each of the project sites. Interview guides were developed, consisting of a number of common questions, as well 1 See \u201cA Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region,\u201d UNDP APRC, 2011. introduCtion 1 7 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises as specific questions for each of the respondent groups. Questions included both closed and open-ended questions to provide respondents with an opportunity to give additional information. Because of language constraints, interviews were conducted in English, with the consultant relying on staff with English skills to translate questions and responses. Data collected during the course of site visits, together with that gathered from the documentary sources, was analysed according to each of the assessment questions described above. The results were summarized for each site, with a synthesis and conclusions made based on a comparison between the various sites, identifying points of communality and differences among them. The findings are presented in this report. Wherever possible, during data collection and analysis, triangulation was used to confirm information and validate data. Nevertheless, despite the efforts to employ a rigorous methodological approach, there remains a possibility that a degree of bias exists in some of the information and conclusions, resulting from the reliance on translation, the short duration of site visits, and factors such as the consultant\u2019s age, gender and ethnicity (older, male Caucasian). While it can be argued that these same factors could also serve to increase the objectivity of the assessment, they should be borne in mind when considering the findings, conclusions and recommendations presented in this report. 8 Of the estimated 4.9 million people living with HIV in Asia, over 35 percent (around 1.7 million) are women.2 However, although they bear a disproportionate share of the impact of the HIV epidemic, the impact of HIV on women in Asia has for the most part been overlooked and under-estimated. Despite the progress that has been made regarding access to care and treatment, women living with HIV in the Asian region still face challenges in regard to access to ART and health care and they and their families are subject to stigma and discrimination. Women living with HIV still bear much of the burden of care and support for other family members affected by HIV, and in many countries in the Asian region", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2845c485-5087-4485-9977-f02cca1692b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2845c485-5087-4485-9977-f02cca1692b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c554cf5a96b9813b7c6b71d710ace93a960f5918af138441917f7606dcb3638"}, "3": {"node_id": "53cfef6c-6fcb-4358-8dab-25efd3a5b39c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d1abcd8cda4602468e3bef23732d582b5c2567036f1318235fc59228d3c5200"}}, "hash": "d328c48d6e2063bcb1a04756c46052f8160f0b0c25f98fda1e4b6716d431958e", "text": "they also have to confront gender inequality and poverty, which make them more vulnerable to the impact of HIV. Loss of livelihood has been identified as one of the most important factors contributing to the vulnerability of women and their families affected by HIV in the Asian region.3 Furthermore, a study conducted by the women\u2019s working group of the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV/ADS (APN+), which surveyed a total of 1,306 women living with HIV from 6 countries in Asia, found that the lack of income was one of the major barriers for the women to access HIV services.4 In response to the need to promote livelihood opportunities for women living with HIV, in early 2006, the UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre, later with financial support from the Government of Japan, initiated the Women and Wealth Project (WWP). The project was designed to promote the socio-economic empowerment of women living with HIV, which UNDP viewed as the next phase of their continuous support to people living with HIV, following implementation of the Asia Pacific Regional Initiative on the Empowerment of People Living with HIV from 2003-2005. This Initiative focused on establishment and organizational development of people living with HIV networks, leadership, advocacy and care and support skills.56 Key achievements of the Initiative included emergence and growth of people living with HIV groups and leaders, development of platforms for mutual support at the regional level, services provided to people living with HIV and their families where there was none, collective regional advocacy to address their rights, needs, and issues, and growing public recognition that people living with HIV groups constitute a critical and indispensable part of collective responses against the epidemic. Through their support and strong involvement in the Initiative, UNDP came to recognize the urgent need for economic empowerment among HIV-positive women, which provided the rationale to move ahead into the next phase of support to positive people with a greater focus. An important principle guiding UNDP\u2019s approach was that, in accordance with the principle of GIPA (Greater Involvement of People Living with HIV), women living with HIV should be provided with as much \u201cspace\u201d as possible, to develop sustainable livelihood 2 Global Report: UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic 2010, UNAIDS, 2010. 3 ICW Vision Paper 3: HIV Positive Women, Poverty and Gender Inequality, The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (ICW), 2004. 4 A long walk- Challenges to women\u2019s access to HIV services in Asia, APN+, 2009 5 From Involvement to Empowerment: People Living with HIV/AIDS in Asia Pacific, UNDP 2004. 6 Working in Partnership with Networks of people Living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific: A Guidance Note for Development Practitioners, UNDP/APN+, 2006. bACkground 2 Fig. 1: Trainees at Weaving Destination 9 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises activities by themselves as part of a genuine empowerment process.7 Thus, as originally conceived by UNDP, the WWP was intended to address several critical issues related to the well-being of women living with HIV. These included provision of a sustainable livelihood for women and their families, to relieve the immediate issue of lack of income and, in recognition of the need to re-build women\u2019s self-confidence and self- esteem, individual and collective empowerment. As well as addressing these core issues, UNDP also identified the successful implementation of a social enterprise approach as having the additional potential to fund activities of the mother organization. Social enterprises are one among a range of livelihood models that have been implemented to address poverty and the needs of vulnerable populations in the Asian region. The different approaches are compared in more detail in a complementary report.8 In brief, however, group-based social business models like WWP have several advantages for people living with HIV. One of the most important of these is \u201ccollective security\u201d in which staff can cover each other when someone is sick or has to take leave for regular health check-ups or collecting HIV medicines, without loss of salary. In individual- based micro-credit initiatives, there is no such security and there is no income for days when staff are absent from work.

As will be seen, this was experienced with the SLC and MDSF projects implemented under WWP. Such risk is minimal in the individualized micro-credit based initiatives. The WWP has been implemented by the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand, drawing on PDA\u2019s expertise and experience in the field of economic empowerment in the context of HIV. In addition to provision of technical support and project implementation, an objective of this partnership with PDA was to facilitate South- South learning, in which PDA\u2019s extensive HIV and community development experience in Thailand could be transferred to assist other countries in Asia. Working with networks of people living with HIV in Cambodia, China and India, the WWP aimed to create sustainability and financial resources among people living with HIV groups through a social enterprise scheme. Through the project, each of the groups involved was encouraged to start a business that would be sustainable. The activities would increase confidence among the women involved, reduce stigma and discrimination within their communities, and provide financial and other support for women living with HIV and their families. The people living with HIV networks involved were: - AIDS Care China, Women\u2019s Wing in China - Positive Women\u2019s Network in India - Cambodian People Living with HIV Network, Women\u2019s Sector, in Cambodia The reason for selection of networks of people living with HIV in the three countries, China, Cambodia and India, was based on a number of considerations. At the time UNDP conceived the project in early 2005, activities within the positive community focusing on positive women were very limited across Asia, not to mention development of an organized effort or institution within positive networks. Under these circumstances, the three groups were selected, in consultation with a GIPA advisor living with HIV on the UNDP team and the Asia 7 Mr. Kazuyuki Uji, UNDP, personal communication, 9 May 2011. 8 See \u201cA Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia\u201d, UNDP, 2011. 10 Pacific Network of People Living with HIV. Selection was based on the following criteria: 1. Existence of a positive women\u2019s organization (at that time PWN+ was the only such entity in Asia) or the presence of a women\u2019s wing within a positive people\u2019s network; 2. Attainment of a certain level of capacity or strong potential to manage a complex project within the women\u2019s group or the umbrella positive people\u2019s network; 3. Strong willingness and determination to pursue socio-economic empowerment of women living with HIV. In 2008, an additional project implementation site and partner were added, located in Bodoland Territorial Council, Assam, India, implemented through a local NGO, the NEDAN Foundation. The partnership with NEDAN differed from the original structure of WWP in some important ways, in that NEDAN is an NGO, not a people living with HIV organization, and the NEDAN Foundation was funded and supported directly by UNDP India and UNDP APRC, rather than through the MOU with PDA as in the case of the other groups. It is important to note that the WWP was conceived as a pilot project. Given the fact that few other projects of this nature had been attempted in the region, and none on this scale, there was little information to draw on to help in its planning and design. This was also the case during implementation; because WWP was a pilot project, with no previous experience, UNDP, PDA and the people living with HIV groups involved were in a constant process of learning and improvement. objectives The overall objective of the Women and Wealth Project was to pursue the socio-economic empowerment of women living with and affected by HIV through development of small- scale social enterprises. The project had the following objectives: 1. To provide women living with HIV an opportunity to lead a life with hope, economic security and dignity through the development and operation of small-scale social enterprises; 2. To reduce stigma and discrimination against women living with and affected by HIV through business interactions and raising their status and public perceptions as important income earners and social contributors; and 3. To increase public awareness and understanding about HIV, leading to a greater acceptance of people living with HIV. 9 intended beneficiaries At its inception, the project was implemented with groups of women living with HIV in Cambodia, India and China, with the main beneficiaries consisting of: \u2022\ufffd Women living with and affected by HIV, their families and their community; \u2022\ufffd Vulnerable girls and women (in the case of Weaving Destination); \u2022\ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd44e0ae-300d-4d78-b216-24aea3101c60": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd44e0ae-300d-4d78-b216-24aea3101c60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0218cac346c490d6ba3a243b822331805c49f4b8cbca9b51e93c03b359ff6f45"}}, "hash": "0218cac346c490d6ba3a243b822331805c49f4b8cbca9b51e93c03b359ff6f45", "text": "Stakeholders, including people living with HIV networks and other community based organizations and NGOs working on HIV and related issues. time frame As this project was conceived as a pilot project, the appropriate project duration was not clear.

Later, when it was realized that the project needed a longer duration than that of the original MOU, the WWP was extended on two occasions: a two-year extension of support for the WWP, from June 2008 to June 2010, with a further extension of one and a half years, from July 2010 until December 2011. Some of these extensions are attributable to additional funding availability, particularly from the Government of Japan. development of business models and initial training Each group was given US$40,000 to start a business with the aim of empowerment, profitability and sustainability, and given guidance and support from the collaborative efforts of PDA, UNDP APRC, UNDP country offices (COs), and local consultants in each country. Implementation of the project was carried out over 4 phases: 1. Training including feasibility study; 2. Final business plan development; 3. Launch of business; 4. Redistribution of profits in the form of micro-credit. The first task undertaken by each of the people living with HIV networks/groups during the inception phase was to conduct a feasibility study. This was followed by drafting of a business plan, developed in conjunction with participation in a training workshop organized by PDA in Bangkok. Feedback was given on each Business Plan through comments and suggestions by both PDA and UNDP. The deadline for the finalization of the Business Plans was mid-October 2006, with the expectation that each business would be operational by November 2006. Local consultants were hired in each country, through PDA, to assist the women\u2019s groups develop feasible business models, and to help the groups launch their business ventures. At each site, women were selected from the positive people\u2019s network groups to form a working group, together with the consultant, for implementation of the Business Plan. Feasibility studies were conducted in each participating country by the consultants in close collaboration with the people living with HIV groups, in order to identify potential business opportunities. The studies were carried out based on guidelines provided by PDA.10 The study consisted of two parts: the first consisted of a self-assessment of the capacity and experience of the group related to income generation, which was answered by the three members of the organization who attended the training in Bangkok. Issues considered included: the organization\u2019s history, structure, membership, financial resources, legal status; existing skills of members; previous business experience and reasons for success or failure; and whether the group had any ideas for potential business ventures. The second part of the study was intended to identify potential areas of income generating activities or small businesses for the economic empowerment of people living with HIV, and was undertaken by the local consultant in close coordination with the group. Each group was asked to: \u2022\ufffd Look at existing skills of the group that can be enhanced or further developed to be a source of income-generation; \u2022\ufffd Explore the market demand and assess whether there is a need for these products or services; \u2022\ufffd As skills can be learned through training, after first identifying the market demand and the skills needed to meet it, determine whether the necessary skills exist, and if not, if these can be acquired by training. 10 \u201cFeasibility Study \u2013 Market research\u201d, unpublished draft guidance document for WWP, PDA 2006. 12 In identifying a new potential income-generation or business activity for the group, the guideline suggested that the following issues be considered: \u2022\ufffd The ability of the group to produce the product or provide the service or the potential to do so with skills training; \u2022\ufffd Potential markets or market demand for the goods and services, looking first at the local market, then the city market and last at the export market; \u2022\ufffd What raw materials are needed, and whether these are readily available, and at a price that makes it cost-effective to purchase them; \u2022\ufffd Whether there are competitors and, if so, their capacity, market share, and whether the group has a competitive advantage over them; \u2022\ufffd Potential marketing channels, and the possible marketing strategy that will", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0855463-3f32-4068-839e-8ab2103ee5fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0855463-3f32-4068-839e-8ab2103ee5fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "221ad95eb1e026e1eae05fa676869f27c85d5a20c4c72eef6f71eb02cf95bbca"}}, "hash": "221ad95eb1e026e1eae05fa676869f27c85d5a20c4c72eef6f71eb02cf95bbca", "text": "confer a unique selling advantage for the group\u2019s products or services over the competitors; \u2022\ufffd The financial situation related to the proposed venture.

The initial training course organised in Bangkok by PDA was entitled \u201cSocio-economic Empowerment of People Living with HIV\u201d, and aimed to provide participants with the understanding and skills necessary to start a business and keep it operating on a long- term basis. Participants attending the training course included three women from the three network groups in China, India and Cambodia. In addition, three selected local consultants from the respective countries attended, as well as a UNDP APRC representative. During the first week of the training course representatives from UNDP China and Cambodia also joined the classroom sessions. Content of the course consisted of an overview of PDA\u2019s activities in the area of socio- economic empowerment of people living with HIV, including the Thai Business Initiative in Rural Development (TBIRD) concept and Positive Partnerships Programme, presentations on business sector involvement in HIV activities, planning and management for small enterprises, including financial management, business plan development, implementation and management. The course included site visits to observe small business activities supported by the Thai Red Cross in Bangkok, and PDA in Buriram, a rural province in Thailand\u2019s northeast region. The training course also allocated time for participants from each country to finalize their business plans. At the beginning of the workshop, the three country groups, represented by the local consultants, presented the output of their feasibility studies. During the course the groups drafted business plans that were presented for comment by all participants at the end of the second week. Subsequent to the training course, working groups continued development of their business plans including budgets for initial capital investments and operation costs. Local consultants assisted the working groups in further researching selected business ideas and worked with PDA and UNDP to strengthen and finalize their business plans. Each group had to submit a business plan to PDA for comments and suggestions. Once business plans were considered viable and approved by PDA, the working groups received funds to launch the business ventures. 13 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises The businesses chosen by each of the country groups were: 1. Cambodia Phnom Penh: Modern Dress Sewing Factory, a garment factory; 2. India Chennai: Social Light Communications, a communication design and print production business; 3. China Kunming: Positive Candle Works, a candle making business; Guangzhou: Jasmine Online Exchange, an online used goods seller. The group in India was the first to commence operations, in August 2006, followed by Cambodia and the China groups at the beginning of 2007. technical support Local consultants were recruited by PDA in order to assist each group with identification of business opportunities, and development and implementation of the business plan. Their specific roles and responsibilities were detailed in a job description. Suitable candidates were identified through advertising and networking in the respective countries. In general, qualifications consisted of previous experience, skills and networks related to business management, experience or familiarity with NGOs and awareness of issues related to HIV and its impact on women and their families. In order to help measure the impact of activities in the three main areas of the project, income generation, empowerment and social acceptance, at both the personal and community level, PDA developed the Bamboo Ladder Survey (BLS) approach, a self- assessment tool. Using the BLS, beneficiaries fill out diagrams corresponding to five key areas relating to their well-being. These consist of: physical health; mental health; social condition; economic condition; and quality of life. When used regularly, the BLS provides a useful means of measuring changes that have occurred in people\u2019s lives and their future aspirations. In addition to monitoring implementation progress, the BLS provides a useful means of improving performance, through provision of on-going feedback. On-going technical support to the groups and consultants was provided by PDA staff, in particular the Director of the Community Health Bureau and Planning Officers.

These included the international fashion designer Ms. Bibi Russell, and Mr. Seimi Wangsai, a skilled apparel designer and the owner of Tragoon, a high-end fair trade store in Yokohama Japan, whose costs were covered by UNDP APRC. Additional technical support for WWP activities has been obtained from the Singapore International Foundation (SIF), a non-profit organization based in Singapore, which completely funded its support in the form of technical trainers, onsite training and donation of equipment to the WWP, and WEINC (Women Empowered through International Cooperation), a group of volunteer Japanese women who came together to take action to support women living with HIV and advocate for HIV prevention. Catalyst Management Services (CMS), a Bangalore, India-based consulting and research organization also provided technical support. Additional in-country technical support was obtained from a range of other sources, including international volunteers, local NGOs and community-based organizations. Aside from the initial training workshop in Bangkok, opportunities for group members and consultants from the different sites to meet were provided by the International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP), held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2007, and in Bali, Indonesia, in 2009. A launch event for the WWP and the WE brand was held at the Colombo ICAAP in August 2007, in the form of a press conference (Figure 2). WWP also advertised the WE brand at an exhibition booth at the conference (Figure 3). These activities helped promote the project, and draw international attention to the issue of the socio-economic 14 impact of HIV on women and the steps that can be taken to address the situation through the economic empowerment of women. Representatives from each WWP group, their local consultants, and PDA staff participated in the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Bali in August 2009. The project presented an exhibition booth about WWP that provided an excellent opportunity for the groups to display and successfully sell their products, as well as to explain the WWP rationale and experience to hundreds of Congress attendees. WWP representatives used this platform to describe the impact of WWP on their personal well-being and family life. PDA staff networked with individuals and organizations from throughout the Asia- Pacific region interested in launching similar livelihood initiatives in their communities. In addition, the ICAAP provided other opportunities for learning and capacity building. All representatives were invited to attend a pre-Congress event (called the Southeast Asia Court of Women on HIV and Human Trafficking) that explored the connections between women\u2019s experiences of human trafficking and HIV. Also, PDA staff organized a one-day workshop for WWP participants to share their accomplishments, strengths, and weaknesses, to discuss strategies for joint WWP promotion, and to outline six-month action plans for each business group. The WWP provided an important opportunity for public advocacy and has actively pursued public exposures in an attempt to portray a positive image of women living with HIV for stigma reduction, to make known their challenges and empowerment experiences, and to provide the women with self-confidence, motivations and an opportunity to act as a role model for other positive and vulnerable women. In the course of the project, several important channels were used for promotion and marketing of the WWP, its products and services provided, as well as increasing public awareness of the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and role of WWP in addressing this situation through their empowerment.

An estimated 52 percent, or about 30,100, of them were women.14 Cambodia\u2019s epidemic has been attributed primarily to heterosexual transmission among high-risk groups, particularly female sex workers, their clients, and the other sex partners of clients. Significant progress has been made in regard to increasing access to treatment, care and support services, with the number of people living with advanced HIV infection on ART increasing by 40 percent from 2007 to 2009. Cambodia now has near universal ART coverage, with over 90 percent of people living with HIV in need of treatment reporting they are on ART.15 Growing numbers of orphans and vulnerable children are being reached by essential care and support services.16 In Cambodia, the HIV epidemic is closely linked with poverty and loss of livelihood. A recent large-scale survey study by the UN17 on the socio-economic impact of HIV on households indicated that households with members living with HIV were 23 percent more likely to be poor, with children from the poorest households 62 percent less likely to attend school than children in the wealthiest households. Heads of HIV-affected households were more likely to be young, female, and widowed, and HIV-affected households owned significantly less of every asset surveyed than non-affected households. Twenty-seven percent of people living with HIV reported they had stopped earning income after their diagnosis, and for those who remained employed, the average income was less than half of what it had been before their diagnosis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d393b43-6df1-4175-89ca-11eb123aeb3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d393b43-6df1-4175-89ca-11eb123aeb3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a3eb71073fe11ad3bcdc7b1fe2ff9ccd7289f35eff2d8b5c3fb4eeecc750692"}, "2": {"node_id": "d49e4791-4dc4-4d32-9250-1f96fa962c4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74b46a6e1b2d2e356e7ce9e759f0adad6ab677a10ee392cbf6fc247c86b8ed88"}}, "hash": "90cd71522a064a3a85bd64e6b4b50cd113d49ea20364654373e83d356e64b84b", "text": "In another recent survey on stigma and HIV, 51 percent of people living with HIV reported having lost their jobs or income in the last 12 months, due mainly to their HIV status or poor health.

The interconnectedness of the HIV epidemic and overall socio-economic development issues is recognized in the third goal of the NSP, \u201cTo alleviate the socio- economic and human impact of AIDS on the individual, community and society\u201d, where Objectives 2 and 3 under Strategy 3 are \u201cto improve the social and economic status of people living with HIV and their families, especially the most vulnerable\u201d and \u201cstrengthen the capacity and participation of people living with HIV in social and development activities and their meaningful involvement in impact mitigation interventions and decision making processes.\u201d However, the NSP gives few details of activities other than to \u201cadvocate for and expand evidence-informed sustainable livelihood and income generation interventions for people living with HIV and their families.\u201d22 Cambodia has seen considerable efforts to address poverty and socio-economic inequality, including a number of initiatives that focus on the empowerment of women. These include the Creative Industry Programme (a joint programme supported by UNDP in cooperation with ILO and UNESCO), the ILO-supported Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Development and Gender Equality (WEDGE) project as well as initiatives supported by GIZ Cambodia, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Women\u2019s Development Centre in Kampong Speu, the UNDP Partnership for Gender Equity Project, and NGOs such as Hagar. While their income generation programmes benefit women in general, and thus almost certainly include a number of women living with HIV, none of them specifically target women living with HIV. There are some programmes that address the issue of livelihood and income generation among people living with HIV such as the activities implemented by Khmer HIV/AIDS NGO Alliance (KHANA), Cambodia\u2019s key NGO working on HIV, with USAID and EC support. The focus of this programme is mainly on people living with HIV in rural communities, and the activities have not had a specific focus on women.23 For these reasons the WWP has addressed an important need. The local partner for implementation of the WWP is the Cambodian Community of Women Living with HIV under the Cambodian People Living with HIV/AIDS Network. CPN+ is a national network of groups and organizations of people living with HIV, founded in July 2001. Currently CPN+ has over 38,000 members countrywide with 643 active support groups. CPN+ has a mandate to coordinate and contribute to national and international responses to HIV and AIDS in Cambodia.24 CCW, formerly known as the Positive Women\u2019s Sector, has been part of CPN+ since 2004 and currently represents HIV positive women in twelve provinces and sixteen self-help groups in Phnom Penh. 19 The Socioeconomic Impact of HIV at the Household Level in Cambodia, National AIDS Authority, 2011. 20 People Living with HIV Stigma Index Cambodia 2010: Final Report, Cambodian People Living with HIV Network (CPN+)/UNAIDS February 2011. 21 Cambodia Most at Risk Young People Survey 2010, Ministry of Youth, Education and Sports, 2010. 22 Kingdom of Cambodia National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS 2011-1015, National AIDS Authority, 2010. 23 KHANA Livelihoods Program, presentation by Dr.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46bf9f47-8f8c-4144-803a-7cc5ce91b043": {"__data__": {"id_": "46bf9f47-8f8c-4144-803a-7cc5ce91b043", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8d3a79489a86bb63598daf656765124f558d0e6c17d1f9e9648bda0b5371aa5"}, "2": {"node_id": "12fa85e8-1a5f-44cf-8b47-de4788e5dfa3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1737308e3c77c334ca31a496570f8c6981193d57dd1be164929d1e2748711f07"}}, "hash": "ac4a71dcc0ed71dcfcf2cba3577dbdd1f3cda567394198e68dd328686cfaec2a", "text": "23 KHANA Livelihoods Program, presentation by Dr. Oum Sopheap, Executive Director, KHANA, at High-level Technical Consultation on HIV-sensitive Social Protection for Impact Mitigation in Asia and the Pacific, Siem Reap, Cambodia, 27-29 April 2011. 24 http://www.cpnplus.org/ 18 3.1.2 description of activities and results The business plan developed by the Cambodian group, submitted and approved by PDA in early August 2006, was for a garment production business called Modern Dress Sewing Factory business.

The Modern Dress Sewing Factory started operations in January 2007. The initial capital investment covering the setup, including equipment, premises and other basic costs was US$8,700. The factory was housed in rented premises, with equipment consisting of 22 sewing machines, as envisaged under the original plan. This was expanded to a total of 32 machines, including those for sewing, cutting and button holes. Currently (as of April 2011) there are 28 machines (Figure 8). Given that the machines were originally purchased second-hand to save cost, have been subjected to heavy use since they went into service, and maintenance has not been regular, they are increasingly in need of repair and a number of them may be nearing the end of their working life. This affects not only the quality of the product but increases production time and also means that there will soon be a need to buy replacements, increasing overhead costs. As originally envisaged, the focus of MDSF\u2019s marketing strategy focused on the international market, local and international NGOs, and the tourist market in Cambodia. The competitive advantage of products was their high quality, reasonable price, and the marketing system that would make use of local and international NGO networks for promotion and distribution. In fact, local and international NGOs seem to have been the main clients, together with gift shops run by NGOs, such as Friends, Colours of Cambodia and Rajana. In addition to these outlets, lower quality products such as t-shirts and other apparel items made from donated materials have been sold on local markets. Products of MDSF have been successfully marketed in various countries, including Canada, Japan, UK, USA, Thailand and Sri Lanka, which indicates that the quality of their products meets international standards. The MDSF team designs and produces their own goods for sale directly to consumers and conference organizers. Products have consisted of conference bags, WE brand products comprising silk conference bags, silk wine bags, and silk wallets, tote bags, sarong bags, passport covers, and folders (Figure 9). These include the \u201cBibi for WE\u201d line designed by Ms Bibi Russell during her visit in August 2008 (Figure 10). In addition to these items the group originally aimed to upgrade manufacturing skills to produce well-made women\u2019s garments, but this does not seem to have eventuated and conference bags have been one of the mainstays of the business. However, the market for conference bags is very narrow, with limited demand, and is highly competitive, so if the business is to grow there is a need to diversify and try to promote some of the other products that MDSF can produce and find reliable lines of production. 25 http://www.ilo.org/global/standards/information-resources-and-publications/free-trade-agreements-and- labour-rights/lang--en/index.htm Fig. 8: inside the mDsF factory 19 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises Office and factory space has been a challenge throughout the term of the project. This seems to have been mainly due to the difficulty of finding premises that are suitable in terms of providing sufficient well-ventilated space which is readily accessible to the workers, at a cost that is affordable. Rental costs are quite high in Phnom Penh, and along with salaries, rent has been one of the main overhead costs, affecting opportunity of MDSF to break even. After several changes in location, MDSF is currently sharing premises with CCW, at a low rent of US$50 per month that includes utilities and internet connection. However, available space is limited, and barely accommodates the current staff of 8 women, limiting expansion and showroom space. For this reason, as noted by several informants, the current arrangement must really be seen as a temporary solution. staffing It is important to note that MDSF did not begin as an initiative developed by the positive women themselves.

The original management structure as proposed in the business plan consisted of a team of 26 employees, supervised by a team leader, with finance, operations and marketing staff, with overall direction from a management team made up of a project coordinator, the local consultant and supporting committee, including project, NGO, private sector and government representatives. On start-up, 28 women were employed, which increased to 30 in 2007. In 2008, the staff numbers began to fall, with the organizational structure dropping to 22 staff positions. These consisted of: five management positions (a General Manager, a Financial Manager, an Administrative Manager, an Operations Manager, and a Marketing Manager); three assistant managers (Administration, Operations, Marketing); three unit chiefs (Design, Maintenance, Sewing Unit); nine sewing and quality control positions; an ironing position; and a cleaning position. By December 2008, the number of women working at MDSF had been reduced to 17 people and then to the current number of 8 (as of April 2011). The reasons given by staff for leaving MDSF are varied. They include leaving MDSF to take up better-paying positions (which they were able to obtain because of the improvement in 26 Interviews, Phnom Penh, 18-22 April, 2011. Fig. 10: bibi russell training mDsF staff on new products Fig. 9: mDsF products on display 20 skills that occurred through employment at MDSF), pregnancy and personality conflicts with other staff. In the business plan developed in the Bangkok workshop, it was estimated that 80% of positive women had the necessary skills to undertake the proposed venture.27 However, while several of the women initially recruited had some sewing experience, they lacked the skills in other areas necessary for the success of the enterprise. Most staff did not have sufficient experience in design and cutting let alone other areas such as quality control, calculation of quantities and time required for production, management of orders, finance, marketing or language skills. Thus, the baseline skills did not meet requirements of the business chosen, which necessitated additional training and support in these areas, and slowed the rate of the development of the business. MDSF paid all workers a fixed monthly salary and small bonuses for overtime, hard work (good attendance), and special skills (e.g. extra responsibilities), somewhat following the ILO labour guidelines in Cambodia. While the salary was relatively generous and the working hours not long, some women still felt that the income was insufficient to meet their living costs, and they found it difficult to save any money.28 This was especially the case for women who have commitments supporting children and other family members, or, in one case, a disabled husband. For this reason several of the women have engaged in additional jobs in the evening after MDSF working hours. Some women also receive additional support through projects run by WFP, Licadho and other organizations, which provide them with rice, sugar and other essentials that enable them to survive. As can be seen from the results of a Bamboo Ladder Survey, which measures satisfaction with the income level and other benefits derived from working with MDSF, while all measured indicators showed an upward trend, the economic component has scored lower than others (Figure 11).29 This is reflected in comments from some of the current workers, with previous experience working in commercial garment factories, who mentioned that the salary is not as good as working in the private sector. Some members of the group also have to invest additional time and money in order to travel a long way from their homes in other areas of the city. However, all workers agreed that, in comparison with other firms that do not care about 27 WWP Modern Dress Women and Wealth Cambodia Team 6 July 2006. 28 Annual Report January - December 2008, Women and Wealth Project, PDA, 2008; interviews, Phnom Penh, 18-22 April, 2011. 29 Annual Report January - December 2009 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf445a71-8194-4857-ade9-dfad9a17770e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf445a71-8194-4857-ade9-dfad9a17770e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47a16df3ba78ca6437eb7309a184ddfd3997c802bfb83fd249990f508ed7a2d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b384782-6464-4a1e-ba47-1734959726a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f8c9dcc0d3214f8cb6eb3d847e8321e9363534f363b32c8d09410a0fb16fefa"}}, "hash": "cb1d857436bca56a34066059689e0f4f4ec94497c6c849767875da17663f71a3", "text": "29 Annual Report January - December 2009 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2009. figure 11: self-assessment of positive women at mdsf (n=15, mean values) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Past Present Future Rating (0=worst / 10=ideal) Self-assessment of positive women at MDSF (n=15, mean values) Physical Mental Social Economic QoL 21 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises employees\u2019 health, they prefer MDSF as it has a better work environment, with longer lunch breaks, more reasonable", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65060ef9-aa91-4483-80e6-77e6b47ca11a": {"__data__": {"id_": "65060ef9-aa91-4483-80e6-77e6b47ca11a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d19447cfaa95397eefa5dd24ebc6dbf20bbb76a4adb8735c583bb05916eaa3f2"}}, "hash": "d19447cfaa95397eefa5dd24ebc6dbf20bbb76a4adb8735c583bb05916eaa3f2", "text": "working hours, and flexibility with regard to time off (paid leave) for health and medical appointments (two days per month). MDSF also maintains the ARV checklist, in which its team leader asks all the staff everyday if they have appropriately taken the medicine to ensure adherence and their good health. Also, at MDSF there is more opportunity for training, as other factories make women specialize on any one area of the production line. They are also able to share their problems (both personal and health related) with one another without fear of stigma and isolation and seek support from each other. For these reasons, they felt that many more women wanted to work at MDSF, although currently the factory is unable to recruit additional workers owing to financial constraints. A strong sense of commitment to MDSF was expressed among the women working with the enterprise.30 Nevertheless, the group has experienced its share of challenges in regard to relationships among workers. This is reflected, at least in part, in the high turnover of workers, as well as in consultants. Staff levels have varied, ranging from 30 women at the beginning of the project in early 2007, falling to around 17 in 2008, and then dropping to the current number of 8 women in April 2011. The retention of consultants has also been a challenge, with a total 6 consultants having worked with MDSF (to March 2011).31 This has meant expenditure of much additional time and effort on training, recruitment and communication over the course of the project by personnel, consultants, PDA and UNDP. A number of reasons were given by informants for this situation, including lack of certainty regarding the future support for the project, moves to better jobs, marriage and pregnancy of the workers, jealousy and personality clashes among the women, differing educational levels, frequent relocation of the office premises, and differences in opinion regarding the management of MDSF. It is difficult to assess which, if any, of these reasons was the most important. Comments from several informants suggest that dissatisfaction with the management of MDSF may have been an important factor. They pointed out that the duties and responsibilities of senior staff were unclear and not properly reflected in Job Descriptions (JDs), when these were available, and the office lacked a clear organogram. There was also no contract for the manager\u2019s job (the manager was selected by the women) and, as a result, there was a lack of clarity regarding the reporting structure and supervision of this position.32 Ultimately, when serious issues were raised regarding transparency, divisions developed within MDSF and a number of staff, including the Marketing Manager and Administrative Manager, resigned.33 Another issue, related to the management challenges outlined above, concerns the relationship with CPN+, which was not clearly defined. According to informants, while CPN+ wanted to supervise MDSF the network did not recognize the group in their organogram and did not involve MDSF in their internal meetings. At the same time, MDSF had no separate board of directors that could provide supervision to the manager and take responsibility for planning and oversight of operations. While this situation has improved considerably following changes within CPN+ and the assumption of a management role by CCW, MDSF still lacks a structure, such as a steering committee or board of directors that will provide strong management following completion of the current UNDP support phase. Additional funding was obtained and PDA spent a lot of time revising the TOR to suit the existing consultant, who did not provide feedback or engage in the process. Based in Bangkok, it is difficult for PDA to monitor the local consultant and the women became dependant on this person who was an experienced negotiator and made all the connections for MDSF. In Cambodia men, are seen as business people, which creates a significant barrier for MDSF, a business run by women. MDSF was remaining viable through the work of the consultant and other connections but the question arose on what would happen when the 30 Annual Report January - December 2008, Women and Wealth Project, PDA, 2008; interviews, Phnom Penh, 18-22 April, 2011. 31 Annual Report January - December 2009 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2009; Annual Report January - December 2010 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Mar. 2011. 32 Interviews, Phnom Penh, 18-22 April, 2011. 33 Ibid. 22 consultants were no longer around.

While the women already had, or could learn, sewing skills, it was more difficult to recruit women with skills in the crucial areas of design, marketing and management. For this reason it was necessary to provide regular on-going support and arrange for special training sessions to be held. Throughout the duration of the project, MDSF has received strong technical support from PDA and a range of other partners. Altogether, to the time of this assessment, PDA has made a total of 16 visits. Five of these were made in the initial phase (2006-2007) of the project, followed by two visits in 2008, five in 2009, three in 2010, and two so far in 2011. Tele-meetings were conducted twice a month and progress reports were made to PDA every month. The PDA Bamboo Ladder Survey, a self-assessment exercise, was conducted annually, usually in November. Participants expressed that this exercise was very beneficial, helping the women to be more aware of their situation and clearer about what they wanted to do with their lives. PDA visits were usually made by a team consisting of the Planning Officer, an international post, together with the Thai Director of PDA\u2019s Community Health Bureau. On a number of occasions, UNDP staff also joined the visits. These visits were regarded as very important by MDSF workers, who greatly appreciated the technical support and guidance given, which they felt was essential to the business. In the final 18 months of the project, the field visits have been of an extended period as it was felt that a longer time was required to work with the staff and address issues. One issue mentioned by MDSF and consultants was the impact of frequent changes in PDA staff responsible for MDSF. While the Thai staff of PDA has remained largely unchanged, the PDA Planning Officer position has seen many changes in personnel since the project commenced, on some occasions twice in the same year (the current PDA Planning Officer is the sixth person to occupy the position since the commencement of the WWP). Informants commented that this contributed to a lack of consistency in communication with PDA, as the different planning officers each had their own approach, priorities and expectations of MDSF. In general, there was a feeling that PDA was strong in regard to theory, with strict emphasis on the implementation of the business model, and meeting deadlines, but lacked sufficient understanding of the capacity of MDSF personnel. MDSF felt that, as a community-based organization, flexibility and concern for the health of members should be a primary concern. On the other hand, a consistent comment from PDA, in both reports and interviews, was what MDSF needed to change their approach from that of an NGO to one with greater business orientation in order to survive as a business entity and continue benefiting the women and their families. Bibi Russell, a former super model, internationally-known fashion designer and former UNESCO goodwill ambassador, conducted training on product design during her visits in 2008 and 2009. As a result, MDSF developed a new line of products called \u2018Bibi for WE.\u2019 While her support and the publicity surrounding her visit to MDSF was useful, staff felt that the training did not really match their skills and the future direction of the business. The Singapore International Foundation has conducted training for MDSF staff from around early 2009. According to MDSF, the team of four Singaporean trainers dispatched by SIF has made visits about once every four months. Their training consisted of management and various technical areas of product manufacturing. In particular, their assistance on sewing and design has been greatly appreciated, as MDSF recognizes this as an area where they lack capacity. SIF has completely funded such training on its own and even donated some equipment to MDSF. SIF assistance is expected to continue even after the completion of the project in December 2011. 23 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises MDSF has also received training from Seimi Wangsai, a fashion designer and an owner of a fair trade company from Japan, who has helped with design and marketing of products, in particular bags designed specifically for the Japanese market. Products made under Wangsai\u2019s instructions were marketed in Japan. He conducted a total of 4 trainings between 2009 and 2010 and his last visit was made in 2010. His next visit was planned for March 2011, however, it has been delayed owing to the Japanese tsunami disaster.

The following year, 2008, saw a total income of over US$31,647, or an average of over US$2,630 per month, which has been the highest annual income over the total five years duration of the project. However, this was still over US$14,000 short of the total expenditure for the year. In the following year the project\u2019s income dropped to an average of just over US$1,300 per month, with costs running at over US$2,260 per month. In fact income was so low during 2009 that PDA provided three emergency fund transfers, totalling around USD $4,000 to enable MDSF to purchase materials, pay salaries and meet other costs.34 In 2010, for the first time, income exceeded expenditure, making the annual net profit of about US$260. In 2011, results to date are not encouraging. The worker\u2019s salaries, including bonuses such as the US$50 per worker paid in March for the Cambodian New Year holiday, together with rent constitute the biggest costs for MDSF.

The cost of these materials, which can amount to two thirds of the sale price of products, reduces the profit margin considerably, making it uneconomical to produce for sale on the local market.

While this is certainly true, there are no clear indicators that enable the degree of change resulting from the project to be assessed. It is somewhat easier to assess the contribution that the project has made at the level of the community based on the workers\u2019 personal feedback regarding instances of discrimination. In fact, some of the women live in the Tuol Sambo community, a resettlement community outside Phnom Penh that became, for a period, a de-facto \u201cAIDS colony\u201d, and have thus had considerable exposure to stigma and discrimination.35 All agreed strongly that the project has brought changes in terms of their acceptance in the community. While there were reports of previous cases of discrimination, for example in relation to attendance of children at school, currently stigma and discrimination do not seem to be a major concern and most of the women appeared unconcerned whether the community were aware or not. Women have been able to apply for jobs outside the project, and they reported that there is increased understanding about what MDSF does and its contribution, resulting in increased respect from others. 3.1.4 main challenges MDSF has faced major challenges related to almost every aspect of the enterprise. The business model chosen is in an area that is already highly competitive, with existing competition that is well-established and well-funded. To compete in this sector, at the same time promoting workers\u2019 rights, has been a significant challenge. MDSF has spent much time exploring ways to reduce overheads, such as the cost of source materials and rental of factory space, and at the same time identify and exploit its comparative advantages in order to cover core costs such as worker\u2019s salaries. The need to exploit MDSF\u2019s comparative advantages has placed much emphasis on the 35 Brill, D., \u201cConcerns grow over Cambodia\u2019s \u2018AIDS Colony\u2019\u201d, The Lancet, 374 (9694), 19 Sept. 2009, p. 966, box 1: mdsf Client snapshot The Rajana Association is a local, non-profit income generation and skill-training project that produces fair trade products, blending traditional Cambodian skills with contemporary designs.

Their advice to MDSF and other social enterprises engaged in similar activities is not to try and produce too many things that may not sell, but to begin by producing a little at a time, in order to identify styles that suit the market, then try producing these for a few months initially to build up a customer base. Groups that base their activities on strong existing skills are more successful. Compliance with Fair Trade and emphasis on the background to the social enterprise, for example through notes and pamphlets accompanying the goods, can also be used to good advantage as an effective marketing technique. 26 way in which the enterprise\u2019s products are marketed. There is much goodwill among the client base, and most seem to be very satisfied with the quality, price and timeliness of completion of orders. This has helped support operations to date. However, in order for MDSF to be really sustainable, it needs to access and expand into local markets, as well as internationally. To date the approach has tended to be passive, waiting for orders to arrive rather than proactively maintaining business relationships and contacting prospective clients. Several informants commented on the current lack of capacity of MDSF in regard to marketing, and commented that it was they who approached MDSF and not the other way around. They felt that MDSF needed to be more active in approaching potential clients and maintaining relationships with existing clients, for example through making regular visits carrying a sample book, or when new catalogues and new products are released. This would help ensure that MDSF is fresh in the minds of supply or procurement officers in large organizations, including the UN system, when supplier lists are drawn up for tenders. To do this MDSF needs a marketing person, with the necessary skills and an outgoing approach, supported by a business plan and marketing strategy that is regularly updated. Marketing needs more than good products, but also a marketing officer who is presentable, has good English language skills, has the necessary sales skills and understands the psychology of customers. Also required is a change from what some informants referred to as an \u201cNGO mentality\u201d to a business-like attitude. Currently the lack of this approach represents a big challenge to the survival of MDSF, much less its growth and expansion. With these considerations in mind, a marketing and communication person has recently been recruited with support from PDA. box 2: mdsf worker snapshot \u201cSopheap\u201d is 53 years old and comes originally from Battambang province. She has lived in Phnom Penh since the year 2000. She was married with 3 children, two daughters, aged 31 and 28, both of whom are married, and a son aged 24, who has just graduated from college. On completion of her secondary school education, Sopheap worked for around 30 years organizing wedding parties and doing make-up for brides and grooms, until she became sick with AIDS and could not do this work anymore. After recovering from her illness she took some training on how to make bed linen. She learned about MDSF through an announcement at the hospital, and applied to join the project in 2007 as one of the founding members. Sopheap lives in Tuol Sambo village, which gained notoriety for a time around 2 years ago as \u201cthe AIDS village\u201d. The situation is now much improved, and Sopheap now owns her own home, which was built through assistance from the charity Caritas, with her main expenses now being food, electricity and support for her son. The Women and Wealth Project has changed her life in several important ways: she has gained new friends; has been able to take her ARV on a more regular basis; has learned more about society, especially HIV positive society; and she has acquired sewing skills. She has participated in all the training workshops provided to MDSF, including technical support from Singapore and Japan, and also acquired skills as a team leader, including passing on her skills to other ladies. However, she still does not feel confident enough to lead or advise entirely by herself. Her hope is to become like she was in the past, preparing wedding parties, not just sewing and cutting.

In particular, there are two main aspects of MDSF\u2019s management system that have contributed to challenges in operation of the enterprise. One of these is the management structure, where the lack of board of directors or steering committee has meant a lack of clarity regarding reporting and accountability, especially for the office manager position, and a reliance on PDA to help fill this role. The other aspect that appears to have been a challenge is the management approach. Styles vary but, for any business to be successfully run, managers, as well as consultants in the case of MDSF, need to be able to get the most out of their staff. In order to keep up staff morale, some understanding and application of psychology is needed in addition to business skills. This is especially challenging in a situation such as MDSF where there are special sensitivities because the women are living with HIV and feel that they have different needs from other women. For this reason, management must be aware of and able to respond to issues when they arise in a way that eases tension on a personal level, and reminds women of the big picture \u2013 the commitment to the enterprise. Insecurity regarding the duration of donor support has been an important factor during the life of the project. While it has run for five years, the fact that support was given through a series of shorter contracts, of one to two years\u2019 length, seems to have resulted in a degree of uncertainty among the workers, as well as the local consultants. For this reason, a number of people opted to leave the project in order to take up more secure employment elsewhere. There will also be a need for continued donor support after completion of the current UNDP/PDA support phase. This includes technical support, funding for activities and assistance in finding markets. On-going technical support will be needed in the area of design, marketing and management, in order to ensure that skills are updated, and also for new staff who replace current workers or join in case of expansion of the business. Training in marketing was identified as a key concern for the present, as well as the future. The need for funding has resulted from the fact that, despite five years of support from UNDP/PDA, consultants and trainers, the business has still not been able to generate a constant surplus in income that will enable funds to be saved in order to cover costs such as replacement of equipment, or bridging to cover basic costs during slow periods, not to mention the provision of financial resources to CCW to benefit a greater number of positive women across Cambodia, which is envisaged in the rationale behind the initiation of WWP. 3.1.5 Conclusions MDSF has provided a safe and supportive working environment, income, and empowerment for the women living with HIV involved. Lacking specific indicators, however, it is hard to assess the broader impact of the project on improving the general environment for women living with HIV in Cambodia. At present in Cambodia the issue of stigma and discrimination appears to have improved considerably, largely due to the intensive public advocacy efforts of CPN+, CCW and other organizations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the MDSF project has helped this change, by providing a good example that shows the important contribution that women living with HIV can make to Cambodian society, through undertaking challenging and productive work that is appreciated at international level. As a business, MDSF has not been highly successful. With the exception of a few short periods, MDSF has struggled to break even throughout its duration.

PDA had initially hoped that MDSF would operate in a similar way to that used by PDA in Thailand, where the social enterprise activities generate profits that can help support the NGO partner\u2019s activities. However, MDSF has never become sufficiently well-established for this to occur.

The human resource capacity of MDSF is still limited. In order to compete more effectively in the marketplace, the enterprise needs to strengthen its personnel in the areas of marketing and design. Currently marketing is passive, relying mainly on requests from clients, rather than being proactive and seeking out new clients and maintaining existing relationships, as well as identifying ways to expand into other sectors where there are potential markets, in particular Government and private sector. This should be done according to a marketing strategy that is regularly updated. While PDA has recently assisted MDSF to engage a marketing and communications officer and a design and production person part time for the remainder of the project, this arrangement needs to be formalized. In order to ensure that it can compete in the marketplace, and as part of a more long-term and business-like perspective, MDSF also needs to review its management structure. The link with CCW is a good step towards strengthening the social enterprise, with benefits for both MDSF and CCW. However, with the end of UNDP APRC and PDA support, a board of directors or similar organ should be established, with representation from key stakeholders. At the same time, the enterprise\u2019s organogram and job descriptions of all staff should be revised so that the management structure is clear and the General Manager reports to, and acts on guidance from, the Board. In the final year of the project (2011), PDA is currently focusing on strengthening the management structure and sustainable local support. The current arrangement, where premises are shared with CCW, must be seen as only a temporary solution. If MDSF is functioning effectively as a business, it should be able to generate sufficient income to cover core costs, rather than relying on subsidized rental and other overheads, as at present. In the long term, subject to financial stability, MDSF needs to move to separate premises that provide an improved workspace for the women, as well as room for expansion. There appears to be little advantage in being located in the middle of Phnom Penh itself, and MDSF should consider rental of larger premises further away from the centre of the city, which will help reduce overheads. Given that Phnom Penh is not a large city, and the fact that most of the women already commute relatively long distances to work, this should not present a major problem. With effective marketing and management, the potential business advantages to MDSF should easily outweigh any disadvantages in terms of increased rental costs. In addition to strengthening the human resource base and management structure, MDSF needs to identify funding sources in order to cover on-going training costs, enable expansion and create a contingency fund that can be used for additional costs such as replacement of equipment, bulk purchase of materials and cover running costs between payments and orders. With the shift in priorities among many donors, including the UN system, away from HIV to climate change, one of the best prospects may be the Global Fund on AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "862b8118-132a-42c0-90f9-5f0f2cd8dad9": {"__data__": {"id_": "862b8118-132a-42c0-90f9-5f0f2cd8dad9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ae31706c8f04646e4f11afb88946f8b6e39b5e6391aa7779c7e564d6a9989ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "e42a8447-63fc-41ba-a27e-7b486ff8a4b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4cff47c6cec139d6223f8777d89b7bf1173c8ff7d55823b6b619d6de9dbc072"}}, "hash": "3490772274977277c13eef5a4457fc131269807bc5921cf7c5f260a5184f3a21", "text": "The issue of support for livelihoods for people living with HIV is included in the Kingdom of Cambodia National Strategic Plan for a Comprehensive and Multi-Sectoral Response to HIV/AIDS 2011-2015 and as the Chairperson of CCW is a member of the Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), she is in a position to advocate on behalf of MDSF and other organizations engaged in similar initiatives for inclusion of support for livelihoods in the next GFATM Round.

Additionally, the possibility of home-based production can be explored as one way to reduce costs; \u2022\ufffd To address the enterprises\u2019 long-term funding needs following the completion of the WWP, with assistance from CCW, MDSF and CPN+ should identify alternative sources of donor funding, in particular advocacy for inclusion of support for livelihood and social enterprise in the next GFATM Round proposal; \u2022\ufffd In keeping with the recommendations of the 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia36 and the changing priorities among the donor community, MDSF should consider broadening its beneficiary focus to include a greater emphasis on vulnerable and most at risk women. 36 Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an Effective Response, Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia, Oxford University Press, 2008. 30 3.2.1 background Globally, India carries the largest burden of HIV behind South Africa and Nigeria, with over 2.27 million people of India\u2019s 1,160 million population estimated to be living with HIV. Women account for 39 percent of people living with HIV while children account for 3.8 percent. Sixty percent of people living with HIV are in the six high prevalence states, including Tamil Nadu.37 In Chennai (the capital city of Tamil Nadu) itself, where the first cases of HIV in India were diagnosed amongst sex workers in 1986, data furnished by the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) indicates that a total of 28,000 HIV new cases were registered in 2008-2009 and 30,000 new cases in 2009-2010.38 The implementation of the ART programme has been very successful in India, with some targets set under the NACP III likely to be exceeded.39 Nevertheless, by the end of 2009 only about 280,000, or 45 percent, of people living with HIV in need of treatment were receiving ART.40 Despite the gains made in increasing access to care and treatment, stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV remains widespread in India. A 2006 study found that 25 percent of people living with HIV in India had been refused medical treatment on the basis of their HIV-positive status. It also found strong evidence of stigma in the workplace, with 74 percent of employees not disclosing their status to their colleagues for fear of discrimination. Of the 26 percent who did disclose their status, 10 percent reported having faced prejudice as a result. People in marginalized groups, including female sex workers, transgender persons and men who have sex with men, are often stigmatized not only because of their HIV status but also because they belong to socially excluded groups.41 Owing to their status in Indian society, women are especially vulnerable to the impact of HIV in India. For poor women, the loss of a partner or parent to AIDS can create a situation of extreme financial insecurity and desperation, especially in regard to shelter and property, with limited education greatly restricting opportunities for women in finding work.

Under the Asia Pacific Regional Initiative on the Empowerment of People Living with HIV, UNDP APRC had established a partnership with the Indian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+). INP+, which was established in Chennai in 1997, represents 22 state level networks and 221 district level networks of people living with HIV, supporting them to mobilize communities and ensure access to ART and other services. The key partner in the WWP project was the Positive Women Network. PWN+ was founded in 1998 and based in Chennai, and is an all-India network of over 5,000 women living with HIV, including state- level member networks in seven states. The activities of PWN+ are focused on improving the quality of life of women and children living with HIV through mutual support, promotion of human rights, and sensitization of society regarding their situation and needs.44 At the commencement of the WWP project in 2006, PWN+ had 30 full-time employees, 12 of whom were working at the organization\u2019s headquarters.45 Three members of the network attended the WWP training workshop organized by PDA in Bangkok in June-July 2006. 3.2.2 description of activities and results At the time the project commenced, a large range and volume of HIV-related materials was being produced, and the considerable budget involved in its production was paid directly to the private sector. PWN+ had some previous experience producing greeting cards, posters, and some published materials and it was felt that if a social enterprise were established it could help redirect some of this money back to those affected by the epidemic. Thus the business model, as originally developed by PWN+ in July 2006, was for a company, under the name \u201cSocial Communication Company\u201d, that would produce a range of communications media, including products such as posters, cards, brochures, billboards, banners, stickers and t-shirts (Figures 14 and 15). Implementation of this plan required a creative team, who could design the media, a marketing team, to identify and maintain relationships with clients, and an operations team to oversee the production process. A business manager would be needed for the enterprise, as well as an advisory board, comprising representatives of government, the private sector and PWN+. The approved business model describes the concept, marketing strategy, challenges, comparative advantages and potential income of the proposed enterprise. While the business plan states its purpose as \u201cserving other women living with HIV and AIDS\u201d and the benefits it brings to society, little more is said about the project\u2019s objectives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f0a7b56-eb8e-4ae2-b308-845e592d98cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f0a7b56-eb8e-4ae2-b308-845e592d98cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2ce501b7e5ce3d75deb052a19c0ceb1cb7c1482a3fb617aac31b1e91aef0d79"}, "2": {"node_id": "b074db9b-ff06-4c23-977b-ca5ecd822e27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7181c42718675b397442c06e934d68b2d0c485ad19b9549e704eee86ba73685"}}, "hash": "4e1943803007e041b868920aaa0a3af5853ed11b428238105fae2603f670f2e7", "text": "Similarly, while the plan describes how profits will be used to establish a revolving fund \u201cto be used only for women and children\u2019s economic empowerment\u201d no details are given regarding the selection criteria for beneficiaries and the type of activities that might be supported, other than to say that a separate committee will be set up.46 A revised business plan, for a design and print production company, under the name \u201cSocialite Communications Company\u201d, was submitted to PDA in September 2006, although the group apparently began operations earlier, in August 2006.47 48 Under the revised name of Social Light Communications and four employees (two part- time and two full-time), the enterprise experienced considerable early success.

Fig. 15: samples of slc products 32 initial capital investment of just US$5,400, by the end of March 2007, the enterprise had generated income of US$15,210 and a net profit of US$2,995. In addition, SLC developed a website, with a plan for a secure online payment system, which has not eventuated to date. As can be seen from the business results for the project (see Annex), this early success continued through 2008. During the first year of the project, SLC had also begun to train and provide seed funds to women living with HIV to start micro-enterprises, such as screen printing (SLC supported training of two women in screen printing), related to SLC\u2019s production needs. Challenges identified during this phase of the project included the restriction of marketing to within HIV networks, international agencies and NGOs, the potential restriction of growth through having only one designer, the need to improve quality control, sharing premises with PWN+ and the need to try and run SLC separately from PWN+.49 During 2008, SLC\u2019s activities expanded beyond the initial design and print production to include a WE shop and micro-credit activities with rural women\u2019s HIV self-help groups. As of November 2008, SLC had a total of over 55 clients on their books and SLC expanded its networks among local and international NGOs, including sales at exhibitions in the UK and Sri Lanka. High sales figures were recorded through several large orders, for example the Population Foundation of India in October, and SLC enhanced its communications and formally registered with large NGOs such as World Vision India in order to qualify for their procurement process. Challenges faced during this period included an insufficient quality control system, lack of a proactive marketing strategy, coordination of sub-contracted printing, a weak financial reporting system, inadequate office space, and meeting donor reporting deadlines. SLC followed the PDA model, where the business enterprise supported the parent NGO. This included employing both HIV positive and negative staff, to reduce stigma and discrimination and encourage interaction, and pooling of profits made by the social enterprise into community activities, through initiation of micro-credit activities with positive women. Building on the promising start to the project, SLC made early moves to expand quickly into the second phase of WWP, or the Positive Partnership Programme (PPP) model developed by PDA.50 Beginning in late 2008, SLC drew upon PWN+\u2019s strong network and activities in Tamil Nadu to begin work with rural women living with HIV through support for micro-credit activities. This consisted mainly of provision of training for positive women to start businesses related to SLC\u2019s production needs, and a micro-credit loan scheme in the Villupuram district that was used to initiate a business called the \u201cModern Saree Shop.\u201d The group also received seed funding from the local government. During early 2009, SLC provided technical support, including business skills development and marketing, to this group, enabling it to develop its infrastructure and members\u2019 skills. Unfortunately, after several months, the group members decided to divide the business loan among themselves for personal use. As a result, SLC dissociated itself from the project, recognizing the group\u2019s abuse of the loan and general misdirection. This experience discouraged SLC from engaging in similar activities elsewhere and indicates that for the transition to a second phase, according to the PDA PPP model, close, continual, monitoring and technical support is required.51 Despite its negative experience in Villapuram, SLC continued with its efforts to promote the PPP model through other activities. The main one of these was the development of the WE Shop, a handicraft supplier run by a pair of HIV-positive women. Unfortunately this activity also encountered difficulties, although in this case it was largely because SLC did not administer the loan as envisioned in the PPP design. While SLC provided an initial loan with the intention that it be repaid once the WE Shop generated sustainable profits, this did not happen.

Despite advice from PDA on how to address this issue, through restructuring SLC\u2019s relationship with the loan recipient, financial support continued until the WE Shop\u2019s activities were transferred to PWN+ in 2010.52 53 54 Subsequently, the issue was worked out and over half the loan has been repaid.55 From 2009 the fortunes of SLC seem to have gone into decline. The enterprise began to experience a fall in its business, with monthly income averaging only about US$460, and expenses averaging over US$1,090 per month. This seems to have been due to several factors, including a high staff turnover, personal differences among staff, and deterioration in the relationship with PWN+. In turn, these issues resulted in slow development of comprehensive marketing strategies, especially a failure to establish long-term business relationships with new clients, a neglect of existing clients, and management problems that led to claims of poor design, long processing time, and poor printing quality.56 57 The deterioration in the relationship with PWN+ seems to have been the most crucial factor in the decline of SLC\u2019s business. SLC shared premises with PWN+, and in the early stage of the project the two part-time members of SLC\u2019s staff also worked for PWN+. While this had initial benefits, some important differences in objectives and outlook became apparent as SLC developed. In contrast to the NGO approach of PWN+, in order to develop, SLC needed to become more business-like in its approach, having greater independence and control over its finances and administration. Conflicts arose over issues such as workspace, supervision, the HR policy, and finances, in particular control and rights to cheque signing. Interpersonal conflicts also arose between SLC and PWN+ staff, resulting in resignation of key SLC staff.58 While a number of the issues described were identified earlier in the project, they do not appear to have become a threat to the survival of the business until 2010. This may be due to the fact that at this time PWN+ was also experiencing its own problems in regard to funding, staff capacity, performance and attitude.59 staffing As mentioned previously, SLC started with four employees, two of whom were part-time and two full-time. Staff numbers increased to six, during the first year of operation, then gradually declined to three. For a period in 2010, there were no staff.60 As of April 2011, there were three full-time staff, comprising the Business Manager, a Designer, and the Business Support Mentor who was recruited to undertake marketing.61 The most effective staffing structure, as represented by the situation as it was in 2008 when SLC was at its most profitable, is shown in Figure 16. Staff turnover has been an on-going challenge for SLC. Outside the personality issues referred to above, which led to resignation of staff, the specialized nature of some key positions, requiring skills such as design and marketing, has made it difficult to hold on to trained staff in the highly competitive business environment of Chennai. Additionally, when people have gained experience and skills, they look for a higher paying job. Generally, it is very difficult to identify women living with HIV who possess the necessary skills and experience, and for this reason the designer position, in particular, was filled by HIV 52 Annual Report January - December 2009 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2009. 53 Annual Report January - December 2010 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2010. 54 Annual Report 2010, Social Light Communications. 55 Personal communication with Bargara Eagle, PDA, 2010 56 Annual Report January - December 2009 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2009. 57 Annual Report January - December 2010 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2010. 58 Annual Project Report, Strengthening socio-economic empowerment of women living with HIV in Cambodia and India, UNDP, January 2010. 59 Annual Report January - December 2010 Women and Wealth Project, PDA, Dec. 2010. 60 Ibid. 61 Interview notes, Chennai, 28-30 April 2011. 34 negative staff, mostly male.

Unfortunately, as we have seen, this did not eventuate. training/capacity development and support The success of the business model chosen required not only the recruitment of staff with specialized skills, but also the ongoing training of specialist staff to maintain and update their skills, and training of other staff in core areas such as finance, management and quality control. For this reason, SLC\u2019s training needs were quite distinct from those of MDSF in Cambodia, and each staff member had individual training requirements based on their background, experience, qualifications and role within the group. For this reason SLC chose to pursue training specific to each individual staff member. SLC\u2019s local consultants were the key provider of these capacity building activities, while some staff members pursued individual training to learn English language, marketing, and book keeping. In addition, regular monitoring and site visits were made by PDA, there was input from UNDP and other consultants such as Catalyst, and special training workshops were organized on specific areas. In all, PDA made nine site visits to Chennai: in December 2006; May 2007; July-August 2008; November 2008; April 2009; September-October 2009; June 2010; October-November 2010; and March 2011. Regular contact was also maintained with SLC through two- weekly Skype meetings, email communication and regular quarterly, biannual and annual reports. PDA conducted an evaluation of the project\u2019s progress on two occasions, using the figure 16: slC staff organogram (december 2008) PWN+ Board SLC Products Design and Print Business Manager Ms. Padmaja Business Coord.

The first of these was in 2008, when six team members participated, and the second, in 2009, with only three women participating. PDA planned to repeat the survey in late 2010, but was unable to do so owing to the lack of staff at SLC at the time.62 SLC also benefited from technical support from the Singapore International Foundation, whose trainers made site visits to Chennai, including presentation of a five-day workshop in March-April 2010 on communication media and print production. The content included designing formats to help SLC track its orders, development of creative briefs on jobs, formatting of timelines, and preparation of costings and quotations. SIF also gave training on design software to the Graphic Designer, along with distance support. 63 In 2009, in order to provide additional local technical support, PDA initiated a partnership with Catalyst Management Services, a Bangalore-based consulting and research organization that serves small enterprises and disadvantaged communities. Catalyst worked with SLC from early 2010 starting with a study, in April 2010, to identify the gaps in the business and analyse the reasons for the current state of its affairs, and reflect on SLC\u2019s achievements and challenges with a view to reviving and strengthening its business.64 Major areas of concern identified were governance, business operations, human resources, planning and monitoring, quality and diversification.65 Unfortunately this relationship has since withered due to some disagreement between CMS and PWN+.

In terms of fulfilling the first of the key objectives of the WWP, providing livelihood support for women living with HIV, SLC has had very limited success. The number of women living with HIV who have benefited from SLC through financial support is very small, totalling only some six people, of whom some had previously been employed by PWN+, or had part- time work with the organization. A number of women living with HIV in the community also benefited financially from SLC in the course of the micro-credit activities implemented early in the project, covering about 20 women living with HIV.

Kousalya, Client Services Manager for SLC and President of PWN+ 36 empowerment The major achievement of SLC has been in regard to the empowerment of women living with HIV. The establishment by women living with HIV of a business enterprise that was, initially at least, successfully sent a strong message to other members of the PWN+ and to the members of INP+ nationwide. SLC demonstrated clearly that women living with HIV have the capacity to acquire the skills and manage the day-to-day activities of an enterprise working in a highly competitive area of the private sector. Through participation in SLC, as reflected in comments made by the women and consultants during interviews and in the Bamboo Ladder Survey results, the women involved are strongly committed to SLC, have acquired confidence and increased self-esteem, as well as important skills and experience in a number of key areas related to the business.66 These skills include management, marketing, an understanding of design and production, book keeping and finances. In addition, they have gained valuable experience and contacts from working with major organizations and agencies working in the area of HIV in Tamil Nadu and India in general. The increased self-esteem, skills and partnerships will be of benefit both individually to the women themselves in their future employment and lives, as well as to other women living with HIV that they represent. socio-cultural environment In Chennai, as in the other WWP implementation sites, it is difficult to assess the outcomes of the project in terms of its third objective, in reduction of stigma and discrimination against women living with HIV and their families, and improving the socio-cultural environment. Certainly, from the viewpoint of key partners in the area of HIV, such as TANSACS, and business partners, including clients and printers, the staff of SLC gained acceptance and appear to have enjoyed the same relationships as the staff of any other organization. In regard to changing the attitudes of society in general, it is unlikely that SLC has had a great impact, owing to the relatively small scale of its operations and limited publicity concerning the project among the local media. Any changes that have occurred are more likely to have taken place because of the activities of PWN+, which are strongly focused on advocacy and the policy environment. While SLC has made a contribution to the work of PWN+, it has been an indirect one. 3.2.4 main challenges The main challenges faced by SLC have been in two areas, the business model itself, and the management of the enterprise.

In particular, the marketing officer position was one that required a dedicated staff member recruited from the private sector. Management has been another important challenge for SLC. While some issues were noted early in the project, these do not seem to have become sufficiently serious to affect the success of the enterprise until around its third year, in 2009. After that time implementation of business plans and marketing strategies became more difficult, with decreasing income and high staff turnover. Behind these problems there appear to be two related issues. One of these is the approach of management to the enterprise, operating in a business environment in a business-like manner. In addition to making the shift from the non-government sector to the private sector, other changes of approach need to be promoted among staff, including getting personnel to put the best interests of the business ahead of personal issues. Strong management is needed to ensure that these changes take place in a way that maintains staff morale and commitment. Another aspect of management is the capacity of PWN+ in regard to providing adequate support for SLC. For successful development of SLC, PWN+ needed to understand the basic difference between the two organizations, with SLC being a business enterprise, in comparison to PWN+, the primary role of which was social advocacy and community development. This implied allowing SLC sufficient financial and management independence to enable it to function effectively, but at the same time monitoring the progress of the enterprise and providing support when needed to address any problems that arose. From the reports and information provided by staff, it seems that PWN+ has lacked the necessary strength and experience to fulfill this role. 3.2.5 Conclusions The Chennai group chose a business model that had high potential to generate profit but at the same time was accompanied by significant risk. Chennai is a city that has seen rapid development, with strong growth as a regional business centre. In addition, considerable funding has been available for HIV activities in the region. Chennai has also been a forerunner in the HIV response, with development of strong networks, including PWN+. However, the business sector is highly competitive, with large and well-established printing and production companies that have strong financial backing. While the goodwill conferred on SLC through its status as a social enterprise provided a marketing advantage that would enable it to compete, for its success the business also needed skilled and experienced personnel, and strong management. Given this context, the achievement of SLC has been quite remarkable. In a relatively short period of time, the enterprise established itself as a business, developed contacts, obtained contracts and generated high profits, showing an excellent return on the investment. This enabled SLC to move quickly into its second phase much sooner than anticipated. The project demonstrated clearly that, given an opportunity, women living with HIV can make an important contribution to society, and also take responsibility for improving their own situation. Unfortunately the enterprises\u2019 early promise was not sustained, and SLC has failed to reach its full potential. The reasons for this are mainly an inability to address the challenges that arose, in particular the need for strong business management. In this regard questions arose concerning the capacity of PWN+ to manage and support an enterprise of this kind. This was probably compounded by the overly rapid expansion into the second phase of the business model. In retrospect, it may have been better to wait until the business itself had become more consolidated before entering the new area of micro-credit. At the present time, when the business is struggling to stay", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96b7c075-1472-440d-aab5-2687eab9cc24": {"__data__": {"id_": "96b7c075-1472-440d-aab5-2687eab9cc24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42547d60207ee9e89c9a70da9b46990bc47ec79d0f05d46ebe4d7ec21a689dad"}}, "hash": "42547d60207ee9e89c9a70da9b46990bc47ec79d0f05d46ebe4d7ec21a689dad", "text": "afloat, it is crucial that PWN+ take steps to revise the management structure of SLC so that the enterprise can function effectively as a 38 business. This includes ensuring that SLC has greater autonomy in financial management and decision-making, and staff recruitment, as well as clarifying the role and responsibilities of PWN+ in providing support, and management of income generated by SLC. A second challenge has been that of the recruitment and retention of skilled staff. The enterprise is reliant on skilled and experienced staff, especially in the areas of design and marketing. The required personnel could not be identified from among the community of women living with HIV, and were recruited from the private sector. Another potential source of people with these skills is the male or transgender members of other HIV positive people\u2019s networks, but involving them would mean broadening the scope of the beneficiaries of SLC. However, bearing in mind that most of the designers recruited from the private sector have been male, this should not present a major obstacle. It is apparent that with the difficulties experienced recently, SLC has been less proactive in accessing the private sector market in Chennai, and more reliant on orders coming from within the HIV and INGO network. For this reason an urgent priority is recruitment of a staff member with skills and experience in marketing who can approach the private sector and other potential clients to sell SLC\u2019s services, making use of the comparative advantage of the business\u2019s social enterprise status. As a consequence, despite its promising beginning, SLC has not been able to deliver the expected benefits for women living with HIV. Potentially, based on the very accurate initial market analysis and identification of the business opportunity, the enterprise could have resulted in the generation of considerable income. Based on its business model, the benefit to women living with HIV would come not from employment in the enterprise itself, but through pooling of profits into its micro-credit activities and funding other activities of the mother organization. While not yet entirely a missed opportunity, it will require considerable effort and commitment on behalf of SLC and PWN+ to turn the situation around. 3.2.6 recommendations The following recommendations are made for steps that could strengthen SLC in order that it can better meet its objectives in empowerment of women living with HIV: \u2022\ufffd The management structure of SLC should be reviewed by key stakeholders with a view to clarifying the arrangements necessary for SLC to function most effectively as a business enterprise, gaining a consensus on the role of PWN+ and the board of management, and a firm commitment from PWN+ on implementation of agreed actions; \u2022\ufffd In conjunction with the stakeholder review, staffing structure should be reviewed, and consideration given to recruitment of the staff, in particular a marketing officer, needed to ensure that SLC can compete in the marketplace; \u2022\ufffd Greater efforts should be made to reach beyond the HIV sector in marketing and access, in particular, the private sector. Increased emphasis should be placed on promotion of the concept of CSR and SLC\u2019s status as a social enterprise; \u2022\ufffd Consider broadening the beneficiary focus of SLC to include members of the wider network of HIV positive people\u2019s networks, including members of key at risk populations. This might also help to expand the source of skilled people living with HIV who could contribute to the enterprise. 39 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises 3.3.1 background India\u2019s northeast region is socially and culturally distinct from the rest of the country. Relatively isolated until recently, the northeast is home to 200 of India\u2019s some 430 tribal groups. One of these groups, the Bodo, occupy an area located in the north bank of Brahmaputra river in the state of Assam in the north east region of India, by the foothills of Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh. The Bodo people number over 1,350,000 and speak Bodo, a Tibeto-Burman language. Also in this area are a large number of Adivasi people, a mixed group claimed to be the aboriginal populations of India.67 From around 1987, following lack of response to marked socio-economic disparities between the region and other parts of India, coupled with land disputes and ethnic conflicts fuelled by an increase in migrants from other parts of India, the Bodoland Movement for an independent state of Bodoland began, under the leadership of the All Bodo Students\u2019 Union (ABSU). By the time an accord was reached, with the establishment of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in 2006, over two hundred thousand people had been displaced from their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "105d946a-ceee-4544-b458-86f6721766f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "105d946a-ceee-4544-b458-86f6721766f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98ce55d6fc718708d23cc7fd7f77d58b1199e0617e7e09a49fd2e71ed3ab5c56"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bc6a158-23db-4b49-ba23-089ab22c3eef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "042debdbe9e9c0a1008abbe138f2e5116f7b5e8a14bb8387ad603ea45ea9ca13"}}, "hash": "d3e89a45e539efb909a7a7598acd3f1b482a3fed3de1f66a097a66fdbc9cd68f", "text": "homes and were living in 25 relief camps. Extreme poverty and the poor conditions in the relief camps made the inhabitants an easy target for human traffickers and, according to a report by the Nedan Foundation, in the two year period to 2006 over 100 young women had been reported missing from the camps. The total number of women from the area who have migrated to work in India is much larger, and it is likely that many of them have entered the sex trade in India\u2019s major cities such as Kolkata and Mumbai. 68 The poverty, insecurity and high population mobility of Bodoland are linked to a rapid increase in transmission of HIV in the region. HIV is already well-established in the northeast of India, where some states, such as Nagaland and Manipur, rank amongst the six highest prevalence states in the country. According to official data from the Kokrajhar health department, in 2005 nine cases of HIV were reported, which rose to 27 in 2009 and 66 cases of HIV in 2010, with 31 cases of AIDS. The people living with HIV include 37 men, 23 women and six children, with four deaths from the disease. The actual number of people living with HIV can be much higher, since the health department only records the cases reported from blood tests on people suspected of being infected with HIV. Currently only limited facilities are available for counselling and testing for HIV, at the R.N.B. Civil Hospital and one other hospital in Kokrajhar. The closest delivery point for ART and CD469 testing is at Guwahati Medical College (GMC), located some 200 kilometres, or four hour drive, away 67 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi 68 INDIA: Human trafficking in the northeast fuelling HIV/AIDS \u2013 report, 17 May 2006, http://www.irinnews.org/ PrintReport.aspx?ReportID=34306. 69 CD4 is a glycoprotein receptor found on the surface of immune cells that can be used to measure the human body\u2019s capacity for immune response.

As mentioned earlier, the activities in Bodoland Territorial Council, Assam, through the NEDAN Foundation, were added to the WWP in 2008. The partnership differed from the original structure of WWP in some important ways, in that NEDAN is an NGO, not a people living with HIV organization, and the NEDAN Foundation was funded and supported directly by UNDP India and UNDP APRC rather than through the MOU with PDA as in the case of the other groups. While working closely with the Assam People living with HIV Network, the primary focus of NEDAN has been the issue of trafficking and its related causes, and the organization has strong experience and technical skills in the area of community development. NEDAN\u2019s areas of interest match several of UNDP\u2019s core areas of engagement, and UNDP felt that because of their capacity and previous experience in the key areas of trafficking, HIV and existing economic empowerment project for women the partnership was consistent with the objectives of the WWP and would be a profitable one. So far this appears to have been the case. 3.3.2 description of activities and results Bodo women share a strong cultural tradition of handloom weaving and are regarded as the finest weavers of silk and cotton fabric in India\u2019s northeast region.71 Prior to the commencement of the project, weaving was mainly done to make the traditional dress (dokhana) worn by Bodo women. NEDAN realized that there is enormous scope to build on this tradition as a source of sustainable livelihood, through use of the women\u2019s traditional skills to produce high quality fabrics with modern designs and colours for sale on local and international markets.

In order to produce quality fabric products, the existing weaving centre was expanded by the addition of six Jacquard looms to increase the quantity and quality of fabric produced, and the number of weavers increased to 15. The weavers would consist of rescued and migrant returnee women. Whilst the weavers were mainly Bodo women, the trainees in the stitching and finishing centre were mainly Adivasi women, since they did not have a strong hand weaving tradition. The project included activities to strengthen the training centre for stitching and end- product production. Training would continue for the 16 women already learning cutting, designing and stitching of end-products, using fabric produced by the weavers. Under the WWP, training would be provided to women to produce better quality products with more colourful and fashionable designs, and the WWP would also increase the opportunity to access international markets with products labeled with the WE brand. Women\u2019s self-support groups would be established at each centre, comprising all women members, each with its own capital fund, in order to provide an opportunity for the women to learn skills about earning, management of income and entrepreneurship. It was expected 70 Interview notes, Kokrajhar, 25-27 April 2011; The Telegraph, Calcutta, 2 December 2010. 71 Bodo silk is mainly made from the cocoons of eri and muga varieties of silkworms, of which the eri, which feeds on castor plants, is preferred owing to the fact that its production does not involve killing the pupae. 41 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises that each woman would contribute US$25 per month to the capital fund, making a total of US$375 per weaving centre or US$13,500 per year from all three centres. These funds would be used within each group to expand production and serve as an emergency fund for the women\u2019s domestic needs. Group leaders would be taken on exposure visits and trained in business management.72 With a high quality product, designs acceptable in local and international markets, and good marketing, the business model was expected to provide livelihood opportunities for the women involved, as well as economic empowerment, social and health support (Figure 18). The activities would also help address the issue of stigmatization and social ostracization of the women and their families. NEDAN would strengthen its links with various national institutions and organizations promoting tribal handicrafts, including the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and other outlets, such as Tribe Shop and Fab India. It was anticipated that the project would begin to generate profits within one year of the start of implementation. In addition to payment of the salaries of women employed, it was planned to use profits generated to purchase materials to sustain operations, and also to promote new livelihood activities in Baksa District of BTC, and two other states in the northeast, Manipur and Mizoram. According to the original plan, operations of WD would be managed by a committee, comprising NEDAN staff, as well as women representing the workers, including trafficking survivors and women living with HIV (see Figure 19). Budget for equipment, raw materials, printing, rent of premises, transport and salaries of a supervisor/trainer and an instructor was provided. By the end of 2009 WD employed 47 women who were engaged in weaving, spinning, stitching and finishing. These women included those who had been repatriated, returnee labour migrants, women living with HIV and family members or other vulnerable women from the community. In addition, six young men were employed to assist with dyeing, lifting and handling of raw materials and the finished products. By the end of 2010, the number of employees had increased to 65 women, and eight young men.73 During 2009, 40 women were trained to upgrade the quality of the weaving. Sixteen women were trained in stitching and finishing at the training centre at Srirampur. An orientation workshop was organized in March 2009, after completion of the WD Women\u2019s production Campus, which was attended by 42 women and girls. Following that workshop it was decided unanimously by the women that in-house training should be organized to build their capacity in regard to running a business enterprise. In addition to aspects of women\u2019s business development and management skills, the training also included the topics of gender-based violence, stigma and discrimination, and HIV. In 2010, 56 women and girls were trained in a workshop focused on these issues, which was supported by a grant from NEDFi Guwahati.

Fig. 20: bibi russell training WD staff design and quality improvement of products, creating a wide media exposure of WD across India and the world (Figure 20). As WD staff developed their skills and experience, they were also able to help train other women in the community. The activities of the Stitching Centre were decentralized, with three of the original batch of eight trainees selected to train other women in Srirampur. Each group of eight women underwent five months training, then were replaced by a new batch, with a certificate being issued to women who completed the course. Soon after its establishment, WD was able to start generating a good income from sale of its products (see Annex for details of WD\u2019s business results for 2009, 2010, and 2011). By the end of 2010, over US$28,000 had been earned from sales. After payment of workers\u2019 salaries, the remaining funds were used to purchase raw materials and also support some community development activities (Box 3). In large part this was due to the attention paid to quality and design of products, as well as careful planning in marketing to maximize opportunities at the local, national and international level, including personal and professional networks, and the Indian Government\u2019s own trade initiatives. In payment of the WD workers\u2019 salaries, NEDAN encouraged the women to develop an understanding of the concept of saving and management of their money through establishment of a women\u2019s bank. A condition of payment of the women\u2019s salaries was that they deposit into a bank account at least INR 600 (about US$13.50) a month to encourage savings. NEDAN arranged for a bank account to be opened with the national bank in the name of each employee. If a woman had some urgent need then she could draw on this money, and if she decided to leave the project she would have some savings that could help her establish a small business. Facilities were expanded to include space for the Women\u2019s Bank, as well as a training hall that can accommodate 50 people. In 2010, dormitory accommodation was increased through construction of a 25 bed dormitory, as well as a kitchen so that the women can manage their meals by themselves. These additions were paid for from income generated by sales of WD\u2019s products. Using funds generated by sales of WD\u2019s products, NEDAN was able to expand its 43 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises development activities in the adjacent communities. Initially the sum of INR 50,000 (about US$1,113) was allocated for this support. During 2010, two villages were adopted, with 56 households, and activities undertaken included provision of tube wells to ensure a safe water supply and reduce the time spent, mainly by women and children, on water collection (Figure 21). The resulting increase in water supply and time available could be used to establish kitchen gardens and income generation activities, such as raising silk worms, which could then be sold to WD. Funds were also used to provide education support for children.74 Another aspect of the community project that complements the activities of WD involves increasing access of women and their families to ART and related care and support services. NEDAN is supporting outreach services for the 79 adults and 12 children reported to be living with HIV in Kokrajhar.

WD products were subsequently included in the Indian Government\u2019s Ministry of Tribal Affairs\u2019 initiative by marketing through various outlets, such as the Tribe Shop, Fab India, the Confederation of Indian Industry, Eco Tasar Silk (pvt) Ltd, the Silk Mark Organization, the Central Silk Board, DASTKAR and other organizations that promote social marketing inside and outside the country. Within India, WD\u2019s products are also sold through exhibitions organized for handloom and handicraft products in various regions through bodies such as NEDFi Haat, the India International Trade Fair, and the National Commission of Handloom. In the international market, WD products have reached out to the USA (three outlets in New York, three in Chicago, two in California, and one in Washington DC), France (one outlet), the UK (two outlets) and Singapore (two outlets). Participation in the 2009 ICAAP in Bali, Indonesia, also gave WD important international exposure. In accessing these outlets, WD made good use of the social enterprise advantage, and the fact that the project respects workers\u2019 rights, and the product is natural, with even the production of eri silk not involving harm to animals. Though these marketing partnerships are still in the initial phase, the demand is high in terms of quantity. However, WD is still a small social enterprise and meeting large international orders is a challenge. In addition to expanding its production capacity, and increasing its capital investment, WD needs to do some important ground work such as procuring an export license, arranging for eco- friendly certification of its products (this is also necessary to comply with USA\u2019s import regulations) and registration under the World Fair Trade Organization. These challenges need to be overcome if WD is to continue expanding its production so that more women will benefit from the enterprise. Fig. 21: Tube well donated using WD\u2019s profits 44 box 4: wd beneficiary snapshot Ahila is 35 years old. As a child, she did not go to school and is illiterate. She has four children, three daughters and a son, the eldest at age 20 is a boy, while the rest aged 18, 14, 11 are girls. Ahila\u2019s husband died of AIDS six years ago. After her husband\u2019s death no one advised her to take an HIV test, so Ahila remained undiagnosed until she became ill with TB when she was bed-ridden and had a skin infection. NEDAN found out about her situation and staff took her to the Guwahati Medical College where the doctors found that her immune system was very weak, with an extremely low CD4 count. They started her on ART, and advised her to return home to her village near Kokrajhar. During the ambulance ride she was close to collapse, and had a fever with vomiting. To her surprise, Ahila survived and after three or four months regained her strength. At present her health is good. She has just had another CD4 count last November and her immune system is now strong again. Her ART treatment and CD4 tests are provided free of cost under India\u2019s NACO programme. NEDAN supports the cost of her travel and that of the staff who accompany her to Guwahati for tests. Subsequent to Ahila\u2019s own diagnosis, her youngest child was also found to have HIV, although so far her health remains good and she is not yet on ART. Ahila has been with WD for three years. During her illness she was very worried about how she would support her family after her recovery.

Unlike the other weavers, most of whom are unmarried, Ahila does not live in the WD dormitory but lives in her own house, built on her father-in-law\u2019s land. She does her weaving in her own home. WD has changed her life in several important ways, and Ahila is very thankful to NEDAN for supporting her. She was weak and they helped her to get to GMC and to recover her health. She now has a regular income and can support her family. While she can not afford everything she wants, she earns enough to buy her food and other basic necessities at the market. She spends everything she makes from weaving. NEDAN also provides a little help for her two youngest children, providing vitamins and other nutrition supplements. Ahila hopes that the family will be better off in a few months when her son starts work. Initially, when her husband died of AIDS and she learned about her own HIV status and that of her youngest daughter, Ahila felt her life was shattered and she was very depressed. She became shy and withdrawn. It was like a bad dream. When other people in the village came to learn about her HIV status, nobody wanted to sit with her, so she had no friends. Things are better now. She is proud to be able to support her children. The WD campus has a nice relaxing atmosphere and there is no discrimination, so Ahila sits, talks and eats together with the other women. Things have also improved in her village and she is treated very well now. People have started to come to visit her at her home and take tea with her. She feels more confident, even feeling that she is not afraid to talk to \u201cbig people\u201d, and is now living a normal life again. Now her aim is to try and develop her skills more. It will be hard, as she is illiterate, but she will try. Ahila\u2019s advice for other women like herself who are living with HIV is that fear is greatest thing to overcome. Women should come forward and be tested [if they suspect that they might be HIV positive] so that they can be treated in time to get a CD4 count and take ART so that they do not develop AIDS. They should not feel shy, but should be confident, as they are not alone and have support from their families and projects such as WD. 45 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises 3.3.3 key outcomes business As a business enterprise, WD has established itself quickly and been able to show impressive profits. WD has been continuously generating net profits since its establishment and, in 2011 so far, it made a net profit of nearly US$10,000 as of the end of July. The business model selected built on existing skills and expertise of both the beneficiary group, as well as the NGO partner, taking a traditional craft and adapting the products to the different markets available at the local, national and international level. At the local level, in Kokrajhar, cloth was produced in traditional colours and styles to meet the existing demand among local women, establishing a market niche through higher quality production and sales through small boutique shops in the town. In fact, some clients added further value to the product through embroidery of additional designs for sale to a more select, and better-off, clientele. At the national level, WD also successfully tapped the international visitor trade, by selling products through shops in tourist locations, such as the Tribes Shop, in Delhi and Gangtok, Sikkim. Participation in trade fairs around India also gave WD\u2019s products important exposure to international visitors and entrepreneurs. This was followed by a number of international orders in the USA, France and UK. Additional international marketing was done through NEDAN\u2019s INGO networks, as well as those of UNDP and other international agencies. In this marketing, WD made very good use of the WE label, as well as the Silk Mark label, and other advantages such as Free Trade and the project\u2019s use of natural and \u201cnon- violent\u201d products (Figure 22). As a result of the successful business plan, WD has been able to generate significant income that has paid for the salaries of over 65 women and eight men employed by the enterprise. The income generated has also paid for the cost of expansion of the WD campus,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "320f4582-eeba-4bbb-b201-1b0ae3ce2c93": {"__data__": {"id_": "320f4582-eeba-4bbb-b201-1b0ae3ce2c93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a60534719be704314b736d0ddc44a53b241d6cbbe7ddb94bdef3ef028cf4693"}, "3": {"node_id": "6520152e-01a6-4a6b-95dd-a8d1b50c9c3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e079a6e7def1aa0fa5ae63263b124dd6f18ba8205bf2e11ca3fb2d8cae36f73f"}}, "hash": "2d77742a5d460efdaf35148c24940374a6e04b82eeb35b157c7f5b965a515139", "text": "providing new buildings and improved facilities for the women, as well as contributing to the training costs (Figure 23).

These achievements resulted in NEDAN receiving the Chief Minister\u2019s Best Community Activity Award in 2010. empowerment As reflected in the case study above of one woman living with HIV who was involved in the project, WD has also had important benefits for the women. Most of the weavers, in particular, have previously experienced varying degrees of trauma in their lives, and in addition to giving them an income, WD provides the women with a safe and supportive environment that can help them regain their self-confidence and self-esteem. Through feeling pride in their work, and that they are making a contribution to support of their families and themselves, the women have felt better able to live normal lives in the community. \u201cbEyonD Economic EmPoWErmEnT, ThE WomEn anD WEalTh ProJEcT in assam ProviDEs a sPacE For Psycho- social sUPPorT ThaT hElPs WomEn To collEcTivEly coPE WiTh ThE inDigniTiEs anD DiscriminaTion ThEy FacE aT homE anD in sociETy as TraFFicKED sUrvivors anD hiv PosiTivE WomEn.\u201d Patrice Coeur-Bizot, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in India Fig. 22: silk mark certificate carried by WD products 46 socio-cultural environment As in other sites under the WWP, it is difficult to assess the outcomes that WD has had in regard to improving the social environment for women living with HIV and other vulnerable women. Through its HIV awareness activities NEDAN has certainly helped to increase understanding of HIV, and the WD project has provided examples that show how women living with HIV can contribute to the community and live and work normally alongside other women, without any risk of transmission. Anecdotal accounts from the women themselves suggest that these efforts may be helping to increase community acceptance and lessen cases of stigma and discrimination. HIV is, however, not the only cause of stigma and discrimination in BTC. Women who have been trafficked, especially involving sex work, are also subject to stigma and discrimination by the community, and there is also a high level of gender-related violence in Assam, as elsewhere in India. These issues will take much longer to address. 3.3.4 main challenges WD has faced a number of important challenges over the duration of the project. Some of these, such as widespread stigma and discrimination in the community against people living with HIV and lack of access to ART and related services, have already been discussed above. The lack of an adequate social protection system for families affected by HIV and other vulnerable groups is also a major challenge. The project itself has faced an important challenge in the form of providing care and support for children living with or affected by HIV. Many of the women coming to WD have families who are brought with them to the campus. In addition to around 12 children affected by HIV, there are around 10 children who are survivors of human trafficking. As WD was primarily set up to cater for the needs of women, the facilities are not designed to provide childcare and the other support needed by these children. WD and NEDAN are currently looking at ways in which this issue can be addressed. The relatively rapid growth of WD has brought challenges regarding production, and meeting large orders. There is now a need for establishment of a natural dyeing centre, as well as additional equipment such as a calendaring machine for pressing silk and cotton yarn and cloth. Also, additional funds are needed to provide a buffer during periods when shipping orders and waiting for remittances to arrive.

For this reason, there is a need to recruit, or train, a marketing manager who can handle the day-to-day follow-up on orders. Owing to the difficulty in identifying suitable people from the Assam region, or those from elsewhere who are willing to move to Kokrajhar, filling this position may prove difficult. 3.3.5 Conclusions The WD project is working well. Bearing in mind the fact that WD has only operated for a little over two years, it appears to have implemented an effective business model that has made money and has shown benefits for both the women involved and the communities they live in. The reasons why WD has worked seem to be because of a combination of building on an existing skill, good timing, the commitment of the women, as well as that of other key stakeholders, strong management support from an experienced NGO and the linkage of the social enterprise with effective community development activities. The WD business model successfully identified a traditional product for which there was both a local market and, with support for improvement of quality and design, an international market as well. The fact that the women already had a strong weaving tradition, with unique aspects such as eri silk, meant that little additional training was needed to develop the basic skills necessary for the business. This meant that training could focus on complementary skills, such as stitching and finishing, design and management. WD was initiated soon after the end of the civil conflict and establishment of the BTC, a process that is continuing as Kokrajhar develops as the capital of Bodoland. This timing meant that WD benefited from support, enthusiasm and commitment of a range of authorities and other stakeholders, not least that of the staff of NEDAN itself, who were prepared to work hard to improve the well-being of their fellow Bodos and other peoples in the region. The women too, as the main beneficiaries of the project, recognized, and were highly appreciative of the opportunity given them to develop a sustainable livelihood. The support of NEDAN has been a crucial factor in the success of WD. First, NEDAN was able to develop the infrastructure for WD, so that the enterprise operated effectively to produce fabric. In addition, NEDAN made the marketing contacts at the national and international level that would result in large orders with high returns. NEDAN also provided the necessary framework and training needed for capacity building of WD\u2019s employees. Finally, NEDAN was able to link the enterprise to a community development approach and programme of activities that would engage the local community and address the basic issues related to the vulnerability of women in this region. The main challenges faced by WD concern the capacity of the enterprise, and of NEDAN, to sustain the good progress that has been made to date. With development of the project and expansion of the scope of the enterprise, there is a need to adjust the management structure accordingly. In future, WD will need to become more independent in its management so that NEDAN can continue its focus on social and community development activities, and reduce time spent on marketing and other activities related to the business side of the project. Recruitment of a marketing officer will be an important step in this direction. 3.3.6 recommendations Given the apparent success of WD to date, and at this relatively early stage of development where the project is still evolving, it is premature to make too many recommendations other than the following suggestions that may help avoid some of the challenges faced by other sites under the WWP: \u2022\ufffd Recruit a marketing officer to help take up some of the marketing burden currently absorbed by NEDAN; \u2022\ufffd Steps should be taken to plan for the eventual separate management of WD so that NEDAN can focus more closely on community development activities and WD can develop more independently as a business. 48 3.4.1 background At the end of 2009, there were an estimated 740,000 people living with HIV in China.

Under the Chinese Government\u2019s \u201cFour Frees and One Care\u201d policy, access to care and treatment has improved significantly, with over 62 percent of people with advanced HIV infection receiving ART.77 People living with HIV in China have suffered heavy economic impacts, resulting from income loss coupled with high expenditure on medicine and health.78 A study carried out in 2009 found that households where there were members living with HIV had to bear a significantly higher socio-economic burden than households not affected by HIV. This resulted from several factors, including: reduced workforce participation of adults at productive age and additional burden on older people and children; extensive discrimination that results in higher income loss than poor health conditions; two times higher medical expenditure of households affected by HIV than those unaffected households; and higher rates of school drop-outs, which is higher among girls and a considerable household burden on women.79 AIDS Care China originated in 2001 when a group of people affected by HIV came together through the Internet. From 2002, ACC started to expand into the cities and counties in four provinces in southern China and build community groups with the support from more than 20 institutions at home and abroad, with over 20,000 people living with HIV receiving services.80 At the time the WWP began, ACC employed 30 full-time staff and managed projects through five offices, including their head office in Guangzhou and one in Kunming. ACC\u2019s steering committee was responsible for approval of budget and major policy decisions. The Women\u2019s Wing of ACC, the Colorful Cloud Yunnan Group, was established in 2005 and consisted of four full-time staff who operated a shelter for women and family members, visited in-patients at the local clinic, and conducted training activities. On the initiation of the WWP, the Women\u2019s Wing of ACC, Colorful Cloud Yunnan, was invited to join the project to start activities in China. Owing to time constraints, the group did not complete the feasibility study in time for the start of the Bangkok training workshop in June 2006. In the course of the workshop, the group initially selected the \u201cHot Dog Club\u201d, a washing and grooming service for pet dogs, as its business activity.

Additional support was provided by a Programme Officer from UNDP China. During the first year (2006-2007), two monitoring and support visits were made by PDA, in November 2006 and March 2007. Further visits were made in October 2007 and February 2008. While PCW initially generated a small profit, this was considerably less than the initial capital investment of USD $5,000. The business faced several important challenges, including high turnover of employees, and lack of clarity between PCW and AIDS Care China regarding roles and business management. By July 2007 only one employee remained and production had slowed. In order to address these issues some changes were made, including recruitment of new employees, better definition of roles and responsibilities, a revision of the work plan, re- start of mass production and better targeting of markets. In November 2007, PCW made a major change from candle production to re-packaging, and, following a market survey, refocusing on small, fancy, inexpensive candles, to be sold as souvenirs rather than for lighting.85 Orders were received for exhibitions, World AIDS Day and other HIV-related activities, at the national and international level. These efforts were ultimately to no avail and the business closed in February 2007. The project enjoyed some initial success, with women gaining skills in quality candle manufacture, sourcing and supply of materials, and marketing. Women involved in the project saw it as an important opportunity for social engagement, which brought increased dignity and pride, greater self-esteem and family support. The regular monthly income offered increased security and a degree of improvement in the quality of their lives. There was also a strong sense of ownership among women involved. According to PCW, the main challenges faced were insufficient marketing skills and difficulty in promotion of products, high rental cost of factory space, and lack of daily follow-up and 81 Quarterly Report Women and Wealth Project, PDA, September 2006. 82 Women and Wealth (China) Project: Integrated Business Plan, Women\u2019s Wing \u2013 AIDS Care China, September 2006. 83 Annual Report 1 June 2006 \u2013 30 June 2007, Women and Wealth Project, PDA, 2007. 84 Annual Report January - December 2008, Women and Wealth Project, PDA, 2008. 85 Ibid. 50 communication with support agencies. Competition was fierce in the candle manufacturing industry, making it difficult to add value to the product. Communication was difficult with external retail dealers, which limited the export market. In China, candle-using culture was much less developed than suggested by initial assessments, and market acceptance of the products was low, with customers more concerned about the appearance and price, rather than the health benefits from natural products. This limited the scope for local sales.86 guangzhou By late 2006, the caf\u00e9 and used bookstore plan developed by the Guangzhou group had been revised to include a website to sell second-hand goods, the Jasmine Online Exchange. On commencement of operations, in early 2007, the business had two employees, a website project manager and a cashier, and shared premises with ACC Guangzhou. The project shared a website with ACC and appeared to be subsidizing ACC\u2019s office rental. Several concerns were noted by PDA soon after commencement of activities, including the limited involvement of women living with HIV in the business, the inappropriate location of the caf\u00e9 (on the 31st Floor), the low volume of donated goods for online sale, the high cost of business registration, the limited target group, low sales levels, insufficient marketing of the business, lack of technical business skills among employees, need to separate the business from the NGO and need for better communication with PDA and UNDP.87 88 A number of suggestions were made by PDA in order to address these issues, covering improvements to the website to make it more accessible and to make a clearer distinction between the NGO and Jasmine Online Exchange, better marketing, improved communication with donors, inventory management and tracking system, staff capacity building and job descriptions (JD), and better alignment of shipping and price schemes for handling with those of competitors.89 While none of the Guangzhou employees attended the Bangkok training in June 2006, the project did show some minor success. This included the establishment of a website with online payment system in a very short period, development of a good donor network, and effective use of market research to identify the most viable business opportunity. Ultimately, however, the business was not a success. The initial capital investment for the Jasmine Online Exchange was US$1,380, but the income generated was not sufficient to recoup these costs.90 3.4.3 key outcomes", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89acebba-adc1-4088-9374-de2c3386b136": {"__data__": {"id_": "89acebba-adc1-4088-9374-de2c3386b136", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89dd5021bac45e4f2b1ed5fa85ccb6e04a43f664e7db12afe79249c7fad32090"}, "3": {"node_id": "3bdbb7ea-a9f8-4df2-a992-4acdb9bd087f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dfaab4b33667f031db475b67fc98a45a69eec867d2685bdb15e1167965de99c"}}, "hash": "9ec781d49938dcd851326205e7e0d393695826f95da727eeb1009b6381d601e1", "text": "The business models proposed by the China groups, including the \u201cHot Dog Club\u201d were quite innovative and, given different circumstances, might have been successful.

The efforts to address difficulties in the situation with WWP activities created many internal problems for the Women\u2019s Wing of ACC, which started to affect its other work.

Unfortunately it is not known whether the skills and experience gained during the project were of benefit to them in securing employment after they left the project. An important issue is the actual number of women who benefited from the project. Again this is difficult to assess, as there are few details available regarding who the women were who participated, and how many there were in all. Nevertheless, it seems that, even accounting for relatively high staff turnover, the total number of women who participated was small. In terms of raising awareness of the impact of HIV and its impact on the socio-economic situation of women, the outcome is difficult to assess owing to the limited duration of activities and the lack of clear indicators. At best it can be hoped that the publicity generated by the project will to some degree raise awareness of HIV among those sections of the business community that were involved or in contact with the project. Also, within the HIV network itself, there is now likely to be a much greater awareness of the issue of livelihood and income generation. 3.4.4 main challenges The main challenges encountered in implementation of the WWP in China were in two main areas, the business side and the management structure. Both the businesses were ambitious, and therefore risky, for different reasons. The Kunming candle-making activities faced stiff competition from well-established competitors, who had strong advantages in regard to business networks, scale, experience and resources. The comparative advantages of the project, the use of healthy raw materials and the social responsibility appeal, were not sufficient to enable the PCW to compete successfully. This may have been due either to a failure to emphasize these points in marketing, or the fact that in China, or at least in this relatively remote Southwest region of the country, concepts related to personal health and social responsibility are still relatively undeveloped in comparison to major urban areas of the country such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

Because of the relatively short time that activities were implemented in China under WWP, it is difficult to make any firm conclusions regarding the business models and possible benefits that might have resulted for women living with HIV. Nevertheless, the China experience furnishes some good lessons to be learned in terms of the overall approach for establishing social enterprises such as WWP. These include the need to ensure that partner organizations are sufficiently well-developed to implement the planned activities as well as to cope with any challenges that may arise in the course of implementation, especially internal management issues. 52 In retrospect, given the limited experience and capacity of ACC in undertaking social enterprise projects, the decision to implement activities in two sites simultaneously may also have been over-ambitious. A more cautious approach, focusing on one site, say Kunming, may have provided a more substantial base for learning and development, before expansion to other sites. 3.4.6 recommendations While the China component of WWP no longer operates, the activities in Kunming and Guangzhou provided some valuable lessons, and from these a number of recommendations can be made regarding the implementation of social enterprises for empowerment of people living with HIV. They include: \u2022\ufffd Identification of potential livelihood or social enterprise activities should take greater account of the number of people, for example positive women, who will benefit directly from activity in the business plan; \u2022\ufffd In planning implementation of social enterprise or livelihood projects such as the WWP, where key stakeholders consist of community groups or organizations that have been established primarily for advocacy purposes, more consideration should be given to the management and support capacity of implementing partners as well as additional local support resources such as government agencies and NGOs; \u2022\ufffd In initial activities, such as workshops and study visits, ensure that there is participation of all the key staff who will be responsible for implementation of project activities; \u2022\ufffd Job descriptions and the management structure should be clearly identified at the start of project activities and staff briefed on these. 53 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises The WWP is an important initiative that has responded to a serious, and neglected, issue in the Asian region, the need for socio-economic empowerment of women living with HIV. To achieve this WWP focused on support for sustainable livelihoods, giving networks of women living with HIV and other vulnerable women an opportunity to identify business opportunities in their local area, develop business plans to exploit these, and provided them with the financial and capacity building support necessary to implement their plans. In response, the participating groups in three countries, Cambodia, China and India, each identified creative and potentially financially viable activities, which they developed into business plans. In implementation of these plans, there were varying levels of success. In all sites, a key achievement of the project was the empowerment of the women living with HIV involved, increasing their confidence and self-esteem and the recognition by their communities that they can make an important contribution to their families and society. While it is hard to measure, the project also helped increase the acceptance of women living with HIV by their communities, through showing that they could make an important contribution to improve their own well-being, as well as benefit society in general. However, overall the number of women living with HIV who benefited directly from the project in terms of employment was low, being about one hundred twenty, if we do not count those who may have been indirectly benefited such as their family and children. The wide variations in the country and socio-cultural context between the WWP sites mean that it is hard to generalize among them. However, comparing the different outcomes and challenges faced, it is possible to identify a number of factors that have been important in contributing to the success or otherwise of the social enterprises concerned. In all sites, WWP created a safe and supportive work environment where workers\u2019 rights and health were prioritized, and there was sufficient flexibility in working time to allow employees time off work for medical appointments and regular breaks. This recognition of workers\u2019 rights, together with an emphasis on \u201cnatural products\u201d, was also an advantage in terms of accessing markets, especially the international tourist market, and the export market to Europe and the USA.

The outcomes also show clearly the potential mutual benefits that can be obtained by linking NGOs or CBOs to business activities. While this was really only successfully achieved with WD, the experience from SLC also indicates that profits generated can be channelled into community development activities, such as infrastructure and micro-credit schemes. At the same time, it is clear that to do so successfully requires local support from a strong NGO with experience in small enterprise management and community development, and initiation of activities should be approached carefully, ensuring first that the business enterprise is well-established and the NGO or CBO has the capacity to support these activities and will not itself be weakened as a result. The capacity of available human resources proved to be one of the biggest challenges faced in all sites, although this was better managed in some than in others. In the drafting synthesis And ConClusions 4 54 of feasibility studies for the sites where the main implementing partner was a people living with HIV network, that is in China, Cambodia and Chennai, there seems to have been an over- estimation of the capacity of the partner to manage the activity, and an underestimation regarding the availability and level of skills necessary to implement the business plan. People living with HIV organizations have developed enormously in the past 10 years, in terms of the size of their membership and skills. However, their primary expertise is in the area of advocacy, not management of businesses, and while many of their members have experience in the private sector, they lack specialized skills in relevant areas such as design, finance and marketing. While this was addressed to some extent by training, it could not really compensate for formal education and experience, and was further compromised by staff turnover. It is notable that the most successful site, WD, was the only one where there was a local NGO with a strong community development focus to provide support for activities. Management is an area that reflects the capacity of the main implementing partners. Where a WWP partner was less experienced, or had its own internal problems, then the response to the challenges that arose in implementation was weak or inadequate. Conversely, strong and experienced partners were able to help address difficulties encountered. Thus, the lack of experience and instability within PCW was probably the main reason for its closure, while the experience of NEDAN has been the main reason for WD\u2019s success. Lack of clarity in the relationship between networks of women living with HIV and larger people living with HIV networks, or instability within these groups, was an additional factor that affected implementation of business models. The establishment of well-defined management structures can help compensate for the lack of experience, and reduce the burden on the partner. This was especially important when the organizational structure was unclear, without well-defined staff job descriptions, organograms and accountability, or was not implemented, as was the case in SLC and MDSF. Social enterprises, by definition, bring together civil society and the business world, both of which have quite different perspectives and motivations. For this reason, from the outset, one of the challenges of the WWP was how this could be accommodated. In fact, all sites faced the challenge of making a shift from an NGO or CBO perspective to a more business- like approach and, while some projects have coped better than others, it remains an area that needs to be addressed. In the case of MDSF and SLC, for the businesses to be successful, a broader and more proactive approach to marketing needs to be adopted, involving approaches to the business sector and government agencies, rather than reliance only on the UN and INGO sector as the main point of access to markets. Also, in the long term, changes in management structures are needed, to ensure greater autonomy in financial arrangements and human resources, with a view to eventual separation of the business activities from those of the NGO or CBO. Even in the case of WD, where marketing seems to have been more successful than in the other sites, the point has now been reached where consideration must be given to increasing the autonomy of the business operation in terms of its management and for greater empowerment of the women. A critical factor in development of WWP was the timeframe for activities. Partners felt strongly that for this type of project to be successful,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da0241d2-37c6-48ea-9172-9127afa376dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "da0241d2-37c6-48ea-9172-9127afa376dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6b8fa101a01de95830ea1ccc0b24b8dd8aff9bcac3f6b2a91d603c8e8ec3772"}}, "hash": "e6b8fa101a01de95830ea1ccc0b24b8dd8aff9bcac3f6b2a91d603c8e8ec3772", "text": "a longer-term commitment, of at least four to five years is necessary. While WWP did eventually run to this length, partners did not know this at the outset, and believed that WWP would be of much shorter duration, which may have led to insecurity and a lack of full commitment among beneficiaries. While almost all development projects operate on annual or, at most, biannual funding cycles, a long- term plan incorporating a longer time frame of five, or at least three, years with annual approval subject to availability of funds, would have helped increase the sense of security and commitment among partners and enabled better planning for learning and capacity building activities within the project. This might have helped in development of a system for sourcing of materials and services from within the project and in better organization of the knowledge management process in the closing phase of the project, helping the networks of women living with HIV involved assess and increase their ownership of the project outcomes, and summarize the key lessons for sharing more widely. Again, however, 55 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises given the reality of the funding cycle, this was a limiting factor beyond the control of the project. Also, importantly, WWP was created as a pilot programme, so when planned it was not known how much time would be needed for development of the activities. Another missed opportunity for learning and support seems to have been the sourcing of materials and services from within the project. While this was done to a limited extent, such as in the design of the logos for MDSF and WD as well as the WE logo and WWP brochure for other WWP groups by SLC, in theory at least, the WWP could have provided an opportunity to do more on a larger scale, including, for example, use of WD cloth for MDSF products. While this was in fact considered during implementation of the project, it was found that the high cost of shipping (particularly cotton which is heavy and possibility of high customs duties) and other materials, in particular silk, would not be affordable. Possibly, with more time and research, ways could have been found around this problem, but it does serve as an important lesson for future enterprises of this kind. An additional feature of the project design that could have been improved is the incorporation of indicators for some of the expected outcomes. In particular, the lack of defined indicators for the second and third objectives of WWP, related to empowerment of the women and improvement in the social environment, meant that the outcomes in these areas proved difficult to assess. Better definition of the types of benefits that could have been expected under the first objective, for example in terms of numbers of women receiving direct or indirect support from the social enterprises, would also have strengthened the design and improved the guidance for selection of business models. Finally, an issue that arose in relation to the design of WWP is that of the beneficiary group. As originally conceived, WWP was designed to empower women living with HIV. However in the course of implementation, the beneficiary group was widened, in particular with WD in Assam, to include other vulnerable women and girls, and even a small number of young men. In the course of the assessment, a number of stakeholders commented that the narrow focus on women living with HIV limited its value, and consideration should be given to broadening the beneficiary focus of the project to include a greater emphasis on vulnerable and most at risk girls and women, and in fact, for empowerment of women to be truly successful there must be involvement of male partners. This issue will be discussed further in the accompanying review of different approaches to empowerment and livelihood support for people living with HIV. 4.1. lessons learned A number of important lessons can be learned from the implementation of the WWP from its commencement in 2006 up until the present: \u2022\ufffd When given the opportunity, with technical and financial support, women living with HIV can identify viable business opportunities, and design and implement business models to exploit them; \u2022\ufffd In order for the social enterprises developed by women living with HIV and other vulnerable women to be sustainable, strong and on-going technical support is needed from people or organizations with experience in social enterprise and community development; \u2022\ufffd Having an understanding of the situation faced by people living with HIV and expertise in areas such as advocacy, as exemplified by people", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07f91d88-9299-4290-8b6f-5a258a59ef3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "07f91d88-9299-4290-8b6f-5a258a59ef3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Women and Wealth Project - Empowering Positive Women through Social Enterprises: Results Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b54e77a6da09621e97011a5a9ceff710432e560e909b66673f9aab59ef433cca"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d9307b3-8053-4f2b-955b-8ccdfad54792", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-wealth-project-empowering-positive-women-through-social-enterprises-results-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "debb6adcf8af21fde4b41c4f34b4dd5f0adc9ccbc6627957aba982f479487c74"}}, "hash": "810ac06df010aab38d5fdf2d7c9c89cb65d5aab0bf9aa6df4805aa0d85dcafd6", "text": "living with HIV networks, does not necessarily translate into capacity to provide strong support for social enterprises run by women living with HIV; \u2022\ufffd On-the-job training can only go so far in substituting for education and experience; \u2022\ufffd A cautious approach should be taken to expansion, pending consolidation of the business enterprise; 56 \u2022\ufffd In order to gain full commitment of beneficiaries, from the onset development of social enterprises should be based on a bottom-up approach; \u2022\ufffd The annual or biannual funding cycle may have limited the potential of strong commitment among participating women and partners due to perceived lack of long-term security; and \u2022\ufffd Strong management and marketing are needed for the businesses. This needs to involve people with expertise in business and marketing. 4.2. future steps In the region, there remain many women living with HIV who face severe crises in their lives due to the impact of HIV. For this reason, the WWP, as one of the few initiatives that has sought to address this situation in a systematic way, continues to be important, both in terms of the activities still in place, as well as for the lessons it has generated that will help women living with HIV elsewhere in the region. The most effective ways in which this issue can be addressed are considered in a separate report; however, in relation to the activities supported under WWP, there are several concrete steps that can be taken to move forward in order to consolidate achievements and ensure that the lessons are shared: \u2022\ufffd If MDSF and SLC are to survive and their activities sustained, then both enterprises must be strengthened. In both cases the most important actions that need to be taken are (1) to put in place a strong management structure that defines clearly the relationship with the people living with HIV networks, CCW and PWN+ respectively, with provision for the sufficient degree of autonomy necessary for the businesses to operate effectively and agreement on the use of income generated; and (2) to strengthen the marketing of products and services, through recruitment of personnel with skills and experience in marketing and, at the same time, development of a clear marketing strategy; \u2022\ufffd In both Phnom Penh and Chennai, it is essential that there be planning for on-going technical support for the social enterprises. Local NGOs need to be identified that have skills and experience in social enterprise and community development and good relationships with people living with HIV networks, which can help provide such support; \u2022\ufffd The lessons-learned from the WWP should be widely disseminated and effectively used to facilitate dialogue with governments, donors, and NGOs/CBOs considering or implementing other people living with HIV livelihoods projects in the region. 57 The Women and Wealth Project: Empowering positive women through social enterprises APN+, 2009: A long walk \u2013 Challenges to women\u2019s access to HIV services in Asia, Women\u2019s Working Group of APN+.

The economic crisis will have severe consequences for employment and poverty in the region as it often pushes out of the labor market the most vulnerable, such as migrants. Migrant workers vulnerabilities to HIV will likely be exacerbated with increasing deterioration of their economic opportunities.

The crisis could result in reductions in public expenditures on prevention, care and treatment programs all of which could increase HIV prevalence and shorten the life span of PLHIV. Due to the crisis, some migrants\u2019 risk behaviors may increase; faced with reduced opportunities they may enter the sex industry. Those migrants who are already HIV positive may be less likely to aff ord treatment or care. To project the possible implications of the current crisis, this research has reviewed the evidence on how the 1997 Asian economic crisis aff ected migrants and their families and increased the incidence of HIV infection; It also analyzes the information available on the current crisis, including migration trends, the economic sectors most aff ected, case studies of migrants in the region and how the fi nancial crisis has aff ected them and their health status so far. The paper concludes by proposing potential scenarios that may result from recent economic forces, with attention given to early warning systems to allow governments, civil society and the international community to take action. Recommendations for appropriate measures to address these scenarios conclude the paper. Evidence from the 1997-1999 fi nancial crisis shows that migrants faced increased vulnerability and that many undocumented migrants moved into the informal economy. Social protection schemes in the region were largely non-existent except for some more developed countries that had unemployment schemes covering formal economy workers. These, and programs developed in response to the crisis to aid displaced workers, were unlikely to reach migrant workers. Notably, there is evidence that HIV risks increased during the crisis, with increases in the number of sex workers in less formal settings and in traffi cking for commercial sex work. These risks occurred at the same time that health budgets and funding for HIV prevention programs were being cut. While the full implications of the current crisis are still unknown, there are indications that many of the same patterns are emerging. Many foreign workers in manufacturing and construction have been laid off in the region and there have been government moves to stop issuing work permits and crack down on undocumented migrants. There are fears that female migrants who lose their jobs may move into sex work to survive; in Cambodia for example, 70,000 garment workers, mostly female, have lost their jobs since the crisis began. Two recent studies with sex workers in Cambodia have found that 58% entered into sex work in the wake of the fi nancial crisis and 19% of these women were former garment sector workers. Migrants are facing much higher expenses and are less able to aff ord health care, especially those who are living with HIV The paper concludes with policy recommendations to ensure migrants have adequate access to health care and HIV services throughout the migration cycle during times of economic downturn. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The current global recession has had severe consequences for employment and poverty reduction in Southeast Asia. Though the extent of the crisis cannot yet be known, the large population of migrant workers in the region is in a particularly vulnerable position, for several reasons. First, migrant workers1 \u2014both internal and external\u2014tend to be concentrated in the economic sectors most aff ected by the crisis, which include export-led manufacturing, tourism, and construction. Many thousands of jobs have been lost in these sectors since the latter half of 2008; the World Bank estimates unemployment at 24 million for the East Asia and Pacifi c region as a whole in January 2009, about one million higher than one year earlier.2 Second, while migrants often fi nd themselves in exploitative situations\u2014earning less than the legal minimum wage and being unable to claim basic workers\u2019 rights\u2014they are even more susceptible to exploitation and worsened labor conditions under economic crisis. The threat of job loss and even deportation may be used to cut worker benefi ts, wages and working hours. This is especially true for the large number of workers who are projected to move from the formal to the informal labor market and from documented to undocumented status as a result of the crisis. Finally, the combination of social, cultural, linguistic, legal and behavioral barriers that aff ect migrants\u2019 access to information and to prevention, health and social services under the best economic times are likely to worsen during the economic crisis. While government responses to the crisis may benefi t from lessons learned during the previous Asian fi nancial crisis of the late 1990s, these policies tend to favor economic growth stimulation and social safety nets for citizens over foreign workers.

Moreover, as happened in the last crisis, receiving countries are already enacting policies to restrict foreign workers, by freezing work permits, retrenching foreign workers fi rst and cracking down on undocumented foreigners. In Malaysia, nearly 7,000 foreign workers have been retrenched while in Indonesia 250,000 migrants have reportedly returned because of the crisis. Fears have been raised also of worsened work and living conditions for foreign workers, as their position to advocate for fair wages and benefi ts weakens. Moreover, vulnerabilities to HIV faced by migrant workers and mobile populations will likely be exacerbated with increasing deterioration of their economic opportunities and health conditions. This is not because migration leads to risk behavior per se, but because the conditions under which people migrate and work puts them at risk.3 It should be remembered also that this fi nancial collapse occurred in the midst of sky-rocketing food and fuel prices worldwide, with food prices rising 66% globally from mid-2005 to August 2008.4 Families of migrants are aff ected as well, as remittances are cut off and migrants return to rural areas. Job loss and economic vulnerability\u2014both for the migrants and for their families at home who depend on their remittances\u2014may lead to entrance into sex work, whether voluntarily or through traffi cking. This is particularly of concern because many of the job losses in the region have been in the export- led manufacturing sector, which largely employs women. Recent evidence from Cambodia (reported in detail below), where large numbers of internal migrant women have been laid off from the garment sector, shows that there is a link between the current crisis and entry into sex work.5 As the crisis impacts public expenditures on prevention, care and treatment programs, outcomes such as increased HIV prevalence and increased morbidity for PLHIV are of increasing concern. Migrants are generally underserved by HIV prevention programs, as there are language and cultural barriers to their access. Those programs that do target migrants\u2014through the formal workplace or through NGOs\u2014are likely to be aff ected by the current crisis. PLHIV 1 Throughout the paper \u201cmobile populations\u201d is used as a general term to refer to \u201cthose who move from one place to another, temporarily, season- ally or permanently for either voluntary or involuntary reasons\u201d (FHI 2006 p. 1). \u201cMigrant\u201d refers to those who take up residence in a place for an extended period of time. Migrants may be internal migrants, who move within their country of origin, or external migrants who move to a foreign country (FHI 2006). 2 World Bank 2009b. 3 UNRTF 2008. 4 IMF 2008. 5 UNIAP 2009. 1 INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF PROBLEM migrants who receive care and support from their families or who are served by government programs are also in a vulnerable position. A recent World Bank/UNAIDS study concludes that a substantial number of countries will be forced to cut their programs, as they are dependent on external sources of support that will be reduced in the current crisis. As discussed further below, migrants to Thailand who receive treatment will lose access if they lose their jobs and legal status. For those in treatment, interruptions or barriers to access in treatment can be lethal; transmission risks also increase as those who stop treatment become much more infectious.6 The objective of this paper is to give an overview of the potential impact of the current economic and financial crisis on migrants and mobile populations in the Southeast Asian region. It also seeks to foresee possible negative implications accessing health services including HIV and probable increases in unsafe mobility with accompanying increases in the risks and vulnerabilities for health of people on the move, including HIV transmission. To project the possible implications of the current crisis, this paper reviews the evidence on how the 1997-99 Asian financial crisis affected migrants and the social policies put in place to address that crisis. It presents information available to date on the current crisis and migration, including an overview of the economic sectors most affected where available, as well as potential increased risks to HIV and health in general. Where possible, the paper includes case studies of migrants in the region and how the financial crisis has affected them and their health status. The paper concludes with recommendations for appropriate measures to address the challenges that the crisis is posing to migrant\u2019s access to HIV services and health care. 6 World Bank/UNAIDS 2009. 2 While the full impact of the current crisis will probably not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9677b34-4235-42be-956d-c9297f182358": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9677b34-4235-42be-956d-c9297f182358", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e13a159630f854297b53630a1df684e956d7775d46e6e21c030b4f18ec93b6ed"}, "3": {"node_id": "efc9f9fc-12df-4535-9fb7-40a556d5775b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ede4298b90f4666ce3e80bad95e3d147a53a29c3a0949fe8e3c39ff39dc324e"}}, "hash": "00077a9d877a0e44b423c32915e738aa19a76ebe155ba49c237042900919292f", "text": "be known until several years after economic recovery, some insight may be gained by reviewing previous analysis of the 1997-99 fi nancial crisis, its impact on migrants and their health risks, and the government and civil response, with particular attention to the impact on HIV/AIDS programs. The 1997-1999 crisis was centered in Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It began in mid-1997 when Thailand\u2019s stock market and asset markets collapsed due to huge external debt and increasing defi cits. The devaluation of the baht and loss of investor confi dence had a ripple eff ect throughout the region, leading to many bank failures and stock market free-falls.7 While the economic freefall was dramatic, most economies recovered by 1999; Thailand, however, was slower to recover and did not return to previous growth levels until 2001. The impact of the crisis on employment is diffi cult to estimate, since many workers who lost jobs moved out of the formal labor market into the informal economy; for this reason unemployment fi gures do not refl ect the percentage who become underemployed or who are no longer refl ected in offi cial statistics. Most sources say that unemployment doubled during the crisis. The economic sectors most aff ected during the 1997-1999 crisis were construction (which was sharply aff ected by the loss of capital) and manufacturing; as money tightened, trade and commerce also contracted. Figure 1 shows the loss in employment by sector from 1997-98 in Malaysia and Thailand. Though employment contracted only 2.9% in Malaysia in this period, more than half of reported retrenchments in 1998 were in manufacturing, both for national and foreign workers; with construction, trade and tourism sectors also strongly aff ected. However, the reported numbers of job losses greatly underreported the number of workers in the informal economy who lost jobs, especially in the agricultural sector (such as plantation jobs) and the construction sector.8 In Singapore manufacturing and commerce were most strongly aff ected,9 and these two sectors were also the most sharply aff ected in Thailand. In Thailand however there is evidence that the service sector absorbed about 19% of employment losses in other sectors.10 Source: Chalamwong 2000; Kassim 2000. Most notably, after decades of decline, poverty rates increased in countries where the economy had been booming. In 7 OECD 2000; Skeldon 2004; UNFPA 1998. 8 Kassim 2000 9 Yap 2000. 10 Knowles et al. 1999. 3 BACKGROUND: THE 1997 ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS Thailand for example poverty fell from 32.6% in 1988 to 11.4% in 1996, but increased to 12.9% in 199811; in Indonesia the rate went from 10.1% to 14.1% from 1997 to 1998 according to the World Bank.12 Increases in poverty reflect in part the inability of the informal economy and the agricultural sector to absorb displaced workers. Evidence indicates that the rise in poverty in the region was associated with increasing risks of HIV. A 1998 UNFPA study in four Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand) concluded that an increased number of women moved into commercial sex work as a result of the crisis.13 At the same time, a decline in demand for sex work due to the crisis lowered their bargaining power to negotiate condom use. A Thai survey also found an increase in the supply of formal sex establishments, but a decrease in demand in terms of fewer customers\u2014which may mean that sex work was shifting to less formal establishments and to \u201cindirect\u201d sex workers, including migrant workers from nearby countries.14 Trafficking, including of young girls, was also reported to increase during this period. A study of the China-Burma border area found that, at the peak of the economic crisis, legitimate trade had completely disappeared while the trade in narcotics and trafficking of young girls for the sex trade was thriving.15 The loss of construction jobs along the border particularly affected young girls from ethnic minority groups who had no prospects for earning in Burma, making them particularly vulnerable to the sex trade. Fighting along the Thai border further contributed to the displacement of workers there. Impact on migration streams Internal migration flows greatly increased during the 1997-99 economic crisis, with a reversal of the prevailing pattern of rural-urban migration as migrants losing jobs in urban and peri-urban areas returned home.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efc9f9fc-12df-4535-9fb7-40a556d5775b": {"__data__": {"id_": "efc9f9fc-12df-4535-9fb7-40a556d5775b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e13a159630f854297b53630a1df684e956d7775d46e6e21c030b4f18ec93b6ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9677b34-4235-42be-956d-c9297f182358", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00077a9d877a0e44b423c32915e738aa19a76ebe155ba49c237042900919292f"}}, "hash": "5ede4298b90f4666ce3e80bad95e3d147a53a29c3a0949fe8e3c39ff39dc324e", "text": "In Thailand, where manufacturing and construction were particularly hard-hit, it was estimated that two-thirds of the unemployed were rural migrants; return migration to rural areas increased four-fold as 75% of these returned home.

The impact of the 1997-99 crisis on international migration is difficult to estimate, as it affected different countries and different sectors in different ways. Figure 2, using statistics compiled by Skeldon (2004) from official sources, shows a drop in migrant numbers in South Korea in 1998 and Malaysia in 1999-2000; while in Thailand the numbers were stable or even continued to increase. In Indonesia, the outflow of workers to other countries fell by more than half from 1996 to 1997 (from over 500,000 to less than 250,000).16 However, estimating the number of migrants who left these countries as a result of the crisis is difficult, since so many migrants were undocumented. The crisis occurred at a time where labor flows to the key destination countries in the region\u2014Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia\u2014were high and increasing.17 However, with the onset of the crisis several countries attempted to restrict migrant numbers by instituting policies to expel foreign workers; in Malaysia and Singapore manufacturing jobs employing foreign labor were greatly cut. Despite these policies, during the crisis the number of foreign workers in the informal economy remained at stable numbers or even increased during the period, as local workers, even though facing unemployment, were unwilling to undertake the 3D jobs \u2013 those that are dirty, difficult and dangerous. Skeldon (2004) concludes that policies to expel foreign workers had no net dramatic effect on migration during this time period. Further, many employers over reacted to the crisis cutting their workforce at the start of the crisis, only to take back migrant workers as they found themselves with labor shortages. Abella (2000) maintains that expelling the workers was also not cost effective for Malaysia as they 11 NESDB 1999. 12 Knowles et al. 1999. 13 UNFPA 1998. 14 Pothisiri et al. 1998; Ainsworth et al. 2003, Punpanich et al. 2004. 15 Feingold 1998. 16 Thetis 2009. 17 Skeldon 1999. 4 had a labor defi cit when the economy recovered. Figure 2: Offi cial estimates of the total number of foreign workers in Asian economies, 1996-2000 Source: Adapted from Skeldon 2004, p. 64. Social safety nets in the 1997-1999 crisis Social protection issues had not been a high priority for countries in the region when the 1997-1999 crisis hit; economies had been booming, unemployment was low and poverty rates had been dropping in the previous decades. In fact, social sector programs were cut in many countries due to governments not seeing the need for them. Most countries did not have any unemployment benefi t schemes, though several (including Malaysia and the Philippines) had some form of social security scheme with modest benefi ts upon retirement for those who worked in the formal economy.18 In Singapore and South Korea, legal skilled foreign workers were also covered by the social security scheme.19 Such benefi ts were also in theory available to legal migrants in Malaysia, including housing, medical benefi ts and insurance, though in practice few workers were covered by them.20 In a review of policies protecting temporary migrant workers during the crisis, Abella (2000) maintains that unemployment insurance schemes would have prevented the relocation of thousands of workers in Malaysia, who then would have been available when needed when the economy recovered. Although Skeldon (1999) showed that the overall net impact of the crisis on migration was minimal, Abella (2000) points out that the fact that large numbers of migrants shifted from legal to undocumented status made the crisis particularly diffi cult to address, both in terms of dealing with social protection issues and with managing the work force. Civil society organizations in the region, many of which were formed to serve poor and vulnerable populations, were often also negatively aff ected by the crisis. A UNFPA assessment (1998) found that monitoring of health needs by governments also lacked funding due to the economic downturn, so that needs were not being tracked, much less met. Thus the family was the main safety net for migrants; those who could no longer make enough money to survive in their destination countries were forced to return home. For many however, the preference was to remain in the 18 UNFPA 1998. 19 Abella 2000. 20 Kassim 2000. 5 destination country, as there were even fewer income-generating opportunities at home. Employers sometimes exploited this by cutting wages as their profits dropped; illegal migrants were especially vulnerable to worsened employment conditions.

Impact of the crisis on HIV/AIDS programs The financial crisis affected government expenditures on HIV prevention as well. In Thailand government expenditures on the national AIDS program were cut by 28%, and the number of free condoms distributed by the government was cut by 50% from 1996-99.21 Funding for treatment programs, including ARVs and treatment of opportunistic infections, was also significantly scaled back.22 Pothisiri et al.\u2019s (1998) analysis of how the 1997-1999 crisis affected public funding for HIV shows how changes in costs, spending and needs interact. As public funding for programs is cut, both preventive programs and treatment programs are affected. At the same time, the economic crisis affects private household purchasing power and employer prevention programs, leading to increases in risky sex behavior. These multiple channels can , the life span of PLHIV is shortened and HIV prevalence increases. The Pothisiri et al. study documented the cuts in national program budgets and also interviewed program staff to get their views of how these cuts impacted the programs. During the crisis period, provincial hospitals could not meet the demands for care and treatment. It should be remembered that Thailand has been viewed as one of the few countries \u201cin which there is strong evidence that public policy has had an impact on reducing the spread of the AIDS epidemic on a national scale.\u201d (Ainsworth et al. 2003, p.13). Thus the cuts in government funding risked the loss of momentum in the efforts to promote 100% condom use and to meet the care, support and treatment needs of PLHIV. External funding was also cut to AIDS programs in the region due to the financial crisis. In summary, the 1997-1999 crisis had a short-lived yet severe effect on migrants in the region. Inequality increased, and migrants faced increased vulnerability with increasing numbers of undocumented migrants who moved into the informal economy. While some governments instituted national policies to deport foreign workers and cut work permits, ultimately they had to take back those workers because of severe labour shortage. . Social protection schemes in the region were largely non-existent except for some more developed countries that had unemployment schemes covering formal economy workers. These, and programs developed in response to the crisis to aid displaced workers, were unlikely to reach migrant workers. Notably, there is evidence that HIV risks increased during the crisis, with increases in the number of sex workers in less formal settings and in trafficking for commercial sex work. These risks occurred at the same time that health budgets and funding for HIV prevention programs were being cut. 21 Punpanich et al. 2004. 22 Pothisiri et al. 1998. 6 How the current crisis appears to be less severe than the 1997-99 crisis: \u2022 The epicentre of the 1997 crisis was in Asia; it was much deeper and growth losses were more severe \u2022 Asia has learned from the past crisis: macroeconomic foundations are better, many countries have large reserves and the ability to fi nance stimulus packages \u2022 Several countries have had a quick response to the crisis by initiating economic stimulus packages, possibly because of these large reserves How the current crisis may have a more severe impact than the 1997-99 crisis \u2022 It is a global crisis. Although growth losses in Asia are lower, it will be more diffi cult to overcome the crisis. \u2022 Export-led growth which lifted Asia out of the crisis in 1998 is more diffi cult this time; reduced demand in the US and Europe has hit this sector hardest \u2022 It is a multiple crisis: food, fuel, fi nance. Too many crises within a short time\u2014stressed economies \u201cThis crisis is di\ufb00 erent\u201d (adapted from Steinmayer 2009) 7 THE CURRENT CRISIS Several factors make the current economic crisis in the region very diff erent in character from that of the 1997-1999 crisis. For one, the current crisis is a global one that did not begin in Asia; rather, the region is mainly aff ected through the ripple eff ect of the collapse of the U.S. credit and banking system. The resulting liquidity shortage led to a decline in Asian investments, and in global equity markets. Though Asian economies were less aff ected by the decline in fi nancial markets than the US and Europe, the subsequent decline in demand for Asian goods in these countries has hit the export-led region hard.23 Overall economic growth in Asia declined from 8.8% in 2007 to 5.8% in 2008, with forecasts for a bigger drop in 2009.24 Exports dropped by more than 20% in the fourth quarter of 2008 for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "024eed70-75b1-4ad8-b086-a6bf1721e256": {"__data__": {"id_": "024eed70-75b1-4ad8-b086-a6bf1721e256", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed27f9143c9f9ae2499028ed306433ba89831aa16dc288491de0cdc62f4d6a5"}}, "hash": "7ed27f9143c9f9ae2499028ed306433ba89831aa16dc288491de0cdc62f4d6a5", "text": "region.25 Moreover, unlike the 1997-1999 crisis, the fact that the recession has had a global reach means that the Asian region is unlikely to bounce back as quickly as it did last time.26 This fi nancial collapse has occurred in the midst of sky-rocketing food and fuel prices worldwide. Food prices rose 65.7% globally from mid-2005 to August 2008.27 Projections on how these increases aff ect the poor in developing countries show that increases in the poverty headcount are likely to be severe, eliminating much of the progress in poverty reduction that has been made in recent years. Moreover, the favorable eff ect of higher prices on rural food producers is projected by several studies to be minimal.28 Unemployment in the formal economy has risen sharply as a result of this global recession. The World Bank estimates unemployment at 24 million for the East Asia and Pacifi c region as a whole in January 2009, about one million higher than one year earlier.29 As there is a time lag before export declines lead to worker layoff s, these numbers could go higher. The sector to be most directly aff ected by the crisis is construction, as aff ected by the decline in foreign investment and credit, and manufacturing, as aff ected by the decline in consumer demand in the U.S. and Europe. With regard to the latter, the textile/garment, electronic, automobile and electrical machinery industries dropped dramatically.30 Tourism is also severely aff ected. The impact of these sectoral declines on employment varies however. While in construction the loss of jobs is severe, in manufacturing and tourism employers are more likely to cut hours rather than workers at least in the short run. The gender impact of these changes is uneven; as seen in the box, many 23 Steinmayer 2009. 24 EIU 2009. 25 Steinmayer 2009. 26 World Bank 2009. 27 IMF 2008. 28 ADB 2008a, 2008b, Ivanic & Martin 2008, Valero-Gil & Valero 2008. 29 World Bank 2009b. 30 Mangahas 2009, Steinmayer 2009. of the jobs aff ected mainly employ women. The World Bank projects that the health impact of the crisis is likely to be widespread, as currency devaluations lead to higher drug prices, donor funding declines and government programs are cut. However, they maintain that governments are in better fi scal shape to handle increased health expenditures than they were during the previous crisis.31 31 World Bank 2009c.

The World Bank reports that 25 million internal migrant workers in China were laid off and returned to rural areas by early 2009. In general for the region however, the proportion of workers returning to rural areas is projected to be smaller than that in the 1997-1999 crisis, as continued urbanization means that fewer have continued economic ties to rural areas. For this reason, the safety net of the rural family that formerly existed is seen to be weakened.32 Foreign workers are heavily concentrated in the sectors aff ected by the current fi nancial crisis. Figure 3, using data compiled by Mangahas (2009), shows the composition of foreign workers by sector in four receiving countries. At least half of the offi cial foreign workforce is concentrated in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The degree to which the informal economy can absorb workers retrenched from these sectors is not yet known, although this is seen to be an important safety net", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e932aa31-ad30-4b9c-9a5c-77cdc48d5a7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e932aa31-ad30-4b9c-9a5c-77cdc48d5a7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "522d1bbb0a7c4e3b418b14e65119b283006d6e213ba7aaf807f109281d50c216"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bc80890-f3e4-4976-9f12-5327c8f8bd04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c4d336aace05ebe336291b80ae75c28ac03d02f1a63669f125eff2a84aa5c98"}}, "hash": "14c564b111b4f9854ba58b49c79ac6d09b075257a8c70c9e9c507a6b7320c559", "text": "for these workers. Migrant workers in the Gulf States, which include a large concentration of South Asian migrants as well as workers from the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia, are also expected to signifi cantly decrease, particularly those working in the construction industry.33 The domestic sector, which employs many women in the Gulf countries, is not expected to lose large numbers of workers in the current crisis. However the agricultural sector, which employs large numbers of foreign workers in Malaysia and Thailand, is expected to lose large numbers of jobs.34 Figure 3: Foreign Workers by Sector of Employment in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan 31 33 36 50 20 16 15 3 24 11 14 45 25 16 24 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Singapore Thailand Malaysia Taiwan* Agriculture Manufacturing Construction Domestic Work Services Others Source: Mangahas 2009, drawn from government sources. Little data is available at this time about the numbers of foreign workers who have returned to their home countries since the crisis began. Abella and Ducanes (2009) found that the number of contract workers leaving the Philippines increased 28% in 2008 over the previous year, with an average of 3,772 documented workers leaving the country daily. Only about 4,000 Filipino workers total were seen to have returned in early 2009. 32 World Bank 2009b. 33 Tharoor 2009. 34 Abella and Ducanes 2009. 9 IMPACT ON MIGRANT STREAMS AND REMITTANCES While on a global basis remittances were not seen to be strongly aff ected in the beginning of the recession\u2014even with the high food and fuel prices seen in 2007-2008\u2014analysts now expect that the growth in remittances will decline during the current sharp downturn. This is in contrast to double-digit growth in remittances in recent years. Ratha and Mohapatra (2009) explain how remittances are particularly resilient to economic crisis since their source is the cumulative fl ow of migrants over time, not just new migrants; also, migrants tend to continue to remit even when they face losses in income. The World Bank however predicts an overall drop in remittances globally from 5.0-8.2% in 2009, with a slightly lower decline of 4.2-7.5% in Asia and the Pacifi c.35 For the Philippines, remittances are expected to continue to grow, though the growth is expected to drop from 16% in 2002-2008 to only 3-6% in 2009.36 35 World Bank 2009b 36 Abella and Ducanes 2009. 10 Many of the economic forces that came into play in the previous economic crisis are likely to re-emerge in the current one. Jobs normally held by migrants are being lost in destination countries at the same time that push factors are exacerbated in sending countries. Foreign workers are often stigmatized due to resentment among citizens, even though many of them do jobs that are unacceptable to citizens. Migrants are subject to increased exploitation and vulnerability as they attempt to hold on to their jobs in the formal economy, even with deteriorating working conditions, or attempt to move into the informal economy and possibly shift from documented to undocumented status. Women are expected to be more severely aff ected, both because they have lower pay and because they may be dependent on male migrants for remittances. For families at home, loss of remittances leads to declining food security and health status, and a lessened ability for children to pursue education. Depending on the length of time that the crisis persists, the loss of suffi cient nutrition can impact an entire generation. Migrants also face potential general including occupational health risks when they move into \u201c3D\u2019 (dirty, diffi cult and dangerous) jobs. Illegal, undocumented migrants are normally not able to seek health care in foreign countries; Finally, mobility itself, due to the disruption in familiar surroundings and loss of support systems, can have negative health impacts.37 Undocumented migrants, and those working in the informal economy, are also less likely to be exposed to health and HIV prevention programs or to be reachable by such programs. Examples of programs inaccessible to these workers include pre-departure mandatory programs for registered migrants (as in the Philippines), workplace prevention programs based at more formal workplaces, and community-based programs in well-established migrant communities. It should be remembered also that global HIV prevention programs are expected to face funding cuts in the face of the fi nancial crisis, likely aff ecting smaller and more specialized programs fi rst.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bc80890-f3e4-4976-9f12-5327c8f8bd04": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bc80890-f3e4-4976-9f12-5327c8f8bd04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "522d1bbb0a7c4e3b418b14e65119b283006d6e213ba7aaf807f109281d50c216"}, "2": {"node_id": "e932aa31-ad30-4b9c-9a5c-77cdc48d5a7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14c564b111b4f9854ba58b49c79ac6d09b075257a8c70c9e9c507a6b7320c559"}}, "hash": "1c4d336aace05ebe336291b80ae75c28ac03d02f1a63669f125eff2a84aa5c98", "text": "The World Bank/UNAIDS study fi nds that prevention programs are especially under threat under the current crisis, especially those that serve populations at higher risk because they are politically easy to cut.38 Testing programs are generally not combined", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37439a78-d709-413b-b4cc-13a278053ed7": {"__data__": {"id_": "37439a78-d709-413b-b4cc-13a278053ed7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd9d3e82b932a9ebab29141fc12b650ee56df30f7f1c51fe6706a7f52b315189"}}, "hash": "dd9d3e82b932a9ebab29141fc12b650ee56df30f7f1c51fe6706a7f52b315189", "text": "with counseling and referral for migrants.

She has been divorced for 21 years and has fi ve adult children. Mrs. Maly came to Thailand 13 years ago; she does not have a work permit. She came to work in Thailand because of bad economic problems in Cambodia, where the only work available was in the rice fi eld which pays only 25 baht a day. Mrs. Maly used to make 200 baht a day. There used to be a lot of fi sh and there used to be work every day, so that she could make 3,000-4,000 baht per month. But in the past year her income has been drastically reduced. Her employer now pays her by the hour at 20 baht per hour, and after 4 hours of work the fi sh are sorted so that she only makes 80 baht a day. Sometimes there is only work for one day and there is a 4-day break after that. This income is not covering her expenses, which include 40 baht for the motorcycle taxi to the Pier and her rent, which has gone up from 300 to 600 baht including the electricity and water bills. The rest is spent on food, clothing, and personal care items. In a month when she fi nds herself short of money, she will borrow from the shop owner where she usually buys supplies and will pay back the money when she gets her monthly wage. She is never able to send any money home to Cambodia. At present Mrs. Maly is suff ering from thyroid problems and high blood pressure. In the past she would go to a local clinic which only charges her 120 baht. But due to her economic situation she now buys her medicine from a pharmacy; 10 baht can buy a package of 3 pills which immediately takes care of her dizziness. If the problem is more serious than dizziness, she goes to the clinic. However, she now practices alternative medicine and takes honey with lime juice for her blood pressure. Case Study of Mrs. Maly, a Cambodian Worker in the Thai Fishing Industry 11 IMPACT ON MIGRANTS AND MOBILE POPULATIONS result before departure shuts down the possibilities of finding jobs abroad and on site a positive result will often lead to deportation. Mandatory HIV testing, though prohibited by the ILO Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS, is practiced by the majority of main host South East Asian countries (with the exception of Thailand).39 A forthcoming ILO/IOM study of eight countries found that even countries that prohibit HIV tests by employers facilitate the testing requirements of other countries by testing their own citizens who were emigrating to work in those countries, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t receive a work permit to work abroad.40 For migrants living with HIV, the situation is even more dire. Access to treatment, care and support for migrants who are PLHIV is already low; when migrants move into the informal economy and/or undocumented status their links to such programs become even more tenuous. A World Bank/UNAIDS survey of 71 countries on the impact of the economic crisis found that AIDS treatment programs would be negatively affected in one-third of countries surveyed, home to 61% of those in treatment. In 15 countries external budget cuts will leave those in treatment highly exposed to risk of interruption. Of the 12 countries surveyed from Asia and the Pacific, 5 (42%) said they were uncertain of the impact of the crisis on treatment programs, mainly because the impact on national budgets was still unclear.41 Countries like Thailand who support their treatment programs through their national budget are particularly vulnerable to losses in trade and financing. The study calls for governments to plan for countercyclical fiscal measures to offset shortages in external AIDS. However, their analysis of the country survey results reveals that many of the countries who expected their AIDS programs to be affected by the crisis had a combination of high budget deficits and low or medium fiscal and institutional capacity. This implies that these countries (11 of 71 or 15%) would need both financial assistance and technical assistance to weather the crisis.42 It should be remembered also that the majority of migrants who", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9af91bf1-7341-4097-8d42-4c61a2a0f6be": {"__data__": {"id_": "9af91bf1-7341-4097-8d42-4c61a2a0f6be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4abe2e419ba4c9ec882f519aacebec83fba789e898e663a30a027c30a2c07cc"}}, "hash": "a4abe2e419ba4c9ec882f519aacebec83fba789e898e663a30a027c30a2c07cc", "text": "test positive and/or become sick return home, relying on family who once relied on them for remittances. For these return migrants, the long periods spent away from home mean that social support networks and family ties may not be strong as they were in the past. Thus the family may not provide the support expected and needed, even in the absence of other alternatives. And the economic burden of having a family member living with HIV often falls upon the poorest families, who are ill-equipped to cope with increased medical expenses and needed care. A recent four-country study showed that low-income households affected by HIV tend to spend a higher proportion of their expenses on medical costs and a lower proportion on food. They also tend to eat less healthy food, relying more on grains alone than on protein sources and fruits and vegetables. This is particularly worrisome as it is particularly important that PLHIV have good nutrition to maintain their immunity.43 Country Focus: Cambodia Cambodia\u2019s economy has been particularly hard hit by the crisis, as it is dominated by export-based manufacturing and heavily dependent on the garment industry. Exports in Cambodia were down 31% in January 2009 compared with the previous year, and the World Bank projects that the economy will contract by 1% in 2009.44 The garment sector accounts for over 70% of the country\u2019s export earnings and has been heavily affected by the decline in US demand (which alone accounts for 50% of total export earnings).45 In all, 70,000 garment workers\u2014nearly all young women\u2014 have lost their jobs since the crisis began.46 Declines in tourism, construction and foreign investment have also had a drastic effect on growth and employment. In agriculture, commodity prices continued to fall with drops in export demand for cash crops. An ILO study explored the impact of job losses in these key sectors (textiles/garment; construction; tourism and 39 UNRTF 2008. 40 ILO/IOM 2009. 41 World Bank/UNAIDS 2009. 42 World Bank 2009c. 43 UNDP 2008. 44 The Economist, 2009b. 45 EIU, 2009. 46 This downturn occurs after the Cambodian garment industry withstood steep competition from China and India since the expiration of U.S. import restrictions on those countries at the end of 2004; growth in employment and exports continued from 2005-2007 despite fears that both would contract (ILO, 2005, 2006, 2008). 12 agriculture).47 Garment factory workers mainly had their hours cut to the point that they were not making enough to live, causing some workers to resign. An increasing number of strikes were held by garment workers in 2008 to protest lower wages and layoffs, mostly without success. Because the vast majority of workers in the garment and textile sector are young women migrants from rural areas, one response to the crisis would be for large numbers of these women to return to their rural hometowns. However, the study found that the workers would prefer to remain in their current job\u2014even with lower wages\u2014or to search for another job rather than to return home. Other preferred solutions were to go into debt or sell assets rather than returning home, because there were no prospects for earning money in the rural subsistence economy. Some did say that they would return home temporarily to help with the rice harvest, in the hopes that the job prospects in the garment industry would improve in a few months. In the construction industry, where an estimated 30-40% of jobs have been cut, workers were much more likely to say that they would return home. This is partly due to the unskilled nature of these jobs and to the fact that construction workers typically move between seasonal work in agriculture and short-term construction jobs.48 Workers in the tourist sector are more likely to face underemployment than job loss, especially for those in the informal economy such as tuk-tuk and moto-dop drivers; most of those interviewed said they did not plan to return home. Concern has been growing that job loss and underemployment in the garment sector\u2014especially given the large number of women involved and the reduced prospects of employment in other sectors\u2014would lead to increasing numbers of women moving into sex work. A recent UNIAP study finds that 58% of a sample of sex workers began doing this work since the onset of the financial crisis and that 19% of these were former garment sector workers.49 \u201cDifficult family circumstances\u201d was the reason given by a large majority of the workers.

A study by CACHA found that 18% of EW/SWs did factory work before doing EW/SW, with another 33% saying they had been unemployed.50 Of additional concern is the fact that the financial crisis has coincided with a new anti-trafficking law in Cambodia that has had the indirect effect of increasing \u201cunder-the-radar\u201d sex work, operating outside the reach of well-established HIV prevention programs. The UNIAP study found that massage parlors have seen a large increase in the number of workers in recent months.51 Of 322 brothels that were previously directly serviced by Population Services International\u2019s (PSI) condom social marketing programs, most have been shut down by authorities with 143 operating as less obvious entertainment venues, which are less likely to have condoms on hand.52 A survey of high risk men found that more than twice as many (83% vs. 35%) reported having sex with a non-brothel based sex worker since the new law was initiated. Also, while there has been a 51% decrease in the number of women working in brothels in Phnom Penh, there has been a 44% and 6% increase in the number of women working in beer gardens and karaoke parlors respectively.53 Besides closing brothels, authorities have also arrested large numbers of entertainment workers who are taken to detention centers, where there have been many reports of abuse by police. Family Health International (FHI)-Cambodia also reported that their implementing agencies were less able to reach sex workers with their HIV prevention programs since the new law has been put in place, due to these women\u2019s fear of detention.54 Thus if young women who have lost their livelihood in the garment industry move into sex work, they are more likely than in the past to do so outside of Cambodia\u2019s 100% condom policy and to be at increased risk of HIV infection. 47 Kang et al. 2009. 48 Nyi, N. 2009. 49 UNIAP 2009 50 CACHA 2009.

His two sons are now working on a fi shing boat in Malaysia. He is currently living with his second wife with whom he has one daughter; she is 4 years old and lives with his parents in Myanmar. He came to Thailand in 1999. Initially, he planned to work in Thailand for 2-3 years to save money and then move back to Myanmar, but he could not save enough money and has only returned once in the past 10 years. He normally works on a fi shing boat and earns extra income shelling seafood, sending around 4,000-5,000 Baht every 3-4 months to his parents and his daughter. Mr. Win is HIV positive. He does not take ARV drugs, only drugs to treat opportunistic infections for about 500 baht per month. In the past he has always gone to the doctor immediately when he has a health problem, since the cost for the drugs is cheaper if he is able to avoid a severe infection. In this current economic situation, costs for food and other necessary items are getting more expensive, and are currently more than his income. At the same time, he is now having health problems and is not strong as before. He cannot work nowadays and only has income from his wife\u2019s work of around baht 4,500 per month. He has not been able to send money home for four months. Currently because of the economic situation, he has had to borrow money for the treatment and has to pay this back in monthly installments; with only his wife\u2019s income, he cannot pay the interest of around 2,000 baht per month. Case Study of Mr. Win, a Burmese migrant working in the fi shing industry in Thailand 14 Similar to the 1997-99 crisis, governments have reacted by creating highly visible policies to restrict migration and \u201ccrack down\u201d on undocumented migrants.

Some countries also are reported to have cut working hours and wages for foreign workers, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. In Singapore there are reports of foreign workers not being provided with food, shelter and health care which they formerly received.58 Many governments in the region have instituted economic stimulus packages to jump-start economic growth and create jobs. These include Vietnam ($6.0 billion), Indonesia ($6.3 billion), South Korea ($24.4 billion), and Malaysia ($16 billion). Thailand has announced two stimulus packages this year for a total of $44.4 billion. The Thai package includes infrastructure projects including transportation, public health, school and hospital projects as well as support to rural village economies. The Malaysia package includes incentives to create 163,000 jobs, with 63,000 of these in the government sector.59 Governments also are responding to the crisis with social protection policies and programs.

Expenditures are higher as well. Sometimes he has had to borrow money to send to his family in Myanmar, but he has been able to borrow from friends without interest so far. He keeps his HIV+ status confi dential, only consulting with the doctor or his HIV friends when he has a problem or uncommon symptom. It is not diffi cult for him to get information when visiting the doctor and his HIV group meeting friends every month and every time he also gets some information and training from the nurses and doctors, as well as his CD4 cell count. But he thinks that many migrant workers do not know how and where to get this health information and knowledge about HIV, and that they are not aware of the risks. Case Study of Mrs. Maly, a Cambodian Worker in the Thai Fishing Industry 15 RESPONSES TO THE CRISIS AND SOCIAL SAFETY NETS its assistance package for displaced workers, including overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who lose their jobs. The package includes providing temporary employment through business process outsourcing, with the Labor Department providing technical training.60 In Thailand, the government has provided an instruction to provincial Social Security Offices to ensure the prompt payment of unemployment benefits to laid-off workers in accordance with the Social Security Act. Cambodia has allocated $6.5 million to re-train laid-off workers from the garment industry. The Ministry of Labor also has set up a policy to encourage migration abroad as a way to alleviate poverty in Cambodia. A task force was also set up to create measures to stimulate tourism, such as engaging a public relations company to create a new image for Cambodia and funding a new tourism board. Vietnam initiated a new unemployment insurance system in January 2009, however workers will be able to benefit from it only in early 2010, as they must first pay an insurance premium for one year. In the meantime the government has set up a temporary job-loss subsidy scheme to assist laid- off workers. In Malaysia, the Ministry of Human Resources is undertaking further study before establishing a safety net program for retrenched workers.61 60 Philippines Department of Labor", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2820250-e846-4c48-a2d0-78b805f94566": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2820250-e846-4c48-a2d0-78b805f94566", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Threat Posed by the Economic Crisis to Universal Access to HIV Services for Migrants", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82544be973c1ba802c3fb43da16f5c2b95d727be4a3f33c55ee5fd7efeb9dc6f"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3f4e921-5037-4040-a217-595f2a36838c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/threat-posed-economic-crisis-universal-access-hiv-services-migrants", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9a3fbaba5a9c72415c2ba7378a56948d24b252ed1feed44362f96c5a07ecd96"}}, "hash": "a153dd87210cf727d0831f56813f36496bc7ec7daf24ff6de496d9c475c076c3", "text": "and Employment (DOLE) 2009. 61 Lustig 2009. 16 Evidence from the previous fi nancial crisis and from the information to date about the current crisis points to the likelihood of several, sometimes competing, scenarios for changing overall health and HIV vulnerability among migrants in the region. There are some lessons learned from the past that are important to highlight: \u2022 Cuts in government funding risks losing all the achievements in reducing the spread of the AIDS epidemic at national scale (e.g. Thailand - The cuts in government funding risked the loss of momentum in the eff orts to promote 100% condom use, also during the crisis period, provincial hospitals could not meet the demands for care and treatment of PLHIV) \u2022 Policies to reduce migration like limiting migrant work permits or cutting jobs and deporting workers are not successful in reducing irregular migration (e.g. Malaysia, South Korea); \u2022 Without access to formal channels of migration, many people on the move seek informal, unsafe channels of movement that puts them in conditions with greater risk and vulnerability to HIV. \u2022 Protecting temporary migrant workers during the crisis through unemployment insurance would have prevented the relocation of thousands of workers, who then would have been available when the economy recovered (e.g. Philippines).62 It is now well understood that while migration itself is not a risk factor for HIV infection, the exposure to vulnerable and exploitative situations that migrants are faced with places them at risk of HIV.63 Moreover, \u201ccertain types of work situations are more susceptible to the risk of infection than others although the main issue is one of behavior, not occupation\u201d (ILO 2001, p. 20). These work situations include separation from families and social support systems, substandard living and working conditions, and isolation. Women are placed at risk when their survival depends on exploitative employers or the need to exchange sex for food or money.64 Moreover, migrants do not have access to HIV prevention, VCCT and other health services that citizen workers do. Host countries do not provide subsidized ARV treatment to migrants or referral, and a positive test result usually means deportation.65 If migrants do seek health care, they face language and cultural barriers including the discrimination practiced towards migrants in many settings.66 62 Abella, M. 2000. \u201cProtecting temporary migrant workers: the challenges for modernizing states in Asia.\u201d Pp. 57-70 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Labour migration and the recent fi nancial crisis in Asia. 63 Skeldon 2000. 64 ILO/IOM/UNAIDS 2008. 65 In Thailand registered migrants can purchase health insurance but it is not clear whether this includes ARVs. 66 UNRTF 2008. 17 FINANCIAL CRISIS, MIGRATION, HEALTH AND HIV: LESSONS FROM THE \u201897 CRISIS Stephen Lewis recently articulated how the fi nancial crisis is aff ecting the global AIDS eff ort, in sharp contrast to the fi nancial sector at the heart of the crisis67 : The amounts of money required by government and civil society HIV/AIDS programs are relatively much smaller than the bail-out paid to fi nancial institutions, yet the loss will be deeply felt, and has severe implications for the spread of the epidemic and the health of millions of people worldwide. Below are some recommendations for mitigating these eff ects: Adhere to agreements made. Universal access to comprehensive health care services including HIV prevention, treatment, care and support is necessary to eff ectively fi ght the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. Barriers due to uncertain legal status and unequal access to health care should be addressed to ensure that progress continues to be made. The basis of commitments and agreements is well understood and accepted by host countries and countries of origin in the region, and they are necessary to avoid a crisis in migrant health. The ASEAN countries agreed at the 12th summit in Cebu the Philippines to \u201cpromote the full potential and dignity of migrant workers in a climate of freedom, equity, and stability in accordance with the laws, regulations, and policies of respective ASEAN Member Countries.\u201d In addition the United Nations General Assembly\u2019s \u201cUniversal Access Target for Reproductive Health\u201d, signed in 2005, includes provisions for access to sexual health and HIV/AIDS services.

In previous crises, some countries undertook massive deportation only to take back the same workers because of severe labour shortage at tremendous personal cost to migrants and their families as well as to the operating costs of their employers. Workers\u2019 and Employers\u2019 Organizations can be extremely eff ective in protecting migrant workers\u2019 rights, both by enforcing existing laws and policies and by working to enact increasing protections and reaching out to peers to establish equal treatment for migrant and national workers. 67 Fifth International AIDS Society Opening Address, Cape Town. 68 While stimulus packages to jump-start economic growth and create jobs in the region are in billions [South Korea ($24.4 billion), Malaysia ($16 billion), Thailand ($44.4 billion)] normative AIDS spending for a comprehensive response is between 0.5 \u2013 1 USD per person per year , approxi- mately 0,01 \u2013 0.02% of the stimulus packages 69 Aids Commission Report 2008 18 RECOMMENDATIONS 1 2 6 5 4 3 7 For example, as large numbers of migrants work in manufacturing an organized response in that sector, should eff ectively achieve greater protections for workers\u2019 rights and benefi ts. Also, as there is an apparent shift from manufacturing to the entertainment sector organizing/unionizing entertainment workers and mainstreaming HIV education into existing workplace services (such as OSH) for them will most probably reduce their HIV vulnerability. This will require sustained social dialogue at the sectoral level between Workers\u2019 and Employers\u2019 Organizations. Design re-integration programs that include re-training and placement help for returning migrants. Economic stimulus packages should include provisions for employing skilled return migrants who can greatly contribute to their home country economies. Special attention should be paid to the employment needs of women due to their vulnerability to employment loss and HIV risk. Countries of origin should establish protective mechanisms like welfare funds, social insurance schemes and training programmes to help migrants returning home or to relocate on site. Investment to support one migrant or mobile person impacts an estimated 3-5 family members in their home countries.

The words \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018sex\u2019 are interpreted differently in diverse cultures and societies as well as by the individuals involved. As a result, the term MSM covers a large variety of settings and contexts in which male-to-male sex takes place. The term \u2018gay\u2019 is used by some people to refer to a sexual identity that they apply to themselves and other men that is based on the sex they have with other men. Transgender people are individuals whose gender identity and/or gender expression differ from the socially- assigned gender identity at birth. The terms \u2018transgender person\u2019 and \u2018transgendered people\u2019 describe a wide range of identities, roles and experiences which can vary considerably from one culture to another. Transgender persons in Asia often identify themselves in local indigenous terms (for example, waria in Indonesia and kathoey in Thailand). 1.2 About this report This report describes specific examples of programme activities that seek to address HIV and promote health and rights among MSM and transgender people in six Asian cities: Bangkok, Thailand; Chengdu, China; Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; Jakarta, Indonesia; Manila, the Philippines; and Yangon, Myanmar. These examples, identified through consultation with local HIV leaders and practitioners in those six cities, are presented here to inform planning, design, and delivery of health and community services at the municipal level. Ultimately, these types of activities, if widely adopted and scaled up in combination, would lead to a reduction in rates of HIV infection, improve access to health services, and reduce human rights violations in urban areas and cities in the Asia-Pacific region. A detailed methodology for the scanning exercise and each city report is available at www.undp.org, and is summarized below: \u2022\ufffd In August 2010, local community consultants in each of the six cities were recruited and trained.This six cities scan was designed to use Appreciative Inquiry techniques, aimed at documenting new ideas and emerging potentials in local practice. Consultants were trained to collect narrative stories, using a participatory inquiry approach to consult with and reach consensus among local leaders about what might be innovative and interesting in local service delivery. Where locals could not reach consensus, consultants used the regional framework outlined in the Comprehensive Response to HIV Services to MSM and Transgender people in Asia Pacific to determine which local activities to study. \u2022\ufffd In September 2010, local consultants completed the initial scan in their respective cities over approximately five working days. \u2022\ufffd In October and November 2010, consultants produced a report about activities in their cities. \u2022\ufffd These findings were compiled and presented as a background resource to inform a Multi-City MSM and Transgender Populations Action Meeting held in Hong Kong in December 2010. This meeting brought together leaders from across the city-based responses in Asia and was supported by USAID, the UN, APCOM, APN+ and the Hong Kong Department of Health. This review of HIV-related programming for MSM and transgender people is produced in the context of a range of related municipal, national, regional and global efforts to promote health and human rights; advance universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support; and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. As such, this report builds from several key national, regional, and global documents (see Table 1). 2 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities table 1: key recent national, regional, and global documents about HIV programming for msm and transgender people document title description National AIDS plans of China, Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam 1 2 3 4 5 National AIDS plans of each country are intended to guide the design, delivery, monitoring and evaluation of HIV programming, including coordination among national, city, and district governments.

MSM in the region are 19 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population,6 but the proportion of MSM reached with HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support remains low.7 This report is a review of examples of programme activities seeking to address HIV and promote health and rights among MSM and transgender people in six Asian cities: Bangkok, Thailand; Chengdu, China; Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam; Jakarta, Indonesia; Manila, the Philippines; and Yangon, Myanmar. All have large and growing populations, and each also has a burgeoning middle class as well as millions of people living in poverty with little access to health or social welfare services.8 For many MSM and transgender people, these cities offer new freedoms for expression of sexuality and gender identity. At the same time, people living in these cities confront social dislocation and insufficient economic opportunities relative to demand. This produces contexts and patterns of vulnerability to HIV and human rights violations.9 Therefore, there is an urgent need for targeted planning and scale-up of health and social services in each of these cities.10 11 This report describes specific examples of programme activities that seek to address HIV and promote health and rights among MSM and transgender people in six Asian cities.

Consensus at the Asia Regional Consultation on MSM HIV Care and Support Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand in November 2009 (henceforth called the \u2018Care and Support Regional Consensus Meeting\u2019) was that \u201cno one size fits all\u201d,19 and the meeting recommended \u201cstrengthening links between community-based MSM care and support and facility-based services.\u201d20 Results from the six city scanning exercise underpinning this report reinforced those findings. The scan found a wide variety of HIV community services which appeared to consider the range of MSM and transgender sub-populations in each setting and attempt to design services to meet different preferences and needs. online and new technologies emerged as a preeminent approach for programmes to boost capacity to reach large numbers, including young people and \u2018hidden\u2019 or \u2018harder to reach\u2019 MSM. City-based cultural events also surfaced as an essential strategy to reach large numbers of MSM and transgender people with HIV and other health messaging in a number of cities. msm- and transgender-led services were widely cited as a critical element of city-based responses, for the reason that these peer-led services are able to reach deep into their specific sub-populations more easily and thoroughly than most public- sector programs.

They highlighted mobile phone and SMS communication strategies, emerging online peer education services and targeted internet health promotion and advocacy campaigning. Community organisations need relevant skills (e.g., in online service delivery and website design) and the ability to scale- up online and mobile phone HIV services to reach MSM and transgender people in Asian megacities. Mobile phones and SMS (or \u2018short message service\u2019) In all six cities, MSM are increasingly using mobile phone technologies to chat and \u2018hook-up\u2019 through \u2018apps\u2019 (applications), which inform the user when someone signed up to a particular e-network is in close proximity to them. However, no participants reported using such apps in their service delivery; this, therefore, is an area that could be explored further in the design of HIV services online. Some HIV medical and community services are using mobile phones and SMS to engage and re-engage gay and other MSM and transgender people in their services, and early research suggests these strategies may be successful at promoting sustained health seeking and improving re-testing rates among MSM.28 Given the increasing numbers of MSM and transgender people using mobile phones in the region, the use of SMS and mobile technologies should be standard practice among HIV medical teams and community- based services. For example, SMS reminders could prompt return visits by MSM and transgender people for HIV and STI testing and counselling as well as for health maintenance and monitoring visits for those living with HIV. Peer education and HIV support online Underscoring the impact of the internet on the lives of people in Asia, some MSM community-based services are diverting their HIV peer outreach efforts away from face-to-face interventions and increasingly to online service delivery. In online peer education, staff join social networking and other online communities where they engage individual Internet users in discussion about HIV through \u2018private messaging\u2019 or through group chats in dedicated, online sessions. These engagements provide online peer educators the opportunity to \u2018private chat\u2019 with users about their sexual health concerns or establish virtual information and education groups for online users. In many instances, online peer educators arrange face-to-face meetings with their online contacts to connect them to local health and social services. 24 USAID. 2011.

The AIDS Society has no policy, procedure or protocols for online peer-based service delivery. Instead, it sets basic ground rules for peer educators to ensure their professionalism and uses transcripts of discussions between online users and peer educators to help train them through practice discussions. Bric Bernas, the Executive Director of the AIDS Society, notes that this is the only online health intervention for MSM in Manila, and underlines the importance of linking with municipal health services for consistency and continuity of health promotion, service referrals, and health service provision and follow-up. Internet campaigning In all six cities, HIV programmes are using internet websites constructed exclusively to promote a particular HIV awareness-raising campaign or GLBT rights issue for short periods of time. These sites vary in content and include a video mini-series targeting young gay Thai men and a site advocating electoral reform to allow GLBT groups to form political parties in the 2009 Philippines general election. Some of these internet campaigns used existing social networking media sites such as You Tube, Twitter and Facebook, all of which provide low cost platforms for these activities. The use of short-term targeted web campaigning appears to be an under-utilised strategy \u2013 especially the use of specialised websites to drive net users to health promotion campaigns and IEC materials. Online\ufffdtelevision\ufffdminiseries\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok Love Audition is the product of an idea by Vittaya Saeng-Aroon of Global Fish Media. He used new and emerging media to produce an online \u2018television\u2019 mini-series for gay teenagers in Thailand. The series follows the exploits of three young Thai gay men who make a bet to use condoms every time they have sex and it attracted thousands of online Thai MSM who followed the series over time. Saeng-Aroon expressed a range of ideas for strategies for scale up of this sort of activity, including linking the series to cable television and running an episode per week on television for a year. He suggests setting up a fan club to help engage local communities and young gay networks and arranging fan club meetings as a way of reaching young MSM face-to-face and promoting safer sex. Such a fan club meeting might include meeting the actors involved in the series and taking questions from audience members. Longer term online activities were also highlighted by participants, including a dedicated online gay social networking site in Yangon, online counselling services in Ho Chi Minh City and a gay radio station in Chengdu. There was evidence of the beginnings of online advocacy and awareness-raising for people living with HIV with the launch of Positivism \u2013 a monthly, online magazine on the lives of people living with HIV in Manila. Building the capacity of community organisations in professional, web-based service delivery The majority of community organisations now have a web presence, but very few appear to have the expertise necessary to deliver professional, high quality and responsible services online. Participants highlighted the need for increasing web capacity, standard operating procedures and improved skills in online promotion and marketing. On the theme of strategic information, the AIDS Society of the Philippines, points to the need for skills in the building and maintenance of high quality websites, publishing service policies online so that net users can access them; providing clear and responsive complaints mechanisms; developing systems for net users to evaluate online service delivery; and using internet technology to produce data on webuse by MSM and transgender people. 10 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities \u201d 3.2\ufffdHealth\ufffdand\ufffdrights\ufffdactivities\ufffdlinked\ufffdto\ufffdlarge-scale\ufffdevents\ufffdand\ufffdcampaigns \u201cWe also want to run this event to let people know more about GLBT life....GLBT people come to see movies at the festivals and sometimes they bring their friends and families from outside the GLBT community who are interested.

Film Festival is a large-scale, annual cultural and lifestyle event for GLBT people that tours six Indonesian cities over 10 days, screens a range of films and hosts panel discussions, interviews, art exhibitions, performances and public debates. It is run by a core team of volunteers but attracts hundreds of casual volunteers to assist with local administration and service delivery each year. The event unifies HIV and GLBT organisations across Indonesian cities that cooperate in organising a range of events to coincide with the festival. The festival already attracts some HIV activities, but could be the catalyst for large-scale, annual health promotion campaigns targeting MSM and transgender people with subsequent mini-launches that follow the festival as it moves from city to city. Health promotion campaigning, HIV testing and education combined with annual events An important way to scale-up HIV services and campaigns is to link health promotion campaigns and HIV testing initiatives with large-scale annual events, such as the Sedona Township Transgender Fashion Contest in Yangon, the Q!

This galvanized partnerships for the development and implementation of a highly successful, large-scale HIV awareness campaigns featuring international film star Jackie Chan, NBA basketball star Yao Ming and Chinese film actor Pu Cunxin to raise awareness of HIV among broad segments of China\u2019s population.

They repackaged the message of HIV testing to give it a \u201csexy look and feel\u201d and included suggestive messages like \u2018Are you sexy enough?\u2019 [to take an HIV test].

Manila participants observed that without these targeted \u2018gay\u2019 media outlets it can be very difficult to reach large numbers of MSM and transgender people. In Bangkok, participants felt that the media needed to focus less on scientific information about HIV and more on behavioural, sociological and sub-cultural dynamics important to MSM and transgender people. For example, media articles focusing on HIV prevalence assisted in raising awareness of HIV in general but did little to inform people at risk about the actions they could take to reduce their risk or where to go for friendly and safe HIV and STI services. Global Fish Media noted some key obstacles that need to be overcome: \u201cThere has been so little information in the mainstream media about HIV prevention that is specifically tailored at this high-risk group.

These networks of self-generated community action appear to be an affordable and effective strategy for national AIDS responses that can act as a \u2018bridge\u2019 to the health system and can sustain community-based service delivery. From this it would appear that there is great value for city governments in recognising, supporting and resourcing these movements in the response to HIV. At the moment, however, most of these community- generated actions are not adequately resourced to scale-up their potentially valuable work. Community-based MSM and transgender movements are effective and affordable for national and city- based HIV responses Self-generated community groups, networks and organisations of MSM and transgender people contributing to the city-based response to HIV are evident in all six cities scanned for this report. These organisations appear to offer value for money because they are often able to mobilise large numbers of volunteers in their service delivery and because salaries and overheads for these groups are often lower than in programmes funded by governments or the private sector. They are effective because they use people from the sub-populations to generate and deliver messages, thereby increasing their relevance and acceptability to the target audience. The 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia concludes that \u201ccommunity groups of men who have sex with men have proved to be energetic and competent partners (and leaders) in HIV prevention in many settings. This can keep costs down, while ensuring high programme coverage.\u201d33 sustaining community-led programmes in multiple cities Three groups that provide HIV services - Tongle (an MSM-led community organisation in Chengdu), Inter Medika Foundation (an MSM-led community organisation in Jakarta) and Healthy Life Helping Society in Yangon - have at times experienced severe fluctuations in funding. All, however, are able to continue to provide a baseline range of services, which expand and contract with changes in funding. They can do this because of the civic-mindedness and community spirit they generate in their constituencies.

The goal is to prevent these individuals from \u2018falling through the gap\u2019 between community and clinical services by working with nursing teams at sites across the city. The organisation has a strategy to scale-up this initiative by developing Memoranda of Understanding with the city and national health departments to formalise and integrate this programme into health facilities across the city. At Rainbow Sky (an MSM-led community organisation in Bangkok), volunteers regularly accompany individual MSM to the Silom Community Clinic; this practice of accompanying MSM and transgender people to services was cited and prioritized by many scan participants. Community\ufffd\u2018lay\ufffdpractitioners\u2019\ufffdin\ufffdclinical\ufffdsettings\ufffdin\ufffdJakarta The Jakarta Planned Parenthood Association has developed a model which points to a way forward for strategies for scale-up. Among the strategies are i) sensitizing local medical staff using MSM and transgender persons\u2019 organisations that establish community organisation positions inside government clinics and hospitals; and ii) integrating community organisation services into government clinics and hospitals and then encouraging their members to attend those sites for services. The association believes that over time such efforts would establish a system in which community organisations are embedded within and more intimately connected to the general health service system and could ultimately facilitate system-wide change. Openly gay and other MSM are most effective at reaching the range of men who have sex with men across the complex and multiple social and sexual sites that exist in a megacity. This is particularly true regarding those hardest to reach. According to Ryan from Inter Medika Foundation, \u201cWhen we talk about MSM in Jakarta... we also should talk about hidden gay men and hidden MSM... [who] don\u2019t tell others\u201d about their sex with other men.34 These men, who are assumed to be the majority of MSM in the Asia region, are not interested, able or prepared to engage in the building and sustaining of community organisations to serve them. Therefore, organisations such as Inter Medika in Jakarta, Healthy Life Helping Society in Yangon, Tongle in Chengdu, The Philippines AIDS Society in Manila, Blue Sky Clubin Ho Chi Minh City and Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand in Bangkok all appear essential to reaching and improving the health of these \u2018hidden\u2019 MSM.

The group uses local celebrities including a transgender star named Tina Thai Tai and actors, singers and TV presenters in the delivery of edutainment in local clubs, restaurants and bars; such events sometimes attract hundreds of people.

Promoting condom-use through public-private partnership and initiative Access to the means to prevent HIV is essential to interrupting HIV transmission among MSM and TG people. The following two case studies focus on scaling-up condom distribution through public-private partnerships. Condom\ufffdsocial\ufffdmarketing\ufffdin\ufffdHo\ufffdChi\ufffdMinh\ufffdCity In Ho Chi Minh City, Population Services International (PSI) implemented a targeted condom social marketing campaign in 2007. It launched a new brand of condom for sex workers, injecting drug users and MSM called \u2018N1*\u2019 and collaborated with private pharmacies close to MSM venues to promote the condom - including by hiring an advertising and promotions company to work with these pharmacies. At the same time, PSI held N1* promotional events in cafes and bars across Ho Chi Minh City and Viet Nam and produced and distributed IEC materials as part of these events. PSI plans to scale-up this activity by transferring the promotional model to community organisations so that they can generate demand for condoms and water-based lubricant among their MSM and transgender members. Using this community organisation transfer strategy, PSI believes it can scale-up condom and lube promotional activities to more pharmacies and encourage use across all MSM and transgendered populations, including male sex workers. 16 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities Revolving\ufffdCondom\ufffdFund\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok Service Workers in Groups (SWING) is a Bangkok-based community organisation that established a Revolving Condom Fund aimed at scaling up condom distribution to MSM and transgender sex workers through a partnership between civil society and the private sector. Another example of community-generated action, SWING managed complex liaison with commercial sex venue owners and managers and a local condom manufacturing company. It established a system in which the company provided condoms at-cost while community workers operated inside commercial sex venues to sell and distribute condoms at the lowest possible cost. The Fund now has an annual budget of THB400,000 (US$13,300). It has actively engaged in strategies for scale-up - in mid-2009, the Condom Fund was distributing to 64 establishments in Bangkok and 12 across Chiang Mai, Korat and Nonthaburi and through Thailand\u2019s Sexual Diversity Network. There are plans for local community organisations across Thailand to adopt this model of condom distribution and modify it to the particular needs of their local constituents.The programme has been adopted through Thailand\u2019s HIV programme funded through the Global Fund with roll out expected in 14 provinces across the country. Reaching MSM and transgender people where they gather Outreach education involves teams of community-based volunteers and staff visiting places where MSM and transgender people gather across a megacity. While there, they provide HIV education and information and distribute condoms and lubricant. Across all the six cities, outreach education was a fundamental approach linking MSM and transgender people to HIV information and HIV and STI services. Coordinated\ufffdoutreach\ufffdeducation\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok,\ufffdJakarta\ufffdand\ufffdHo\ufffdChi\ufffdMinh\ufffdCity Bangkok city scan participants in particular underlined that outreach education must be embedded in national HIV strategies and city-based HIV responses because it has in many circumstances demonstrated its value in bridging MSM and transgender individuals and networks to public health services. As well as outreach in parks and streets where MSM and transgender people gather, many community organisations work with the private sector \u2013 such as cafes, bars, massage services, and saunas where MSM and transgender people can be accessed. Blue Sky Club in Ho Chi Minh City delivers \u2018edutainment\u2019 and in some cases HIV testing and counselling services in these venues. Rainbow Sky and a community organisation called Bangkok Rainbow have worked in cooperation with saunas, city health officials, international agencies and police to remove barriers that inhibit the use of condoms in commercial venues. 9M Sauna and Massage, the only gay sauna in Jakarta and Indonesia, works closely with Inter Medika Foundation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eda3d8e8-88c8-47a6-8b7b-d936c094d5ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "eda3d8e8-88c8-47a6-8b7b-d936c094d5ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "153fb1a64f1807798a548c770f2f40f21979ca485c27cf99071c5c22e37c5e3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "77da2e36-6bfb-4d03-8565-d093686687d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3aecb3a937f2852f306a6db1aa77add177221ffff9f3b7cb8507d56bb8cdf4b3"}}, "hash": "d827011516c91359d3bfc18682ce1a07df8a5e1ef51e7c29f96bb87b692caa6a", "text": "Staff and volunteers from the foundation undertake regular activities and training inside the sauna, offering HIV education, condoms and lube distribution, and health promotion and IEC materials.

However, such services are rarely implemented or effective. Innovative models described in this report suggest that city-based and national public health departments can implement simple, cost-effective medical services that reach large numbers of MSM and transgender individuals. Guidance for innovative HIV programming is available in the region. The WHO Priority Health Sector Interventions Report supports \u2018combination prevention\u2019 through partnerships with clinical services that deliver biomedical prevention (such as rapid HIV testing and post-exposure prophylaxis) and community-based services that deliver outreach, peer education,and health promotion support, among others.36 The report calls for clinical services to take a more active role in the distribution of condoms and provision of HIV information to patients, and to collect more thorough scientific information on HIV transmission, treatment and behaviour change. It also recommends that clinic services be delivered inside community organisations and that community organisations deliver \u2018lay\u2019 services inside clinics and hospitals in a synergistic relationship that supports high quality information provision while generating increased demand for services in clinic settings.37 These recommendations call for a blurring of sector boundaries and increased integration across sectors that will require operation research to provide strategic information demonstrating \u2018evidence-based\u2019 innovation. The Comprehensive Response lists a series of effective public sector/community organisation partnership models that provide effective HIV treatment, care and support. These include the use of MSM and transgender \u2018expert\u2019 patients in clinics; strong referral links across sectors; and HIV treatment and care services provided at community-run clinics and hospitals.38 Guided by this advice, the six city scanning exercise looked for examples of these sorts of innovations and highlights them in this report. Improved municipal government coordination is needed to facilitate innovative approaches. In megacities such coordination is a complicated undertaking. Greater Manila, for example, comprises 16 cities with a total population of 20 million. Each city has its own government with administrative responsibility for its particular jurisdiction. Approaches to HIV services \u2013 including for HIV services to MSM and transgender people \u2013 vary from city to city. In Bangkok, the Bangkok Municipal Administration is responsible for over 50 districts across the metropolitan area. Adding to the geographical and governance complexities are cultural and social factors that influence the availability and provision of HIV services to MSM and transgender people. In some societies, for example, religious-based opposition inhibits policymakers\u2019 inclination or ability to implement strategies to reach these populations. Approaches that seem straightforward to public health practitioners from the West - from which many testable models of HIV partnership of this nature first emerge - often must be filtered through subtle local cultural dynamics within nation states and HIV responses. In some cases, such approaches conflict with some (but not all) local cultures and the ways in which local MSM and transgender people work within their cultures to facilitate social change. Nevertheless, a number of potential solutions emerged from the case studies, including the following: a) fundamentally, what is required is a change in strategy for active leadership by city governments; b) local champions across government, medical facilities and communities are needed, and they must 36 WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, Hong Kong Department of Health and APCOM. 2010.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6437274-5cce-4b6c-9a3a-9c0b9de963e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6437274-5cce-4b6c-9a3a-9c0b9de963e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "deb2f5f6098fd9775cf48af1157084d0a7380e0fd22120812250b227638cfa00"}, "2": {"node_id": "81ab53e2-5cb6-4d7f-8016-783975fe999e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14b92e91b4bd9a25cafa67cf980518312e83f2b651352256de0fc3bb2458a03c"}}, "hash": "fd070a163cdab44b0d1c2c8205ad7f5217241131500c6c232820fd9ac3485e82", "text": "2010.

The scan identified some innovative HIV and stI testing and counselling services as well as some innovations in the delivery of public health services for msm and transgender people living with HIV. In many of the case studies international organisations helped prompt innovation and change in medical facilities and systems and work cooperatively with municipal and national governments to assist them in meeting their HIV public health goals. 4.1 City government coordination and leadership \u201cWe [at the Ho Chi Minh Provincial AIDS Committee] see communication with all our partners and listening to each other as key. In terms of programmes for MSM we should not stop at condom provision but also provide MSM and transgender people with more service options.\u201d - Thi Thu Tran Hue at Ho Chi Minh City Provincial AIDS Committee39 The Asia Regional Consultation on MSM HIV Care and Support Meeting held in Bangkok in November 2009 underlined the importance role of governments in defining how HIV care, support and treatment is delivered to MSM and recommended that governments be supported \u201cin developing guidelines, standard operating procedures and training to ensure quality care delivery.\u201d40 Improved city government planning, coordination and leadership are essential to ensure that larger numbers of MSM and transgender people in Asia Pacific megacities have access to public health services. Such efforts need not be expensive and do not necessarily require system-wide changes. The scans hint at four steps city governments can take, ideally in partnership with national and local authorities and other partners: i) ensuring supply,ii) strengthening service quality,iii) improving service effectiveness, and iv) generating greater demand for public health services. 39 UNDP. 2010. Ho Chi Minh City Scan Report: Provincial AIDS Committee \u2013 the coordinating the response to HIV in Ho Chi Minh City; p. 115. 40 Ibid. USAID, et al. 2009; p. 7. Four steps to coordinating city level scale-up of public health services Step 1: Supply Select public clinics and hospitals for specialised services to MSM and transgender people Step 2: Quality Facilitate mentoring between experienced and inexperienced sites Step 3: Effectiveness Implement experimental approaches to HIV testing, counseling, treatment and care services for MSM and transgender people Step 4: Demand Integrate community organisations\u2019 service delivery and promotion initiatives into these public health clinics and sites 20 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities Ensuring supply This step involves city government-led selection of a number of public health clinics and hospitals for intensive service improvement to attract more MSM and transgender people to access them. It also includes ensuring the commodities needed to deliver effective services at these sites. Correct site selection should be a core aspect of city government thinking and strategizing about clinical services. Clinics need to be conveniently situated in respect to places that MSM and transgender people gather and open at times that they can and will use. A number of national and city governments have already identified their HIV public health sites, but it remains to be asked, \u2018Are these sites generating demand for their services among MSM and transgender people?\u2019 If the answer is \u2018No\u2019, then the next steps must be considered. Service strengthening This step aims to improve service quality. It involves city governments facilitating ongoing mentoring and transfer of knowledge and skills between community-level clinics that currently reach larger numbers of MSM and transgender people and other public health services that do not. A key part of this step consists of implementing best-practice HIV testing, prevention, treatment and care services and ensuring clear, well understood procedures for medical staff.

New strategies for generating demand This step aims to generate increased demand for public health HIV services among MSM and transgender people by ensuring the involvement of their groups, networks and community organisations in service delivery at public health sites.

Such omissions stem from prevailing stigma and discomfort by health providers, poor policies, insufficient staff, and insufficient staff training and supervision, often due to limited resources. One doctor in a public hospital reported, \u201cI donate my time at the clinic [which provides HIV testing and counselling] because the hospital board prevents the adequate resourcing of HIV services to most-at-risk populations.\u201d The three-step process for best-practice HIV testing and counselling is well known and includes: i) pre-test counselling that assesses the risk profile of the client and provides information about HIV and STIs followed by; ii) the drawing of blood and subsequent testing of the sample, with results provided at some time later in; iii) a face-to-face post-test counselling session (i.e., results should never be given over the telephone). This comprehensive model provides a critical link between testing positive for HIV and accessing HIV medical services for monitoring, treatment and care. HIV and STI counselling and testing is sometimes wrongly programmed as a one-off strategy to identify PLHIV rather than as a strategy for connecting people to the services and programmes they need (whether they have HIV or not). Public health and community organisation partnerships in HIV testing and counselling Partnerships between public health and community organisations are one way in which it is possible to generate increasing demand. The examples below include a number of case studies identified during the city scans in which public and private health clinics have formed partnerships with community organisations to increase uptake of HIV testing services. These examples all stress the critical importance of comprehensive testing, including high quality pre- and post-test counselling and referral services.

Our 2010 six-city scan found several cases where national and city governments are conducting innovative HIV programmes for MSM and transgender people with the ongoing funding and support from international organisations. These partnerships for the creation and multi-year operation of government-run programmes have helped to increase demand for and access to HIV testing and counselling among MSM and transgender people. Supporting start-up and transition to government-led service management and delivery Partnerships between governments and international agencies are particularly useful in developing new clinic models for both HIV and STI testing and counselling and medical services for MSM and transgender people living with HIV. In some cases international organisations provided the initial start-up funds, helped to articulate service models, and advocated for services across local partners in a city. Community-based HIV counselling and testing in Chengdu Tongle is a community organisation providing HIV testing and counselling to MSM with the support of the Chengdu Center for Disease Control (CDC) and a range of local hospitals and clinics. The China-UK HIV Collaboration helped to facilitate these cooperative partnerships and assisted this small service by working with the Chengdu CDC to define the model which became the first community-based HIV testing and counselling service in the city and in China.

FHI subsequently took over continuing operations in a partnership with the city governments harm reduction unit and some civil society organisations that support key affected populations. The partners extended the service\u2019s mandate to reach key affected populations in the city but with varying levels of success. Thus, although promising, this model has not yet resulted in significant changes to the public health system. Improved effectiveness may be an important next step prior to transition to a government-led HIV testing and counselling programme in public health settings.

This sponsorship of both services and research together in one place is a model for the Asia Pacific region, and has produced internationally-recognized epidemiological and behavioural research among MSM and transgender people as well as documentation of best-practice delivery of HIV testing and counselling services to these sub-populations. In Ho Chi Minh City, FHI works closely with the city\u2019s harm reduction programme to deliver a range of services across the city. In Yangon, several international agencies work across the response to HIV in collaboration with the Myanmar Health Department. A key challenge is to understand how such cooperation can now lead to integrating services and programmes within national and city level responses and how, in some cases, leadership can be transferred from international agencies to national and city governments. Thailand and Indonesia are potentially interesting case studies of how scaling up HIV testing and counselling in HIV hotspots can increasingly become a government goal. Developments in Viet Nam demonstrate how to transfer \u2018ownership\u2019 and \u2018leadership\u2019 to governments. Yangon offers a unique perspective on political and economic barriers to the transfer of services to government-owned and -led programmes. Integrated prevention, treatment, care and support services A number of examples of services that provide integrated prevention, treatment, care and support were identified in the 2010 city scans. The examples below explore two sites that integrate services in Yangon. Integrated drop-in health centres in yangon In Yangon, international organisations have developed integrated prevention, treatment, care and support services in order to consolidate and maximise limited resources. In 2004, PSI Myanmar established its Targeted Outreach Programme (TOP) with the objective of reducing transmission of HIV and STIs and improving the quality of life of both female and male sex workers. It successfully worked with the Myanmar government to scale-up TOP to seven sites across seven cities, and the model integrates prevention, treatment, care and support services centred on drop-in centres at each site. Multidisciplinary teams of clinical staff and peer educators work together to supply and generate demand for services. Peer educators organize support and education groups as well as social and cultural events at the drop-in centres; they also provide outreach services to places where MSM and transgender people gather. Clinical staff at the drop-in centres provide HIV and STI testing and counselling as well as monitoring and treatment support for MSM and transgender people living with HIV. MSF Holland in Yangon also integrates prevention, treatment, care and support services. \u2018MSM behaviour change communication peers\u2019 act as \u2018goodwill ambassadors\u2019 to increase support for MSM and transgender people across the general community and act as a bridge to clinics and hospital services responding to HIV and sexual health. MSF Holland makes presentations to township health coordinating committees across Yangon, a procedure that has resulted in improved access to public health clinics for MSM and transgender people, including those living with HIV. Conclusion Integrating public health innovations in to city government policy making, programming and annual resourcing of HIV services is recommended to assist local scale up of HIV responses to MSM and TG people across megacities in Asia. The diagram below aims to assist policy makers and HIV health programmers to conceptualise the key conclusions from this section of the scan and prioritise these innovations in city- based programming. 26 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities 1.

They included a lack of services for transgender people in general and the need for more insight and understanding into local transgender people\u2019s lives; legal difficulties for MSM and transgender people engaged in sex work, and the lack of advocacy and service responses to assist them; and the importance of prioritising young MSM and transgender people in municipal responses to HIV. Services for transgender people Transgender people\u2019s lives and identities vary across the region and are deeply conditioned by local cultural and religious norms. Transgender people\u2019s descriptions of their own lives reveal varying levels of social and economic exclusion. These differences make it difficult to clearly define the category \u2018transgender person\u2019 and also underline the imperative for locally tailored strategy development and programming. However, several consistent findings emerge in relation to transgender people across Asian megacities. There is a wide variety in the ways that transgender people identify and experience health services across the six cities. In some cities, it is rare to find transgender people working at high-level positions in universities, businesses, or government, and the majority of transgender people have low-paying jobs if they work at all. In China, there are few publicly visible transgender people because of the extreme hostility toward them. In Jakarta, community organisations state that many transgender people live in poverty, beg on the streets, and/or engage in sex work to make a living.47 At the same time, in the Philippines, the Society of Transsexual Women is one part of \u201ca vibrant community of Filipinas who identify as transgender,\u201d and its chairperson argues for separate targeted programming for transgender people \u201cbecause our health care needs are completely different.\u201d48 In Myanmar, transgender people play an important role in spiritual life, and in Yangon there was evidence that many are able to establish businesses and engage as leaders in the HIV community response to a limited extent. Healthy Life Helping Society is a small community organisation that appears to have built a model of service delivery integrating MSM and transgender people\u2019s services that is mostly acceptable to local transgender people in Yangon. Despite some examples of targeted programming, transgender people\u2019s services were notable by their systematic absence in the six cities scanned. Furthermore, in most cases, HIV programming merges transgender people into programming for MSM with apparently little insight into the particular needs of transgender people in local service delivery. A number of community organisations in the six cities claim to provide services to both MSM and transgender people, but transgender people are not fully integrated as clients, service providers or programme leaders. 46 UNDP. 2010.

Despite such efforts, the 2008 Integrated Bio-Behavioural Survey among Waria populations found an HIV prevalence of 34 percent among the sample, while living conditions and social supports for transgender people remain extremely limited.49 Key factors behind these health, social and economic problems, according to Waria themselves, are religious opposition and an extremely conservative social environment. Note: Most Waria in Indonesia undergo a physical transformation that includes breast implantation and cosmetic surgery but mostly does not include gender reassignment. The majority of Waria live as a \u2018third gender\u2019 between \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 with breasts and male genitalia partly because Muslim tradition emphasises \u201cleaving the world with the same genitalia that one is born with.\u201d50 Programming\ufffdfor\ufffdtransgender\ufffd(kathoey)\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok The Indonesian experience contrasts significantly with Thailand. In Thailand, openly transgender people are now graduating from universities and, in some cases, working as academics and other professionals in some limited capacities. Yet despite the very visible presence of Thai transgender people (or kathoey, a Thai term for a transgender person), there remains no exclusively transgender people\u2019s organisation in Bangkok. (In the nearby beach resort city of Pattaya, however, there are two transgender-led community organisations.) Reliable data on the impact of HIV are difficult to obtain, but in 2005, a study of 474 transgender people in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket found HIV prevalence of 13.5 percent.51 Community organisations such as Service Workers in Groups (SWING) have developed a service model that carefully considers transgender people\u2019s lives and centrally involves them in designing and leading services. SWING uses a community service model that integrates MSM and transgender people\u2019s needs in a sophisticated way, and this model appears acceptable to the transgender people involved. Note: Thai transgender people\u2019s lives vary greatly across the country. Some undergo a physical transformation that includes gender reassignment. Others undergo breast augmentation and cosmetic surgery but do not undergo gender reassignment (thereby retaining male genitalia). Still others move fluidly between dressing as women and dressing as men, depending on their current circumstances. These variations further trouble attempts to define transgender as a social category. 49 IBBS Integrated Biological-Behavioural Surveillance among MARG in Indonesia \u2013 waria. 2007.

MSM and transgender people, especially the young and the poor, often engage in sex work as one of a range of strategies for earning income in cities. Community-based HIV projects and organisations in each city seek to reach these individuals, and the lives of these male and transgender sex workers were described in detail by some participants. Some people move from setting to setting (from massage and sauna services to streets to parks) and use a range of methods to engage in sex work (including mobile phones and the internet). Some self-identify as \u2018heterosexual\u2019 and have sex with male clients for money while also having sex with girlfriends, wives and other women.

Instead, they began embracing a human rights approach in which building self-confidence, self-respect and self-esteem - regardless of what work participants engaged in - became the goal. The project was innovative in that it aimed to mix women, men and transgender people engaged in sex work together and to build alliances and friendships among them. The project combined practical, vocational training with training on HIV and STI prevention, treatment, care and support along with support for those living with HIV participating in the programme. Policy\ufffdbarriers\ufffdfor\ufffdsex\ufffdworker\ufffdprogrammes\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok An obstacle to coherent service delivery for MSM and transgender sex workers in Bangkok (and in most of the cities scanned) is the contradiction that exists in the policies of governments toward condom use. While health departments promote the use of condoms to prevent HIV transmission, law enforcement uses the same condoms, often distributed to sex workers through government programmes, as evidence of prostitution and as a justification to detain and arrest sex workers. Although sex between men is not illegal in Thailand, police practices are described as hampering HIV prevention efforts.52 SWING reports raids on bars, clubs and other venues where sex work occurs. Other community organisations report that the fear of raids on clubs and saunas where men meet each other for sex is a barrier to encouraging condom use among clientele.Similar obstacles and challenges were described in Manila, Jakarta, and Yangon. 52 Godwin, John. 2010.

Sometimes these behaviours are risky to their health, especially if they are unaware of the risks involved and how to protect themselves. Communities can help. Group-based, peer-led services such as workshops, camps, social and cultural events were highlighted as a method that can engender a sense of community, family and connection between young MSM and transgender people. These services provide a \u2018sense of belonging\u2019 as well as \u2018role modelling\u2019 and \u2018positive reinforcement\u2019 for many participants. University\ufffdcampus\ufffdoutreach\ufffdin\ufffdJakarta Inter Medika Foundation in Jakarta delivers a programmecalled GLBT Goes to Campus in which outreach workers provide education and distribute condoms to students at university campuses. One element of this programme includes a peer education team that specifically targets young men who choose to not publicly admit their sexual behaviours or self-identify as MSM.

In the writing and production of the Love Audition mini-series, Vittaya Saeng-Aroon of Global Fish Media undertook a series of focus groups with young MSM in Bangkok and found that Thai gay teenagers were not always using condoms, often because their poorself image affected their confidence in negotiating condoms with sexual partners.

Human rights campaigns can help address these barriers and improve access to health services and legal representation for key affected populations and PLHIV. New initiatives in many of the six cities are now focusing on human rights and the law and working to build municipal government ownership of human rights programmes for key affected populations, and specifically to create government-supported programmes to inform key populations about laws and human rights, receive and compile reporting about human rights violations, and ensure positive and appropriate responses from relevant administrative and judicial authorities. Rights-based campaigning and its local contributions to HIV Three examples are highlighted in the boxes below; they discuss different approaches to campaigning. The examples below highlight the potential that rights-based GLBT organisations and campaigns can play in enabling the environment for HIV services. By working with experienced human rights campaigners and organisations, they can improve their skills in campaigning to improve the HIV health service delivery environment for MSM and transgender people locally.

This decision stemmed from a recognition, he said, that \u201c many of my friends [were] unable to access information... [including information] about HIV provided by NGOs... for so many reasons.\u201d Widodo Budidarmo, a founding member of Arus Pelangi, said his group has \u201cvery good relationship[s] with legislative members and they really support our movement.

The decision catalysed the mobilisation of gay and other MSM community groups to petition a counterclaim to be heard through the Philippines Supreme Court in 2010. Jethro Patalinghug, a Filipino TV producer, and Nicolo Cosme, a photographer, mounted an online rights campaign in which they photographed celebrities and posted their headshots with quotes supporting the GLBT movement. Later, Jethro Patalinghug went on to apply his skills to the Take the Test Initiative and coordinated a mobile HIV testing and counselling clinic in Puerto Galera. His negotiating experience helped him coordinate the involvement of the community sector, medical and government sectors. Defending\ufffdthe\ufffdQ!\ufffdFilm\ufffdFestival\ufffdin\ufffdJakarta In Indonesia, the core group of volunteers who annually organise the Q! Film Festival in Jakarta plays an important role building relationships and advocating for MSM and transgender people. The festival faces stiff opposition from Muslim groups and from legislative threats such as the Anti-Pornography Act. Organisers have so far managed to protect themselves from these threats by, among other strategies, ensuring good relationships with national and provincial Indonesian government leaders; working closely with and garnering the support of foreign embassies in Jakarta; and aligning themselves with the international Teddy Awards for the Berlin Film Festival. 59 UNDP. 2010.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcfff9b3-ebe1-4ed8-baaf-e6484eefdec0": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcfff9b3-ebe1-4ed8-baaf-e6484eefdec0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b094a70c9d969d72b6fb06c798f220ff922081c865807ef362db9863ce3bb333"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2baa968-e73d-430d-8d93-bf954b059906", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d93a88d7943111bf27fac16b3e6308002d3d0656aad529e6157a767465e12f61"}}, "hash": "0d411b6939e8f4a692ac25f98806ef8b0a136866330c013425d6f31f4deff607", "text": "59 UNDP. 2010.

These include government departments easing the way for peer outreach workers to conduct their activities; strategies to fund community organisations prevented from registering as community organisations; and strategies for working with the police. Easing the way for peer outreach workers A number of examples of megacities taking legislative and administrative steps to ease the way for peer outreach workers and two examples from Ho Chi Minh City are provided in the case studies below. national laws to facilitate outreach in Ho Chi minh City The UNDP and APCOM Legal Environments Report discusses Viet Nam\u2019s Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control (2006), which states that \u201chomosexual people will be given priority access to information, education and communication on HIV/AIDS prevention and control\u201d (Article 1), andDecree 108 on Implementation of Articles of the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control(2007), which \u201cprovides that harm reduction interventions [including condoms] are to be provided to MSM and sex workers.\u201d The decree stipulates that identity cards should be issued to harm reduction outreach workers and that these workers are protected from prosecution \u201cif they have notified the People\u2019s Committee and the police prior to conducting outreach\u201d61 and carry identification cards with them at all times. The Provincial AIDS Committee has issued these cards to Blue Sky Club outreach workers who now show them if stopped by police or other authorities. 60 UNDP. 2010.

In addition to hosting forums with local authorities to explain the importance of these HIV initiatives, the city\u2019s harm reduction program also provided stamped letters to each venue that owners could show authorities. This step was said to increase confidence and participation in \u2018edutainment\u2019 activities. Blue Sky Club plans to scale-up edutainment services in five other districts in Ho Chi Minh City in a partnership with the Provincial AIDS Committee. Supporting unregistered community organisations The UNDP and APCOM Legal Environments Report found that a number of countries in the Asia Pacific region have laws preventing or restricting community organisations from obtaining legal status.62Such obstacleslimit their ability to attract government and donor funding and threaten their sustainability. The examples below highlight strategies for funding and supporting unregistered groups in Yangon. Helping communities to organise in yangon The Yangon scan found an interesting approach to funding unregistered groups and networks being implemented by the HIV/AIDS Alliance Myanmar. The Alliance identifies small groups of MSM and transgender people, provides training in mobilising among these key populations and train- the-trainer skills, and then supports these groups to deliver workshops on HIV to their networks. Eight groups from different parts of Myanmar are funded under this programme, which also has supported the groups in developing skills in grant application and management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03095c7f-38d7-4eb6-8d8e-7cf1e16da8d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "03095c7f-38d7-4eb6-8d8e-7cf1e16da8d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "250ff9ca4cfde787f383e8575d7b0d03deed89718ab8895337952cacad578cda"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e88aedc-b4ce-4222-a122-02b3f3317d49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c441b5515ed150d433d61c4bc43a2b1468e74c3fce923f2605c3232aa15e7e6"}}, "hash": "4dbd87602ca522ec77686fab1fe76824f01262a9754677c27fd0462b95ff6dbc", "text": "Healthy Living Helping Society is one example of a group that has gone on to achieve considerable success locally in attracting funds from the American Foundation for AIDS Relief (amfAR) and the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7cb4308-d15d-4e44-9c14-553a2e433e31": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7cb4308-d15d-4e44-9c14-553a2e433e31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c39194aefd82a288f1596f53cc178648ad7beded26e6cc9f76ff11176d37dd4"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fc51eb7-9850-47ec-8446-0f3a6079fb46", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/towards-universal-access-examples-municipal-hiv-programming-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-six-asian-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20d819ad7b7c0c4ca601e6542dabcdda469ffbf4df784af55c2573407479c22a"}}, "hash": "74cae0d3d80bc8c6c66692643c6ef2dee251f85152a31d988baa3d20818bd5a8", "text": "(ITPC). The Myanmar National MSM Network Initiative was formed in 2009 and comprises the leaders and groups originally funded through the alliance\u2019s grant programme. This approach demonstrates how it may be possible to build and sustain civil society responses starting with small, informal groups and mentoring them over time to build their capacity to contribute to the civil society response to HIV locally. Such an approach could be used to strengthen the provision of HIV treatment, care and support among MSM and transgender people living with HIV across the region. Working with the police The city scans highlighted a number of ways to successfully work with the police to improve the environment for condom use and access to HIV services. 62 Ibid. p. 3. 34 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities \u201d Working\ufffdwith\ufffdpolice\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok,\ufffdYangon,\ufffdand\ufffdHo\ufffdChi\ufffdMinh\ufffdCity Bangkok\u2019s Gay Sauna Initiative in 2000 aimed to respond to a government crackdown on \u2018immorality\u2019 in Thailand in which police were using condoms as evidence of sex work to arrest and close venue managers and to arrest their clients. The impact was a dramatic reduction in the use of condoms when HIV incidence was increasing sharply among MSM and transgender people. At the time, Khun Nikron emerged as an important community champion along with members of Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand. He used his sophisticated network of business and local government relationships to lobby for exemptions for gay saunas in the interests of public health. The Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations assisted Rainbow Sky and Bangkok Rainbow by provided funding and support to set up a meeting among representatives from the Thai Ministry of the Interior, the Department of Health, sauna owners and police. The result was an agreement by the Ministry of the Interior to provide letters to local police stations instructing them to take a \u2018hands off\u2019 approach\u2019 to the city\u2019s gay saunas. Similar to the Ho Chi Min City approach taken to support HIV \u2018edutainment\u2019, copies of the letter were provided to gay sauna owners who then kept these letters at their receptions to show police teams coming to raid the site. Condoms continued to be made available in the saunas, with no threat of repercussion for their use in those settings. In Yangon, Medicines du Monde\u2019s Police Force Engagement Initiative also used dialogue to build cooperation between local police and HIV health programmes. The goal was to reduce arrests and detainment of female, male and transgender sex workers and gay and other MSM and transgender people when condoms are found on their persons. In Ho Chi Minh City, the government\u2019s harm reduction programme, working with Blue Sky Club, held a series of meetings and discussion workshops involving community organisations and government departments (including representatives from the judiciary, law enforcement, health, and welfare agencies) to explain the club\u2019s outreach and edutainment work and to seek their support in taking a \u2018hands off\u2019 approach to enforcement of the law for the sake of public health. As in the other cities, an important result was that members of these key affected populations faced less of a threat of arrest and detention simply by having condoms in their possession. dialogue between police and sex establishments in manila Action for Health Initiative, Inc (ACHIEVE) in Manila engaged in an initiative to improve communication, dialogue and cooperation among the police, sex venue owners and city government health officials. In partnership with Quezon City Health Department, ACHIEVE organised a dialogue involving the Quezon City Police Department and SAMACKA (the association of establishment/venue owners in Quezon City). This initiative is in its formative stages and forms part of an ongoing strategy to improve cooperation among police, entertainment establishments and city health officials in relation to condom distribution in venues where sex is sold. While it remains an open and ongoing discussion, this first conversation helped to raise and clarify inconsistencies between local ordinances mandating the health department to distribute condoms in \u2018entertainment\u2019 establishments and provisions of anti-trafficking legislation currently used by police to justify condom use as the basis for raids and detention of sex workers. 5.4 Champions for health and rights programming \u201cThe death of a friend [from HIV] strengthened my resolve to do something.

Manila City Scan Report: Take the Test Campaign; p. 173. 35 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities Findings from the city scans reinforced the important impact of champions in improving HIV responses targeting MSM and transgender people. The scale and reach of HIV services to MSM and transgender people as well as their quality and effectiveness were greatly enhanced by champions across all sectors. Many of these champions deliver services and advocate on behalf of MSM and transgender people within the social structures where they have influence. City government champions are vital to encouraging comprehensive government support Champions within city governments can affect positive change across entire government structure and systems. The capacity of these champions to influence \u2018up\u2019 to senior bureaucrats and politicians, \u2018across\u2019 to other government departments, and \u2018down\u2019 to local authorities, law enforcement and medical service sites at district and suburban levels was highlighted. City government champions in Ho Chi minh City In Ho Chi Minh City, community advocates report that staff at the government harm reduction programme are helping community organisations to remove barriers at the local level in the delivery of services across the city. The department also successfully garners the support of the Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s People\u2019s Committee and the Fatherland Front Organisation \u2013 two essential bodies in decisions made in regards to health at the city level. It is worth noting, however, that city scan findings were inconclusive as to whether this level of city government championship resulted in significant public health changes. There was also little evidence of a coordinated approach to improving demand among MSM and transgender people for public health services in Ho Chi Minh city. City government champions in Chengdu Several years ago the Chengdu Center for Disease Control (CDC) formed a community, hospitals and government cooperative committee to assist with coordination and cooperation across the sectors responding to HIV. \u201cThere are many different HIV/AIDS resources,\u201d explained Dr. Han De Lin, director of the HIV Department at Chengdu CDC. \u201cI think it is important to integrate them together as then we can all be more efficient.\u201d64 The coordination role of Chengdu CDC has been highlighted by all Chengdu respondents in the Multi-City Scan interviews, thus suggesting the Municipal CDC is very useful to them all \u2013 including in resolving service delivery issues and difficulties. Dr. Han of the Chengdu Municipal CDC documents the impact of this coordinated approach by noting that the coverage of services to MSM is now \u201cmuch higher than before\u201d and services to PLHIV are also more widely available. \u201cChengdu now services three hundred more MSM living with HIV than it did three years ago,\u201d she reported.65 However, although representatives from Chengdu CDC and Tongle (an MSM-led community organisation) believe that there is an enabling environment for MSM even without anti-discrimination legislation, other stakeholders contradict this view, stating that the environment remains hostile and that legislative reform should be an important priority for the city and the country. The lack of consensus highlights the need for more work on the role of legislative change in the response to HIV in Chengdu and in China. Medical champions and their vital impact on HIV service delivery for MSM and transgender people Medical champions are doctors and nurses involved in the public health system who are actively engaged in advocating for improved HIV and STI testing and counselling for MSM and transgender people. Medical champions often have innovative ideas for scaling up services which remain untapped. 64 UNDP. 2010.

Estianti first facilitated collaboration between clinical staff and MSM and transgender community service organisations. The specialized clinic subsequently established close relationships with government health facilities, including in regards to referrals both ways, depending on needs.

The clinic provides reports on the programme to both the Ministry of Health and the Commission. The clinic has a medical intern programme that provides internships for three months for those who wish to develop their capacity in HIV and STI diagnosis and treatment. This is also a way to provide experience to medical students in working effectively with MSM and transgender persons. In Chengdu, Professor Zhang Jian-Xing of the China-UK HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Project initially approached Dr Yu Shoa-Ming at the Sichuan Architecture Hospital to establish an MSM STI clinic on site. Yu then championed its establishment within the hospital and across MSM community organisations and was successfully able to convince the hospital board for the need to provide MSM-friendly, low cost or free STI diagnosis and treatment services. Community champions and their vital impact as local advocates, specialists and coordinators The city scans provide numerous examples of community champions who help to coordinate, advocate and provide specialized skills to improve the ability of community organisations to provide HIV services to MSM and transgender people. Across all cities, champions surface as sources of expertise, leadership, support and advocacy for social change. They are able to generate increased support for MSM and transgender people\u2019s services because of their passion and commitment to the issues and often because of the connections they have across municipalities. They also seem to understand the cultural contexts and the limits of advocacy and influence, and thus are able to work effectively within these limits. In many situations, champions across sectors are sensitive to working together to generate increased support. Community\ufffdchampions\ufffdin\ufffdBangkok,\ufffdManila,\ufffdand\ufffdYangon In Manila, Bric Bernas, the executive director of The AIDS Society of the Philippines, returned to the country after many years of experience in HIV service delivery in New York City. In Manila he is implementing much of what he learned during his time in the United States. In Yangon a group of openly gay and other MSM have collaborated since 2007 to maintain a website called MgEDU that provides an online space for social contact, HIV education and support, and general news and information for gay and other MSM in Myanmar. In Bangkok, Vittaya Saeng-Aroon from Global Fish Media facilitated coordination among partners and provided specialist skills for his Love Auditions online miniseries. In Jakarta, Widodo Budidarmo, a founding member of Arus Pelangi, has been one of many champions who helped to sustain the work of this community-based organisation. Celebrities and the attention they bring to HIV initiatives As noted in several examples in this report, local celebrities can play an important role in generating interest among MSM and transgender people in HIV initiatives and can also help build crucial support outside these communities. Blue Sky Club\u2019s\u2018edutainment\u2019 activities in Ho Chi Minh City and the Sedona Township Transgender Beauty Contest in Myanmar highlight particularly effective use of celebrities. 37 Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities Conclusion Integrating enabling environment innovations in to city government policy making, programming and annual resourcing of enabling environment projects is recommended to assist local scale up of HIV responses to MSM and TG people across megacities in Asia.

PACIFIC ISLANDS 1 2 Introduction Background The Pacific islands have some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the world, with obesity rates as high as 75% and diabetes rates as high as 47% in some countries1. Increasing reliance on imported foods has contributed to an \u2018epidemic\u2019 of obesity and related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the region2 . In 2011 Pacific Island Forum Leaders as part of the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum communiqu\u00e9 declared the Pacific in a crisis due to the non-communicable disease epidemic. Several trade agreements currently being negotiated by the Pacific island countries are likely to have a big impact on future ability to address NCDs, including PACER Plus (being negotiated between the Pacific Island Forum Countries including Australia and New Zealand) and the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the European Union. For example, reductions in tariffs (import taxes) on unhealthy products such as fatty meats, tobacco and alcohol could lower the prices of these products, contributing to obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Trade agreements can also restrict governments from introducing policies and laws to address NCDs, such as bans on certain products, restrictions on food labelling, etc. There is a need for closer engagement between the health and trade sectors in (i) developing health promotion strategies to address NCDs that are compliant with existing trade commitments; and (ii) contributing to the design of trade policies and trade agreements that are health promoting. The concept of policy coherence asks that health policies and trade agreements are formulated in ways which enable both trade objectives and public health objectives to be met at the same time. The need to work towards closer coherence between health policy and trade policy has been recognised in World Health Assembly Resolution 59.263 and reiterated in many regional meeting and research reports. Capacity development is needed to support such collaboration. In August 2011 during the NCD forum in Tonga, health offficials with responsibility for NCD prevention and management from 14 Pacific island countries were interviewed regarding their capacity for health-trade collaboration in their countries. The findings from these interviews substantiate anecdotal evidence and concerns previously expressed in the literature that the health sectors of Pacific island countries are generally not well equipped to initiate cross-sectoral discussions about health and trade. Capacity building strategies that were prioritised most highly included training in technical disciplines such as epidemiology and health economics; support from regional organisations (particularly country-specific advice); and earning opportunities for health officials (focused on understanding trade agreements) and trade officials (focused on understanding the impact of trade agreements on NCDs). Also emphasised was a need for different sectors (health officials, trade officials, clinicians, civil society, media etc.) to coordinate interventions in the intersection between trade and health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d7a302f-bc24-4c7f-acbf-478807e523a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d7a302f-bc24-4c7f-acbf-478807e523a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b628462eaedd60d8e362173fe9f1fdab9b16f0bb436277a7be21025f20aa0d38"}, "2": {"node_id": "9101182e-e01e-42e6-a741-6abc59798438", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b87b97e1166a3d30758f7cf5c8a74b05dd2564245cc5368b17246468738082b"}}, "hash": "d69be6fcf87b33e12563f432da388ec7ec34e02c8f1691a9b6d4550dc70b0e1d", "text": "to coordinate interventions in the intersection between trade and health.

Goal and Objectives of the Workshop The overall goal of the workshop was to strengthen the capacity for effective collaboration between health and trade sectors in and across the Pacific Island countries, with a view to working towards trade relations which support health-promoting environments and accessible, affordable, available and adaptable health care and thus contribute to eliminating the excessive burden of NCDs in the Pacific Islands. Objectives 1. To encourage a shared understanding between health, trade, planning and civil society on the health implications of trade agreements in the Pacific 2. To identify tools and systems for assessing the potential impact of trade agreements on health, and health policy on trade 3. To draft country strategies for developing trade policies that support health, and health policies that are trade compliant Opening Statements The workshop began with an opening prayer from Dr Isimeli Tukana. The opening address was given by the Attorney-General, and Minister for Justice, Anti-Corruption, Public Enterprises, Communications, Civil Aviation, Tourism, Industry and Trade Mr Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum. Mr Sayed-Khaiyum indicated that there was a need for a balancing act between trade and the efforts to control non-communicable diseases. He stressed the need to take the best of what trade agreements could offer, while ensuring they did not add to the NCD challenge. He highlighted some of the efforts the Government had made to support the fight against NCDs, including changing import duties on healthier and less healthy foods, alcohol and tobacco. Opening remarks were also given by Dr Ezekiel Nukuro of the World Health Organization. He highlighted the scale of the NCD issue in the region, and the commitment given at global and regional level to tackling the problem. He emphasised how trade agreements and trade are affecting the supply of goods in and out of the region and stressed the importance of health being protected. There is also a need for greater understanding of how trade and health intersect. Opening remarks were then delivered by Mrs Fekitamoeloa \u2018Utoikamanu, Deputy Director General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community. Mrs \u2018Utoikamanu said the interests of public health should be considered in trade negotiations and that there was a need for \u2018compatibility\u2019 between government efforts to minimize the negative impacts associated with unhealthy products, and international commercial treaties that promote the freer flow of goods, services and investment. Workshop participants were then asked to briefly introduce themselves and Dr Wendy Snowdon gave an overview of the aims and objectives of the workshop, and the programme content. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 3 4 Session 1: The intersection of trade and NCDs: an overview This session intended to provide an overview of health and trade intersection in the region, with a particular emphasis on NCDs. Dr Wendy Snowdon introduced this session, using an interactive \u2018clicker\u2019 session where participants were asked to use remote clicker devices to answer questions. Questions focused on underlying causes of NCDs and food insecurity, and where trade and NCDs may be interlinked in their country. Dr Temo Waqanivalu then provided an overview of NCD epidemiology and control in the region. He indicated that 75% of deaths in the region are due to NCDs and mostly premature.

He emphasised that 60% of global deaths are due to NCDs and many of these premature deaths are now occurring among people who live in low and middle income countries. NCDs are clearly no longer synonymous with wealthy countries with ageing populations. Poverty increases the risk factors for NCDs through unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol, tobacco use and low physical activity rates. NCDs in turn increase the risk of poverty through health care costs, disability and premature death which cause decreased household income and further exacerbate the risks to poverty. Poverty, socio-economic determinants and NCDs in low and middle income countries Dr Xuereb then discussed how the social determinants of health influence NCDs and require a multi-stakeholder and cross- sectoral approach and call for countries to intervene at specific levels to affect the social structure (including gender), education and employment, trade and fiscal policies and purchasing power. He highlighted that since trade agreements are often quite broad in scope, i.e: covering trade in goods and services, regulation of intellectual property rights (IPRs), labour mobility, protection of foreign investments, phytosanitary regulations and the supply of goods and services to government; they can affect the social determinants of health which in turn have a high influence on NCD risk factors and the management of NCDs. Dr. Xuereb concluded that there are both benefits and risks for health in these agreements which require careful consideration. Dr Wendy Snowdon provided examples of how upstream determinants were affecting NCD risk factors, with a focus on diets and food supply. She outlined how store surveys had identified 54 countries of origin for foods sold in five countries in the region. The impacts of foreign direct investment including by fast food chains and of urbanization on diets were also discussed. Even aid post-disaster has contributed to long-term changes in dietary patterns in selected countries. Results of 5 country study on processed foods: 54 countries of origin of foods During the discussion, concern was expressed by one participant about a recent supermarket promotion in Fiji which gave away various high fat, sugar and salt items to customers. While consumers could refuse these items, there is also a need for work with all aspects of food industry including retailers so their activities support public health. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 5 6 Session 2: Trade agreements and how they can intersect with NCDs This session intended to introduce the intersection of trade and NCDs, from a trade perspective. Dr Benn McGrady began this session with another round of thought-provoking questions using the \u2018clickers\u2019. This included questions on how participants perceived the trade agreement development process and benefits in their country and the scope to implement trade regulation to address NCDs. Dr McGrady then spoke on the trade architecture and mechanisms in the Pacific Islands. The underlying feature of trade agreements is a commitment to lower barriers to trade (both tariff and non-tariff). Non-tariff barriers include quotas which might limit import amounts or health regulations. Dr McGrady indicated that the World Trade Organization (WTO) was the central multilateral instrument of the international trade regime.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "486b4ff1-2cef-4f86-8907-d76aad7cd50a": {"__data__": {"id_": "486b4ff1-2cef-4f86-8907-d76aad7cd50a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b97e3359273dbfdacf8ef76285c8adeca3d32e37b7bbcc9c7951c4c87041e33e"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a275d94-899c-44ac-9372-845b46c5e844", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35f4ec2f58012c90e80f0526c2e9ebfe05a8da77324cb6411842a2e5e9093627"}}, "hash": "f6ad38e7716255b395f4306acde3be9c33bbbb3654ca0a6e7f3dbc5d0a93e425", "text": "The WTO agreements place upper limits on the imposition of tariffs (customs duties) on imported goods and restrict the use of non-tariff barriers to trade, including regulatory measures.

Trade agreements which exist or are under consideration in the Pacific include PICTA, SPARTECA, EPAs and PACER Plus. Nicky Anaturin from the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) provided further information on the trade agreements in the region. He highlighted that 7 countries were currently trading under PICTA, with 4 yet to complete necessary domestic arrangements, and that other countries are yet to join. PICTA was regarded as a stepping stone for PACER Plus. EPAs are intended to be an instrument for development, and to assist Pacific Islands to be integrated into the world economy, as well as to achieve sustainable development and eradicate poverty, enhance production, supply and trading capacity and improve capacity to handle all trade-related issues. Progress has been made in recent trade negotiations in October and December 2012 for EPAs and negotiations are expected to be concluded by mid-2013. PIFS is also assisting small island states to develop and implement Trade policy frameworks to mainstream trade plans into trade policy, with a focus on: trade policy analysis and negotiations, trade facilitation and export development. Dr Sripen Tantivess shared an example of how health and trade agreements had overlapped in Thailand in the area of tobacco control. She highlighted the considerable burden of NCDs, and the importance of tobacco smoking as a risk factor. Since late 1980s government agencies, in collaboration with civil society organizations and private businesses, have introduced several measures to curb tobacco consumption. During the same period, smoking prevalence significantly declined. Excise tax rate, revenue and smoking prevalence, Thailand 1991-2011 Evidence suggests that raising excise tax was effective in reducing smoking, especially in low-income groups. However, this intervention was challenged under regional and bilateral free trade agreements (FTA), which required the elimination of tariff on tobacco products. Dr Tantivess also described how trade agreements under discussion may cause problems for tobacco efforts if the Thai government does not balance health concerns with economic benefits of these agreements on the agriculture and industry sector. In this respect, intersectoral, evidence-informed policy development is essential for health protection. During discussion of these three presentations a question was raised about whether any of the excise taxes in Thailand went to health promotion activities. Dr Tantivess clarified that 2% of the excise act were transferred to a Thai Health promotion Foundation. It was also highlighted that alcohol, food and tobacco cannot be tackled in exactly the same way, although some lessons may be drawn from successes in these areas. For example: that efforts are needed to increase access to healthy foods e.g. through support for local agriculture as well as reducing access to less healthy products. An additional question requested suggestions of what might be health-supporting interventions, which are trade compliant. Dr McGrady indicated that for tariffs, non-discriminatory excise taxes are preferred. Dr McGrady next presented on trade rules and their implications through a series of case studies. Indonesia argued discrimination when they were unable to export clove cigarettes to the United States, although menthol cigarettes were imported. The WTO panel had to consider whether clove and menthol were \u2018like\u2019 products, and whether restriction was more restrictive than necessary to protect human health. Indonesia lost its case. In regard to the adoption of plain packaging for tobacco, Australia is being challenged on the basis that the measure is restricting the use of a trademarks (tobacco company symbols and brands). A second case study was presented on the French ban on the import and sale of asbestos products. Canada complained under GATT (part of WTO) arguing discrimination as France uses asbestos substitutes (which pose no danger to health). The WTO panel found that the measure was discriminatory and favoured French substitutes but still ruled in favour of France because the measure was necessary for health. The final case study was on retread tyres, which Brazil banned the import of. They argued retread tyres have maximum lifespan of 5 years and then are discarded creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes. In fact less trade restrictive measures were available i.e. waste disposal, spraying, and ultimately the measure was found to be unlawful. During the plenary discussion questions were raised about the level of evidence needed to prove that something was harmful to health. Dr McGrady indicated that it was largely about assessing the risk, however there are no strict evidentiary requirements. It is important to ensure that product selection is consistent and \u2018like\u2019 products are regulated in similar ways, rather than targeting one particular product.

Multilateral trade agreements contain rules allowing for the adoption of measures to protect public health, even when such measures may violate parties\u2019 obligations. Article XX(b) of GATT 1947, for instance, has been invoked in certain cases as a justification for trade restrictive measures. GATT/WTO jurisprudence has subjected the application of this provision to the so-called \u2018necessity test\u2019, in accordance to which only the least trade-restrictive available measure would be permissible. In the Thailand-Cigarettes case, a panel rejected arguments based on article xx(b) . In Canada-Asbestos, however, the Appellate Body clarified that \u2018(1) the protection of health is a national objective of vital importance; (2) WTO members are free to select the level of health protection they believe appropriate for their populations; and (3) in cases analyzing measures to protect human health under the necessity test, the potential effectiveness of less trade -restrictive alternatives should receive strict scrutiny\u2019. One of the objectives of the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) is to enhance human health. WTO members can adopt standards higher than those recommended by the relevant international organizations if scientifically justifiable. The burden of proof is then shifted to Member countries. Governments should explore the ways for effectively using the public health-related provisions in the WTO system and in other trade agreements.

Prof Correa clarified that this was determined by parties to the dispute and the panel may also request expert opinions. Concern was expressed by one participant about CODEX standards which are promoted to be only food standards, not being of relevance for NCDs. Dr McGrady agreed that this was historically the case, with emphasis on food safety, however new areas were being discussed, such as trans fats4 . In the final session for day one, country teams were asked to share information about their country\u2019s situation in terms of both NCDs and trade and economic development, and to share any country-based examples of collaboration between health, trade and planning sectors. This was done through a pre-prepared poster, supported by a few minutes of explanation per team. This was a highly informative session for all participants, revealing considerable differences between countries and also some similarities. All countries highlighted their significant NCD burdens through mortality, morbidity and prevalence data. They also provided an overview of their NCD strategies and implementation approaches including multisectoral mechanisms (NCD committees) and regulatory interventions such as food regulations and sugar tax. Posters also included information on trade policies and economic country data, and their trade agreement environment. Civil society involvement in NCDs was also highlighted in some country presentations and some teams even identified actions they would pursue post-workshop to increase collaboration between trade and health. The presentations were lively and the posters provided a strong basis for the country group-work later in the workshop. Posters were left on display for closer examination during the remainder of the workshop. Example of posters developed by country delegates at the workshop Session 3: Regional cases where trade and NCDs have intersected The intent of this session was to consider regional examples of how trade agreements and NCD issues have intersected and how they have developed. The session began with a panel discussion on trade and economic development chaired by Dr Anne Marie Thow. Ahmed Moustafa began the panel by outlining the mixed results on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), across the region, with some good progress but also some issues. He also stressed that trade agreements do not directly lead to economic development, especially for countries in the Pacific. The markets for exports are already out there and accessible, with or without trade agreements, but the region has had problems with providing the supply. Additionally the market for primary commodities is highly volatile and competitive, to increase its earnings and the stability of these earnings, the region needs to move up value- added chain in terms of its exports.

Ms Falemaka also indicated that there was a need to consider health during development of trade policies and trade agreements, such as PACER Plus. For example, Vanuatu has a national trade policy, which integrates food security concerns. Dr Joann Young spoke of the work of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat in regard to consideration of health in trade agreements, using the EPAs as examples. When Nauru, as part of its\u2019 EPA was asked to liberalise its market, it was allowed to exclude 20% of items from the agreement listing. It chose to exclude chapters 17-19, and it therefore can leave its tariffs for European goods unchanged \u2013 this includes sugary products thus meaning its sugar tax can remain in place. Dr Young also indicated that there was a provision in EPA for export tariffs \u2013 and this is allowed for \u2018special development needs\u2019. Paulini Sesevu from AusAid then spoke on the role of AusAID in the region, its strategic priorities and its emphasis on poverty reduction. The final presentation on the panel was from Dr Eva Jarawan from the World Bank who outlined the World Bank\u2019s commitments on health and development in the region. This includes improving health and nutrition, enhancing the performance of health care systems and sustainable health care financing. Dr Jarawan then provided a brief overview of a recent study by World Bank on costs of specific NCD treatments in three Pacific island countries. In particular she emphasised how costs increased as diseases worsened. Costs of treatment in Vanuatu for diabetes Ms. Jarawan also stressed that the fiscal space for health was shrinking and according to World Bank projections, raising the excise rate on tobacco and alcohol to reach WHO recommended level would generate extra excise revenue of 3.6 million Tala for Samoa (USD 1.57 million) and 2.5 million Pa\u2019anga (USD 1.4 million) for Tonga each year, whilst discouraging uptake. 4 This also includes food labelling and claims. A shift from trade-based standards to consumer-based standards and guidelines is underway in the Codex Alimentarius. This is a shift from a prevention of fraud approach (1960s) to providing more consumer information (1990s) and increasingly towards delivering health policy through labelling. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 9 10 During the discussion component of the panel, it was highlighted by a participant that health officers need to ensure friendly and open dialogue with trade officers. There was a request from one country participant for more countries to have studies on costs of NCDs. Nauru asked if World Bank would include other countries going forward. Dr Jarawan responded that World Bank would need to assess the value of and interest in further studies in the region. Dr Thow, Christine Quested and Samuela Bolalailai then spoke on mutton flaps and turkey tails. Mutton flaps and turkey tails were banned in Fiji and Samoa respectively. In Fiji, the ban was a health and commerce collaboration, proposed by health and implemented by commerce in the year 2000. Mutton flap imports declined significantly, but due to difficulties with enforcement mutton flaps have reappeared on the market despite the ban. In Samoa, the ban, first put in place in 2007 on turkey tails was proposed by the Prime Minister and implemented by Customs after a cabinet brief supporting the measure was prepared by the Ministry of Health. The ban resulted in removal of turkey tails from the food supply \u2013 consumers replaced consumption with a variety of foods, including seafood and chicken, and some consumers reported eating less meat as a result of the ban. Samoa\u2019s ban on imported turkey tails has since been lifted as part of Samoa\u2019s accession to WTO. These case studies highlight bigger issues related to trade, food, agriculture and health. One is that unhealthy cheap imported food creates incentives for unhealthy diets, leading to NCDs. Another is that these cheap imports undercut local agricultural productions, leading to decreased production capacity and greater dependency on food imports. Dr Thow then spoke on the issues with agriculture, trade and NCDs. NCDs have implications for agriculture due to their negative effect on a productive labour force. The agricultural labour force is also affected by trade due to increasing labour mobility.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18ca19f3-f5a4-4dd3-b37e-487e8e1fa436": {"__data__": {"id_": "18ca19f3-f5a4-4dd3-b37e-487e8e1fa436", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8433914147980baf01626572137f3a67295ff561dd5429afa10ca7e73f0fb01"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a79897e-7cec-4569-a483-f21a948264e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1aade7469608048532289835742a7fd23e9375bb171efd0082bd67642c7fc304"}}, "hash": "f093b24f9b288c16c3a0f57a586c147bfa10e77cdd6213fff1e7e0269abbdeb7", "text": "The agricultural labour force is also affected by trade due to increasing labour mobility.

During the plenary discussions, a question was raised in regard to sustainability of bans, given problems experienced in Fiji and Samoa. Dr Thow suggested that fat-based standards which have been implemented in Ghana on fatty meats (effectively preventing sale of very fatty meat cuts) might be preferable to product specific bans. Dr McGrady also commented that these bans are not necessarily against WTO law, this depends on individual country accession agreements. What Ghana has done is consistent regulation across food product range, and this is much more in line with a WTO approach. A query was also raised about whether people had potentially shifted to other less healthy products when flaps or tails were unavailable. Ms Quested indicated that there had been no obvious shift to one alternative product, but overall to chicken and seafood, and also lowered consumption of meat overall. Dr McGrady also added that once a measure was in place, countries do not have to be able to demonstrate immediate impact (the long term impact is often more important). Dr Snowdon presented on sugary taxes in the region and began by outlining the evidence demonstrating links between high sugar intake, overweight, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is evidence of high consumption levels of sugar and other high-sugar items such as soft drinks in the region. Daily intake of soft drinks by 13-15 year olds (global school health survey) Dr Snowdon also highlighted how sugar and high fructose corn syrup (an alternative to sugar, particularly used in the Americas) were heavily used across a wide array of processed foods, and were cheap commodities, in part because of production subsidies. This has led to significant global interest in taxing sugary products in an attempt to reduce consumption, and taxes are now in place in many countries. In this region Samoa, Nauru, French Polynesia and the Cook Islands are some of the countries which have tariffs on sugary products and/or soft drinks. Evidence globally is that they can lead to reduced purchasing by consumers if the tariffs are high enough to be noticeable to the consumer. From a trade agreement perspective, these tariffs are unlikely to be problematic as long as they are applied equally to domestic and imported products, and if import duties are used then they must not exceed what has been agreed as the upper bound limit. Berrick Dowiyogo then spoke on the sugary tax that has been implemented in Nauru. This applies a 30% tax to a range of high- sugar products. Mr Dowiyogo commented that he has seen a greater supply of diet drinks since the tax. However, there has also been more sourcing of sugary products from Asia, which are cheaper, meaning that the price to the consumer for some products (e.g. can of soft drink) has not changed overall. During the plenary discussion it was emphasised any such measure needed to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive strategy (also addressing behaviours). Additionally, viable healthier alternatives need to be available and affordable. Concern was also expressed at possible side-effects of such tariffs, and it was emphasised that it was important to consider these prior to implementing a policy through health or social impact assessments. Peter Hoejskov spoke on the issue of salt and salt standards for sale or import. He highlighted how high sodium intake increases blood pressure and contributes to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Other damaging effects of high sodium intake include cancer, kidney disease, renal stones and osteoporosis. Raised blood pressure is one of the key intermediate NCD risk factors and cardiovascular diseases including stroke are among the leading causes of death in Pacific Island Countries. Population salt reduction has been found to be one of the most cost effective interventions for NCD prevention and control. Salt intake originates from three main sources: food prepared at home; food and meals prepared by the foodservice sector; and processed food.

Elsewhere, South Africa has developed standards for maximum content of salt in a range of processed foods. He encouraged the Pacific Island Countries to consider the possible effects of regulatory versus non-regulatory measures on population salt intake and to gather the necessary evidence to support these. Comparable prevalence of raised blood pressure in adults +25 yrs in 2008 Western Pacific Region (Mr Hoejskov - PowerPoint workshop presentation) Jeanie McKenzie then spoke about the experiences with the issue of exclusion of tobacco and alcohol from the Pacific Islands Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). She began with an overview of PICTA\u2019s development and then outlined the process that had resulted in alcohol and tobacco being excluded. This was primarily more about concerns over declines in duties and taxes than health issues. The need for early and thorough assessment of legal, socio-economic and health impacts before entering into trade agreements was highlighted, particularly to ensure policy coherence between trade and health. The interests of various stakeholders including national governments e.g. revenue/taxation, manufacturers and health interests, showed that finally the agreement on the exclusion of tobacco and Alcohol from PICTA suited all parties but for very different reasons; protectionism, lack of readiness to adopt tax changes and the growing concerns about NCDs. She also indicated that the long term future for the exclusion of tobacco and alcohol form PICTA is yet to be determined but the Forum Communiqu\u00e9 on Regional Health Initiatives \u2018acknowledged urgent need for health systems strengthening and cross-sectoral, whole of country initiatives to achieve better health outcomes at national level\u2019, which would indicate that alcohol and tobacco will continue to be excluded from PICTA for the foreseeable future. A comment was raised after this presentation that the exclusion of alcohol/tobacco from PACER Plus or EPAs may be more difficult, as the process is likely to be more stringent regarding exclusions as the discussions include non-Pacific island countries. Dr Benn McGrady then spoke about the relationship between the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and trade agreements. FCTC is an international treaty that binds Parties to implement a wide range of tobacco control measures. These measures include tax or price measures, mandatory warnings on tobacco product packaging and a comprehensive prohibition on tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion. The Convention is supplemented by guidelines designed to assist the Parties in implementing their obligations. All Pacific island countries (but not the Territories of the Pacific) are Parties to the WHO FCTC. Dr Lester Ross shared the experience of the Solomon Islands with tobacco control. The country has developed a comprehensive Tobacco Control Action Plan, tobacco-free school policy and a tobacco control Bill. More work is underway, to develop and enforce regulations for example, and there is a need to gain more support from important stakeholders such as Chamber of Commerce and Ministries of Commerce and Trade. Dr David Legge spoke about trade in services as part of trade agreements and how this might impact on health systems in the Pacific. He mentioned that the main agreement on trade in services is WTO\u2019s GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) but that most bilateral or regional trade agreements now have a Services Chapter which covers much of the same ground. The four modes of trade in services (i) cross border supply, (ii) consumption abroad, (iii) corporate presence, (iv) presence of natural persons. In health care these could be exemplified by: (i) telemedicine or internet transcription services; (ii) medical tourism; (iii) foreign investment in hospitals; (iv) importing doctors. Dr Legge argued that trade in services provisions are virtually irreversible and all of the benefits can also be achieved through development cooperation; because of the irreversibility, there is good reason to be very careful about committing to such agreements. Since GATS at least is negotiated on an \u2018opt in\u2019 basis he recommended that Pacific countries should be cautious about including health services or health related services in their \u2018offers\u2019. He expressed some doubt as to the significance of trade in services agreements for the Pacific. Dr. Legge also stressed that the interests of Pacific countries in relation to the four kinds of trade in services could be well advanced through international or commercial negotiation.

Prof Correa presented on the issue of access to medicines. The adoption of the TRIPS (Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) Agreement (part of WTO) brought about a drastic change in the policy space that countries had in regard to intellectual property (IP). Notably, TRIPS obligates all Member countries (with a transitional exemption for least developed countries only) to grant patents in all fields of technology, including pharmaceuticals. Patents create a tension with public health as they can permit the charging of high monopolistic prices on patented medicines. TRIPS contains, however, a number of \u2018flexibilities\u2019 that allow Members to mitigate the impact of exclusive rights including through: certain exceptions, compulsory licenses and parallel imports. The legal challenge by a number of multinational companies to block the use by South Africa of some of the TRIPS flexibilities eventually led to the adoption of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, in 2001 which confirmed those flexibilities. Despite this, developing countries still face the problem of proliferation of pharmaceutical patents on derivatives, formulations, new uses, etc. of known substances, which may unduly prevent or delay the commercialization of cheaper generic drugs. Non-WTO Members should use the policy space that they have to frame their IP regimes in accordance with their national interests. WTO members should use to the fullest extent possible the TRIPS flexibilities.

They were now rewriting their intellectual property legislation to be WTO compliant and made sure it encompassed TRIPS flexibilities (e.g. removing data exclusivity from its draft IP law). She highlighted the importance of the health sector being knowledgeable and engaged in trade issues and of cross-sectoral collaboration and coordination during development of trade agreements. She also added that health needs to get involved with trade even if feeling uncomfortable. During the plenary discussion, Dr Gleeson added that countries need to be aware of newer trade agreements (bilateral and multi-lateral) which include much more IP protection (known as TRIPS plus). A participant suggested that a system be created within Ministries of Health to train such professionals. It was also commented that it was important to verify the patent status of medicines, as absence of patents on certain medicines allow for importation of their generic, more affordable versions. Session 4: Assessing potential impacts of trade agreements on health and feasibility of policy options This session intended to briefly familiarise participants with some of the tools and methods available to assess trade agreements and policies for their relevance and health impacts. Dr Gleeson began with an overview of the methods and tools available for impact assessment. The focus of the session was on assessing the impact of trade agreements, but the methods and tools were also discussed in relation to assessing the impact of health policies. The three main methods discussed were Health Impact Assessment (HIA), Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA). Dr Gleeson explained that Impact Assessments can be conducted either ex ante (before or during trade negotiations, to highlight likely impacts and inform the negotiations) or ex poste (after a trade agreement has been implemented, to measure actual impacts and assist in identifying mitigating measures). Each of the methods discussed (HIA, SIA and HRIA) follow a similar series of steps, which includes screening, scoping, collecting information, assessing the information, making decisions and recommendations, and evaluation, monitoring and follow up. They all use a combination of data collection methods, which may include quantitative data (such as economic data) and qualitative data such as community consultations, focus group or key informant interviews. There are various practical guides available for all of these methods. While the methods are similar, there are important differences in the normative frameworks of these three methods. HIA focuses on the social determinants of health and the differential effects that policies can have on the health of different population groups. SIA includes a focus on the social, environmental and economic impacts of trade agreements. HRIA is explicitly referenced to the human rights obligations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4281cab0-2e8f-447e-9682-57304a08c86e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4281cab0-2e8f-447e-9682-57304a08c86e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cd6c2c58f2475cc0801a8d22a42be9860ea7b44da2b2ec74f511fb2dd3a734e"}, "3": {"node_id": "703bd28a-9d99-45a5-8342-cec2533a32cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dca3303ec3951509d2cc444071bb752130752f8b9b19867395db826818cb4a6"}}, "hash": "a5663f5cd4566b7f0eed3df94803c0f8b1b817c6a99b035b7ed8468fe6d416bd", "text": "of states and includes a focus of the impact on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. Issues that need to be considered in an impact assessment (whichever model is chosen): \u2022 When to conduct the impact assessment (before, during or after the negotiations, or as a cyclical process); \u2022 The appropriate scope and level of detail given the time and resources available; \u2022 Who is best placed to undertake the impact assessment (keeping in mind factors such as independence from the negotiations, expertise, and the implicit assumptions that different actors might bring to the task); \u2022 The best mix of methods for the particular situation; \u2022 Transparency (of objectives and decision making criteria, of consultation processes, and findings and recommendations) and inclusiveness; and \u2022 Opportunities for the findings to feed into policy decision making. Dr Wendy Snowdon, reflecting on her experience with HIA to predict the possible impact of introducing policies for health and nutrition on other health and social issues, emphasised the value of these tools to \u2018flag\u2019 policies which might have potentially negative side-effects and warranted further investigation before being considered for action. She also highlighted that the screening process was relatively simple to undertake in a participatory way with a strong working group and tool. Simone Troller then presented on Human Rights Impact Assessments. She stressed that Trade agreements and human rights conventions both impose legal obligations on countries, and therefore countries should make sure that one set of binding rules does not undermine another set of legal obligations. Trade agreements and policies can positively or negatively impact on people\u2019s enjoyment of their right, including their right to the highest attainable standard of heath; and they can positively or negatively impact countries\u2019 abilities to realize human rights, including the availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of health-related facilities, goods, and services. Increasing attention therefore is being paid to human rights impact assessments as a tool that provides countries with evidence on how to mitigate negative impacts of trade on human rights, including the right to health, and how to maximize positive outcomes. The UN has adopted guiding principles for assessing the impact of trade agreements and policies on human rights in 2011, and the same year the EU Parliament has called for human rights impact assessments to be carried out for all trade agreements with the EU. Brian Lutz discussed how statistics could be used to support analysis of impacts, with a focus on Household Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES). While evidence-informed policy-making requires reliable, regular data, especially on NCDs and their risk factors, obtaining primary data, can be costly. Analyzing secondary data (i.e., existing data collected through other means) could provide a workable \u2013 if sometimes imperfect \u2013 solution. Regularly administered in Pacific countries, the HIES captures relevant, disaggregated food expenditure at household level. This is collected through food frequency assessments and is used as an indicator of calorie/energy consumption. These data can be classified by users into four binary, non-mutually exclusive categories (e.g., imported/local, unhealthy/healthy, processed/unprocessed, non-traditional/traditional) to develop descriptive food profiles. Analyses can also be conducted that examine relationships among food classifications (e.g., imported and unhealthy food) and among food classifications and NCD risk factors (e.g., imported food and obesity). The approach can provide an indication of problematic foods at the nexus of health-trade policy. It can also be used potentially to estimate policy impacts and build policy impact scenarios.

Non-country participants were asked to discuss whether impact assessment should be used more systematically in the region, how countries might be better supported in assessing the impact of trade agreements on health and whether there is a case for regional level impact assessment. The outcomes of these discussions were picked up again in the country work on Day Four. Session 5: Towards health and trade policy coherence This session intended to consider how to build an environment where health promotion policies are trade compliant and trade policies support health. This session commenced with a presentation from Dr Tantivess on Health in all Policies, the Thailand experience. Health in All Policies (HiAP) is an innovative, horizontal policy strategy to improve population health and health equity. The focus of this is development of healthy public policy, across non-health sectors, which may have impacts on health such as agriculture, education, trade, industry and transport. In response to the need for health system reforms since 1980s, Thailand includes HiAP concept in its 2007 National Health Act. Under this law the National Health Assembly is annually convened, with the aim of providing public space where health problems and solutions are openly discussed among stakeholders from all sectors including government agencies, civil society organizations, private companies and provincial networks of lay people. Throughout the processes, deliberative exchange of knowledge, information and experience between different interests is encouraged as a means to pursue consensus on each resolution. During 2008-2012, evaluation studies indicated that the Assembly, as an alternative policy venue, provides opportunity for social mobilization and policy engagement of general public, although there is still substantial room for improvement. During plenary discussion a question was posed on how Thailand had been able to secure representation of the range of government officials and business people in the national health assembly and how does Thailand bring in people who are reluctant? Dr Tantivess responded that the process was now 5 years old and is currently being evaluated. The Commission has tried to solve the problem to make sure different sectors understand each other better, but the process is still fairly new and will take some time. She also emphasised that while alcohol and tobacco companies were excluded from the assembly; other companies are present including asbestos manufacturers. Dr Anne Marie Thow then presented on health promotion strategies which are trade compliant and trade policies which promote development and create healthy environments. This includes health promotion interventions consistent with commitments within trade agreements and policy interventions or improvements in coherence within trade, commerce, finance, agriculture. These policy directions must consider strategic framing of policy objectives that ensures that they are able to defend necessity and non-discrimination as key principles for trade compliance. Healthy trade policy includes: Trade policy and negotiations that are sensitive to protecting policy space for NCD prevention; and Implementation of specific interventions for health. Principles of healthy trade In developing these policy directions, assessment of health and other impacts is essential, as is ensuring flexibilities and policy space to protect public health. The opportunities created by collaboration between trade and health in the prevention and management of NCDs include: Potential for new strategic policy directions and innovation in NCD prevention; Development of more feasible multisectoral health interventions to prevent NCDs; and Pro-active engagement with trade negotiations to ensure public health is protected. A question was raised as to whether a country should pursue policy measures if they are associated with risk to other areas of health, or if countries should just pursue a health education approach. Dr McGrady emphasised that this is not either/or, policy and education may both be needed, but it\u2019s important to find the best approach. Prof Correa also added that in reality there is scope to try a policy measure, and then see if there is a WTO objection to it, and if there is then the measure can be revised, while if there is no objection, then the measure can be maintained. Prof Correa stressed that the WTO functioning is based on diplomacy and negotiation. Prof Carlos Correa then spoke about how to achieve trade agreements which progress healthy policy. He spoke of the importance of a clear identification of national interests in relation to NCDs and, more broadly, public health, being crucial when engaging in trade negotiations. It is also essential to assess the extent to which trade agreements may permit the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02fb4629-ce20-4d0d-9e6f-cbfa696727be": {"__data__": {"id_": "02fb4629-ce20-4d0d-9e6f-cbfa696727be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "292dc1f9b7a837cb042fe94bcbfb093ec8f1f7fae7ca43a20e91dfd84f5c146e"}}, "hash": "292dc1f9b7a837cb042fe94bcbfb093ec8f1f7fae7ca43a20e91dfd84f5c146e", "text": "achievement of such interests. Thus, access to markets will not automatically lead to an increase in exports; even if such an increase takes place, it will not automatically lead to poverty alleviation. Prof Correa also emphasised that the new generation of \u2018trade agreements\u2019 include a number of disciplines that limit governments\u2019 policy space, such as those on investment, labour and environmental standards. Investment disciplines, for instance, may be used (as illustrated by the cases of Uruguay and Australia relating to cigarettes packaging) to challenge public health measures. Improving the technical capacity to deal with the complex issues involved in trade negotiations is certainly crucial. But this is not sufficient to attain the desired objectives in the context of an asymmetric economic relationship, or when pursuit of a trade agreement is primarily driven by political reasons. Trade negotiations, should also be transparent; various government departments and civil society should be given an opportunity to continuously assess the process and express their concerns and aspirations. Trade compliant health policy Strategic framing of objectives Take into account necessity and non-discrimination Healthy trade policy Assess health and other impacts Protect public health policy space Strategic cross-sectoral engagement process Consultation when needed Notification to WTO when needed (Adapted from Dr Thow - PowerPoint workshop presentation) TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 17 18 Dr David Legge considered the role of advocacy in the pursuit of healthy trade in his presentation. He commenced this joint presentation by comparing trade policy to a \u2018tug of war\u2019 with various interest groups, industry lobbies, foreign corporations and foreign governments all pulling in different directions to better achieve their own objectives. Multiple pressures on trade policy For example, the multinational food industry had been very effective at the UN High level meeting on NCDs in ensuring that there were few references to regulation and where they appear they are very general. Dr Legge argued that while governments have a responsibility to manage these pressures and align the outcomes to the national interest, civil society participation in the conversation can be a very effective support for governments. Dr Legge described \u2018civil society\u2019 as including professional organisations, academics, NGOs, trade unions and churches. He instanced three NGOs which have been particularly influential in trade negotiations: Third World Network, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. Dr Legge returned to the South African Treatment Action Campaign which Prof Carlos Correa had mentioned earlier and described how civil society mobilisation had been critical to the success of this campaign including AIDS solidarity activists campaigning in both the US and in South Africa. Dr Deborah Gleeson then provided an additional example from Australia, and reflected on advocacy work undertaken by the Public Health Association of Australia around the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). She mentioned the concerns of civil society organisations including the impact of tighter intellectual property provisions and restrictions on pharmaceutical programs on the cost of medicines, and restrictions on the scope for governments to regulate for public health as a consequence of the proposed investor state dispute settlement provisions. Dr Gleeson described the many facets of this episode of civil society advocacy including writing submissions, literature reviews, consulting with experts, raising awareness, advocacy at public health conferences, and involvement in stakeholder events during negotiating rounds. This example highlights the important role civil society can play in providing a counter-balance to the industry interest groups and corporations, which lobby governments and trade negotiators to promote their interests through trade agreements. In the last presentation in session five, Henry Tunupopo shared the experience in Samoa of working intersectorally on trade issues. When Samoa decided to join the WTO a public-private stakeholder committee was set up, chaired by the deputy Prime Minister with participation of various government Ministries including foreign affairs, finance, health, agriculture, environment, Attorney General\u2019s office and SUNGO (a local civil society umbrella organization). Academia and other groups were also invited to join. The terms of reference of the committee is to provide advice to Cabinet on trade arrangements, so that cabinet may make informed decisions to ensure that Samoa\u2019s gains from trade arrangements are in line with international agreements and the county\u2019s interests. The committee signs off on all matters relating to trade agreements. Issues have ranged from tariffs and turkey tails, to quarantine regulations. Consultations have been considered to be effective and included the general public. Negotiations are not kept secret from other stakeholders. All members of committee were invited to negotiations; they were allowed to sit in the room during negotiations.

Briefly at the end of session five, sector teams met to consider what the strategies and structures operating in their countries to facilitate trade and policy coherence might be and how could they be improved. They were also asked to consider what might be best practices in ensuring trade and policy coherence. The feedback by the different sectors was undertaken in the country team groups during session six. Sessions 6 & 7: Way forward and commitments Country teams considered specific actions they would pursue and what further support they would need for this. To facilitate this exercise, Brian Lutz provided an overview of what the country team discussions could cover: 1. Feedback from sector teams from session five and consideration of how intersectoral collaboration in their country on trade and health could be achieved; 2. Review their national strategies and other relevant existing commitments on NCD policy interventions, and along with the public health interventions discussed in this workshop, draw up a \u2018possible\u2019 list of public health interventions; 3. Review each option for NCD impact, trade relevance and importance (using provided excel sheet templates) to develop a short list; 4. Develop this short list into a detailed action plan, including specification of support needed. The country teams then worked on these tasks for the remainder of day three of the workshop, and also for an hour on the morning of day four. Each country team was asked to prepare a ten minutes presentation on their action plans, using a provided PowerPoint template. Samoa Country Presentation The team from Samoa identified three top priority actions: \u2022 Completion and implementation of the WTO study on practical and realistic options to combat Samoa\u2019s health problems \u2022 Reduction in import tax on fruit and vegetables (to increase affordability) \u2022 Introduction of a tax on sugary products and sugar (to complement their existing tax on soft drinks) They identified partners who would need to be involved in each of these, including their National Working Committee on Trade Agreements, government Ministries, SUNGO and SPARKEL (advocacy group in Samoa). They also identified their external assistance needs including technical assistance in the areas of taxation, WTO, law, HIA and nutrition, and agencies that can provide this support. On the issue of building multisectoral collaboration, particularly between health and trade they identified challenges as being of sustainability and data availability. Their proposed solutions were to have back-up members for committees, capacity building for other sectors and to strengthen their information and data systems. Trade Policy Civil society Foreign governments Export industries Foreign companies TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 19 20 Fiji Country Presentation The team from Fiji then shared their action plan. Their top three action areas were identified as: \u2022 Graphic labeling on tobacco \u2022 Controls on alcohol advertising, promotion and sponsorship \u2022 Increased fiscal duty on alcohol They identified a need for technical support in the areas of policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation and enforcement. They also indicated that they needed a study on the economic impacts of NCDs in Fiji. In regard to the issue of intersectoral collaboration, they indicated a need to strengthen the existing National Trade Policy Committee and strengthen the development of evidence-based policy submissions. They also identified a need for impact assessments of trade agreements during accession discussion, and for capacity building on HIA. Additionally they suggested that there be a regional network on NCD awareness and knowledge sharing. Dr Neil Sharma, Minister of Health for Fiji commented that he was happy that the meeting had been held in Fiji and that Trade officials were being involved. He added that Fiji is trying to implement \u2018best buys\u2019 and have implemented tobacco registration fees to provide funding assistance for health promotion work. He also shared experiences of working with the food industry in Fiji, and that legislation may be needed when progress is slow. Tonga Country Presentation The team from Tonga spoke initially on their Technical Committee for Tax which was established by the Prime Minister in October 2012. The membership includes Revenue and Customs, Finance/National Planning, Health, Commerce and Trade (soon to be Foreign Affairs and Trade). The aim of the committee is to make the healthier choices the easier choices, through the development of cabinet submissions. The issues they identified for action were: \u2022 Removal of import taxes for tinned fish \u2022 Increased tax rate on dripping and lowered rate on vegetable oil to encourage a shift in fat consumption \u2022 Increased tax on sugary drinks The intended process", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d7a3864-b781-4c7a-80e8-a8a39bf73c9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d7a3864-b781-4c7a-80e8-a8a39bf73c9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37e1d56bd5678921c9319cbde4601fd8f2f0f72159ae050b04c201e4d0731538"}}, "hash": "37e1d56bd5678921c9319cbde4601fd8f2f0f72159ae050b04c201e4d0731538", "text": "was for the collection on data on quantity of imports and tariff rates from Trade, consultation with stakeholders and then work via their Technical Committee for Tax. They requested support for a review of their existing legislation, awareness campaigns before policy implementation and implementation of their MAF acceleration framework. In regard to multisectoral collaboration they emphasised need for health promotion to support policy change and acceptance, and clear responsibilities for policy enforcement to be defined. They also stressed the importance of ensuring that senior health officers were involved in trade negotiations, and that they would need to make an application to the respective Ministry to ensure this. Nauru Country Presentation The team from Nauru identified several areas for action: \u2022 Establishment of a committee on trade and health \u2022 Maintenance and improvement of sugar tax procedure and implementation \u2022 National workshop on trade and health connections to emphasise the importance of health in the Trade Policy Framework \u2022 Development of a mechanism for a health promotion fund, to support preventive measures They identified the key stakeholders who would need to be involved in each of these, including government ministries and external technical experts. In regard to multisectoral collaboration, they highlighted the importance of the above committee or of expanding on existing committees with health and trade. There was some discussion after this presentation on how to ensure actions progressed when multiple organisations were listed to lead actions. Vanuatu Country Presentation The presentation from Vanuatu identified the three key areas of action: \u2022 Maintaining high taxes on alcohol and enhancing alcohol policy \u2022 Establishing food standards to allow for stronger labeling and packaging regulations and taxing fatty foods higher \u2022 Increasing tobacco tax and a ban on the sale of locally grown tobacco. They identified that these actions would require multisectoral involvement from across the government, and that they would need financial and technical assistance, including some local capacity building in regard to food standards. A local food laboratory may also be required. They emphasised the importance of integrating health and trade policies, greater collaboration between health and trade committees and for developing an information exchange programme between health and trade. After the country presentation the possibility of regional food standards supported by regional or shared food testing was raised and discussed. Mr Hoejskov clarified that testing of the nutrient content of processed food can be done by existing laboratories in the region and is relative simple and inexpensive. Tuvalu Country Presentation To support healthy trade policy the team identified a need for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between health and trade, which would support greater information sharing, networking and incorporation of health issues into annual trade work plan. They also indicated a need for proper co-ordination of policy development, including consultations. Their priority action areas were also to: \u2022 Implement a tax on sugary, fatty and salty foods, alcohol and tobacco. This would need to be compatible with existing trade policies \u2022 To undertake a feasibility study on sourcing alternative domestic healthier foods \u2022 To undertake an impact assessment (health, gender and climate change issues) on PACERPlus and establish a monitoring system. They identified the need to involve a number of government departments in these actions, and also a need for some technical assistance and capacity building. During plenary discussion, the possibility of a regional impact assessment of PACERPlus was raised. It was agreed that this might be useful, however it would not replace the need for country specific impact assessments due to considerable inter-country differences. TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 21 22 Palau Country Presentation The team shared the content of the Executive Order number 295, in which the President of Palau ordered the Minister of Health to coordinate activities to manage the NCD crisis, including calling upon all Ministers and head of National government agencies to assist in his effort at tackling this national crisis. Additionally, the Minister of Health is requested to record all assistance from other Ministers and heads of national government agencies and report to the President every 6 months. A national NCD committee is already in place and includes representatives from across the government, civil society and private sector. Following an NCD summit early in 2012, a sub-committee on policy/legislation was formed. This committee includes Ministries of Justice, Health, Public Infrastructure, Industries & Commerce, Finance and Education. This committee would review existing legislation and priorities policies for action. The team emphasized a need for data on the burden of disease, health insurance and possibly other trade issues. They requested technical assistance and support for a cost of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2627db7f-dbe3-4603-9a44-c60ce0e5de2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2627db7f-dbe3-4603-9a44-c60ce0e5de2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Trade, Trade Agreements and Non-Communicable Diseases in the Pacific Islands", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/trade-trade-agreements-and-non-communicable-diseases-pacific-islands", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "864df990cae3b34a910cfb17343c41b18a4d76c07e96d6dc60e5f6433826d5fd"}}, "hash": "864df990cae3b34a910cfb17343c41b18a4d76c07e96d6dc60e5f6433826d5fd", "text": "NCD study, health impact assessment and also further training \u2013in- country on issues of trade negotiations and also taxation. A query was raised as to whether Palau was able to sign up for trade agreements, as under a Compact with the United States. It is able to so, as long as compliant/consistent with the Compact. Kiribati Country Presentation The team identified a number of action areas related to alcohol and tobacco prices \u2022 To remove tobacco from price control (via submission of concept paper, meeting and consultations with Parliament/ Cabinet) \u2022 Increasing tax on tobacco and alcohol: along with survey of effects on health, and consideration of implications of the intervention These would need to involve actions by Trade, Finance, Health and the Attorney Generals\u2019 office and may require some financial and technical assistance. They recognised issues of multisectoral collaboration and suggested they needed a balancing act towards common national goals. It was suggested that health be allowed to join the Trade Policy Advisory Committee (TPAC) and Trade and Finance become members of the NCD committee (NCDC), which would need to be mandated by Cabinet. Delegates developing and presenting action plans Overview Of Post-Workshop Support And Assistance Following the presentations from the country teams, Dr Wendy Snowdon shared the proposed way forward on behalf of C-POND, SPC, UNDP and WHO. It was suggested that country teams should before the end of March \u2022 Review their action plan and update if needed, based on further consideration \u2022 Discuss drafts with their respective CEOs /managers and incorporate their input \u2022 Forward revised PowerPoint presentations to the Secretariat contact point On receipt of these, C-POND, SPC, UNDP and WHO committed to review the action plans and discuss and agree on a joint approach to supporting each country. By 10th April, each country team would be contacted by the secretariat to advise them of how support would be provided, and by which organisation primarily. In-country support for actions and associated research and data gathering actions would then occur, in line with country needs. Additional capacity building would be considered at regional, sub-regional and national level. The scope of support was then further clarified, as shown below in figures three and four. Resources would be sourced from existing projects, existing programmes and through new sources. Scope of support Key areas of support Meeting Statement Discussions took place to draft and finalise a meeting statement entitled \u201c the Nadi Outcomes Document\u201d in line with the proceedings (See pages 24 \u2013 25). Closing Session Following the awarding of certificates to participants and an evaluation session, the Fiji Minister of Health Dr Neil Sharma delivered the closing remarks. He highlighted that this was a landmark meeting and that he was impressed with the interactions and contributions from countries. He thanked the organisers who have made this event possible. He was pleased to see collaboration occurring between sectors, through discussions and sharing of experiences. The Yanuca declaration introduced the concept of healthy islands and this workshop was really supporting those commitments and ideals. He also stressed that the involvement of the health sector in trade issues is important.

He added that Fiji has just upgraded its food labelling requirements and was now considering a new approach to support this. He emphasised his interest in regulating the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children in line with controls on the promotion of breast milk substitutes and tobacco advertising. He recommended countries to have national strategies which were aligned, time bound \u2013 and relevant for NCDs and trade. Berrick Dowiyogo then gave a vote of thanks on behalf of the participants. He thanked regional and international organisations for coming together and making this workshop happen. He mentioned that the workshop had been valuable for the participants and provided information and advice that they can take back and use in their countries to strengthen the intersection between NCDs and trade. Dr Tukana then provided a closing prayer.

Recognizing that at the Forty-Second Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland, New Zealand, the leaders of the Pacific were deeply concerned that an estimated 75 percent of all adult deaths in the Pacific were due to NCDs, with the majority of the deaths occurring in adults in the economically-active age bracket and that there are huge economic losses due to NCDs and the resultant impact on national health budgets and possibly the region\u2019s ultimate achievement of the MDGs. Recognizing that the WHA Resolution 59.26 also identified the need for ministries of health, trade, commerce, finance and foreign affairs to work together constructively in order to ensure that the interests of trade and health are appropriately balanced and coordinated. Recognizing that addressing social determinants of health, social inequality and poverty, as well as the legal, policy, and regulatory frameworks, is essential for development and enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Recognizing that a number of factors, including the protection of intellectual property rights, individual behavior and lifestyle choices, and national capacity to provide adequate health-related goods, facilities, and services, affect the prevention and treatment of NCDs. Recognizing that trade agreements provide both threats and opportunities for improving public health. Recognizing that health gains from trade are important for economic growth and sustainable development which in turn lead to exponential gains in the health of the country, including through the prevention of NCDs. Recognizing the essential role of civil society in advocating for healthy trade and in holding governments accountable with regards to policy commitments and legal obligations. Emphasizing that the Pacific region should not be treated as a dumping ground for unhealthy products that are unwanted in other countries TRADE, TRADE AGREEMENTS AND NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS 25 26 The workshop participants agreed on the need; - to apply or establish where necessary, coordination mechanisms involving ministries of finance, health and trade, and other relevant ministries, institutions and civil society to address the NCD crisis - to strengthen national capacities and regulatory mechanisms (where established) to include among others, undertaking impact assessments, introducing policies, including incentives (e.g. subsidies) and disincentives (e.g. taxation), which affect the risk factors for NCDs and participating in international trade negotiations - for international, regional agencies and development partners to continue to support countries including through provision of technical assistance to support policy coherence between trade and health sectors at a national and regional level and specifically enhance informed decision making and trade negotiations, - to accelerate the regional and national efforts to develop and implement food standards for relevant nutrients (e.g. fat, sugar and salt content in processed foods). The participants of the workshop agreed to communicate these outcomes to the upcoming Forum Trade Ministers Meeting (FTMM) to be held in Apia in 2013 and the Pacific Health Ministers meeting 2-4 July 2013 (Apia, Samoa).

Reports from networks of women living with HIV, as well as academic research in the region, show that it is a crucial factor in reducing women\u2019s vulnerability to violence and HIV, as well as empowering women to cope with the social and economic impact of the epidemic at the household level. With a view to evoking public and policy responses to the issue, the UNDP Regional HIV and Development Programme in Asia and the Pacific, in partnership with Asian Women\u2019s Human Rights Council (AWHRC), UNAIDS, UNIFEM and civil society partners including International Centre for Research on Women ( ICRW), Forum for Women, Law and Development (FWLD), INFORM, Lawyers\u2019 Collective, Positive Women\u2019s Network (PWN+) and Lanka+ organized the first ever Asia Pacific Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance and Property Rights in Colombo on 18 August 2007. The highlights of the Court, which was held in conjunction with the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP), included testimonials by 22 women from 11 countries in the region, special addresses by leading experts and a public statement by a jury of eminent citizens. This booklet and the film enclosed comprise the highlights of the Court and reflections by people concerned with the issues. While the film takes one directly to the Court proceedings, the intention of the booklet is to help set the context and serve as a companion.

In India, about 40 per cent of the epidemic burden is on women. There is unequivocal evidence to suggest that the HIV-vulnerability of women, most of whom are either married or monogamous, stems from the severe gender inequality that is prevailing in the region. Available evidence also suggests that HIV aggravates the deep- rooted gender disadvantages of women, disempowers them, and pushes them into vicious cycles of inequality, vulnerability, exploitation and poverty. An issue of serious concern in this context is the unequal rights of women to inheritance and property, which in many parts of the region has been severely exacerbated by HIV. Access to inheritance and property rights critically impacts a woman\u2019s ability to both help prevent and cope with the impact of HIV and AIDS. Property rights can play a crucial role in reducing the HIV-vulnerability of women because it strengthens the socio-economic status of women in communities and society. Women who own property or other assets are in a better position to resist violence and exploitation, negotiate safe sex and even cope with crises which in turn help to reduce their vulnerability to HIV. Studies in South Asia show that women with access to properties are less vulnerable to violence, and are in a stronger position to resist physical and psychological violence, compared to women without properties. Studies also show that women who own property and are widowed are less likely to engage in high-risk behaviour such as transactional sex. \u201cWith facts and figures, we often become numb to the realities. These personal testimonials bear witness to the socially sanctioned violence women experience at individual and societal levels. It also provides the space to hear and celebrate women who have persisted against all odds and succeeded in reclaiming their rights to housing, safe shelter, livelihoods and their families: \u201d Ms. Caitlin Wiesen Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Leader and Programme Coordinator, Asia and the Pacific, UNDP 6 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women For women infected and impacted by HIV, ownership and control over assets helps them to cope with the social and economic consequences of HIV and AIDS, including medical treatment and related expenses. Property can also serve as collateral for credit, enabling households affected by HIV and AIDS to deal with personal and financial contingencies. However, burdened by the care of their spouses, illnesses and running the household, women are often denied their rightful access to property when their spouses die. Reports from groups of women living with HIV/AIDS in the region such as Positive Women\u2019s Network (PWN+) show that they are often morally judged and blamed for the infection of their spouses and are burdened with taking care of their spouses when they fall ill. When women themselves fall sick with HIV- related illnesses, they are often thrown out of families and denied legal rights to properties. Sometimes, they are also denied access to their children. Such is the continuum of multiple disadvantages throughout the lifecycle of women infected and affected by the epidemic today. The situation is acute when the avenues for legal redress are meager and land tenure options are limited. Even where progressive statutory laws exist, accessing these rights is difficult for several reasons ranging from lack of awareness, lack of access to legal services, conflict between statutory and customary laws and the existence of biased judiciaries. Even in situations where women are aware of their rights, many choose not to exercise them as they are intimidated by time consuming legal processes and associated fees. Exercising their rights may also involve sacrificing other important duties such as taking care of the children or earning a livelihood. A recent study of the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India2 shows that despite constitutional guarantees and legal safeguards, as high as 79 per cent HIV positive widows, most of them in the prime of their youth, were denied a share in their husband\u2019s property. More than 90 per cent of the HIV positive widows had stopped living in their marital homes after the death of their husbands. Defining Property In most parts of Asia and the Pacific, property for a woman is everything that she receives from her natal family at the time of her marriage and all that she is entitled to as a 2 UNDP and NCAER, 2005 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women 7 daughter and wife, including jewellery, dowry, furniture, insurance, pensions, bank accounts, fixed deposits, land and house.

In many parts of South Asia, arable land is the most valued form of property, for its economic as well as political and symbolical importance. It is a productive, wealth-creating and livelihood-sustaining asset. Traditionally, it has formed the basis of political power and social status. According to feminist economist Bina Agarwal, for many, it provides a sense of identity and rootedness within the village; and often in people\u2019s minds, land has a durability and permanence which no other asset possesses4. The single most important economic factor affecting women\u2019s situation is the gender gap in control over property. Agarwal posits that supporting women\u2019s legitimate share in landed property can prove to be the single most critical entry point for women\u2019s empowerment in South Asia5. Land Ownership In most of South and South East Asia, land is registered in the name of the head of the household, usually the eldest male. While women may have control over different kinds of land, such as homestead plots, this is not reflected in the records. The limited data that is available relates to female-headed households, which are considered female-headed only because of the absence of an adult male and not because of equal status. In some cases, such households lease out their land, often on share cropping arrangements, to male kin, who then ultimately hope to gain control over this land6. Land Tenure Rights These are a set of rights held by an individual or group to land, including rights to own, control and use the land. For women, control of land rights has always been difficult, but the ongoing shift from food crops to commercial crops has exacerbated the situation. Increasingly, the land on which 3 Adapted from \u2018Women\u2019s Property Rights as an AIDS response: Emerging Efforts from South Asia\u2019, ICRW-UNDP- The Global Coalition on Women and AIDS 4 Bina Agarwal, \u2018 A Field of One\u2019s Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia, Cambridge University Press 5 Research conducted by Panda and Agarwal in Kerala.

When women are denied their rights to property and inheritance, they are robbed of the social and economic empowerment needed to reduce vulnerability to HIV and cope with its impact on families and communities. Access to these rights would empower women to cope with the multiple burdens of the epidemic. \u201d Ms. Caitlin Wiesen Regional HIV/AIDS Practice Leader and Programme Coordinator, Asia and the Pacific, UNDP UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women 9 women formerly grew food for their families is shifted to commercial production, which is generally controlled by men. Lack of rights and security regarding land are among the most daunting challenges to increasing the agricultural food production and income of rural women. While the proportion of women heads of rural households continues to grow, reaching almost one third in some developing countries, less than two per cent of all land is owned by women, according to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO). Access to land, whether privately or communally owned, is not always a matter of legal rights. Security of tenure can be attained by ownership and access, but it also depends on the control of the land and the right to use it. This is often determined by tradition and economics.

It is also based on the premise that women have human rights to land, housing and property and that this includes the right to be free from discrimination and the right to equality. Excerpted from Women\u2019s Rights to Land, Housing and Property in Postconflict Situations and During Reconstruction: A Global Overview (UN-HABITAT, Land Management Series 9) Laws, customs and \u2018traditional\u2019 practices often legitimize the allocation of community and family property to males over females. Patrilineal customs demand that inheritance of the family name, the membership of the community and property should all be channeled through the male. Women who are widowed, or abandoned by their husbands, and returned to their maternal homes are often forced to survive as full dependents on the fringes of their family. When a woman is HIV positive, all these forms of discrimination and abuse are multiplied because she is perceived to be a \u2018bad\u2019 woman, and as someone who is on the verge of death. Many women who are HIV positive face a range of problems relating to access to health care and services, legal aid and assistance, and emotional and psychological support. Part of this is due to their own lack of awareness of their rights and entitlements. Part of this is also due to the prejudice that exists among service-delivery agencies and institutions, and among those who control the funding for work on HIV-related issues.

When she started falling ill, her mother sent her to a private clinic. The doctor at the clinic tested her for HIV without informing her and it was only then that she discovered that she had HIV. Thereafter, doctors sent her from one hospital to another and finally started her on Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy ( HAART) treatment at a cost of US$ 100 a month. Meanwhile, her health deteriorated and she had to leave her job. Her family sent her to a \u2018home\u2019 where she stayed for seven years. During this period, they did not visit her at all. They withdrew all her savings from the Employee Provision Fund. By the time Sui Lee realized what had happened, it was too late. She fell into deep depression and did not take her antiretroviral therapy seriously. The lack of treatment adherence led to a stroke which affected her speech and mobility. Now she is on second line treatment. Her family has completely abandoned her, but some doctors arranged a sponsor for her from the Malaysia AIDS Foundation. HIV trumps tradition: a story from the Pacific Florence from Papua New Guinea (PNG) is from a part of the country which follows a matrilineal system whereby ownership of land and property is passed down from generation to generation through women.

But in her hour of crisis, neither she nor her husband received the counselling or the guidance they needed. The counsellor at one of the national institutes in India told the couple that the chances of their child being HIV positive was almost certain and that no doctor would perform an abortion on a five months pregnant HIV positive woman. \u201cAt that time, the counsellor did not tell me about AZT which was used in prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. I went into severe depression because I was aware of the acute discrimination against people like me in government hospitals. I went to a private hospital. I gave birth to my child, and breast-fed him. The counsellor at the hospital did not tell me anything about the delivery options for pregnant HIV positive women or about breast feeding. My son turned out to be HIV positive as well.\u201d When Ujwala\u2019s husband died, the situation deteriorated sharply. \u201cMy in-laws did not take care of my son when I was busy in the hospital. I was blamed for everything, even beaten up, and asked to leave my home with my two year old child. I was asked to sign a blank paper, which turned out to be an affidavit giving up my rights to the property my husband had. I signed it because I was in severe depression and was not aware of the law.\u201d UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women 13 Women have contributed enormously to the socio- economic progress of the Asia Pacific region. They could contribute even more. But too many women are vulnerable to exploitative practices and to HIV. Women and children in this region bear the biggest brunt of the HIV and AIDS epidemic. HIV positive women are shunned at the exact moment when they need support.

It is important to critically examine how law enforcement agencies can assist HIV positive women to avail of their rights to property and inheritance, which are considered private, civil matters. A piece of property, to which a woman can have a claim, can be transferred to others by fraud or otherwise, depriving her of her right to care, support and treatment. In instances like these, if the state machinery and the law do not help her, the rights and remedies will mean nothing to her. Reports by the Positive Women\u2019s Network (PWN+)7 show that women as claim holders have very limited capacity to lay claim to property over which they have rights. Unless their capacity is enhanced, they will continue to remain vulnerable and the response to the spreading HIV epidemic will remain inadequate. Therefore, a gender- responsive approach to pursuing civil justice, accompanied by capacity building and legal empowerment of women, is essential.

One thing which came out strongly from all the case studies was that most women did not have access to legal services to handle the cases on their own. After the survey, the TANSACS and the State Legal Services Authority came together to provide free legal services to HIV positive women who needed it,\u201d says Supriya Sahu, Project Director of TANSACS. On April 15, 2007, TANSACS established a free Legal Aid Clinic in Namakkal inside the district hospital premises. It was inaugurated by the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court Justice A.P Shah, the guiding force behind this initiative. \u201cSince most women come to the hospital to access ART, we thought a Legal Aid Clinic functioning within the hospital premises will integrate the legal services along with the other services provided at the hospital,\u201d says Sahu. At present, the State legal Services Authority has provided the services of lawyers for two days in a week at the clinic. These lawyers not only give advice but also provide services in terms of filing cases in Lok Adalat or in the courts. \u201cThe mandate of this programme is to generate awareness among the HIV positive women about their legal rights and ensure that they have easy access to legal services.

Titling provides security of tenure and improved access to credit markets as land can be used as collateral. Since 1995, a collaborative effort by the Lao government, Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) , and the World Bank have sought to address the land use rights and inheritance issues affecting women. This is intended to benefit women as women landholders can benefit from this programme as much as men because they comprise 51 percent of the population and 53 percent of the agricultural labor force. Under national law, men and women are now equally entitled to hold property, and the family law specifies that any property purchased during marriage is regarded as joint property. Land owned by a woman prior to her marriage remains her individual property, as does any land she inherits from her parents. The Department of Lands in Laos worked with the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) and its nationwide network of branches and members to ensure women\u2019s titling rights in project implementation. The LWU works at the grassroots with local women and have been holding village meetings, women\u2019s focus group meetings, and household group meetings to sensitise the population on women\u2019s rights under the family law, inheritance law, property law, and land law. Women are urged to make sure they get their names on titles where appropriate and to participate actively in all stages of the adjudication and titling. The net result is heartening: the number of land titles in women\u2019s names or in joint names with their husband has increased. In areas where the systematic titling project is operating, 34 percent of titles are in the name of women, 38 percent are in joint titles, and 24 percent are in the names of men. In areas of the country outside the project area, 15 percent of land titles are in women\u2019s names, 28 percent in joint titles, and 56 percent in men\u2019s names, according to the World Bank. Women are using their new land titles to secure credit. The project has provided an opportunity for the government agencies to interact more effectively with local women at the district and village levels through a key women\u2019s organization, and thus make important advances in titling land to women. >> UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women 19 20 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women The reforms in Nepal Sustained activism pays. Nepal\u2019s Eleventh Amendment to the Country Code in 2002 is a result of a long struggle of women\u2019s rights activists in Nepal. It is considered a legal safeguard for the protection of the rights of women. The salient features of the Eleventh Amendment are: 1. Equal rights on ancestral property by birth for daughters: It accepts the concept that daughters and sons are equally entitled to inheritance rights to ancestral property by birth. However, the amendment still retains that the daughter should return the remaining property after her marriage. The previous law prescribed that only an unmarried daughter attaining the age of 35 was entitled to this right. 2.

By being in the same room as the people who have been directly impacted, forced all of us to re-think. This was absolutely strategic. History tells us that those who have been at the forefront of a struggle are best-equipped to design the interventions. Self-empowerment is incredibly important.

However, the challenge is that it is yet to be tested and the gap between such progressive legislation and practice remains wide. The way forward The evidence base for addressing HIV and women\u2019s equitable access to inheritance and property has been well established in South Asia. In South East Asia and the Pacific, this needs to be strengthened. The evidence base also needs to be part of the future programming in the region. At the community level, exploring alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within families using direct mediation or pressure groups, has also proved successful in some South Asian countries and these alternative avenues will continue to be explored. In countries where progressive legislation exists, bridging the gap between law and practice, both among right holders as well as duty bearers, is the essential challenge. This includes strengthening women\u2019s access to justice, addressing HIV positive women\u2019s issues within the context of women\u2019s rights movements and capacity building of HIV positive networks and networks working on women\u2019s rights to land and property.

Practically all our countries have ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). A few have ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention. This instrument established an international complaints procedure, with novel provisions expanding locus standi, or the status to bring a complaint before the CEDAW Committee which monitors violations by States that has ratified the Convention. Up to now, no such complaint has been presented to the CEDAW Committee, by or on behalf of a woman from our region. Jury trials \u2013 the procedure adopted by this \u2018Women\u2019s Court\u2019, locates administration of justice in a community context, subject to the abiding norms on criminal justice in the Anglo \u2013 American tradition. Jury trials are not incorporated into criminal justice procedures in most of our countries, including Sri Lanka, which had jury trials in the last century. Alternate or informal community based justice systems, are often the site of gender bias and abuse of male power against women in South Asia. Research from all our countries has highlighted the gender bias even in the established courts of law. The novel concept of a jury trial, where women\u2019s voices and their testimony can be heard, and a decision given by a respected and eminent panel of gender sensitive judges has therefore special relevance for all of us. The concept of the Women\u2019s Court, in its origins, addressed the issue of violence against women as an infringement of the civil and political human rights relating to equality, non\u2013discrimination, and personal security.

Too often, we have taken for granted the institutionalised discrimination against women in religious and customary inheritance laws. There are many positive examples of equal rights to property among men and women, particularly in the rice growing countries of Asia such as Vietnam, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. These positive customary laws have become the basis for progressive reform in some countries such as Vietnam and Lao PDR. Women\u2019s groups have successfully lobbied for changes to the Indian Hindu Succession Act, so as to strengthen women\u2019s rights to inheritance in that religious based system of personal law. The Asia Pacific region has witnessed decades of change, and shared the experience of colonisation. What are perceived as \u201cpure\u201d customs and religious values, reflected in current State law and policy are in fact nineteenth century colonial and other influences that have been eliminated in those Western countries from which they originated. The State therefore has a duty to be proactive in reviewing discriminatory private property and inheritance laws, and must be supported in this endeavour by enlightened members of the community and religious leaders. Discrimination must be eliminated and leadership given, in enacting general laws on inheritance and property that can be adopted by diverse communities to exercise their choice. Unless fixed and equal rights are given to women by family law, they will continue to be denied private property and the assets required for economic empowerment. Inheritance rights can be denied by wills and gifts, and this limitation must also be addressed. The unlimited right to dispose of property by will and gift is already restricted in some legal systems, through a concept of family provision or fixed rights. These concepts must be explored in engendering property laws.

Historically, it is said to date back to the Indus valley civilization. It is nine yards of fabric draped according to culture, religion, class, and caste of the woman. The saree provides a way for women to express themselves and their individuality, by the preference of colours and designs expressing beauty and strength.

The saree captured the voices of 78 people in 10 languages and was 8 ft wide and 30 ft long. About one fifth of the people used the saree to make an appeal to the public - \u2018nothing about us without us\u201d. An equal number of people used the saree to reflect on their experiences with HIV/AIDS. Some of these were very positive. One read: \u201cThank you AIDS\u2026 made me stronger and I have more energy to fight for others\u201d. A few dedicated their contributions to their loved ones. One expression read: \u201cMike Pivette lost in 1983, too early, too young - be safe\u201d. Some captured the aspirations for women: \u201cMay all women dare to claim the sky!\u201d The saree helped to highlight key issues on HIV/AIDS from a very personal point of view. A captivating piece of tapestry, it captured the emotions of a moment in time and space, to be read and listened to by all who see it. The saree will be taken to Mexico for the 2008 World AIDS Conference, voicing the hopes and aspirations from women in the Asia and the Pacific Region. 32 UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb46eb25-1744-4655-8379-7465232129ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb46eb25-1744-4655-8379-7465232129ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-and-visions-asia-pacific-court-women-hiv-inheritance-and-property-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Voices and Visions - the Asia Pacific Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance and Property Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/voices-and-visions-asia-pacific-court-women-hiv-inheritance-and-property-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42d626f52f687046c5be951f31a96939ebe1bc6591c7581672f69be40096e383"}}, "hash": "42d626f52f687046c5be951f31a96939ebe1bc6591c7581672f69be40096e383", "text": "and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women \u201c\u201cThis Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance and Property Rights, seeks to define property and inheritance from the perspective of the dispossessed disinherited women towards finding responses that must not only be legal but also rooted in social transformation.\u201d Ms. Madhu Bhushan, AWHRC UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo Voices and Visions from the Asia Pacific Court of Women 33 The courts of women is a process initiated in 1992 by the Asian Women\u2019s Human Rights Council (AWHRC) and women\u2019s and human rights groups in Asia and the Pacific.

Foreword One of the biggest challenges in addressing HIV in the Asia Pacific region is the complex intersection between women\u2019s vulnerability to HIV infection, coupled with the acute and disproportionate impact of the epidemic on women. Increasingly, women living with HIV in Asia have been infected by their partners. According to the re- port of the Commission on AIDS in Asia, an estimated 50 million women in the region are at risk of HIV infection from their regular partners, who, in turn, have been infected either during paid sex or drug injection. Women now constitute up to 26% of new infections, representing a 7% rise since 2000. In Asia and the Pacific, the impact of HIV is most evident at the household level, where once again, women are at the fore. Women, as caregivers, workers and surviving spouses, generally bear the brunt of the often devastating consequences of HIV. Addressing the specific gender concerns of HIV, is one of UNDP\u2019s key priority areas requiring joint and collaborative efforts by governments, civil society, UN agencies and most importantly, people living with HIV. In attempting to disaggregate the vulnerabilities faced by women and in searching for ways in which to mitigate the impact of HIV on women, UNDP in partnership with key stakeholders, has de- veloped a practitioners guide that builds on experience from the region in addressing issues of women and HIV. The guide offers evidence-based suggestions for policy and programmatic direction, and pro- vides examples of promising practices from around the region to stimulate thinking and trigger effec- tive responses. It is our intention that this guide will be a living document that will continue to be informed by policy and action on the ground in the region. Ajay Chhibber Assistant Secretary General Assistant Administrator and Director UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific i Acknowledgements This Development practitioners guide is the result of an in-depth collaborative process with contributions from many institutions and individuals, largely from the region. Numerous background papers, studies, guidance notes and reports covering the work of gender, women and HIV in the region and beyond, have informed this guide. It most significantly draws on the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia \u201cRedefining AIDS in Asia\u201d, the UNAIDS guidance notes on working with most at risk populations and Global UNAIDS policy guidelines on gender. Taking into account the Global UNAIDS technical division of labour among co-sponsors, extensive consultations were held with other UN agencies including: UNODC on working with injecting drug users, UNFPA on sex work, UNICEF on care and support to orphans and vulnerable children and prevention of parent to child transmission, and UNAIDS on information and knowledge sharing, advocacy, and monitoring and evaluation. UNDP has also worked in close collaboration with UNIFEM SARO on the finalization of this guide. The lead authors provided invaluable contribution to the writing of this report. In particular, we would like to gratefully acknowledge: Sarah Kambou, Jessica Ogden and Linda Sussman from International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW) global and Hema Swaminathan from Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Bangalore, on updates and editing support.

AIDS-related mortality in 2007 was approximately 380,000 and was the largest disease related cause of mortality and morbidity among 15-44 year old adults (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008). HIV prevalence is increasing in some countries, notably China, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam, and there are signs of HIV increases in Bangladesh and Pakistan (UNAIDS, 2007). Nonetheless, some more positive trends are emerging in the Asia and Pacific region. HIV prevalence has been declining among pregnant women in four states in India, including Tamil Nadu where prevention efforts were scaled up in the late 1990s. Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand, are also experiencing declines in HIV prevalence. The Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia (2008) identifies that the spread of HIV in Asia is driven by three high-risk types of behaviour: unprotected commercial sex, injecting drug use, and unprotected sex between men. Of these, men who buy sex are the single largest group and are important in understanding the future of Asia\u2019s epidemic. According to the Report, at least 75 million men buy sex regularly and many are either married or likely to get married and thus, exposing their wives to the risk of infection. Approximately, another 20 million men are at risk through injecting drug use and unsafe sex among men. However, the limiting factor for the transmission of the HIV epidemic in Asia is the sexual behaviour of women outside of commercial sex work. The majority of women in Asia report only one sexual partner making it unlikely that the infection will continue to spread to the general population, independent of the high risk behaviours described above. Given this, the Commission proposes a classification scheme that is derived from the risk behaviour rather than the traditional scheme based on national HIV prevalence rates. The four suggested categories are Latent, Expanding, Mature, and Declining. According to the Commission, this new method of categorization can also help in prioritizing interventions. HIV prevention is far more cost effective than providing treatment, care, and livelihood support for an HIV positive individual. Investing only 1 USD in prevention services can save up to 8 USD in treatment services in countries that are experiencing expanding epidemics (Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008). numbers of Women Country 250,000 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 0 China Indonesia Nepal PNG Vietnam Cambodia Malaysia Thailand 2003 2005 EsTImATED numbERs oF WomEn 15+ lIVInG WITH HIV Source: UNAIDS Report on the Global Epidemic 2006 Figure 1 7 CHAPTER 02 | Overview: HIV and Women in the Asia-Pacific Region WomEn AnD HIV Indeed in this region, as elsewhere in the world (most notably sub-Saharan Africa) women and girls are increasingly at the centre of the epidemic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0cb871e-12e9-4e78-ac0f-32db07326c4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0cb871e-12e9-4e78-ac0f-32db07326c4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bed988e98cd55d16eadaf279814ecd84a43a8f630dc7e542521768856ee39a41"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e3113ad-1da1-4dea-84db-5e7c238964f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7aec570788bf1b40d750c4fb71b92543e79e52cff1291d1c342caf87ac40184"}}, "hash": "f41c03bec86c46682abce6a97c6916a79a9c20df252bb5a9502106329fd4f68f", "text": "While the prevalence among men is still higher than among women in most populations in Asia-Pacific, this is beginning to change.

Others were infected while working in commercial sex or while injecting drugs. In Thailand, approximately one-third of new infections in 2005 were among married women. In India, for 90 percent of HIV positive women, marriage was their risk factor. Women are now sharing a greater percentage of the burden relative to men of similar ages. For example, in Thailand, around 70 percent of young people now living with HIV are girls and women between the ages of 15-24 (UNICEF, 2005). Since 2003, 47 percent of the new infections in Fiji are among women, according to the Ministry of Health. Recent data from India indicate that 40 percent of people living with HIV are women (NACO, 2006). Not only are women more vulnerable to HIV infection, they also largely bear the devastating impacts of HIV and AIDS. In addition to their existing workloads, women are burdened by the care giving responsibilities within the household. They often are unable to access treatment services for themselves, face extreme stigma and discrimination, and in many situations are deprived of their property and inheritance rights. Now, before the epidemic takes firmer hold in the Asia-Pacific region, is an opportune time for development practitioners to assess the role of gender inequalities in the epidemic and design policies and programmes that squarely address the particular vulnerabilities that women face. CRITICAl GEnDER - RElATED IssuEs FoR THE REGIon norms and Attitudes About Gender and sexuality Gender norms are a critical part of the social context that frames the vulnerability of both women and men in the epidemic. Women are, in part, made vulnerable to HIV due to social norms and values that: (1) devalue their contributions to society; (2) persist in casting them in the role of upholders of moral traditions and family honour; (3) limit their identity options to wife, mother and respectable housewife; and (4) fail to recognize their sexuality, or cast it as immoral, deviant and decadent. In many societies in the region (as elsewhere in the world), a culture of silence surrounds sex, and the implicit assumption is that \u201cgood\u201d women should be ignorant about sex and passive in sexual interactions. This makes it difficult for women to be informed about risk reduction or be proactive in negotiating safer sex (Carovano, 1992). Cultural norms that restrict the mobility of women and their ability to access resources, can limit their access to prevention, testing and treatment services. In many parts of Asia gender roles within marital relationships are rigid and based on traditional philosophies that give guidance on morality and the role of women within marriage, the family and the community. Integral to these moral codes is tolerating multiple partners and sexual experience for men, while protecting the virginity of women. Gender norms that reinforce the belief that multiple sexual partners is an essential expression of masculinity and that men must seek multiple partners for sexual gratification are at odds with prevention messages that call for abstinence and being faithful in partnerships or a reduction in the number of sexual partners. Another important dimension of masculinity in the region is the underlying belief that force or coercion in sex is unavoidable as a good woman can never say yes to sex. In a study of men in India, a majority of men said that force in sex was a marker of their ability to satisfy their wives sexually (Duvvury, Nayak and Allendorf, 2002). Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 8 Child marriage, a frequent practice in South Asia, increases the vulnerability of very young girls who lack power to negotiate the terms of their sexual life. Although research connecting child marriage to HIV infection is limited in Asia, several studies from sub-Saharan Africa provide evidence of greater HIV risk for younger married women versus their unmarried peers. In a study in Kenya and Zambia, married girls were 75 percent more likely to have HIV than unmarried girls of the same age (Clark, 2004). In this same study, married girls were more likely than unmarried girls to stop having sex after learning of HIV risk (Clark, 2004). Girls are less likely to be informed about HIV and how to protect themselves or to assess their risk, much less have the power to insist on condom use or to refuse unwanted sex within marriage. Lack of education or limited education and low socioeconomic status are risk factors for child marriage (UNICEF 2005). Adolescent women who are not in school seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of gender", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85635644-4e4e-4c36-9f69-d00066d7ae35": {"__data__": {"id_": "85635644-4e4e-4c36-9f69-d00066d7ae35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00dd60b2bba475836c20c041f9dc13305766a5bdf0aee06f1b890ac84742bd00"}}, "hash": "00dd60b2bba475836c20c041f9dc13305766a5bdf0aee06f1b890ac84742bd00", "text": "inequality (Beegle and \u00d6zler 2007). The common myth in the Asia region that having sex with virgin girls will protect a man or cure him from sexually transmitted diseases and HIV also increases demand for sex with younger girls (Huda, 2006). Stigma also affects women more intensely than men, preventing them from accessing treatment, information and prevention services. The construct of \u2018social evils\u2019, common in much of South Asia, creates stigma and produces greater discrimination towards women because HIV is closely associated with behaviours considered immoral, such as sex work. This compounds the stigma experienced by women with HIV. Disparities in Education The association between education and HIV is likely a complex relationship that changes over time (Hargreaves, et al., 2008). In some countries, higher education has been associated with higher HIV prevalence, but over the last decade (Herz and Sperling, 2004) more recent evidence has shown increased education to be related to decreased HIV prevalence. In a recent literature review, several large cohort studies among Thai army conscripts showed a significant, consistently negative correlation between HIV prevalence and higher levels of education between 1990 and 1995 (Hargreaves and Glynn, 2002). Girls\u2019 schooling has been found to be associated with several factors linked to HIV reduction. In India, women receiving secondary education were less likely to experience violence and had greater ability to leave violent situations compared to women with only primary education (Jejeebhoy, 1998). Education has been shown to be a significant factor in delaying age at marriage (Mathur, Greene and Malhotra, 2003). Girls are also thought to gain autonomy and important life skills useful in negotiations related to the timing of marriage through education (Lloyd and Mensch, 1999). South Asia is still experiencing a gender gap in primary education enrolment, although girls\u2019 gross enrolment rates did increase nearly 20 percent between 1990 and 2000 \u2013 from 79.5 percent to 96.6 percent (UNESCO, 2004). While this trend is positive, the picture is less hopeful for primary school completion \u2013 a better indicator of educational status. In 1990 in South Asia, boys\u2019 primary school completion rates were 94.9 percent compared to 81.0 percent for girls (UNESCO, 2004). The gender gap is much wider in secondary education. In South Asia, the gross enrolment rate for girls in secondary schools is only 50 percent. This is important because statistics show that it is secondary or higher levels of schooling that are associated with improved opportunities and outcomes for women (Malhotra et al., 2003). Secondary education is more consistently and strongly associated with increased decision- making and mobility for women than schooling at the primary level. Studies have found that only at secondary or higher levels of schooling does education have a significant beneficial effect on women\u2019s own health outcomes and risk of disease. Higher levels of schooling are strongly associated with higher age at marriage. Studies of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America have found that while primary education increases girls\u2019 and women\u2019s ability to discuss HIV with a partner and negotiate safe sex or condom use with a partner, secondary education has an even greater positive impact. Girls who attend secondary school are far more 9 CHAPTER 02 | Overview: HIV and Women in the Asia-Pacific Region likely to understand the costs of risky behaviour and know effective refusal tactics in difficult sexual situations (Hargreaves & Boler, 2006). The HIV vulnerability among young girls is a considerable concern, particularly in countries where young girls are twice as likely to have HIV as their boy peers, (Pettifor, et al., 2004). Although this pattern has not yet emerged in the Asia-Pacific region, keeping girls in school can help provide them with essential knowledge and skills to protect themselves. socio-economic Vulnerabilities Economic strain in settings that involve gender inequality contributes dramatically to women\u2019s HIV vulnerability. Treatment of women as inferior to men, fewer economic opportunities and less power to ensure respect of their rights and social protections, including risk of child marriage and sexual violence are all factors that contribute to increased HIV vulnerability among women and girls. Women\u2019s economic vulnerability and their economic dependency on men make it less likely that women will succeed in negotiating condom use or fidelity with a partner. It also makes it less likely that they will leave a relationship that they perceive to be risky because they lack bargaining power and fear abandonment and destitution (Heise & Elias, 1995; Mane, Rao Gupta, & Weiss, 1994; Weiss & Rao Gupta, 1998). Poverty and a lack of economic alternatives repeatedly have been identified as the reasons that many adult women and children become sex workers.

A forthcoming report by Beegle and \u00d6zler found that gender inequality itself puts women, particularly young women, at risk of HIV, because it entitles men to have multiple partners in some settings. Poverty is also directly related to child marriage which increases girls\u2019 HIV risk. Poor families have fewer options to send girls to school or offer other alternatives; thus marriage becomes a way out of poverty. Globally, nations with the lowest gross national product rates also have higher rates of child marriage (Mathur, Greene and Malhotra, 2003). Families may also obtain higher bride prices for daughters they marry off at a younger age (Mathur, Greene and Malhotra, 2003). In contrast, if a girl earns an income it Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region - A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide 10 appears to protect her from child marriage as families delay marriage because of the income (Jejeebhoy, 1995). In Bangladesh, a study showed that only 31 percent of girls who worked in a factory married before age 18, as opposed to 71 percent of those who remained in their village (Amin, Diamond, Naved and Newby 1998). Women\u2019s lack of access to and control over economic assets such as land and housing makes them particularly vulnerable in the AIDS epidemic and can fuel a vicious intergenerational cycle of disease and death. Without a guarantee of property and inheritance rights, a widowed woman is at risk of losing her home, inheritance and possessions either because the law does not give her the right to own or inherit land or housing, or because of dispossession with no accessible legal recourse to regain ownership. Thrust into these difficult economic situations, women and girls may be forced into risky and unsafe sexual behaviours just to meet their own and their children\u2019s or siblings\u2019 basic needs. They may also fall prey to sexual predators (Strickland, 2004). In a recent study in India, loss of property rights was acutely apparent among widows where 90 percent of HIV-positive widows stopped living in their marital homes after the death of their husband (UNDP, NCAER, NACO 2006). The association between property rights and HIV came to light when many HIV-positive widows became dispossessed of their property after their husbands\u2019 death. One of the few studies exploring the link between property rights and HIV in South Asia found that women\u2019s insecure property rights exacerbated the impact of HIV. Women interviewed in this study were frequently asked to leave the marital home when their HIV- positive husband died or were forced to leave due to continued abuse by husbands\u2019 relatives. After dispossessing the widow, relatives often sold off all assets and kept the cash: which is more difficult for widows to recover (Swaminathan, Bhatla, and Chakraborty, 2007). This study also revealed that being female, HIV- positive and widowed exposed the women to very high rates of stigmatization. These women\u2019s stories were brought to light during the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) in 2007 in a women\u2019s \u201ccourt\u201d held to hear cases of property and inheritance loss among HIV-positive women in the region. The court brought together 20 HIV-positive women from 11 nations who shared their experiences of struggle and overcoming dispossession of property and denial of inheritance rights (http://www2.undprcc.lk/resource_centre/rcc_ publications.php?c_id=1002). Women\u2019s ownership of immovable assets, particularly a house, has also been associated with reducing violence against women, and thus indirectly reducing HIV risk. Property ownership was found to not only protect against violence and but also to provide an exit strategy for women to leave violent situations (Bhatla, Duvvury, and Chakraborty, 2006). For example, among women interviewed in West Bengal, 57 percent of women without property experienced violence as compared to only 35 percent of women with property. Research in Kerala, India, found that 49 percent of women with no property reported physical violence compared to only 7 percent women property owners (Panda, 2002).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e2d65cd-ff94-4c7c-84c1-bc9a22398ea8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e2d65cd-ff94-4c7c-84c1-bc9a22398ea8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women and HIV in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Development Practitioner\u2019s Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ba8ee9ea2a2b4222a536d1ef6d353cb210e44d450db2b269abb06d453190754"}, "2": {"node_id": "46445f99-44da-4d5e-82a0-41cbd7517438", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/women-and-hiv-asia-pacific-region-development-practitioner%E2%80%99s-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d36cb8d3950ca2fb8c60c46ea6999bdde9bb2e665a327fa25bf693d9003b7cb2"}}, "hash": "7e3a8a125da69e61088c9552c9908da4c6c50bd956416262c5d71f7dceb8bd84", "text": "Owning property may also help mitigate economic and health shocks, including HIV, by providing assets that can be liquidated to meet resulting financial needs.
