"text": "activities to help ensure that the assessment is conducted in an environment relatively free of political stress. 15. What if there aren\u2019t resources and/or capacity to conduct a capacity assessment? If at all possible, a capacity assessment exercise should be conducted by local resources, not by external consultants. This can help create ownership of the process, generate more insightful findings, build commitment to the results, and finally develop capacity during the process of assessing capacity. If it is not possible to use local resources, technical assistance can be leveraged to conduct the exercise, but local sponsors and stakeholders should be involved and ongoing dialogue and feedback between them and the consultants should be built into the process. 16. Where has this methodology/framework/tool been applied? Can you publish the case studies? What have been the implementation challenges? What have been the results? In previous iterations, this methodology has been used in a number of situations, with varying profiles, e.g., enabling environment vs. organisational level, extensive vs. limited scope. Case studies are being developed as part of a publication called \u201cCapacity Development Strategies: Evidence and Cases,\u201d expected to be published by UNDP by the end of 2006. 69 Annex 2 \u2013 Illustrative Indicators for Capacity Development Strategies Capacity Development Strategies Illustrative Indicators Capacity Diagnostics \ufffd Capacity assessment conducted \ufffd Existing capacity assets and needs inventoried \ufffd Capacity gaps identified Knowledge Services and Learning \ufffd Number of participants trained \ufffd Evaluation rating of training sessions \ufffd Introduction or adaptation of curriculum \ufffd Number of students enrolled in (technical/tertiary) education \ufffd Leadership Development \ufffd Number of leaders trained, mentored, etc. \ufffd Development of a replicable training programme for local leaders than is flexible and interactive and can be executed by local trainers Institutional Reform and Change Management \ufffd Breadth of stakeholders involved \ufffd Number of roles, missions and tasks redefined; clarity of roles and responsibilities at different levels of administration \ufffd Reduction in number of PIUs \ufffd Transparency of policy-making process Multi-Stakeholder Engagement Processes \ufffd Establishment of twinning relationships and other formal partnerships \ufffd Satisfaction rating of these relationships by both partners \ufffd Development of an electronic network(s) to foster exchange of information, best practices and lessons \ufffd Number of e-network users \ufffd Number of stakeholder dialogue sessions held Mutual Accountability Mechanisms \ufffd Establishment of peer/partner review mechanism \ufffd Establishment of \u2018social watch\u2019 type mechanism \ufffd Number of complaints received, processed and resolved \ufffd Number of reviews executed Incentive Systems \ufffd Existence of nationally coordinated, transparent and legitimate salary supplementation scheme linked to civil service reform \ufffd Development of policy on non-monetary benefits that is transparent and performance-based \ufffd Development of policy on pay and compensation that is legal, equitable and transparent \ufffd Agreement and application of exit strategy for externally provided salary top-ups 70 Annex 3 \u2013 Indicators for UNDP\u2019s Default Principles for Capacity Development Default Principles for Capacity Development Examples of Benchmarks 1. Don\u2019t rush. Capacity development is a long-term process: It is not amenable to delivery pressures, quick fixes and short- term results seeking. Engagement for CD needs to have a long-term horizon and be reliable. \ufffd Increase in civic engagement and bottom-up influence the policy agenda \ufffd Client satisfaction with services/performance over time (\u201cbeing broadly right is more useful than being precisely wrong\u201d (e.g. Scorecard approach) \ufffd Existence of long-term strategic policy choices for CD 2. Respect the value systems and foster self-esteem: The imposition of alien values can undermine confidence. Capacity development requires respect. Self-esteem is at the root of capacity and empowerment. \ufffd Engaged but respectful dialogue and advocacy on human rights, (esp. minority groups) \ufffd Advancement of women (e.g. school enrolment, tenure rights, women leaders, \u2026) \ufffd Clear \u201crules of the game\u201d and safeguards that establish domestic partners and legitimate policy processes as leading on policy choice 3. Scan locally and globally; reinvent locally: There are no blueprints. Capacity development means learning. Learning is a voluntary process that requires genuine commitment and interest. Knowledge transfer is no longer seen as the relevant modality. Knowledge needs to be acquired. \ufffd Access to global knowledge (ex. connectivity, internet access points\u2026) \ufffd Choice for domestic agents of inputs they perceive as relevant (ex. TC pools) \ufffd Existence of discussion and policy options with relevant stakeholders \ufffd Iterative planning and implementation with regular review to allow for adjustments \ufffd Quality of dialogue between domestic and external stakeholders 4. Challenge mindsets and power differentials: Capacity development is not power neutral and challenging vested interest is difficult. Frank dialogue and moving from closed curtains to a collective culture of transparency is essential to promote a positive dynamic for overcoming them. \ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d61b00f-86e0-4c03-89c0-e2c27a602863": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d61b00f-86e0-4c03-89c0-e2c27a602863", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Capacity Diagnostics Methodology: User's Guide", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a165ca4ad683f78b0cc8aa5abd628e6edff1163138e54c55dd63fd552cd29baf"}, "3": {"node_id": "1fe16d00-4436-4050-b33c-c6021a491c7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/capacity-diagnostics-methodology-users-guide", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96e35370ab83ee401d1914dface3f426ebc917fa545cf07e2db2fb7d115270a7"}}, "hash": "20b6b32eda3a12801c4f0be65ad6e19eb33df6a3266950a7f8b7e78723d47f17", "text": "Transparency of budget process and allocations \ufffd Access to information, participatory policy process and decision making \ufffd Existence/intensity of independent or more objective forms of monitoring and societal watch dogs that can question authorities \ufffd Effectiveness of parliamentary oversight, access to recourse functions (ombudsman..) 5. Think and act in terms of sustainable capacity outcomes: Capacity is at the core of development. Any course of action needs to promote this end. Responsible leaders can inspire their institutions and societies to effectively work toward capacity development. \ufffd Actionable objectives and outputs in national and local development strategies, work plans and implementation \ufffd Integration of CD indicators/benchmarks in mainstream M&E \ufffd Existence of influential and outspoken champions for ownership and CD \ufffd Iterative planning, decisions and benchmarking. 6. Establish positive incentives: Distortions in public sector employment are major obstacles to CD. Ulterior motives and perverse incentives need to be aligned with the objective of capacity development. Governance systems respectful of fundamental rights are a powerful incentive. \ufffd Existence of a collective nationally coordinated and defended, transparent and legitimate salary supplementation scheme linked to civil service reform \ufffd Explicit integration of incentive questions as standing feature in mainstream M&E \ufffd Degree of \u201crule of law\u201d, equality of citizens, access to justice 71 7. Integrate external inputs into national priorities, processes and systems: External inputs need to correspond to real demand and need to be flexible to respond effectively to national needs and possibilities. Where such systems are not strong enough they need to be reformed and strengthened, not bypassed. \ufffd Reduction in overall PIUs; changes in functioning of implementation structures from the parallel to the organically integrated and accountable type \ufffd Increase in budget support and pooling arrangements, incl. pooling of TC that allows broader choice by primary clients \ufffd Focus on collective outcomes & reduction in attribution to individuals 8. Build on existing capacities rather than creating new ones. This implies the use of national expertise as prime option, resuscitation and strengthening of national institutions, and protecting social and cultural capital. \ufffd Clear establishment of existing assets as standard step in any diagnostics \ufffd Relative size and quality of a domestic consulting sector \ufffd Collaboration with national universities and research institutions rather than expertise and analysis from outside \ufffd Share of finance going through legitimate domestic institutions 9. Stay engaged under difficult circumstances. The weaker the capacity, the greater the need. Weak capacities are not an argument for withdrawal or for driving external agendas. People should not be hostage to irresponsible governance. \ufffd Effectiveness of dialogue mechanisms with domestic authorities \ufffd Existence of efforts that allow for recovery in the long-term (e.g., community level self-organisation, education programme for displaced populations) \ufffd Nationally led coordination mechanisms and collective responsibility for external aid & partnerships (reduction of \u201cdo-it-alone\u201d ad hoc intervention & un-conducive competition) 10. Remain accountable to ultimate beneficiaries. Even where national governments are not responding to the needs of their people, external partners need to be accountable to beneficiaries and contribute to ownership by national authorities. Sensible approaches in concrete situations need to be openly discussed and negotiated with national stakeholders. \ufffd Functioning of democratic process, checks and balances, transparency and participatory nature of policy dialogue, access to justice, level of corruption etc. \ufffd Citizens\u2019 access to budget allocation info to local level services, e.g. schools, clinics, \u2026 \ufffd Increased civic engagement, CSO/CBO activity, established societal \u201cwatch dog\u201d functions, quality and independence of media \ufffd Mechanisms to register the voice of citizens and their perceptions 72 Annex 4 \u2013 Select References on Indicators UN / UNDP Balanced Scorecard, UNDP, January 2006. \u201cEnhancing the UN\u2019s Contribution to National Capacity Development: Initial Guidance for UNCTs,\u201d Working Group on Capacity Development, UNDG, March 2006. \u201cHandbook on Monitoring and Evaluating for Results,\u201d Evaluation Office, UNDP, June 2005. \u201cMeasuring Capacities: An Illustrative Catalogue to Benchmarks and Indicators,\u201d Capacity Development Group, UNDP, September 2005.

2008 1 1. The Central & West Asia HLF Consultation aimed to bring countries in the region together with the following key objectives: \u2022 to support partner countries in preparing for the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-3); \u2022 to ensure that the Central & West Asian voices genuinely contribute to the design and outcome of the Accra High Level Forum. 2. The Consultation sought to achieve these objectives by bringing together seven countries from the region \u2013 Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia and Tajikistan \u2013 including senior offi cials from across the breadth of government, spanning central policy ministries (such as Finance, Planning and Foreign Affairs); donor focal points (acting as representatives for the in-country donor community) and representa- tives from civil society organisations from Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. 3. J.B. Siriboe, Chief Director of Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning of the Government of Ghana, host of HLF-3, addressed the Central & West Asia consultations, via video, and reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to supporting HLF-3 to deliver substantive outcomes on aid effective- ness through the Accra Agenda for Action. 4. Participants were made aware of the range of meetings and preparations in the lead up to HLF-3 and the organising committee for the consultations declared a commitment to support systematic inclusion of the sub-region in HLF-3 preparations. Governments in the region were urged to be vocal and forthright in conveying their messages for Accra and the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) at these events, or opportunities to infl uence would be lost. 5. In-country consultations and preparations were seen as necessary for the AAA to be successfully agreed in Accra. Future country consultations ideally would involve Ministers, so that coun- tries in Central & West Asia can provide formal feedback to the AAA Consensus Group on the draft AAA (visit www. accrahlf.net). The sub-region- al consultation was fortunate to have the participation of His Excellency Japarov Akylbek, Minister of Economic Development and Trade of the Kyrgyz Republic, as well as Deputy Ministers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan. There is high level government interest from the region in the HLF-3. Minister Akylbek discussed how the HLF-3 delegation from Kyrgyz would include top level participation from either the President or Prime Minister. 6. The Contact Group, led by KY Amoako in his advi- sory capacity to the Government of Ghana, was recognised as an initiative available to the region to leverage their voices at the international level. Representatives of the Kyrgyz Republic will meet with other Asian members \u2013 Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Samoa \u2013 on 26 May in Bangkok and draw on the four Asia-Pacifi c Consultation outputs to contribute to the drafting of the AAA. These governments will work with UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacifi c to ensure governments in the region are kept involved in the key next steps in preparing for Accra and drafting the AAA. Executive Summary High level govern- ment interest from the region in the HLF-3 2 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 8\u20139 May 2008 7. Some participants working on gender issues raised the importance of including gender equal- ity concerns within the consultations and ensuring key commitments on strengthening these dimen- sions of development are included in the AAA. 8. Capacity development was emphasised by par- ticipants time and again over the two days and highlighted as a key constraint to delivering results. It was recognised that donors also had capacity defi cits, particularly in aid effectiveness, and need- ed to develop new skills. Participants were invited to join the Community of Practice in Managing for Results \u2013 http://cop-mfdr.adb.org 9.

The Menu of Options for the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) was seen to be a useful frame- work for discussing the AAA. Participants shared a great number of ideas for strengthening the AAA through comment on the Menu of Options paper (See annex 2 of this report). Extremely impor- tant for the region was the issue of language. As example, this consultations meeting was the fi rst at which any of the HLF3 associated literature (the Accra Agenda for Action; Menu of Options; and Generic Terms of Reference for the HLF-3 Round Tables) was provided in Russian and although this was a good step forward, for many their national languages would have been more appropriate still. Development partners might do more to ensure access to the appropriate consultative documents on the AAA, the Round Tables and the HLF3 meet- ing more broadly. 11. Participants on the whole felt that there were options and combinations of options in the menu that could be agreed. Rapid and signifi cant invest- ment in awareness-raising and local level discussion of the HLF3 literature in appropriate languages will enhance participation from the region. Feedback on the Menu of Options suggested that jargon and the use of vague wording confused the meanings of commitments. Whilst there was some diffi culty in translating key headline concepts and principles such as \u2018Ownership\u2019 and \u2018Accountability\u2019 there was still further confusion over nuanced language such as \u2018enhanced\u2019, which participants preferred to be spelt out more clearly for example through lan- guage such as \u2018enforced\u2019. The language of menu of options needs to be clarifi ed \u2013 there is too much behind the words and whilst a short document is needed somehow longer explanations will also be required. 12. Participants discussed how governments need- ed to formulate clear aid policy and, for example, tell donors the sectors where they want them to contribute and the role they want the donors to fulfi l such as policy advise, technical assistance and fi nancial resource. Donors were also asked to consider developing joint strategies among themselves. Almost all the countries in the region received large amounts of assistance from non- traditional donors in line with their development plan, which bring a number of advantages, while they agreed that a coordinated dialogue and coor- dination between traditional and non-traditional donors to share the goal. 3 Central & West Asia: Outcomes 13. The Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia and Tajikistan are already signatories to the Paris Declaration and the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia both participated in the 2006 and 2008 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration. Participants discussed both the value- added of the Paris Declaration in creating impetus for aid effectiveness at the country level and the process by which non-signatories could join the sign the Declaration. During proceedings and sub- sequent to the consultations three other countries have expressed interest in becom- ing signatories. 14. The Asian Development Bank highlighted that it will develop an Asia-Pacifi c perspectives paper that brings together the key points from the four sub-regional consultations in the Asia-Pacifi c region, and table this at the Accra HLF. 15. Feedback from the participants of the Central & West Asia HLF Consultation was very positive, ranking the overall quality of the Consultation at 3.75 out of a possible 4.0. Only three of the seven countries participating have signed the Paris Declaration, and participants noted that \u201cI am much better equipped... to lobby government offi cial to sign up to the Paris Declaration\u201d, \u201cOur country has not yet signed the Paris Declaration \u2013 I will present the results to the Minister of Finance\u201d, and that the Consultation had been \u201cvery useful for partner countries and donors to prepare for Accra\u201d.

The Consultation sought to achieve these objectives by bringing together the critical actors with knowledge and infl uence on aid effective- ness from within the region and internationally. The seven countries from the region \u2013 Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia and Tajikistan\u2013 were represented by a diverse array of colleagues: \u2022 Senior offi cials came from across the breadth of government, spanning cen- tral policy ministries such as Finance, Planning and Foreign Affairs. \u2022 Donor focal points from Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic, briefed to share the perspectives of a broad- er range of donors and share back with them on their return the consultation\u2019s outcomes. \u2022 Representatives from civil society organisations from Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. 18. Six of the Nine HLF Round Table Co-Chairs also attended and were able to both brief and listen to the priorities and recommendations from the region. 19. The organising committee provided sup- port, and included the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Government of Japan, OECD Development Cooperation Department (OECD DCD), the UK Department for International Development (DFID), UNDP and the World Bank. Some agen- cies and donors with regional offi ces attended as observers. 20. The Central & West Asia HLF Consultation (8\u20139 May) was the fi fth regionally-based consultation ahead of Accra. It followed the Pacifi c consultations held in Fiji from 4\u20137 April; the East & South-East consultations held in Bangkok (21\u201322 April); the African Consultation in Kigali (29\u201330 April); and the South Asian Consultation (5\u20136 May). These will be followed by consultations planned for Latin America & the Caribbean, and the Middle East. 21. The regionally-based consultations are comple- mented by workshops organised on specifi c topics of the nine HLF Round Tables, as well as discussions attached to existing events such as the annual meetings of the African and Asian Development Banks. 22. This Outcomes Document provides information on the preparatory process for the Third High Level Forum as well as the key com- ponents of the meeting itself. Secondly, the Outcomes Document conveys headline messages from Central & West Asia to those drafting the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) and the Co-Chairs of the 9 Round Tables. More detailed feedback on the AAA Menu of Options is set out in Annex 1, and Annex 2 provides one page summaries for each Round Table. 1 | Introduction Conveys headline messages from Central & West Asia to Accra 5 Central & West Asia: Outcomes 23. This year, from 2\u20134 September, ministers, heads of development agencies, representatives from global funds, emerging economies and civil society organizations from around the world will gather in Accra for the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. Their common objective is to identify concrete actions that will accelerate and deepen implementation of the Paris Declaration, endorsed in March 2005, which laid down a practi- cal and action-oriented roadmap to improve the quality of aid and its impact on development. HLF-3: An Opportunity to Engage 24. HLF-3 provides a unique opportunity for part- ner countries and other stakeholders to infl uence the highest levels of governments and organisa- tions, and reinforce networks for mutual learning and sharing of experiences. Over 800 delegates will take part in the Accra HLF, including ministers and senior offi cials from over 150 countries, heads of multilateral institutions and representatives from civil society organizations (CSOs). The HLF is organised in three tiers: HLF Tier 1: Nine Round Tables 25. The Round Tables provide for in-depth discus- sion on nine topics. What are the bottlenecks?

During the Central & West Asia consulta- tions, via video, J.B. Siriboe, Chief Director of Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning of the Government of Ghana, host of HLF-3, reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to supporting HLF-3 to deliver substantive outcomes on aid effectiveness through the AAA. He emphasized that the event in Ghana was not only for Africa, but for all regions of the world. It was impor- tant that all voices were heard and refl ected in the AAA and outcomes of the HLF-3. Sara Fyson, of the Aid Effectiveness Division, OECD DCD, presented the process for fi nalising the draft AAA. Participants had an opportunity to discuss the AAA during the con- sultation meeting, but also to contribute directly by emailing comments on the 18 March draft to aaa@acraHLF.net. Comments need to be received before 27 May so as to contribute to the revised draft (12 June) and the fi nal draft (20 July). All ver- sions will be accessible at www.accraHLF.net. 28. The AAA Consensus Group will lead the draft- ing of the AAA. It includes all members of HLF-3 Steering Committee, the Chair of the OECD\u2019s Development Assistance Committee, and four representatives from Ghana\u2019s partner country Contact Group. The Contact Group, comprising of 15 countries from all various regions, has been established to inform and infl uence the fi nal draft- ing of the AAA. It includes Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam from Asia. 29. A Menu of Options for the AAA has been draft- ed for each of the areas that partners and donors identifi ed in the 1st draft of the AAA as requiring greater specifi city and level of ambition. It con- tains a broad spectrum of possible actions proposed at three different opera- tional levels (actions by partners, actions by donors and joint actions by part- ners/donors). The options are drawn from proposals submitted by members of the Working Party on aid effectiveness and civil soci- ety organisations on 18 April 2008. The proposals have deliberately been simplifi ed so as to offer a clear set of alternative or complementary options for consideration. HLF Tier 3: Market Place 30. Accra includes a \u201cmarketplace\u201d, which runs in parallel to the Round Tables and AAA sessions, and allows all stakeholders to showcase and share knowledge, ideas and good practices. Participants can submit their materials by writing to: secretariat@accrahlf.net. The \u2018marketplace\u2019 at Accra will showcase and share knowledge, ideas and good practices 7 (i) Effective Consultation and Preparation for the HLF are Critical to its Success 31. During the Central & West Asia Consultation, participants learned more about the many events and meetings preparing for Accra \u2013 such as the Capacity Development Meeting in Bonn (May) and the Ownership workshop in Colombia (June). Governments stated that some continuity in rep- resentation from the sub-region was essential to maximise their effectiveness. Mr Stephen Groff, Deputy Director, OECD Development Cooperation Directorate, urged gov- ernments in the region to be vocal and forthright in conveying their messages for Accra and the AAA, or opportunities to infl uence would be lost. 32.

There is high level government inter- est from the region in the HLF-3. Minister Akylbek discussed how the HLF-3 delegation from Kyrgyz would include top level participation from either the President or Prime Minister. 34. Delegates were encouraged to convey what occurred at the Consultation to their colleagues and networks at country level who had not been able to attend. This was seen as one key way to reach out across the region and help countries prepare for HLF-3. It was recognised during the consultations that discus- sion on the HLF3 had only begun recently and partial- ly in the region. More and better translation of the relevant HLF3 documen- tation would be of great help governments in par- ticipating more fully in the process. This translation and further investment in national consultations and discussions would require rapid and signifi cant investment from development partners. 35. The Contact Group, led by KY Amoako in his advisory capacity to the Government of Ghana, was recognised as an initiative available to the region to leverage their voices at the international level. Representatives of the Kyrgyz Republic will meet with other Asian members \u2013 Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Samoa \u2013 on 26 May in Bangkok and draw on the four Asia-Pacifi c Consultation outputs to contribute to the drafting of the AAA. These governments will work with UNDP Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacifi c to ensure governments in the region are kept involved in the key next steps in preparing for Accra and drafting the AAA. 3 | Messages and Feedback from Central & West Asia More and better transla- tion of the relevant HLF3 documentation would be of great help governments in participating more fully in the process 8 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 8\u20139 May 2008 36. Some participants working on gender issues raised the importance of including gender equality concerns within the considerations of aid effec- tiveness and consultations on the HLF3. They asked that key commitments on strengthening impact on gender equality be included in the AAA. 37. Capacity development was emphasised by par- ticipants time and again over the two days and highlighted as a key constraint to delivering results. It was recognised that donors also had capacity defi cits, particularly in aid effectiveness, and need- ed to develop new skills. Participants were invited to join the Community of Practice in Managing for Results which has capacity development as it thrust. Please visit http://cop-mfdr.adb.org 38. The need to evaluate the progress of Paris Declaration by CSO and NGOs were pointed out as the current evaluation concerns only with the government. (ii) Strengthening the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) Ownership 39. Many of the delegates from Central & West Asia felt the language of the Paris Declaration could be improved: fi rstly, terms like \u2018ownership\u2019 and \u2018accountability\u2019 needed better defi nition, secondly the language could be simpler and more direct in the AAA and the Menu of Options (e.g. replace words like \u2018enhance\u2019 with \u2018ensure\u2019). Where language used metaphor \u2013 such as \u2018tied aid\u2019 \u2013 participants felt that more effort could be made to take the language universal, jargon free and eas- ily translatable. Also making Paris Declaration and High level Forum documents available in local lan- guages would help spread awareness of the whole process. 40. Better information creates better owner- ship. Delegates from the Kyrgyz Republic shared their experience of how the consultation process stimulated by their desire to localise the Paris Declaration, had developed greater ownership in country. Others discussed how donors should provide full information on all aid disbursements to governments (according to the classifi cation used by partner countries), so they in-turn can discuss the information with parliaments; civil society; direct benefi ciaries and other citizens affected. Donors should include and information regarding off-budget aid, including funding to NGOs and pro- vide projections over three years. Donors should make their own reviews and reports available to in-country stakeholders proactively and in the right language, as these contain rich information on improving aid effectiveness. To better use this information, donors should also provide technical assistance to develop the capacity of national sta- tistical services. 41.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "547571cf-fe35-4744-8450-58fe795fba9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "547571cf-fe35-4744-8450-58fe795fba9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/central-west-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Central & West Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/central-west-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e06395650d27e95528dea18ea55c058a96e6f14b20752d9a55f86de6cc91b8d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cd0e649-e3f2-4f67-b85c-a02f57ca31a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/central-west-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ac84bf980b6c5f38f0ccddcf34c0a8e541e9a7a1b8e8d5ae9ab31c9ea196d70"}}, "hash": "ed9cfd3e27e7a307c45b12fb65d1bef68ce24bd67a47cb17181bd85883791a75", "text": "41.

This process requires political leadership and where successful, creates ownership of goals by partner countries. This is important to build trust in partner countries of donors. Alignment Delegates from Georgia, 43. the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia shared common experiences on the need for stronger alignment of donors with partner countries development priorities, and for more effort to be put into over- coming the obstacles to doing this. Donors can only align to country priorities where they are care- fully planned and clearly expressed. It was noted that donors are sometimes \u2018obsessive\u2019 about their national agendas and this can overshadow their staff\u2019s potential to work to identify synergy with government\u2019s own priorities. To match donor and partner country priorities, some mechanism is required for dialogue between donors and part- ner countries. Better information creates better ownership 9 Central & West Asia: Outcomes 44. There was strong demand expressed for bet- ter performance measurement tools regarding the quality of systems \u2013 this will be key to mea- suring progress on improving country systems and increasing transparency about why donors do not use systems. Experience from the region suggests that country systems are improving, with regulations and legislation in place, though in some cases capacity to implement and use systems is lagging. Georgia noted that improvements in their procure- ment systems had not yet translated into increased donor use. 45. Best way to build capacity of country systems is to use them e.g. by channelling donor funds through them while providing technical assistance. The Kyrgyz Republic expressed a need for greater technical assistance from donors to implement good Public Financial Management systems in its two pilot ministries. Additionally, participants expressed the importance of national develop- ment strategies being based on thorough capacity development assessments. 46. It was recognised that increasing locally sourced technical assistance and reducing the expensive use of technical assistance from the donor coun- tries will require a systematic approach - requiring changing the nature of the expectations of the delivery of TA; changes in delivery mechanisms including more south-south partnerships, as well as more signifi cant donor and government investment in providing training to build up local expertise / improve local. 47. Participants discussed the targets on untying of aid and some argued that the Paris Declaration (or localised versions) should include a specifi c indicator on untying aid, ideally with 100% of aid untied as target \u2013 although others agreed an abso- lute target may not be achievable. Harmonisation 48. Governments should formulate a clear aid policy and tell donors the sectors where they want them to contribute and the role they want the donors to fulfi l such as policy advise, technical assistance and fi nancial resource. Donors should also look at developing joint strategies among themselves. Some argued that donors should not be overly focused on their \u2018attribution\u2019 or visibility at a project level and should develop better understand- ing with their constituencies of the benefit of pooled efforts. 49. Participants discussed the potential negative impact of donors excessively pursuing harmonization without considering its impact on alignment and ownership \u2013 spending too much time on elaborate coordination amongst them- selves mechanisms and too little time on working better with government. 50. Some partners shared their experience of the diffi culty of deciding on division of labour issues due to their lack of knowledge of donors policies. Partners asked that division of labour exercises be under partner country leadership. New and emerg- ing donors should be more transparent in their aid fi nancing and also subscribe to the Paris principles, especially ownership. Managing for Results 51. While there was general consensus on the need for and the progress in aligning donors behind national goals of development, more progress on the alignment of procedures & approaches was highlighted as needed. The alignment of donors\u2019 results frameworks and donor support for gov- ernment systems for managing for development results was considered as one such area that need- ed further attention. Managing for results should not apply just to donor funded activities, but to all development activates of government. 52. Managing for results and project indicators should be defi ned during project design. The should be a small number of clear and simple indicators. At the same time, indicators should not be narrow or exclusively econometric \u2013 there are many other facets to development. 53. Donors should aim to build comprehensive capacity in national statistical institutes, and not just fund piecemeal surveys.

Consultative groups of governments, CSOs and donors are needed as a structure to ensure bet- ter accountability, alignment, harmonisation and ownership. Constructed as working groups at the sector level these can also work well. 55. Governments and donors need to be more pro- active in involving CSOs. These groups have been underrepresented at this consultation as they are at Accra. 56. CSOs also need to demonstrate their account- ability and independence so as to reinforce their legitimacy. 57.

(iii) Messages from Central & West Asia for the Accra Round Tables 58. The Bangkok consultation offered Government delegations an opportunity to: (i) infl uence the issues that will be discussed at the Accra Round Tables; and (ii) to share their own experiences, to present case studies, to offer examples of good practice and innovation; and (iii) to infl uence the commitments and contribute to the announce- ments that will be made at the HLF-3. 59. The nine Round Table (RT) working group dis- cussions underscored that countries in the region have a number of experi- ences that they are willing to share and which could help advance the agenda of aid effectiveness at the HLF-3. These are cap- tured in detail Annex 2. Some participants at fi rst expressed concern that the \u2018headings\u2019 for the top- ics to be discussed at the round tables were not easy to relate their experience to. The discussions were greatly enhanced by countries which had par- ticular experience on the specifi c topics and after these participants had shared their perspectives others made the connection between the HLF3 topics and their country experience. 60. Participating governments from the region were keen to know more about how they could offer to serve as panellists or key note speakers at the HLF. Country delegations interacted directly with six of the nine RT Co-Chairs which were pres- ent, and the organising committee said it would be willing to work with RT Co-Chairs to identify further panellists from Central & West Asia. The organising committee is also willing to support governments in the region develop case studies for the HLF-3. 61. The preparatory process (of meetings, ana- lytical work, country studies) differs for each of the Round Tables. More information will become available at www.AccraHLF.net. Policy and research documents on each of the nine Round Tables can be found at www.AidEffectiveness.org. (iv) Using Evidence for Action: the 2008 Survey on Aid Effectiveness and the Paris Declaration Evaluation 62. The Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia and Tajikistan are already signatories to the Paris Declaration and the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia both participat- ed in the 2006 and 2008 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration. 63. The 2008 survey is intended as a tool to assess the current state of play on aid, to facilitate dialogue between devel- opment partners and to identify actions needed to reach a common vision to meet targets of the Paris Declaration by 2010. 64. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s experience of the survey fulfi lled the above expectations, and led to concrete actions to develop a roster of technical assistance to be used jointly by development partners. Emerging donors should also subscribe to the Paris principles 11 Central & West Asia: Outcomes 65. In one country context, a civil society repre- sentative said the survey had been one-sided and only refl ected the government view, and it was important to dig deeper for more accurate information. CSOs could play a role here, but only where they had suffi cient space and capacity.

Comments are drawn together from break-out as well as plenary sessions. A wide range of sometimes contradictory views were expressed, which are presented here together. The text of the AAA Menu of Options is available on the OECD website at http://www.olis.oecd.org/ olis/2008doc.nsf/ENGDATCORPLOOK/NT000010A2/$FILE/JT03244885.PDF And also through the www.AccraHLF.net website. Annex 1 | Comments on AAA Menu of Options # OPTIONS FOR ACTION COMMENTS/PROPOSALS/ACTIONS B Conditionality Harmonise \u2022 Harmonise and simplify conditionalities: be proportional to aid disbursed: \u00bb link the amount of aid received with the cost of related conditionalities \u00bb transparent mechanism to monitor the cost of conditionalities for partner countries \u00bb set targets/limits for the number of conditionalities \u2013 and value added \u2013 depending on country capacity \u2022 Donors should harmonise among themselves conditionalities relat- ing to multi-donor budget support. Align \u2022 Donors should be realistic about conditionalities \u2013 examples were provided of conditionalities linked to procurement laws where it proved unhelpful and unrealistic. \u2022 Donors should align their conditionalities to government priorities and the local context. Transparency and negotiation of conditionality \u2022 The negotiation of conditionalities is not always clear \u2013 how are they selected? Need commitment from donors on transparency. \u2022 The language of menu of options needs to be clarifi ed \u2013 there is too much behind the words (wording that is as precise as possible should be chosen in order to reduce/eliminate ambiguity and convey accurate meaning)..

(ii) While donors are obsessed with their own objectives, priorities and sector preferences, part- ner countries are also often not able to indicate clear priorities. (iii) It is for recipient countries to see that they receive the assistance according to their pri- orities so as to have the maximum impact on development. (iv) Lack of trust between donors and partner countries makes for cumbersome procedures and bureaucratic delays in project approvals and implementation. (v) High turn over of staff within governments and lack of institutional memory. Solutions and action points (i) To match donor and partner country priori- ties, some mechanism is required for donors and partner countries to simultaneously, and in con- sultation with each other, develop the national development strategies based on thorough capac- ity development assessment. (ii) Active involvement of elected bodies and civil society in priority setting as well as monitoring of aid effectiveness \u2013 with participation of CSOs \u2013 will lead to enhancement of democratic ownership. (iii) For enhancing country ownership, paradigm of interaction between partner countries and donors should change; conditionalities should fi rst be in line with and not in confl ict with partner coun- try priorities and only thereafter refl ect donor priority. (iv) Donor community should have a joint strategy which should coincide with the national develop- ment strategy of the partner country. RT Co-chair take away (i) There is need to clarify the concept and con- notation of various terms, such as ownership and accountability.

(vi) Capacity development was cited often with the demand that donors instead of only giving assistance should also develop the capacity in Annex 2 | The Accra Round Tables: Messages from Central & West Asia HLF Consultation 19 Central & West Asia: Outcomes the partner country. The other side of the coin is that the high turnover of personnel in partner countries can lead to the wastage of resources used for capacity development. (vii) Capacity development is important to ulti- mately reduce aid dependence. Country Experience (Kyrgyz Republic) (i) Paris Declaration of 2005 and the consultation leading to its adoption, provided the stimulus to set out national priorities (reducing the number of priorities to 4 from 162 in the earlier strategy). (ii) This allowed the donors to get a clear picture of the regions and sectors that were most important and where aid was required. (iii) Under SWAP, the Government of Kyrgyz Republic is channelling the aid received for the health sector, which accounts for 20-25% of the sector. (iv) Development aid is audited through the gov- ernment system and the reports are reviewed by the government together with the donors and the civil society because aid effectiveness can lead to development results. Round Table 2: Alignment: Use of Country Systems, Untying Aid, Aid Predictability Use of Country Systems (i) Country systems improving, with regulations and legislation in place, though in some cases capacity to implement and use systems is lagging. (ii) Donors still have diffi culty in using country sys- tems. Georgia has made signifi cant improvements to their procurement systems, and while they still have more to do, still fi nd that some agencies are unwilling to use their country systems. (iii) Sometimes donors use own systems due to lack of understanding of country systems. Partner countries should work to educated donors about country systems and how they work. (iv) Best way to build capacity of country systems is to use them e.g. by channelling donor funds through them. The Kyrgyz Republic expressed a need for greater technical assistance from donors to implement good Public Financial Management systems in its two pilot ministries. (v) Poor salaries for civil servants makes it diffi - cult for governments to attract and retain staff, and thus to effectively build capacity. Georgia strengthened process of capacity building by reduced differential between public and private sector salaries. (vi) Capacity development needs to be based more on demand (e.g. though needs assessment). Some donors have good and transparent training pro- grams that effectively transfer skills. Predictability (i) Donors need to do more on providing accurate and timely information to partner countries on commitments and disbursements. Georgia stated that the lack of a disbursement schedule from donors made it extremely diffi cult for the national budgeting process. (ii) One common online aid management and tracking systems, used by donors and partner countries, improve predictability and allow donor head offi ce to directly update information. (iii) Predictability is a major concern in Mongolia, so now together with UNDP are developing a web based aid system, to improve predictability. (iv) Delays on the part of donors\u2019 in approving projects particularly undermines partner countries budgeting process. (v) Donors\u2019 communication between HQ and coun- try offi ces needs strengthening. (vi) Donor systems may need reform to provide information on aid fl ows in format of partner country systems e.g. synchronising with partner counties\u2019 fi scal year. (vii) Donors should harmonise among themselves, and share best practices. Annex 2 20 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 8\u20139 May 2008 Untying of Aid (i) Progress by donors on untying aid has been mixed (generally multilaterals have done better than bilaterals). A political commitment led by donor head-offi ces is necessary to make contin- ued progress. (ii) Some partner countries are choosing to refuse aid that is tied, unless donor has a real and signifi - cant comparative advantage. (iii) Practice of tied aid has resulted in donors sending outdated technologies.

This can lead to increased predictability. (iii) There is very little coordination among donors either in selecting sectors that they want to be engaged in or even within sectors. (iv) There should be focus on sectors with the greatest need. Besides the national development strategy, there should be medium term strategy for sector in line with the national strategy. (v) To foster harmonization, instruments like pooled funds, Sector Wide Approaches under joint country support strategy could be adopted. (vi) Partner countries should focus on key policies in the quest for harmonized procedures among donors, e.g. procurement policy to be adopted. A country experience of reform in procurement laws in consultation with major donors indicated posi- tive outcomes. (vii) Too many Project Implementation Units (PIUs). Sometimes all the projects in the same sector have their own PIUs and even within the same project, each donor has its own PIU. PIUs could be limited to, say one per sector and they should work in coordination with the line ministries. (viii) Participants discussed the potential negative impact of donors excessively pursuing harmoniza- tion without considering its impact on alignment and ownership \u2013 spending too much time on elaborate coordination amongst themselves mechanisms and too little time on working better with government. (ix) Some partners shared their experience of the diffi culty of deciding on division of labour issues due to their lack of knowledge of donors policies. Partners asked that division of labour exercises be under partner country leadership. New and emerg- ing donors should be more transparent in their aid fi nancing and also subscribe to the Paris principles, especially ownership. (x) Some argued donors are possessive about proj- ects and this prevents pooling of resources and results in some projects suffering from inadequate funds. Some argued that donors should not be overly focused on their \u2018attribution\u2019 or visibility at a project level and should develop better under- standing with their constituencies of the benefi t of pooled efforts. Round Table 4: Managing for Results and Development Impact Managing for Development Results (i) General consensus on goals of development, but more alignment on procedures & approaches need- ed between donors & government for Managing for Development Results is to succeed. 21 Central & West Asia: Outcomes (ii) Managing for Development Results should not be limited to donor funded activates, but should cover all work of government. (iii) Accra Agenda for Action commitments should be linked to development effectiveness and achievement of the MDGs. (iv) National monitoring systems should be established, with involvement of all stakeholders including CSOs. (v) Design projects based on comprehensive sys- tem approach at country-level, and in view of the long term results; and identify performance indi- cators to assess progress. (vi) Avoid narrow or exclusively economic metrics of performance. Economic Rate of Return can not fully express the value of a hospital, for example. (vii) Better alignment by donors with national procurement systems and country strategies will contribute to progress on Managing for Development Results. (viii) Some countries suggested the need for a new mechanism for evaluating results at the coun- try level, (CPIA-Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, and CPPR-Country Portfolio Performance Review worked well in Tajikistan). (ix) Donors\u2019 independent evaluations are impor- tant tools for partner countries, and proactively shared with partner countries by donors. (x) Donors together with partner countries, should jointly design, monitor and evaluate projects and systems. This will synchronise expectations of development partners, and contribute to Capacity Development. (xi) Paris Declaration commitment on joint partici- patory work not met by donors. (xii) (xii) Donors should harmonise among them- selves their reporting and monitoring formats. Project Implementation Units (PIUs) (i) PIU can have many modalities and there were different perspectives about their desirability and effectiveness. (ii) PIUs jointly established by, and jointly account- able to, governments and donors can be highly effective. (iii) PIUs integration with line Ministries is a key to improving aid effectiveness and capacity development.

Round Table 5: Mutual Accountability (i) Partner countries argued that there was a need for a better knowledge of ODA support at the country level, and all donors should create a com- prehensive data base on the aid volumes at the country level, and share it with the partner coun- tries, for the latter to plan their program budgets better. It was argued that multilateral organizations had a better data base than the bilateral organiza- tions. A good example was provided by the Kyrgyz Republic, which has a simple but effective bilingual database, which is updated twice a year. (ii) The countries sought a far stronger commit- ment from the donors to provide timely complete 22 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, 8\u20139 May 2008 information (Para 49 of Paris Declaration), and suggested the need for establishing bilingual ODA database. A good example was provided by Republic of Kyrgyz, which has a simple but effec- tive bilingual database, which is updated twice a year. (iii) Some countries (Armenia, Tajikistan) pointed out the need for a stronger analytical capacity to understand and analyse ODA information, and to use the data base for better decision-making. (iv) There is a proliferation of large number of donors in some countries (Tajikistan faces a chal- lenge to deal with 87 organisations). In some cases, aid coordination units were set up under a project but the accountability of such units is to donors, and also sustainability of such units is under threat after the project ends. Projects supporting aid coordination must build capacity from the start inside regular ministry structures for these to be sustainable. (v) Partner countries argued that donors pick up their favourite projects and do not align to the national development strategies of the countries. If donors allocate aid according to the country national development strategy and priorities, countries will have a better ownership and be more accountable to results. Partner countries sought commitment from donors for greater alignment of donor fi nancing with national priorities. (vi) Some countries argued that Governments should be accountable to their parliaments and citizens fi rst, countries do not have an account- ability but a \u2018responsibility\u2019 to donors, accordingly argued that \u2018accountability\u2019 is not the right term. (vii) Some of the countries in the region argued that domestic accountability mechanisms are weak. For example, in Mongolia governments are unstable, change every couple of years, and there- fore Governments have a short-term strategy, and it is diffi cult to hold governments accountable to parliaments. (viii) Some countries suggested that strong func- tioning of the Consultative Group is critical to effective aid management. Separate coordina- tion mechanisms \u2013 some exclusive to donors or to NGOs \u2013 are diffi cult to manage. There is need to bring all 3 parties (donors, Government, and CSOs) together in a single mechanism to discuss national priorities. (ix) Some countries argued that there is need for NGOs to share their accountabilities also. Some NGOs deliver services but most are politicised. There is need to have tripartite dialogue and bet- ter reporting/accountability of all three; there was also a need to share a positive list and a black list of NGOs, keeping in view experience with the NGOs. (x) Emigration of skilled staff has led to capacity gaps \u2013 yet often Technical Assistance and consul- tants fail to transfer knowledge. Discussion on AAA (i) Draft AAA doesn\u2019t address a core challenge raised by region. AAA should include a fi rm com- mitment of donors needed to report all types of ODA accurately, and to provide three-year forward estimates of ODA levels. (ii) There should be some commitment on the trans- fer of knowledge, from the donors/consultants to the government staff. Partner countries need to address the issue of frequent changes in govern- ment personnel, and coordination and transfer of knowledge between different Ministries. (iii) Strategic directions of donors at the global lev- el \u2013 is not clear, donors should clarify the change in their principles and polices over time. Donors should also post a list of unsatisfactory compa- nies/consultants on the web site.

Some donors have adopted their development strategies to refl ect the Georgian government priorities. (vii) Strong sector strategies can succeed and per- sist through periods of political instability or even \u2018fragility\u2019. (viii) Sector plans can not be developed or imple- mented in isolation as sectors are interdependent: e.g. health sector relies on good Public Financial Management which relies on good governance. (ix) Learning experiences from one sector can inform planning in other sectors, even with very informal institutional consultation arrangements. (x) Lack of harmonization among donors still exist within specifi c sectors. Each donor wants to take a lead and recognised that it can be a challenge for lead donor to get agreement from other donors to use their systems. (xi) Conditionality needs to be negotiated between governments and donors \u2013 donors need to be more realistic and fl exible, as the donors demand never-achievable conditions.. (xii) Donors need to work harder on predictability and transfer of information and meet commit- ments they have made. 25 Central & West Asia: Outcomes Round Table 9: Implications of the Changing Aid Architecture for Aid Effectiveness (i) Almost all the countries in the region received large amounts of assistance from non-traditional donors, especially China. (ii) Countries appreciated the assistance by non- traditional donors and argued that these donors had a number of advantages. The non-traditional donors did not impose any \u2018conditionality\u2019 and the speed of processing of assistance was particularly high with good quality of works as well as extreme- ly advantageous loan conditions. Timing is very important for the partner countries. Transaction costs of such funds was much lower than that of funds from traditional donors. (iii) Further, aid from non-traditional donor align (example China) with the country priorities as stated in the PRSP, including that for infrastructure investment, which is not necessarily the approach followed by traditional donors (IFIs). It was also observed that aid resources from non-traditional donors were also for poverty reduction and eco- nomic development. (iv) However, countries also recognized the disad- vantages of the increasing number of donors in general. Increasing number of donors causes pro- liferation of aid (87 offi cial donors in Tajikistan). (v) The non-traditional donors, in most cases, did not apply any safeguards, or environmental or social standards to their assistance, and this aspect is negatively perceived. It was also observed that the issue of sustainability of infrastructure or services created under the project was not a pri- ority of non-traditional donors. Partner countries called for non-traditional donors to be more trans- parent with fi nancing and to do more to ensure partner country ownership of projects. They also do not recognize debt sustainability of the country at the time of providing loans to these countries. However, there was one case which country assess the safeguard aspects by itself and have rejected the project with insuffi cient safeguard measures. Such proactive measures by the partner country is important. (vi) At the same time countries sought capac- ity development and transfer of knowledge from donors, rather than have the donors implement a project themselves. (vii) Countries agreed that strong ownership was crucial to better manage increasing aid resources from donors, especially in the light of the increas- ing number of donors in country. (viii) There was a need to recognize the diversity of donors as well as partner countries, and a need to enhance dialogue between and with new donors so that a more inclusive framework for Harmonisation and alignment can be facilitated. (ix) Countries agreed that a coordinated dialogue and coordination between traditional and non- traditional donors for shared goal is benefi cial for partner countries. 26 Thirteen participants provided feedback on the Central & Western Asia consultation, evaluation overall workshop quality at 3.75 out of a possible total of 4.0.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c2c48fa-31c2-4435-9610-523ab4181f96": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c2c48fa-31c2-4435-9610-523ab4181f96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/central-west-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Central & West Asia Outcomes: Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/central-west-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47b9b9e921883c2c48c18c270d3f52c7e848c9ec87b86a8bb9ee9acb08e9509d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b606e77a-7598-4b92-ad2a-b1755ae04d0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/central-west-asia-outcomes-consultations-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5531b95ff118ab831ce77d7605002f45beb1c458210fb67c31ddc7374fb0131c"}}, "hash": "6223271ee09f50278f615ae8fd31bfcf00791ad6668f316c9665396229edb4bd", "text": "In the region, only three out of seven countries taking part in the consultation have signed the Paris Declaration (Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Tajikistan) and participants emphasised the practical value of the HLF Consultation in rais- ing country level awareness: \u201cI am much better equipped, and understand recent developments, to lobby government offi cials to sign up to the Paris Declaration\u201d, \u201cOur country has not yet signed the Paris Declaration \u2013 I will present results to the Minister of Finance\u201d, and that the consultation had been \u201cvery useful for partner countries and donors to prepare for Accra\u201d.

The CPEIR examines the linkages between the three spheres of: national climate change policy; the institutional structures through which policy is channelled; and the resource allocation processes whereby public funding is made available for the implementation of relevant projects, programmes and policies. The paper first outlines the analytical framework of this methodology. It draws on the experience of a substantial body of work that has examined the effectiveness of public expenditure through the use of several analytical tools. This leads to a description of the core elements of the CPEIR: namely the analysis of climate change policy, institutions and public expenditure. The tasks associated with carrying out a CPEIR are then outlined, from the necessary preparatory work that is required before the CPEIR can be undertaken, through the implementation of the component analysis (highlighting some of the key questions that this analysis aims to address), to how the findings of the review can be followed up to enhance national systems. Annexes contain complementary information, including sample terms of reference to implement a CPEIR as well as a note on the challenge of ensuring methodological consistency between CPEIRs. 1 1. Introduction New and additional finance is becoming available to assist developing country efforts in their response to climate change. How these resources are being taken up by national systems is an important question that warrants attention. The challenge for all countries is to secure a comprehensive, cross-government approach that delivers a coherent response to climate change, involving both the public and private sectors. Such as approach has been termed a Climate Fiscal Framework (CDDE, 2011). The first step in building a Climate Fiscal Framework is to develop a methodology that allows an analysis to be made of how climate change related expenditure is being integrated into national budgetary processes. This analysis has to be set within the context of the national policy and institutional arrangements that exist to manage the response to climate change. These three key themes of: (i) policy development, (ii) institutional structures and (iii) public financial management need to be investigated in an holistic manner. This is what we call a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09ea660c-7c1f-4569-97d0-cc2eea726d3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "09ea660c-7c1f-4569-97d0-cc2eea726d3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cabf66076e17cb0bbd959f0b66f5d9162526bd41f6dad894c08bfbaa11db7e91"}, "2": {"node_id": "baed1b23-f24f-40fe-82bb-dfd0c59a8214", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "277291ff47de9d2698559c35d7c674ea6e77c58d132d19f682e903206c6fd684"}}, "hash": "f5892ea245fa69850f9215f635041bc05fb985325b122f5eb05e35f4f86ac7ea", "text": "This is what we call a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR).

The CPEIR approach has potential to become a strategic methodological tool that will allow policy makers assess the present status of the national response to climate change. This can then inform preparation for the scaling-up of access and delivery of climate finance. To-date, five CPEIRs have been completed as pilot studies (Annex 1). This methodological note describes the approach taken in undertaking these reviews. 2. Methodological Framework 2.1 PERs, PEIRs and PEERs The CPEIR methodology builds on a substantial body of analysis into policy development, institutional performance and public expenditure. Three approaches to such analysis were reviewed to inform the development of the CPEIR methodology: public expenditure reviews, public expenditure and institutional reviews, and public environmental expenditure reviews. Public Expenditure Reviews Public expenditure reviews (PERs) involve the analysis of the allocation, management and results of public expenditures and may cover all government expenditure or focus on priority sectors. In the case of climate change actions, there is a conceptual hurdle to overcome as such actions are not limited to one or a few sectors, but represent new and additional incremental spending across the whole of the economy. A common representation of a PER is that it should present what was planned to be spent (the budget); what was actually spent (in terms of expenditures); what was achieved (outputs) and 2 whether these achievements met policy objectives (outcomes), together with an assessment of the institutional mechanisms controlling expenditure and managing performance. Evaluation along this \u2018results chain\u2019 provides a robust analytical framework for climate change activities, although an assessment of the long-term impact of such spending cannot yet be determined. Pradhan, in his 1996 review of PERs, observed there was no systematic framework for public expenditure analysis, and that little guidance was available in the academic literature. He identified six elements as being essential in any PER. Table 1 lists these elements and adds a commentary on their relevance where the focus is on climate change expenditure. Table 1: Pradhan's elements of a PER and their relevance to climate change expenditure Pradhan\u2019s elements for a PER Relevance for climate change expenditure Discussion of the aggregate level of public spending and deficit of the consolidated public sector and its consistency with the country\u2019s macroeconomic framework; this requires that all sources of finance are recognised, including central and local government, and extra-budgetary funds. The recognition of different sources of finance is an important issue for climate change actions, with much present activity supported by international funding and future activity likely to depend, to a varying degree, on private funding. Extra-budgetary funds may be significant. Analysis of the allocation of aggregate spending across and within sectors, and the extent to which this allocation is consistent with the maximisation of social welfare. Consideration of allocation to pre-identified \u2018climate sensitive\u2019 sectors (and within these sectors) may be appropriate. Examination of the role of the public versus the private sector in the financing and provision of social programmes (in particular, whether public expenditures complement or substitute for private sector activities). Highly relevant for climate change expenditure: a principle of public expenditure is that it should only support those actions that the private sector is unwilling or unable to meet. Analysis of the effect of key public programmes on the poor, including their incidence and total costs. Equity concerns feature prominently in PERs, but further metrics are beginning to be developed in the study of climate change actions (e.g. the potential for carbon emission reductions and responses arising from climate change vulnerability). Examination of the input mix or the allocations for capital and recurrent expenditures within programmes and sectors (and the extent to which such allocations promote internal efficiency). Highly relevant for climate change, where both new capital expenditure as well as increased recurrent costs are necessary. Discussion of the budgetary institutions and processes and the extent to which such institutions and processes promote fiscal discipline, allocative efficiency and equity in the composition of spending, and technical efficiency in the use of budgeted resources. Institutional analysis is important as climate change represents a new theme of public policy and the institutional setting is not yet well established.

Four country PEIRs were reviewed as part of the CPEIR methodological development. Significantly, they did not follow a standard format, but appeared to focus on country-specific priorities (World Bank, 2001; 2002a; 2002b; 2005). However, common themes included a review of: (i) the macroeconomic context of the country; (ii) budget planning and execution; (iii) the institutional framework; and (iv) the issue of fiscal decentralisation (Table 2). The last element is also recognised as being an important one for climate change, as the structures in 3 place at the local level will help determine how climate finance reaches the most vulnerable communities.

This body of work parallels the CPEIR approach, as environmental concerns are cross-cutting in nature rather than being limited to any one sector. Box 1 highlights some of the major issues that have been identified; many of these can be expected to be present when climate change expenditure is the focus of study. Box 1.

Out of a total of 4,600 expenditure lines identified, the 400 largest budget lines accounted for approximately 80% of environmental public expenditure. The analysis highlighted that capital expenditure predominated (also at 80%) and about one-third of the expenditure occurred at the local government level, reflecting the emerging fiscal decentralisation in Bhutan. Both of these issues \u2013 the balance between capital and recurrent spending, and between central government and local expenditure \u2013 are issues to be addressed when examining climate change related expenditure. These three methodological approaches (PERs, PEIRs and PEERs) offer guidance for how public expenditure on climate change actions can be examined. They all contain elements of policy, institutional and budgetary analysis, which are the three main strands of the CPEIR. 2.2 Analysis of climate change policy There has been rapid development of climate change policies in many countries. This national policy interest has been strongly driven by the international leadership of the UNFCCC, which has framed much of the policy discourse. The policy environment tends to be a fast moving one, as new themes promoted at the international level are taken up at country level. Some countries have prepared national climate change policy statements and, where these exist, they represent an important starting point for the CPEIR analysis. Early policy priorities may have been identified (with varying degrees of definition), which can give some indication of likely areas of new public investment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c024e9d3-8a32-4ec7-b889-c626e4aa9a88": {"__data__": {"id_": "c024e9d3-8a32-4ec7-b889-c626e4aa9a88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b1223c322e3bf8dcaf1eb3028963958e27aa7d21eb540eaef310e2e5486fb86"}, "2": {"node_id": "759d65c0-b32c-4040-9024-304fa28eb42f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7930bf1ee2a8fd7f223be58e70500490387ddfbd025835dba6738383c10c5266"}}, "hash": "9799c4d3eedf5c4a3913e7c37f59a198955525c1c3a55f94e34f7411926bd86a", "text": "However, it may be that policy positions on climate change have yet to coalesce within one national statement of policy, so an examination of policy within different sectors as well as different levels", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11b520cd-3726-4bbb-a93f-02c027ae8ebe": {"__data__": {"id_": "11b520cd-3726-4bbb-a93f-02c027ae8ebe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64ef64c734f70d479e9418a3c10dbfdecfe557a7755f8d74722cc6f11260942f"}}, "hash": "64ef64c734f70d479e9418a3c10dbfdecfe557a7755f8d74722cc6f11260942f", "text": "of government (e.g. national/local/municipal) will often be necessary. This will also allow for an assessment to be made on the coherence of national policy. In addition to reviewing the content of climate change policy, the CPEIR analysis examines the processes whereby policy is developed. In particular, the role of different stakeholders in influencing policy provides an insight into the likely take-up of policy positions and subsequent funding allocations. In many countries, international development partners invest resources to engage with the policy community and may play a significant role. The national climate change response is often characterised by several strategy and planning processes. The integration of policy, strategy and planning represents a considerable challenge to ensure coherence of resource allocation. The CPEIR therefore examines how responses to climate change are being taken forward within a range of different planning exercises, be it the development of disaster risk management or clean energy supply, and assesses the coherence of these responses. How climate change is mainstreamed into national development strategies is also a key area of enquiry. Where policy positions have been enacted into legislation an examination of the legal framework is an important consideration for the CPEIR policy analysis. This may assist in determining how climate change actions are defined in the country concerned. At present, there is no internationally recognised definition of climate expenditure and therefore no clear boundaries of such spending. This represents a major challenge for any study of climate finance. As a starting point, it is important to recognise that the phenomenon of \u2018adaptation deficit\u2019 applies in all countries. This term, perhaps better described as the development deficit, refers to the extent to which societies are adequately adapted to the current climate (Burton, 2004). Normally this deficit is excluded from baseline and future cost estimates of responding to climate change (Smith at el., 2011). In principle, development as usual should be excluded from estimates of climate 5 change related expenditure, but this is difficult to do in academic costing studies and even more difficult in country policy contexts. Adaptation costs are defined as those due to climate change but additional to development. Reflecting these issues, the concept of climate finance remains contested within the UNFCCC negotiations. The OECD has set out some initial definitions (Table 3) distinguishing between mitigation and adaptation, with examples of each as a first guide to identifying climate change activities. Table 3: Defining climate finance 1. Mitigation OECD Definition: An activity should be classified as climate change mitigation related if it contributes to the objectives of stabilisation of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by promoting efforts to reduce or limit GHG emissions or to enhance GHG sequestration (OECD, 2011) Sector Example activities Forestry Protection and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs of GHGs through sustainable forest management, afforestation and reforestation Water and sanitation Methane emission reductions through waste management or sewage treatment Energy GHG emission reductions or stabilisation in the energy, transport, industry and agricultural sectors through application of new and renewable forms of energy, measures to improve the energy efficiency of existing machinery or demand side management (e.g. education and training) Transport Industry Agriculture 2. Adaptation OECD Definition: An activity should be classified as adaptation-related if it intends to reduce the vulnerability of human or natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks, by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity and resilience (OECD, 2011). Sector Example activities Enabling activities Supporting the development of climate change adaptation-specific policies, programs and plans Policy and legislation Capacity strengthening of national institutions responsible for adaptation Agriculture Promoting diversified agricultural production to reduce climate risk Energy Strengthening of energy transmission and distribution infrastructure to cope with the expected impacts of climate change Forestry Securing local rights and systems for the sustainable and long-term utilisation of the forest in order to increase resilience to climate change Health Strengthening food safety regulations; developing or enhancing monitoring systems Transport Building protection from climate hazards into existing transport infrastructures (e.g. Disaster Risk Reduction measures) Water and sanitation Monitoring and management of hydrological and meteorological data Source: Handbook on the OECD-DEC climate markers. Preliminary version. OECD, 2011 The CPEIR approach to defining climate change related expenditure builds on these initial OECD guidelines and begins in each country by reviewing existing national policy documents. These provide insights into how climate change actions are being defined within the country concerned. This literature will also give a strong indication of where climate expenditure will be found across the ministries, departments and agencies of government. 6 2.3 Analysis of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9640674-3f19-40a2-a7cb-569358eae9ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9640674-3f19-40a2-a7cb-569358eae9ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd4e679422d81d97bb68b4111ff87365e8814c88a7740e40cae847e51c4ad9f2"}}, "hash": "dd4e679422d81d97bb68b4111ff87365e8814c88a7740e40cae847e51c4ad9f2", "text": "climate change institutions Spending on climate change actions passes through a range of public and private sector organisations and therefore an analysis of these bodies is a central theme of the CPEIR. In the first instance, it is important to map the institutional arrangements within government for addressing climate change actions. In some countries this may involve new organisations whose primary function is the management of a national climate change response; elsewhere it will involve this role being added to an existing government ministry or department. A core theme of the institutional analysis is to map how the national budget is managed and the role played by Ministries of Finance and their component departments in responding to climate change in the context of greater volumes of finance becoming available, particularly through enhanced international support. The institutional analysis should explore whether these organisational structures are collectively responding to the policy objectives set by government (Box 2). An important element of this analysis is whether there are resources identified within the national budget to allow these agencies to build the necessary capacity. Some measure of existing institutional effectiveness should lead to an assessment of the need for further capacity development. With regard to government institutions this may necessarily link to broader reforms within the public sector. Local government institutions are particularly important in harnessing an effective response to climate change, yet evidence from several countries indicates this is where capacity constraints may be most acute at the present time. Determining the mandates that have been delegated to the sub- national level of the government administration is one element of the institutional analysis that needs to be completed. In additional to the public sector, an institutional analysis is required of civil society organisations and the private sector. Both the profit and non-profit sectors already play a significant role in climate change activities in many countries and this calls for an understanding to be developed of their structures, capacity and operating incentives. 2.4 Analysis of climate change in public expenditure A number of important issues need to be addressed by the CPEIR analysis with respect to budgetary issues. The first challenge relates to identifying climate change expenditure within the national budget so that the most important aspects of public spending can be analysed. This requires that information about planned and actual spending on climate change related activities (at a sufficiently disaggregated level) can be identified. The CPEIR team has to work closely with colleagues in ministries of finance to identify and validate this expenditure. Box 2. Institutional collaboration necessary for an effective response to climate change In Nepal, climate change is an emerging policy theme, with variable interest at the sector level. The discussion based on from the findings of the Nepal CPEIR exercise was instrumental in bringing together the following key ministries of government: Finance, Planning, Environment and Local Government. These ministries subsequently formed a working group to develop a climate change budget indicator code and to follow up on the report's other recommendations. This will ensure that, like already established gender budgeting and pro-poor budget monitoring, climate change is fully embedded in the government\u2019s own budget system with greater use of country systems for implementation and monitoring. Source: Nepal CPEIR Report, 2011 7 The national budget expenditure codes (in both the developmental and non-development budgets if compiled separately) \u2013 as well as in externally funded programmes \u2013 need to be identified using expert judgement and all available budget and programme documentation, including MTEF descriptions. The whole of the government Chart of Accounts should be reviewed to ensure that the administrative structure of government does not detract from significant elements of spending in parts of government beyond a prescriptive list of candidate Ministries. It is important that budget line activities are identified, rather than solely the administrative structures. Identifying expenditure codes across the whole of government from the Chart of Accounts can be a substantial, time consuming task that will require much institutional knowledge. However some points that may be considered to reduce the workload include: (i) identifying key sectors/ministries/ administrative responsibilities; (ii) identifying non-budgetary funds from key sectors; (iii) identifying climate related codes from the administrative and/or the functional classification of the budget. Further assessment of the identified activities should then be made, with an estimate made of the proportion of expenditure considered relevant to climate change on a scale of 0 \u2013 100%. All activities are then grouped into the four categories listed in Table 4, with the subsequent financial analysis based on these groupings.

However, programmes that address (i) and (ii) are already in national development budgets to address the \u2018adaptation\u2019 or \u2018development deficit\u2019. This makes the identification of expenditure very difficult in practice, and this is likely to remain an on-going challenge for such reviews. It is widely recognised in the climate change literature that continued development may be one of the best defences against climate change (Narain et al., 2011, Schelling, 1992). Development makes more resources available for abating risk and recovery from climate change. Of course, too, adaptation is also crucial for development. \ufffd For these reasons, the key is to develop a nationally-appropriate approach that has broad buy-in and confidence, and this should be achieved by ensuring consultation with key stakeholders throughout the course of the study. This is particularly needed in countries where there is no formal climate change policy. National experts and funding agencies need to take the lead in this process. \ufffd Programmes that are normally of low or medium relevance may be promoted to medium or high relevance if they are operating in areas that have been mapped as being highly susceptible to climate change. This particularly applies to general programmes that address the development deficit of the country, such as livelihoods and social protection programmes in Table 4. \ufffd If a programme has some high and some lower relevance components, it may be possible to split it into two programmes.

If there is any uncertainty, the CPEIR methodology defaults to the lower relevance category. The assumptions behind such selections should be explicitly recorded, to lay a trail that others can follow. \ufffd National programmes that address current climate variability are assumed to address climate change and are included in the expenditure summaries. In addition to a review of the central government expenditures, the financial analysis needs to examine local government spending to explore to what extent discretionary powers for spending and revenue collection on activities that relate to climate change have been devolved to local authorities. Other sources of public expenditure that lie outside the national budget also need to be identified, quantified and analysed. Extra-budgetary funds may provide significant financing for CC-related actions. Such funds refer to government transactions, often with separate banking and institutional arrangements that are not included in the annual state (federal) budget law and the budgets of sub- national levels of government. There is already use of national trust funds to direct the climate change response in some countries, with the Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund and the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund being two examples. An important source of climate finance in many countries is that derived from international sources. How this external finance is taken up within a country and, where public money is concerned, if and how it appears \u2018on budget\u2019 is another important issue to be addressed in the CPEIR. As climate finance increases in scale over the coming years the strength of financial controls will become a critical component of the overall system and hence the working of financial audits and the public finance management system more generally also needs to be reviewed. To-date, the CPEIR methodology has aimed to identify those expenditures within the national budgetary system that are relevant to improving climate resilience and the mitigation of climate change. However, it would be possible to also identify expenditures that reduce resilience or lead to increased carbon emissions. The level of such expenditure has not yet been estimated in any of the CPEIR studies, but it may be significant and therefore warrants consideration in future CPEIR analysis. Further, the CPEIR methodology used in the pilot studies has focused on direct expenditures. Countries are however also targeting the mitigation of climate change through the tax expenditures. These are tax credits on specific activities to promote green private sector investments. Further, a number of countries are increasingly using their taxation policies to deter behaviour that may lead to behaviours promoting increased greenhouse gas emissions. A further potential area to explore in a financial analysis is to explore whether tax policy is consistent with stated policy goals for climate change actions. 3. Undertaking a CPEIR 3.1 Preparatory work The CPEIR methodology takes into account the recent beginning of discussions on climate change related policy, planning and budgeting in most countries. Because of this, implementation of the CPEIR has to recognise different perspectives as to what constitutes climate policy and budget allocations, noting where potential definitions differ and where there is consensus. The implementation of a CPEIR therefore represents a first step in the process rather than producing definitive findings on quantities of climate finance being spent. 10 Government ownership and oversight of the CPEIR is a prerequisite for success. Initial discussions across key ministries, normally involving Finance, Planning, Environment (which often holds the technical lead on climate change within the government administration) and Local Government is needed to identify the main themes for the CPEIR and the key questions that need to be addressed to inform policy development on climate change. A first task is to draw up terms of reference for the CPEIR that responds to the national context (Annex 3 provides a sample TORs for a CPEIR). Added legitimacy will be secured by introducing the CPEIR and the benefits of its analysis within existing national coordination mechanisms, such as cross-government climate change working groups, and then having such a group oversee the implementation of the CPEIR (Annex 4 provides a sample TORs for such a government oversight committee). Successful implementation of the CPEIR will depend on securing the right blend of skills to conduct the policy, institutional, and expenditure analysis (sample TORs for these specialist inputs are listed in Annex 5). Ideally, a national centre of policy research should be identified with staff who are already involved in the climate change discourse. National expertise can then be augmented by international specialists to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ef925c6-ccbd-489b-b0a0-dd1416a9e895": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ef925c6-ccbd-489b-b0a0-dd1416a9e895", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "091b1d7772456e19c0f7b5213eac341bd8a851f87a980edd92cea74c45cf88ae"}}, "hash": "091b1d7772456e19c0f7b5213eac341bd8a851f87a980edd92cea74c45cf88ae", "text": "undertake the CPEIR. Experience to-date suggests there are useful synergies to be had by fielding CPEIR teams that combine national and international expertise. 3.2 Implementation Implementation of the CPEIR may take several months to complete. During that time the study team undertakes its research into each of the main themes for analysis, reporting on progress at regular intervals to the oversight group, and explores within the team any challenges that need to be addressed. An early inception workshop allows for the study to be introduced to relevant stakeholders, who can then be invited to a results workshop towards the latter stages of the CPEIR to learn from, and comment on, the findings of the study team. Throughout the course of the study feedback from government ministries, in particular, should allow the team to retain a strategic focus to the study. Policy analysis The CPEIR policy analysis is carried out by a two person team, with expertise in climate change policy development at both the international level and within the study country. Through a review of national development plans, sector plans and other policy-related documentation, and by undertaking a series of semi-structured interviews with key informants, an analysis is built up that addresses the issues that relate to the overall policy environment for climate change expenditure. Box 3 lists some of the key questions that the policy analysis should address. Box 3. Key questions for the CPEIR climate change policy analysis \ufffd What level of engagement does the country have with the international policy discourse within the UNFCCC? \ufffd How much policy attention does climate change receive within national development planning? \ufffd Are there explicit funding strategies for climate change actions (e.g. in costed action plans)? \ufffd What is the overall coherence of the national response to climate change across a range of sectors? \ufffd Does climate change appear as an emerging policy theme in cross cutting government programmes (e.g. social protection / livelihoods / agriculture / infrastructure etc.)? \ufffd Is climate change a policy theme at the local government level? \ufffd Does climate change policy recognize the role of communities, the private sector, civil society and the media in ensuring multi-stakeholder participation in climate change initiatives? \ufffd Is there a monitoring and evaluation system for climate change actions that goes beyond the measurement of financial inputs? 11 Institutional analysis The institutional analysis can also be carried out by the same two person team, assuming they have the appropriate knowledge of capacity development programmes within the public administration. Through a review process similar to that for the assessment of policy, an institutional analysis is developed that provides important context for the level of public expenditure on CC-related actions. Box 4 lists some of the key questions for this analysis. Expenditure analysis The expenditure analysis is the most challenging aspect of the CPEIR methodology. The five pilot studies completed to-date have identified CC-related expenditure through a process of selecting activities, projects and programmes that are recognised as being part of the national response to climate change. In terms of practical implementation, this process has involved the following main steps: 1. Defining the body of \u2018total expenditure\u2019 that is going to be analysed in terms of climate relevance. Before \u2018climate relevant expenditure\u2019 is defined, the body of \u2018public expenditure\u2019 to be analysed has to be determined. A significant issue is how to include donor financed projects where international support for climate change actions is prominent. There is value is keeping domestic and international sources of funding separate in the subsequent analysis as they are subject to different governance arrangements. 2. A review of what data is available. The approach taken in each country depends on the available information. Where possible, electronic expenditure information from the public financial management system at its most disaggregated level is used so that it can be manipulated to generate various reports. Where this is not forthcoming, the CPEIR has to rely on published budget documentation. Information in the Chart of Accounts would typically only capture \u2018on-budget\u2019 information, so relevant spending through any extra- budgetary funds has to be obtained from the respective fund secretariats, often in the form of published Annual Accounts. National budget information systems can be combined with information on disbursements from aid management systems to capture externally funded programmes. 3. Given the broad parameters set out for climate change relevance outlined earlier, the assembled expenditure information is then filtered by asking (i) which expenditures are relevant to climate change and (ii) the level of relevance of those expenditures.

Typically for development budgets, relevance is defined for each individual project, although some general rules may shape decisions (e.g. all rural roads in coastal areas may be defined as mid-relevance, while national roads are deemed to be low-relevance). For recurrent budgets, the process for identifying expenditures depends on the level of disaggregation of the budget information, informed by ministry respondents. 4. With total expenditure defined and climate relevant expenditure defined, secondary analysis is then undertaken looking at a number of different issues. In some cases this information will come from information in the Chart of Accounts (e.g. who is spending the money \u2013 Ministry of Health, Agriculture, etc.; what inputs are being purchased \u2013 assets, wages, subsidies, etc.). In other cases, the climate relevant expenditures may be further broken down into important categories, such as spending supporting adaptation or mitigation activities. Box 5 lists some of the key questions that the expenditure analysis aims to explore. Local government analysis The CPEIR analysis of climate change policy, institutions and public expenditure examines both central and local government actions, with the latter being important for many implementation programmes. The CPEIR report therefore includes a chapter, prepared by two local governance specialists, that highlights the implementation challenges for CC-related actions and its associated spending at the sub-national level. Box 6 lists some of the main questions for this sub-national analysis. Box 5.

As resources are always going to be limiting some form of prioritisation of action is needed to help guide public investment. This is done within the CPEIR reports by providing recommendations grouped into several time horizons, with immediate actions, medium-term and long-term actions listed for review by the oversight committee. It is the membership of the CPEIR oversight committee that can then take forward the lessons learned from this analytical exercise within the appropriate national policy processes.

This analysis has to be set within the context of the national policy and institutional arrangements that exist to manage the response to climate change in each country. Hence, any analysis needs to take account of the three key spheres of policy development, institutional structures and financial management. Three core aspects of the national budget cycle that relate to climate change actions need to be explored: i. An assessment of current policy priorities and strategies as these relate to climate change; ii. A review of institutional arrangements for promoting the integration of climate change policy priorities into budgeting and expenditure management; iii. A review of the integration of climate change objectives within the budgeting process, including as part of budget planning, implementation, expenditure management and financing. A Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review also has an important process function \u2013 acting as a starting point for longer term Government-led stakeholder dialogue and learning involving the public and private sectors, academia, civil society and international development partners. In Thailand, the CPEIR exercise will be conducted under the advice and guidance of the Working Committee on Climate Fiscal Framework, led by the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO), Office of National Economics and Social Development Board (NESDB), Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP), and Bureau of Budget (BoB). This Term of Reference provides the scope of work which will be undertaken in the process of the CPEIR exercise in Thailand. 2. Outputs The team will conduct a 4-month-long Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) between February and May 2012. This exercise will provide further detailed information on how key agencies utilise their budgets and resources to address climate change issues. The CPEIR will include a Readiness Plan to access and deliver climate finance. This will help Thailand in accessing emerging international funds, where there is clear focus on including support for readiness plans for the development of climate strategies and national institutional arrangements to manage climate finance. 3. Methodology Building on the experiences in other countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, and using the emerging generic CPEIR methodology, the study will look at three core aspects of the budget cycle vis-\u00e0-vis climate finance. The methodology will need to assess progress to-date and make recommendations for improvements in the future: 18 \ufffd Assess current policy priorities and strategies as they relate to climate change and the extent to which these strategies and policies are coherent with national development, poverty reduction and economic growth strategies; \ufffd Review institutional arrangements for promoting an integration of climate change policy priorities into budgeting and expenditure management including within and across key ministries and stakeholders. \ufffd Review the integration of climate change objectives within the budgeting process including as part of budget planning, implementation, expenditure management and financing. In terms of international climate finance, the Green Climate Fund Transitional Committee has submitted its proposal for the Green Climate Fund to the UNFCCC in December 2011. Based on the on-going discussions, it is emerging that many developing countries need to strengthen their capacity to manage climate finance in order to be able to tap into international funds effectively. It therefore needs to be clarified what the capacity needs are, and how a country plans to address these. It is proposed that this will be part of the recommendations section of the Thailand CPEIR, to be presented in the form of a so-called Readiness Plan for scaling up access and delivery of climate finance. 4. Issues to be addressed by the CPEIR in Thailand The CPEIR study will build on similar research undertaken by the international team elsewhere as well as relevant recent national studies. The work will be undertaken at both the national and local government levels. (i) National policy, institutional and budgetary analysis The CPEIR will take forward several of the issues identified in the baseline assessment of a climate fiscal framework report: \ufffd Reviewing the institutional arrangements and coordination mechanisms for climate change: While there has been significant progress in establishing the necessary institutional arrangements to deal with climate change, limited coordination has constrained strategic resource allocation and efficient climate finance management. This will also include improving the coordination of international flow of climate finance coming for better integration and prioritization as well as donor coordination on climate change action in Thailand. The CPEIR will examine the current institutional arrangements to identify where improvements could be made. \ufffd Planning for climate change actions: The CPEIR will compile all climate actions, targets and performance indicators proposed in sectoral and national plans to obtain a clear picture of what", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "393ff3ba-be49-46e9-a122-a2c0bbc0ef2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "393ff3ba-be49-46e9-a122-a2c0bbc0ef2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abf3808f777181ca58de077e720b9b616c91410f9e628d48c01a7ec718ba245e"}}, "hash": "abf3808f777181ca58de077e720b9b616c91410f9e628d48c01a7ec718ba245e", "text": "has been planned and implemented by sectors. This will enable key agencies to estimate how much financial resources are required to implement climate change actions and how much budgetary resources should be allocated to finance climate expenditures and investments. \ufffd The need for a national climate fund: The CPEIR will explore the demand for new legislation on climate change and the establishment of a corresponding national fund. Learning from the Energy Conservation Promotion Act 1992 and the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act 1992, the CPEIR team will determine whether such a model may have applicability to support climate change actions. \ufffd Defining climate change expenditures: The absence of a national definition on climate expenditure constrains stakeholders in tracking resources allocated for financing climate actions. The CPEIR will propose an inclusive methodology to define climate change expenditure that is appropriate in the Thai context. 19 \ufffd Establishing a monitoring and evaluation mechanism as well as a tracking system: A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system linking the budget spent and the results achieved on the ground will be explored by the CPEIR team. \ufffd Identifying how to mainstream climate change into the budgetary process: The existing policy- based budgeting system in Thailand offers an opportunity to mainstream climate change into the budgetary process. The CPEIR will examine the opportunities to mainstream climate change into the 4 year Government Administrative Plan (GAP) and the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to support the implementation of climate actions and targets. \ufffd Budgetary allocation and actual expenditure: The CPEIR will review the financial management systems for allocating and spending climate related expenditures. This will involve the integration of climate change objectives within the budgeting process including as part of budget planning and implementation. The CPEIR team will attempt to undertake trend analysis on both budgeted and actual expenditure. \ufffd Budget prioritization. The absence of a comprehensive list of sectoral climate actions and targets has prevented key agencies dealing with budget preparation to prioritize resource allocation on climate change. The CPEIR should prepare a first such list for review by the respective government agencies. \ufffd The role of the private sector as a source of climate finance: The private sector requires an enabling regulatory environment to be established and maintained by government. The CPEIR will examine the role played by the private sector in financing climate change actions and review how taxation and subsidy policies are defined vis-\u00e0-vis climate related objectives. (ii) Local government analysis For local governance, given the limited timeframe for the CPEIR exercise, a sensible way to go about collecting such information and presenting it will be to have a case study component in the final report covering a few provinces/districts/sub-districts. This will offer a good complementarity with more generic discussions of the existing institutional framework, budgeting and planning processes presented in the main body of the CPEIR report. The CPEIR will build on the Local government analysis for a climate fiscal framework in Thailand report. In particular, it will consider the following issues identified in the former report: \ufffd Defining climate expenditure: There is need to create a space for local actors to help central government define \u2018climate change\u2019 and \u2018climate expenditure\u2019, based on local experiences and capacities. Such a definition should be used to inform future national climate policy and plans\u2019, ensuring it is aligned with local planning and budgeting processes. \ufffd Conducting area-based case studies: these should be conducted as part of the CPEIR to map the different funding mechanisms, including donor funding to local government and NGOs, government fund transfer or grants to local government and locally generated sources of revenue. This should include the collection and analysis of climate-related budget/expenditure data at the village, tambon, municipal and provincial level. \ufffd Describing funding modalities: To improve local administrations\u2019 access to climate investment, there is a need to streamline international or national climate investments currently available to local administrations using an efficient and transparent channel of central-to-local funding modality. The CPEIR will explore modalities such as the on-budget formula based general grant, donor funding to NGOs, and existing national funds available to local government, such as the Environment Fund. \ufffd Exploring policy incentives and capacity building for local governments to allocate budget for climate-related actions: in addition to increasing access to funding for LGOs, there is also a need to establish policy incentives to ensure that climate-related actions will be prioritized in the local development plan. Accordingly, LGOs\u2019 capacities will need to be strengthened to understand the issues and translate policy direction into actions on the ground. 20 \ufffd Piloting the tracking of climate-related investments: There", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3cb076a-55b2-4f29-9ed5-cbc8310207e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3cb076a-55b2-4f29-9ed5-cbc8310207e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccb7d8c191b329748e53518b2f92d692ff1824cd1d71d4a7c13be874433934fb"}}, "hash": "ccb7d8c191b329748e53518b2f92d692ff1824cd1d71d4a7c13be874433934fb", "text": "is a need to capture the totality of climate investments available in each local area to strengthen central government\u2019s ability to prioritize and channel climate investments funds to priority areas. Such a compilation could be piloted in the area-based case studies as part of the CPEIR. \ufffd Clarifying local roles and responsibilities: As part of the local governance analysis of the CPEIR an attempt should be made to further unravel the complex relationship between elected local government bodies and the Government\u2019s provincial administrative offices for the delivery of climate-related expenditures. This comparison is necessary to highlight any overlaps in roles and responsibilities, gaps in capacity and responsiveness to community needs. 5. Approach To ensure that the CPEIR exercise directly contributes to existing needs, addresses real concerns and responds to current challenges in the country, the CPEIR team will report to the Working Committee on Climate Fiscal Framework, which will be provide technical and policy related advice and guidance. This Committee will comprise representatives from 1) the Fiscal Policy Office; 2) the Office of National Economic and Social Development Board; 3) the Bureau of the Budget; and 4) the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning. Additional representation can be identified by the above agencies upon further discussion. The Working Committee on the Climate Fiscal Framework will need to: \ufffd Provide technical guidance to the CPEIR process; \ufffd Share relevant findings and recommendations emerging from this review with existing high level forums (such as Climate Change Committee in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office) to influence policy and decision making; \ufffd Review the draft CPEIR report and provide comments; \ufffd Agree the final CPEIR report recommendations; and \ufffd Provide advice on how the recommendations can be followed up The CPEIR consultancy team approach will be: \ufffd Inclusive, multi-stakeholder, gender balanced \ufffd Building the capacity of national stakeholders 6.

Sample terms of reference for government oversight committee TERMS OF REFERENCE WORKING COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE FISCAL FRAMEWORK IN THAILAND 1. Summary Thailand is in a position to mobilise significant domestic and international public and private finance to tackle climate change. However to maximize these resources and use them most effectively will require a comprehensive, cross-government approach that involves both the public and private sectors. Such an approach has been termed a climate fiscal framework. A first step in building a climate fiscal framework is to review how public and private climate change related expenditures are integrated into national budgetary processes, which can be called a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR). This analysis has to be set within the context of the national policy and institutional arrangements that exist to manage the response to climate change. A Working Committee on Climate Fiscal Framework is proposed to be set-up to provide advice and guidance on the process of establishing Climate Fiscal Framework in Thailand. The committee will be led by the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) together with the other 3 key agencies, namely, the Office of National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the Office of Natural Resources and the Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP), and the Bureau of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed9dad4e-1fed-4cd3-a4ea-df9fe8bb7b94": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed9dad4e-1fed-4cd3-a4ea-df9fe8bb7b94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca569634b1f3d484d0274a000461680534baee0d8c9519f8674819fa4d988d76"}}, "hash": "ca569634b1f3d484d0274a000461680534baee0d8c9519f8674819fa4d988d76", "text": "Budget (BoB), and will be facilitated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) These TORs outline the roles and responsibilities of the Working Committee. 2. Background To respond to climate change, countries need to identify the domestic demand for, and domestic and international supply of, climate finance and establish an institutional and policy framework for managing this finance effectively. This comprehensive, cross-government approach can take the form of a climate fiscal framework \u2013 which will link climate change priorities with expenditure and taxation decisions through the budget process. This will ensure that any external finances are used most effectively alongside domestic resources, and provide a framework to incentivize private investments. The importance of these issues has been recognized by both governments and international agencies. In 2007, Indonesia hosted the first meeting of Finance and Development Ministers on climate change which recognized the benefits of \u201cunderstanding of how to integrate climate change issues into country development plans, fiscal policy frameworks and how to benefit and learn from available experience with national climate change strategies and assessments of low carbon growth opportunities.\u201d The need for integrating climate into the budget process has been supported by governments in Asia in the Bangkok Call for Action in 2010 and at the Pacific Stakeholders Meeting on Climate Finance in Palau in April 2011. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been working since 2009 to support countries including Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, in establishing the climate fiscal framework in accordance to each country\u2019s needs and context. In Thailand, various consultations were facilitated in August - December 2011 by UNDP with key government agencies, including the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and planning (ONEP), National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) and Bureau of Budget (BoB). A baseline assessment was also conducted to collate initial data on climate related expenditure. The findings were shared at a round table meeting, including facilitated discussion on next steps. 23 The Government of Thailand led by the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) has now decided to lead the process of developing a Climate Fiscal Framework for Thailand to address both the short term challenge of disaster management and the longer term challenge of responding to climate change. 3. Objectives In practice, the CFF will assist Thailand to: \ufffd Identify and mobilize financial resources required to finance climate actions effectively; \ufffd Improve the budgetary process to ensure a strategic resource allocation to finance government\u2019s expenditure and investments; \ufffd Manage and scale\u2013up climate finance (both domestic and international resources) to ensure sufficient allocation for both national and local government; and \ufffd Allow for a monitoring and evaluation system to track how well the government and stakeholders spend financial resources on climate actions. The Framework will provide a well thought-out investment plan and accountability framework in response to climate change impacts. In this regard, the Framework serves Thailand\u2019s vision for a Resilient Development Pathway and Low Carbon Economy. This will support the next five year plan of NSEDB and the on-going discussions over the Climate Change Master Plan led by ONEP. It is also a good opportunity for Thailand to use the Framework to provide inputs into the work of two newly-established Strategic Committee for Reconstruction and Future Development (SCRF), headed and Strategic Committee for Water Resources Management (SCWRM). 4. Expected Outcomes The main outcomes expected from such an exercise are: a) Demand for climate change finance is assessed and sources of international and domestic climate finance is identified b) An effective institutional mechanism for facilitating delivery of climate change finance in Thailand is established Several activities for establishing such a framework will be undertaken. One of them will be to undertake a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) that will analyze how climate change related expenditures are integrated within budget planning, implementation, expenditure management and financing will provide a sound basis for establishing such a framework. The above framework will help in dealing with important sector dimensions. For example, this will look at the linkages between climate change and natural disasters. This is very timely given the recent floods in Thailand which has been attributed to a result of a rare climate extreme based on historical records. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of such extreme events and there is a need to rethink disaster risk reduction within the climate change policy frameworks. 3 5. Roles and Responsibilities of the Working Committee As a result of the consultation process with various stakeholders and to take forward the recommendations for establishing such a climate fiscal framework, it was proposed to form a working", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25261474-c852-4e6f-a9b1-14111be28fd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "25261474-c852-4e6f-a9b1-14111be28fd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07db1fa19bd2bd7fbcc4bb6c8936023c308379526b27a5001b09a4b825705b22"}}, "hash": "07db1fa19bd2bd7fbcc4bb6c8936023c308379526b27a5001b09a4b825705b22", "text": "committee that will act as a focal point for the framework. This will serve as a forum with representation of key stakeholders to provide advice and guidance on this initiative. This committee will comprise representatives from 1) the Fiscal Policy Office; 2) the Office of National Economic and Social Development Board; 3) the Bureau of the Budget; and 4) the Office of 24 Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning. Experts on key related areas will be appointed to provide advisory role in the committee. Additional representation can be identified by the above agencies upon further discussion. 6. Key tasks 1. Review the TOR for this working committee and ensure all relevant stakeholders are represented and aware of its scope and mandate. 2. Discuss and provide advice on next steps based on the findings of the baseline assessment for climate fiscal framework that has been undertaken. 3. Provide technical guidance to the climate expenditure and institutional review process including advice for taking forward the recommendations of the review. 4. Share relevant findings and recommendations emerging from these reviews with existing high level forums (such as Climate change Committee in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office) to influence policy and decision making. 5. Provide opportunities for dialogue amongst government (national and local), civil society and international organizations for establishing a robust climate fiscal framework in Thailand including supporting exchange of local, national and regional best practices and lessons. 7. Proposed Timeframe The working committee will be operational for two years to ensure effective management of climate change finance in Thailand. The first task will be to advice and steer the CPEIR exercise (February \u2013 May 2012). After that, the Committee will decide, based on the recommendations from the CPEIR exercise, which tasks will be carried forward under the Working Committee aegis, which could be done by other line agencies. It is also envisaged that in the long-run, the Committee can become a sub-committee on Climate Finance under the National Climate Change Committee and/ or a Monitoring and Evaluation body for Climate Finance. 25 Annex 5. Sample terms of reference for technical assistance In each CPEIR study TORs are prepared for both national and international specialists. The following sample TORs are those for the national experts in the Cambodia CPEIR. The TORs take a common format in all countries, with country specific issues being identified from previous engagement and prior knowledge in the Scope of Work section. 1.

This will complement the more generic discussion on the existing institutional framework, budgeting and planning processes presented in the main body of the report. Specifically, the national expert will work with the international local governance specialist to analyse the following issues: \ufffd Defining climate expenditure: How do local actors define \u2018climate change\u2019 and \u2018climate expenditure\u2019, based on local experiences and capacities? Such a definition should be used to inform future national climate policy and plans, ensuring it is aligned with local planning and budgeting processes. \ufffd Conducting area-based case studies: At least two area-based case studies should be conducted as part of the CPEIR to map the different funding mechanisms, including donor funding to local government and NGOs, government fund transfers or grants to local government and locally generated sources of revenue. \ufffd Describing funding modalities: All the funding streams that are currently available to local administrations should be mapped. The CPEIR team should explore existing modalities such as government grants and contributions, locally generated revenue, and donor and private sector funding.

Note on methodological consistency between CPEIRs Introduction As yet, there is no international definition of climate change-related expenditure, which makes comparisons between countries difficult. The CPEIR methodology paper provides general guidelines on how to approach the definition of such expenditure. Within the five CPEIR pilot studies1 these guidelines have been developed by each country team in line with the team\u2019s understanding of climate-related expenditure and the financial reporting standards within each country. This approach has resulted in differences in what has been recorded as relevant expenditure in the five pilot countries. This note assesses whether the main reasons for the differences in the results arises from: \ufffd differences in methodology; \ufffd differences in the available data; or \ufffd differences in the real situation in each country, including the climate challenge and government's response. Headline figures from the CPEIR studies Table 1 provides a comparison of two \u2018headline\u2019 statistics from across the five pilot countries, which shows a relatively low contribution of climate relevant expenditure in Thailand, a medium level in Nepal and Bangladesh and seemingly higher levels in Samoa and Cambodia.

The CPEIR methodology paper defines mitigation and adaptation and gives guidance on how to classify the level of relevance. The guidance on relevance is in two parts: first, some broad principles are defined; and, second, a list of examples of programme types is provided. Table 4 summarises the way in which different programme types were classified in the methodology note and the different CPEIRs. Some of the differences in classification reflect an evolving methodology as it was applied in each country. In addition, the approach to the coordination of the CPEIRs was to allow the broad classification principles to be applied flexibly in each country, to reflect the circumstances in the country and to explore different approaches.

The main challenge arises in programme types that are possible to put in several groups. In some cases, this simply reflects the fact that they are borderline cases. However, there are some programme types where more fundamental issues are involved. The possible range of classification is summarised in Table 5. This table includes reference to percentage scores indicating the percentage relevance of each programme. These scores complement the Hi-Mid-Lo(-Marginal) classification groups. They are intended to indicate the percentage of expenditure that is related to climate change, so that the expenditure can be added from each group to produce an overall total for the country. The percentage scores in Table 5 are taken partly from actual classifications in the pilot CPEIRs and partly to illustrate possible interpretations. Table 5.

However, there are some issues that need further resolution. \ufffd The 'Cyclone Shelter Issue'. For programmes that address extreme climate events (e.g. floods, droughts and storms) it is important to establish whether all the expenditure is climate relevant, or whether it is only the part that addresses the increased frequency and severity of extreme events. The latest evidence from the 2011 SREX report suggests that frequency of flooding may increase by about 25%, and this is remarkably consistent across the world. This would suggest that programmes that protect against extreme events, without specific upgrading for climate proofing, should not be given a score of more than 25%. \ufffd Most reviews of vulnerability to climate change conclude that an important strategy for adaptation is to improve incomes and wealth, so that households can survive an extreme climate event. The CPEIR methodology note includes livelihoods enhancement and poverty reduction as mid to low relevance (i.e. 25% to 75% score), depending on whether they target climate vulnerable households. Most rural development programmes aim to improve the livelihoods of the rural poor, but most have been given relatively low classifications and some have been excluded from the classification. \ufffd Classifying disaster programmes also poses challenges. Most of the CPEIRs classified disaster management and rehabilitation as high relevance. But disaster management and response are normal features of public expenditure, regardless of climate change. Following the same principles as for climate proofing infrastructure, one option is to classify 25% of disaster management as being relevant to climate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4b90aa8-c0b2-4dcb-94d6-640b1bf90ce1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4b90aa8-c0b2-4dcb-94d6-640b1bf90ce1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) \u2013 Methodological Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-review-cpeir-%E2%80%93-methodological-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b28457f02a1eed60a5e07c2daccfd89a69442b45b28af82d2c5244aed1e1084"}}, "hash": "8b28457f02a1eed60a5e07c2daccfd89a69442b45b28af82d2c5244aed1e1084", "text": "change, as this is the expected increase in frequency and severity of extreme events. The situation with disaster relief might appear easier and most CPEIRs excluded this from the analysis. However, in Cambodia it was included because the intermittent provision of relief was considered part of a rational long term strategy for managing disasters. Table 6 illustrates the range of possible classifications for each main programme type in Cambodia. This is prepared by assigning the highest and lowest reasonable classification of each programme, bearing in mind the uncertainties outlined above. The table shows the range of possible results for many programmes is moderate (and in most cases will be influenced by expert judgement to a narrower range), however there are some types of expenditure for which the range is particularly large. The challenges in classifying rural roads in Cambodia are particularly dramatic. This implies that the present CPEIR methodology is inherently imprecise for some programmatic activity and the results from each study need to be interpreted in this light. 34 Table 6. Range for climate development expenditure in Cambodia (in CR bn) Data availability In all the CPEIRs, the objective was to capture all public expenditure, including recurrent and development and including all domestic and external funding. The CPEIRs succeeded in capturing most public expenditure, although it was difficult to be sure about the level of off-budget donor support. This led to one difference between the composition of the \u2018headline figures\u2019 in Table 1, in that in Cambodia and Samoa off-budget donor expenditure was included in the headline statistic of public expenditure, whereas in the other studies it was not part of the climate-related government expenditure statistic. All CPEIRs aimed to work with actual data, rather than budget. However, in Samoa, Cambodia and Thailand it proved difficult to get figures on actual expenditure (both for recurrent and development expenditure) and it was necessary to rely on budget data only and, in some case, on commitment data for donors. These differences in data availability may have had some impact on the overall results. National Approaches It is possible that there was a difference in approach to classification in each of the CPEIR countries. In all the countries, the classification was done according to a system that attempted to respect the same principles and aimed to be as objective as possible. There was no apparent interest in obtaining either a high or low result. In Samoa, the government is compact and there is very wide understanding of the importance of climate change. This may have meant that the national experts and government officials involved in classifying expenditure were more likely to see and stress the climate relevance of activities. In Cambodia and Nepal, there is less appreciation across government of the potential impact of climate change. In Bangladesh there is good understanding of climate change amongst some officials, but government is a large and complex institution in which it is less easy to introduce new priorities and then to ensure that funds follow priorities. Real Differences in National Circumstances 35 The final possible explanation of differences between countries in the level of climate relevant expenditure is that it reflects real differences in the physical characteristics of the country and in the levels of expenditure that are used for mitigation and adaptation. Cambodia has a high level of total climate relevance, but it also has a very large proportion of development expenditure that is devoted to irrigation and the flood-proofing of rural roads. In Samoa, the country has recently recovered from a Tsunami and this has led to an increase in priority for spending that builds resilience against extreme events. Thailand, as a more developed and urbanised country, has a more complex range of demands on public expenditure. Bangladesh could be expected to have similar levels of spending to Cambodia, but the total level of development spending is smaller and the overall balance may be affected by higher spending on health and education. Whilst Nepal may have similar levels of donor dependency, the natural environment is less obviously vulnerable to floods and droughts that dominate concerns in Cambodia. Conclusion There are important steps to be taken in improving guidance on the classification of climate expenditure. The pilot CPEIRs provide the foundation from which to take these steps. The choices on classification need to be informed by the purpose of the analysis. If the purpose is to facilitate the management of climate finance in a more mainstreamed fashion, then the classification should be guided by options that can be made operational, for example as indicators for conditions associated with programmatic support.

Introduction The Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review methodology was first pioneered in Nepal, with UNDP and UNEP support in 2011. In a context common to many countries in the region, a proliferation of financing mechanisms and various donor-government dialogues on how to address climate change had been emerging. These discussions had often been fragmented and typically taking place amongst environment or climate change specialists, but not yet rooted in key national debates on how the government might best promote the country\u2019s economic and social development. The CPEIRs were introduced as the very first climate change studies of their kind that sought to move away from a parochial focus on the use of funds that are primarily dedicated to addressing climate change issues. Rather, they aimed to help countries to review how their own stated national climate change policy aims were being reflected in public expenditures more broadly and how institutions might be adjusted to ensure that financing a response to climate change is delivered in a coherent way across government. It was anticipated that CPEIRs would provide a useful starting point for longer term government-led multi-stakeholder dialogue on how the government might utilise increased financing as part of the national response to climate change. Since the first CPEIR was undertaken in Nepal in 2011, four further countries have followed suit: Bangladesh, Thailand, Samoa and Cambodia. With five CPEIRs now completed, and further CPEIRs already in the pipleline in Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam; it is an opportune moment to review this body of work and promote dialogue and learning. The CPEIR process is still evolving: where they have been undertaken, CPEIRs have already played an important role in stimulating more comprehensive and inclusive reflections on climate change than had taken place previously. However, there is still much to be learnt on how this type of analysis can be utilized and built upon to assist delivery of climate change policy goals. There is also scope to further refine and tailor the process to better meet the requirements of countries undertaking CPEIRs. In this regard, this paper provides a comparative analysis of (i) the methodology used in the five CPEIRs done to date, (ii) the initial findings that have emerged from the CPEIRs and (iii) the recommendations that have been made to take the work forward at a country level.

This methodology was developed to allow for a review of the expenditure on activities that are related to climate change, and to assess the extent to which the national policy and institutional context guides those expenditures (Bird et al. 2012). In that regard, running through each of the CPEIRs is: \uf0b7 An assessment of current policy priorities and strategies as these relate to climate change; \uf0b7 A review of institutional arrangements for integrating climate change policy priorities into budgeting and expenditure management processes; and \uf0b7 An analysis of public expenditure and its relevance to climate change. (CPEIR Bangladesh) The CPEIR approach The CPEIR methodology builds upon the approach taken in World Bank Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), which involve analysis of the allocation, management and results of public expenditures (although CPEIRs have as of yet focused less on results than a regular PER given the lack of climate change monitoring indicators currently in place). This methodology is particularly appropriate, as crucially, this type of analysis begins from a starting point of reviewing public expenditure across the whole of government. By taking a more holistic view of how climate change is integrated with national policies and public expenditures, the studies served as a unified engagement point both for government departments that have specialised in climate change, but also institutions such as ministries of finance, planning and local government who historically have been less involved in these issues. Each of the CPEIR studies has been led by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, combining experts on climate change policy, but also governance and public financial management in order that climate change can be reviewed as part of broader institutional processes. International and national consultants were used to blend international expertise in this field with local knowledge of the country context. This inclusive, multi-disciplinary approach required careful management as it was not always clear during the studies whether authority resided in finance ministries or climate change departments. In each of the countries, government steering committees have been established to oversee the process of implementing the CPEIR, predominantly led by representatives from ministries of finance, but with other key ministries also represented. This has meant that the studies have also been well positioned to respond to the specific concerns of the committee representatives. The studies, moreover, have played a vital process function, acting as a starting point for longer term government-led multi-stakeholder dialogue and learning. The CPEIR methodology introduced to a standard PER the innovation of incorporating an institutional analysis at the heart of the studies. While the importance of \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 climate change in government operations is often repeated, specific responsibilities for development and 3 implementation of climate change policy are in practise typically unclear and administratively unacknowledged. Ministries and agencies with large expenditures relevant to climate change, such as Agriculture or Local Government are also regularly found to have no explicit recognition of climate change within their own sector policies. The CPEIR thereby provides a much needed mapping of the institutional arrangements within government for addressing climate change actions. It also considers how climate change is integrated with national budgetary systems from planning, through to budget preparation, execution and oversight. Further, with local governments having a vital role to play in delivering services to those likely to be most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the CPEIRs have undertaken case studies looking specifically at the role played by local government institutions in implementing climate change policies. Defining \u2018climate relevant\u2019 expenditures At the heart of all the CPEIRs undertaken is the classification of public expenditure into different categories that are relevant to climate change (Thailand CPEIR 2012). In the absence of an internationally recognized definition of climate expenditure, researchers in each of the countries have come up with national definitions of what constitutes the \u2018climate relevant\u2019 component of the national budget. Activities have been grouped into categories of varying levels of relevance to climate-change mitigation or adaptation outcomes (although studies to date have excluded expenditure on activities that may lead to exacerbation of climate change, such as fossil fuel subsidies). Overseen by steering committees, this contributes to a useful process of thinking through how different government expenditures might be related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. There is inevitably a degree of subjectivity in defining how relevant different types of expenditure are to climate change. Bird et al. (2012) point out that where awareness of climate change is more established, as in Samoa, researchers may more readily identify expenditures with climate change.

Relevance criteria are also typically based on stated policy objectives, rather than evidence that funds are actually being utilised to contribute to goals of climate change mitigation and adaptation. For example, while investments of the Thai Royal Irrigation Department in agricultural water management are deemed relevant for adaptation to climate change; the criteria as outlined do not necessarily show whether those investments have in fact contributed positively or negatively to that goal. As well as variations in how climate relevant expenditure has been defined, there have also been differences in the composition of public expenditure analysed. For example, in the studies undertaken in Cambodia and Samoa, off-budget donor support has been incorporated in defined public expenditure, while in the other studies the focus has been explicitly on the budget. Further, at present, extra-budgetary funds1, tax expenditures, public private partnerships and quasi fiscal liabilities have also been excluded from detailed analysis, which has varying implications on the findings depending on the country context and the relative importance of these unbudgeted or indirect expenditures. 1 With the exception of donor financed funds in the cases of Samoa and Cambodia 4 Finally, existing public financial management systems and data availability have also influenced how the expenditure analysis has been undertaken. For example, in Samoa where there are delays in the production of final accounts, the CPEIR relies on budgetary data rather than information on actual expenditures. The Samoa, Cambodia and Nepal CPEIRs have also used donor commitment data from aid management systems as a proxy for donor financed expenditures. 3. Findings Policy-based findings As part of the CPEIR, an assessment is undertaken of current policy priorities and strategies as these relate to climate change. All the countries assessed to date have in place a leading national climate change policy document and there is evidence in all pilot countries that the formulation of these national policies has been guided by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). National climate change policy is seemingly reactive, responding to decisions of annual UNFCCC Conference of the Parties meetings (UNFCCC COP). Despite the importance of the UNFCCC in stated national climate change policy, it does seem that policy is also responding to specific country circumstances, including varying levels of economic development and the specific geographical context. In Bangladesh and Samoa for example, the climate change agenda is primarily adaptation focused and building upon a legacy of supporting preparedness and the capacity to respond to natural disasters. In Nepal, priority is being given to climate change adaptation at the local level, given the high levels of rural poverty and vulnerability. In Cambodia, ambitious infrastructure development plans are factoring in the country\u2019s vulnerability to more frequent flooding. In contrast, in Thailand, where the economy is more developed, climate change policy has been more focused on mitigation and catalyzing private sector investment in mitigation through initiatives such as renewable energy subsidies and promoting access to the Clean Development Mechanism. A common feature identified in the CPEIRs is that while these policy documents are typically comprehensive, they are not prioritized, costed or sequenced. This makes it difficult to assess whether sufficient resources are being allocated to meet the stated objectives. The CPEIRs have looked beyond country climate change policy documents and also outlined relevant sector policies (e.g. transport, energy, agriculture, water management etc.), which have direct and indirect impacts, both positive and negative, on climate change. In Bangladesh, for example, the CPEIR identifies and draws out the linkages between the government\u2019s social protection policy (including food security and livelihood schemes), which may support resilience to climate change at a household level. However, at the time the study was conducted, no specific reference was made to climate change in the social protection policy. In certain cases, climate change policy was also found to be competing with other policy goals. In Cambodia, for example, climate change policy (CMDG 7) aims to achieve and maintain 60% forest cover by 2015, although current forest cover is at 57% and declining. This may partly be explained by incentives created by Economic Land Concessions (ELC) which support the conversion of land for economic purposes and would seem to run counter to environmental goals. 5 Institution-based findings Historically, Ministries of Environment have had the lead role in taking forward climate policy at the national level. That national climate change policy is seemingly reactive, responding to decisions of annual UNFCCC CoP (see above), suggests that the drivers for mainstreaming climate change policy are primarily external.

This has implications for \u2018embedding\u2019 climate change concerns within the planning and budgeting of different government agencies. Ministries of Environment are not \u2018core\u2019 or \u2018upstream\u2019 ministries like planning and finance and may have limited influence over the underlying reforms necessary to implement a systematic response to climate change. In all the countries where reviews have been undertaken, steering committees have already been put in place to coordinate and oversee the response to climate change across government. However, a recurrent theme from the CPEIRs is that mechanisms for coordination are not as well established as they might be, with committees meeting on a sporadic basis (Samoa, Nepal) and insufficient resources to support the secretariat to follow up on recommendations (Thailand). Whilst steering committees have been established to coordinate climate change policy, their influence over existing patterns of expenditures within different ministries has been demonstrated by CPEIR findings to be low. Some governments have established committees focused on climate finance to try and address this (e.g. Thailand\u2019s Climate Fiscal Framework Working Committee). Alongside considerations of coordination mechanisms, there has been less demonstrable progress in establishing the appropriate framework of incentives for government agencies to participate in a more systematic approach to articulating their climate change expenditures. Whilst in most countries, priority sectors and agencies have been identified as having significant relationships with climate change adaptation and mitigation, this has not led to planning and budgeting processes scaling up climate finance to those sectors where further investments could support \u2018positive\u2019 approaches to climate change. CPEIRS did not look in depth at sectors, which might have potentially conflicting interests with taking forward a climate change response (e.g. energy) and the incentives for changing patterns of taxation and expenditures that could influence reform. CPEIRs have found there to be a lack of appraisal criteria for assessing the impact of planned major investments and policies on climate change across countries. Establishing the right incentives and strengthening capacities to appraise projects and programmes in relation to climate change in priority sectors will be a key next step in institutionalising a climate change response. All CPEIRs have identified processes of decentralisation and deconcentration as key to ensuring that climate change expenditures respond to location specific contexts and reach the poor and vulnerable. In Nepal, policy commitments have been made that 80% of public resources for climate change be spent at the local level. In Nepal and Bangladesh, ministries of local government are the highest spending agencies on climate change. However, in no CPEIR were climate change issues found to be systematically considered in local level planning or budgeting. The climate related initiatives of non-governmental and community based organisations were reviewed to a limited extent as part of the CPEIRs, but are likely also to have significant implications for how climate change interventions are coordinated at the local level. 6 Transparency and accountability in delivering a national climate change response is very limited. Issues in defining \u2018climate change expenditures\u2019 mean that existing budget classification and reporting structures are not capable of tracking climate change expenditures over time without considerable manipulation of data. Specific monitoring and evaluation criteria to guide the measurement, verification and reporting on the impact of investments in climate change adaptation or mitigation do not exist. Oversight institutions including parliamentary committees and audit organisations are not yet analysing how the use of public funds is impacting climate change. CPEIRs did not look into the issue of how civil society and media are creating demand and pressure for more transparency and accountability in national-led climate response. The CPEIRs have raised useful questions about how much information and human resources should be devoted to the management of climate finance. Existing systems of performance budgeting are already creating strains on government systems and the CPEIRs have attempted to identify opportunities for adapting these systems, rather than creating new analytical and reporting requirements, wherever possible. These lessons are beginning to bring into focus questions of the appropriate breadth of coverage of climate expenditure, including, in particular, the treatment of infrastructure, livelihoods and welfare payments. Coordination challenges are seemingly further amplified by the fragmentation of donor financing flows and also a lack of coordination of efforts amongst donors. Responsibility for management of donor funds is often split between different institutions. In Bangladesh and Cambodia for example, the responsibility for management of multi-donor trust funds resides with ministries of environment, while resources from the PPCR are channelled through finance ministries.

Parallel arrangements for the management of new flows of international finance dedicated to climate change are also being established, although in most cases they still constitute a minority of the total sums available and used by government. There was also evidence of Governments creating extra-budgetary funds themselves \u2013 in Thailand especially \u2013 but also in Bangladesh. The public presentation of this is to bypass bureaucracy. There are also political considerations in that these national climate funds provide significant visibility to the climate change agenda (although in practice they are a very small component of the overall climate response required). However, the evidence suggests that new mechanisms and institutions lack institutional maturity and agility and take a lot of time to operationalise. Findings from expenditure analysis How much are governments spending on climate change? One of the key findings of the expenditure analysis in the CPEIRs has been estimates of the proportion of public expenditure that are defined by the researchers as being relevant to climate change. As shown in Figure 1, there is large variation in these figures with between 2.7% of the total 7 budget in Thailand deemed to be \u2018climate relevant\u2019 and up to 16.9% in Cambodia in the most recent financial year. 2 Figure 1: Climate relevant expenditure as a proportion of total expenditure and GDP Country Headline statistic (as % of budget) Headline statistic (as % of GDP) Comments on how data captured Nepal 6.7 % 1.8% \uf0b7 Limited to 10 Ministries \u2018likely to undertake activities relevant to climate change on a functional basis\u2019 \uf0b7 Does not include \u2018off-budget\u2019 donor support Bangladesh 5.5 \u2013 7.2 % (2010/11) 0.9% (2010/11) \uf0b7 Analysis identified 37 out of 57 ministries or divisions that had climate relevant expenditure \uf0b7 Does not include \u2018off-budget\u2019 donor support Thailand 2.7 % 0.5% \uf0b7 14 Ministries \u2018had a climate programme in the period reviewed\u2019 \uf0b7 Does not include \u2018off-budget\u2019 donor support Cambodia 14.9 \u2013 16.9 % 3.1 \u2013 6.9% \uf0b7 Analysis of budgeted expenditure covered all Government programmes and projects \uf0b7 Includes \u2018off-budget\u2019 donor support Samoa 15 % 6 % \uf0b7 Analysis of budgeted expenditure covered all Government programmes and projects \uf0b7 Includes \u2018off-budget\u2019 donor support Source: From Bird et al. 2012 Caution should be taken in making cross-country comparisons of these figures given the methodological differences highlighted in the previous section. Results are affected by the judgment involved in determining the relative relevance of expenditure categories on climate change (outlined in more detail in Annex 1). For example, in Cambodia, stated policy on road building is that all roads ought to take into account climate proofing in the design, but for a large part of the road building program there is no explicit evidence of the size of the \u2018climate proofing\u2019 component or means of establishing the additional investment required to \u2018climate proof\u2019 these roads. The proportion of climate related expenditure falls by 3-4% points if these \u2018low relevance\u2019 roads are removed from the analysis. How public expenditure is defined and measured in the analysis can also have a considerable bearing on the proportion of climate change related expenditure. For example, in Thailand, according to the 2009 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment, there are 95 extra-budgetary funds, which are excluded from the budget and by extension the expenditure analysis of the CPEIR. The Energy Conservation Fund alone has an annual budget of approximately $US226m, which is equivalent to 0.3% of total budgeted expenditures. Nevertheless, given the significant range of estimates between countries, the variance between countries is unlikely to be attributable to differences in methodology and data alone. It seems 2 These estimates are based on weighted figures with different relevance categories given different expenditure weightings 8 likely as Bird et al.

Decisions to commit resources to \u2018development expenditures\u2019 rather than \u2018recurrent expenditures\u2019 are not primarily driven by climate change policy; but rather, by the relative level of dependence on externally financed projects and also government policy on appropriate levels of public capital investment. Figure 2: Comparing recurrent and development expenditure in Cambodia and Bangladesh Cambodia Bangladesh Recurrent expenditure as a % of total budget 46.3% 73.3% Development expenditure as a % of total budget 53.7% 26.7% % of recurrent expenditure relevant to climate change 0.7% 3.3% % of development expenditure relevant to climate change 28.5% 14.7% As economies develop, there is also typically a shift away from a reliance on concessional external public financing of infrastructure towards a greater role for private finance. In Thailand, for example, large investments in renewable energy or metropolitan public transport networks are typically made through public-private partnerships and would not be captured in the budget. In Samoa, on the other hand, where there are fewer profitable opportunities for renewable energy investment; the government is relying upon donor funds to finance a large renewable energy expansion project. As such public renewable energy investment is significantly higher as a proportion of the budget in Samoa than in Thailand. Who is doing the spending? While a large number of Ministries and sectors undertake activities that have relevance for climate change (in Bangladesh for example, activities under 37 government agencies were assessed to be relevant to climate change); in all the five countries assessed, between 60%-80% of 9 total climate expenditure was concentrated within just three Ministries.3 Despite often taking the lead in the development of climate change policy, only in Thailand and Samoa does an environment ministry feature as one of the top three spending agencies for \u2018climate relevant\u2019 expenditures; with climate relevant expenditures predominantly being embedded in sector Ministry expenditures with other primary objectives. Figure 3: Highest climate relevant spending agencies as proportion of total \u2018climate budget\u20194 In Nepal and Bangladesh, ministries of local government are the highest spending agencies on climate change. In Nepal, policy commitments have been made that 80% of public resources for climate change be spent at the local level. However, the importance of the local government ministry in this regard is also reflective of the particular institutional structure in Nepal, whereby the Ministry of Local Development is responsible for the allocation of conditional and unconditional recurrent and capital grants to local bodies. Similarly, in Bangladesh, the department of local government plays the role of providing block grants to district government bodies. By contrast, in Cambodia, Thailand and Samoa central government transfers to local government structures are allocated either directly in the budget, or through sector ministries. 3 The figures presented in Table 4 for Cambodia and Samoa also factor in projects implemented by third parties and \u2018multiple implementers\u2019.

Further analysis would be needed to better understand the quality of those investments and whether in fact climate resilience is being built or in fact reduced, as is possible if, for example, aquifers are being depleted. The Electricity and Petroleum Corporation (EPC) in Samoa is the only energy-related institution to be reflected here as one of the top three leading \u2018climate relevant\u2019 spending institutions. Large scale investments in the energy sector would not typically be captured by the CPEIR methodology as conducted to date; given that investments are predominantly undertaken by private investors, public-private partnerships or public corporations (that are typically excluded from government budgets). Samoa\u2019s EPC is captured in this analysis because of the way all donor financed projects are recorded in the Samoa CPEIR, even if expenditures are not being managed through the government budget. How is the expenditure being financed? The relative size of donor contribution to climate relevant finance varies in line with the overall dependence on external finance in the budget more generally. As can be seen from Figure 4, across all countries, donors are financing a higher proportion of climate relevant expenditures than their proportional contribution to total expenditure. This is to be expected given that donor financing is predominantly project based; while governments have ongoing commitments to service debt, finance wage bills and so on. 5 Although these differences also emanate from differences in methodological interpretation whereby roads were deemed not to be relevant to climate change in Thailand, but were in Cambodia and Samoa. 11 Figure 4: Average proportion of expenditures financed by domestic and external resources over last three years6 Proportion of total expenditure defined in CPEIR analysis Proportion of 'climate relevant' expenditure Financed by domestic revenues Financed by external grants or loans Financed by domestic revenues Financed by external grants or loans Bangladesh 86% 14% 77% 23% Cambodia 33% 67% 13% 87% Nepal 73% 27% 44% 56% Samoa 68% 32% 41% 59% Trends in climate change related expenditure It is difficult to draw conclusions from just three years of data about overall trends in climate relevant expenditures. Figure 5 shows diverging trends over time in different countries for the proportion of expenditure relevant to climate change. Changes may not necessarily reflect a growing or waning commitment to climate change, but could also be reflective of broader sector shifts (e.g. significant growth in social sector expenditure could lead to a decrease in climate relevant expenditure as a proportion of the total budget). Donor financing trends also seemingly play a significant role. For example, in Samoa, as part of reconstruction efforts following a tsunami unrelated to climate change, there were significant donor investments in climate resilient infrastructure that have since fallen back. Figure 5: Changes in the proportion of total expenditure that is climate relevant over time While climate relevant expenditure growth in Bangladesh has been less than total government expenditure growth (16% vs. 47% respectively, between 2009/10 and 2011/12); over the same 6 Caution should be exercised in making international comparisons as studies defined \u2018total expenditure\u2019 in different ways.

This suggests that while policy may be influencing the labelling of activities, it is not necessarily leading to increased finance for activities. What is the money being spent on? In the three countries where estimates have been made on the proportion of climate change expenditure allocated to adaptation and mitigation, there has been a relatively consistent breakdown of 70%-80% allocated for adaptation and 20-30% for mitigation. This is likely to partly reflect government priorities: in the cases of Samoa, Nepal and Bangladesh adaptation, broadly defined, is the clear priority of government policy on climate change. However in Thailand, where mitigation is a more explicit policy priority, a similar figure was arrived at. This seems to reflect the fact that while a large proportion of adaptation expenditure is embedded in the provision of public goods; for climate change mitigation, the Thai government is primarily playing a catalytic role aimed at promoting private", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "100ee9fa-960b-4f5d-b8d1-754941f1c35e": {"__data__": {"id_": "100ee9fa-960b-4f5d-b8d1-754941f1c35e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs) in the Asia-Pacific Region \u2013 What Have We Learnt?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68ac4b794d63a32e0289fe7ed9840371021ab75839ea0aa4f0ed7cad4d89a47f"}}, "hash": "68ac4b794d63a32e0289fe7ed9840371021ab75839ea0aa4f0ed7cad4d89a47f", "text": "investment in energy efficiencies and renewable energy provision. 4. Recommendations and actions emanating from CPEIRs CPEIRs articulated recommendations for policy and institutional reforms as well as changes in the ways in which climate change expenditures are managed through planning and budgeting processes as well as within programming. The CPEIRs in Cambodia, Samoa and Thailand include short, medium and long term frameworks for taking forward these reforms. In all cases, CPEIR recommendations are based on a recognition that the planning and budgeting reforms necessary for a comprehensive approach to climate change are just beginning. Climate policy development One of the key findings of the expenditure analysis in the CPEIR countries is that expenditures relevant to climate change are being shaped primarily not by climate change policy, but by expenditure priorities more generally. The CPEIRs therefore reiterate the recommendation that climate change should not be seen solely as an environment concern, but also an economic and social concern and incorporated in national development strategies. The study undertaken by the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) in Thailand on the implications of climate change on food and energy prices is a good example of effectively linking knowledge on climate change with the strategizing of government policy on economic development. While a \u2018whole of government\u2019 approach is often recommended to respond to climate change, the apparent concentration of relevant expenditures to a small number of Ministries suggests that governments may actually be able to take strategically focused approach and concentrate efforts on integrating resilience to climate risks into the policy development of a small number of key sectors. Planning and finance institutions have a leading role to play in facilitating the incorporation of climate change concerns into policy development and public investment planning at a sector and local level. A number of CPEIRs therefore recommend that appraisal criteria for investment projects 13 are revisited to ensure the climate sensitivity of major projects is screened. This is true not just of \u2018climate change projects\u2019; but all major investments where impacts on climate change, both positive and negative, ought to be considered at the investment appraisal stage. While each of the CPEIR study countries have had national climate change strategies in place, there is a recurring suggestion that plans would benefit from greater evidence of prioritisation. Further, in none of the countries surveyed has there been a financing plan put in place to outline how such strategies might be funded. It is recommended in the CPEIRs that climate fiscal frameworks are developed in conjunction with planning and finance ministries which outline the expected role of different sectors of the economy (e.g. public sector, NGOs, businesses, households) in financing a response to climate change. A fiscal framework would help to identify all potential sources of climate financing (both public and private as well as national and domestic) and how these resources could best be accessed, combined and sequenced. Work has begun in Cambodia on the development of a climate change financing strategy emanating from the recommendations made in the CPEIR. Climate Institutions Institutional reforms to address climate change concerns are not happening in a vacuum and will be most effective when built upon existing governance reform programs. Many of the institutional challenges identified in the CPEIRs are not in fact specific to climate change: linking budgets to policy priorities; responding to the needs of the most vulnerable in local communities; issues of transparency and accountability; these are all concerns that touch upon a range of policy domains. Where climate change is particularly problematic to manage is that the majority of climate relevant expenditure is embedded in sector expenditures with other primary objectives. As such it does not have a single agency that acts as a natural champion for goals of climate change adaptation and mitigation during policy preparation or budgetary negotiation. All the countries studied have therefore put in place some kind of high-level, multi-stakeholder, national committee for overseeing the national climate agenda. While these committees on climate change have been active in designing strategies, they have often been weaker in monitoring their implementation on an ongoing basis. Both the Samoa and Cambodia CPEIR recommends that an annual monitoring report be developed, which provides an update on new policy related to climate across all sectors, recent trends on the level of climate expenditure, as well as updates on prospects for climate funding. This type of report would assist in formalising the meetings of climate change steering committees whose mandates are still evolving. A further recurring theme is the significant overlap in institutional structures between agencies responsible for disaster risk management and those leading the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eecb2d89-62e6-4c81-9062-4c76df49b05f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eecb2d89-62e6-4c81-9062-4c76df49b05f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs) in the Asia-Pacific Region \u2013 What Have We Learnt?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adf0301daaae999f7b044d87540092ba3e0aa9e6074cf814685faa796dc1845b"}}, "hash": "adf0301daaae999f7b044d87540092ba3e0aa9e6074cf814685faa796dc1845b", "text": "climate change adaptation agenda. There is seemingly scope for these agendas to converge and economise on resources. In order for policy integration to improve at the sector and local level, a number of CPEIRs also make the case for supporting the development of technical skills in priority sectors for appraisal of policies and performance monitoring and evaluation from a climate change perspective. Given the linkages between climate vulnerability and poverty, areas such as social protection and other poverty programming are also considered as priorities for focused investment to integrate climate related activities. 14 A number of the CPEIRs highlight that more work needs to be done on awareness of climate change at the local level and its possible impact. It is suggested that local government agencies ought to work in conjunction with planning institutions and climate change departments to adapt materials for policy planning and investment appraisal to the needs of local government officials. It is recommended that where available local government agencies also complement their vulnerability assessments with analysis on how the impacts of climate change will affect different geographical regions, in order that funding can be prioritized for the most vulnerable. In certain cases, local government structures may not be best equipped to meet the needs of local communities and there may be scope for NGOs to more effectively fill this role. The Bangladesh CPEIR recommends an appraisal of the capacity and comparative advantages of different local stakeholders to manage larger scale projects. Local variability of the impacts of climate change requires that local government agencies have some discretion over how funds for climate change adaptation are utilized. There is therefore a suggestion in the Nepal CPEIR, echoed elsewhere, that existing fund modalities that provide general purpose grants might be complemented with climate finance. The Samoa CPEIR suggests that modalities for making cash transfers to households also be explored as a means of building resilience at a household level. Relevant Parliamentary committees also potentially have an important role to play in overseeing the development and implementation of government policy on climate change. To do this effectively, they require necessary tools to review the implications of public expenditures on climate change. This includes (i) ensuring that the executive produces necessary information on climate change in development plans, budgetary documentation and monitoring reports as well as (ii) building the skills of parliamentarians to effectively guide climate change activities. Management of Public Finance A common message that emerges from the CPEIRs is that governments do not need to build new bespoke budgetary systems to address climate change issues. Rather in all the countries studied, the recommendations have been focused on building upon established planning and allocation systems within government which already act as the key mechanism for reconciling competing demands. Implementation of ongoing PFM reform plans that countries have in place will serve to strengthen linkages between policy priorities and budgetary allocations, as well as improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures. However, the CPEIRs also highlight that climate change brings it with a number of specific issues that Ministries of Finance ought to consider addressing. Linking climate change policy and budgets is particularly problematic as responsibility for expenditures do not predominantly reside under a single sector, as with other cross-cutting issues. To therefore make climate relevant expenditures more visible, a number of the CPEIRs have recommended that a functional marker be applied to climate change expenditures in order that they can be tracked more easily over time. The Thailand CPEIR also proposes that the marker differentiate between objectives of adaptation and mitigation. Such a marker would facilitate 15 budgetary analysis and the composition of monitoring reports that track the usage of budgetary resources for implementation of climate change policies. In this vein, the Nepal government has introduced a climate change marker in the 2012/13 budget in order that climate-relevant expenditure can be tracked from year to year. The CPEIRs also propose the introduction of certain output or outcome indicators against which the quality of climate relevant expenditures can be measured. Without such indicators, it is difficult to currently assess the effectiveness and efficiency of climate relevant expenditures (although the prospects for monitoring mitigation look more feasible, where operational indicators are more easily developed than adaptation). Climate change departments should work in conjunction with relevant planning or budget departments (depending on where responsibility lies) in providing guidance on the development of appropriate indicators. Where countries have an element of performance orientation integrated in budget systems, as is the case with Bangladesh and its medium term budget framework (MTBF), this framework can be built upon to link budgetary allocations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b59cdc22-16ba-4e6e-a7cd-cacb7caa47b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b59cdc22-16ba-4e6e-a7cd-cacb7caa47b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs) in the Asia-Pacific Region \u2013 What Have We Learnt?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04cf959026b3c98cf77d2d8981bc80b10df1eb62205a1baaa60306b5d8972b61"}}, "hash": "04cf959026b3c98cf77d2d8981bc80b10df1eb62205a1baaa60306b5d8972b61", "text": "and indicators on the effectiveness of climate relevant expenditures. Key spending agencies must also recognize their impacts on climate change in budget preparation. The Thailand CPEIR recommends, for example, that ministries of agriculture and natural resources recognise the climate component of their budgets more explicitly in terms of both performance targets and the policy drivers behind the programmes. With the exception of Thailand, in all countries considered in the CPEIRs, a significant proportion of public finance to address climate change is being provided by donors. The fragmentation of funding flows for climate change presents institutional challenges. Where numerous national and international extra-budgetary funding sources for climate change exist, there is a risk that gaps and overlaps in public expenditure emerge. The Bangladesh CPEIR recommends that there may be scope for governments to work with funders to look at how funds could become more specialized and focus on particular sectors in order to reduce duplication. Aid management systems can also be adapted to incorporate climate change concerns: Cambodia for example has introduced a tag in order that expenditures on climate change are captured in the national database. CPEIRs in Samoa and Cambodia have also looked at mechanisms that could potentially be used to pool fragmented financing flows including the introduction of national climate funds. The uncertainty surrounding projected financing commitments from donors also contributes to the challenges faced by governments in developing prioritised and costed climate change strategies: funders should therefore strive to provide multi-year financing commitments. 5. Building on the CPEIRs With five CPEIRs now undertaken it is an opportune time to: (i) review the CPEIR process more generally and consider how the knowledge gained can be used to drive change at a national level, (ii) propose complementary analyses that countries may wish to consider, and (iii) assess how the methodology could be improved upon for future studies. 16 Supporting implementation of CPEIR recommendations at a national level The CPEIRs that have been undertaken make a number of recommendations that require critical evaluation and prioritisation, but can feed into country-owned follow up action plans. The recent CPEIRs undertaken in Samoa and Cambodia have broken down proposed activities in line with a number of the recommendations outlined above (e.g. introducing monitoring reports, reviewing expenditure classifications etc.) and expected timings when they should be completed. These suggestions should be reviewed critically, amended where necessary and adopted as plans to be monitored by climate change steering committees and, where necessary, supported by donors. CPEIRs should also not necessarily be one off exercises. A periodic review of how policy, institutions and the allocation of expenditures are evolving can help to shed light on how the response to climate change is evolving over time. Recommendations for future CPEIRs The methodology adopted for future CPEIRs may need to delve into more detail as to not just the \u2018relevance\u2019 of expenditures to climate change, but the relevance of particular types of expenditure to the specific policy objectives of the country being considered. Climate change means very different things to different groups in different countries. In Samoa, a small island state vulnerable to rising sea levels, climate change adaptation is the clear policy priority. In Thailand, where rising energy prices have been acknowledged as a risk to continued economic development, greater renewable energy generation is one clear policy objective. In this regard, the forthcoming Indonesia CPEIR is being tailored to focus on the government\u2019s ambitious climate change mitigation targets and how expenditures are impacting those targets both positively and negatively. While differences in policy call for flexibility in approach to the CPEIRs, there may also be value in pursuing a more internationally consistent methodology for defining climate relevant expenditures in order that (i) cross-country comparisons can be made more robustly and (ii) donor and recipient government financing commitments can also be more easily tracked to enhance mutual accountability. The Samoa CPEIR raises the question of whether existing budgetary allocations are at an optimal level with regard to goals on mitigation and adaptation given that resources are also often competing with other development priorities, including health, education, justice etc. While it may not be possible to determine an optimal quantity of \u2018climate relevant\u2019 expenditures, it is useful to consider how governments are progressively integrating a concern with climate change impacts across the full range of taxation and expenditures. To accomplish this, a more nuanced approach to the CPEIRs that looks at the overall composition of public expenditure and the different channels through which they can impact climate change both positively and negatively could be considered. There is a need to focus more on the \u201cdirty\u201d expenditures which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cb44100-c31d-4cb5-a3ff-39f5e2753b98": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cb44100-c31d-4cb5-a3ff-39f5e2753b98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs) in the Asia-Pacific Region \u2013 What Have We Learnt?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "faaa1f07f7594b937cc2731cca68c6eb9dfde60bbce93e3024d09d3af82828ee"}}, "hash": "faaa1f07f7594b937cc2731cca68c6eb9dfde60bbce93e3024d09d3af82828ee", "text": "may undermine the national climate response \u2013 for example fossil fuel subsidies, incentives for deforestation or building of infrastructure in climate sensitive locations. While the relevance criteria employed have made some effort to distinguish between the varying linkages between climate change and public expenditure; 17 they do not explicitly factor in expenditures that exacerbate climate change or lead to maladaptation. It would also be important not to focus solely on \u2018climate relevant\u2019 expenditures when considering whether to reorient expenditure, but also those that are currently not deemed \u2018relevant\u2019 to climate change. Future analyses may therefore benefit from starting with an overview of the functional breakdown of all expenditures: one way this could be done is to undertake a full Public Expenditure Review and build the CPEIR analysis on to the PER. This type of analysis could subsequently drill in to more in-depth analysis of expenditures at a sector level to monitor how allocations within sectors are changing over time (e.g. investments in renewable energy vs. fossil fuel generation) and combining this with evaluation of progress against targeted policy outcomes for the sector. The studies that have been undertaken to date focus on the linkage between budgeted expenditures and climate change; however, they overlook the relationship between tax policy and climate change as well as indirect expenditures such as tax expenditures and public private partnerships. These may not be significant in all countries studied, but may merit further consideration in certain cases. Greater emphasis could be given in subsequent studies to the governance and institutional analysis. In the pilot countries this largely remained a mapping exercise of the government agencies involved, rather than an in-depth examination of their organisational structures, capacity and operating incentives. Political economy analysis should be integrated into CPEIR implementation to assess the incentives and constraints for scaling up \u2018positive\u2019 climate expenditures and reforming patterns of taxation and expenditure that enable \u2018negative\u2019 impacts. This seems particularly pertinent on the mitigation side to reducing carbon emissions from particular forms of energy production or industry. The CPEIR use of reviews at local level should be continued and complemented with more comprehensive reviews of how decentralisation and deconcentration processes as a whole have potential for integrating climate related concerns. A more thorough assessment of public administrative reform processes and their potential for integrating key components for capacity development and institutional reform related to managing climate related planning and budgeting could be undertaken. CPEIR institutional reviews could look in more depth at how to ensure governments are more accountable for their effective planning and budgeting in delivering a comprehensive approach to climate change \u2013 for example, how media and civil society can create demand for information in this regard, as well as to how parliaments and audit institutions can play a role. Complementary analyses The CPEIRs are relatively silent on the issue of whether existing budgetary allocations are appropriate: to do this complementary analyses may need to be undertaken. In the countries surveyed, there is currently a lack of statistical analysis, which looks outside of government and reviews private sector investments, including household expenditures from a climate change perspective. Furthermore, many countries are asking for economic analysis tools to assess how much \u2018needs\u2019 to be spent in order to address the risk or to meet necessary mitigation targets. More forward-looking economic analysis may also need to be done to assess how climate expenditures may need to grow over time as climate impacts continue to deepen. 18 The CPEIRs as currently conceived also primarily consider the quantity of expenditures (ie allocation of expenditures) and how that relates to policy. To comment on the quality (ie effectiveness and efficiency) of various expenditures related to climate change would require complementary analysis such as public expenditure tracking surveys and further investigation of the impacts of expenditures. Further work is needed on the distribution and incidence of climate expenditure to bring in the \u201cpoverty\u201d aspects of climate expenditure more explicitly. Clearly climate expenditure will create \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d as these trade-offs need to be recognised. This is of particular relevance to development partners, who are providing a large share of climate finance. Implications for the international climate change debate There are a number of key sector policy areas which recur in the CPEIR expenditure analysis, but have been less prominent in the international climate change debate to date. For example, the implications of climate change on social protection policy emerge in the Bangladesh CPEIR. Further work is required to think through how governments might adjust systems of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, agricultural input subsidy programs or cash transfers to factor in vulnerability to climate change, which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "642552e1-a3f0-432b-8d5d-15d24dbec84f": {"__data__": {"id_": "642552e1-a3f0-432b-8d5d-15d24dbec84f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs) in the Asia-Pacific Region \u2013 What Have We Learnt?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92ddd431f4a07f905c801394abc2a7760c724e96f4ae099458fd00a442603808"}, "3": {"node_id": "b85bc23c-0b4c-4a95-985b-299b25ab81f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/climate-public-expenditure-and-institutional-reviews-cpeirs-asia-pacific-region-%E2%80%93-what-have-we-learnt", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "457b07a429e313fd03e1f6a2cf338c7ae0f9bd73b53abeec098afb18b4ae35cc"}}, "hash": "9cbf30e25cc7967b558cb41486271c22a8bacc05f5257d674f8a032a1029c094", "text": "will vary from region to region. Expenditure analyses have highlighted that a significant proportion of climate relevant expenditures are embedded in expenditures that have other primary objectives. Creating parallel national systems to manage \u2018climate finance\u2019 risks fragmenting the national response to climate change as well as placing further strain on already stretched national systems. Exploring mechanisms to channel funds through existing national budgetary systems that satisfy donor concerns on fiduciary risk will be a key challenge for the international climate change debate moving forward. The CPEIRs have also highlighted synergies between UNFCCC agreements on putting in place monitoring, reporting and verification systems for climate finance and the domestic benefits of improved output and outcome indicators for climate relevant expenditures in order to be able to assess domestically the effectiveness of existing climate relevant expenditures. There is also a potential need in the international climate change debate to recognize that it may not be easily feasible to monitor the outcomes of all resources relevant to climate change given the challenges in isolating \u2018climate relevant\u2019 expenditure and defining climate change adaptation indicators. The role of the UNFCCC in stimulating climate change policy debate at a national level suggests that there would be benefit in development partners providing continued support to developing country governments in preparing and attending the annual COP meetings. 19 Annex 1: CPEIR classification of programme type (Bird et al. 2012) Annex 1 summarises the way in which different programme types were classified in the proposed methodology for CPEIRs (method note) and the five different countries CPEIRs completed. The approach to the coordination of the CPEIRs was to allow the broad classification principles to be applied flexibly in each country, to reflect the circumstances in the country and to explore different approaches.

The UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) led the implementation of this initiative. UNDP RCB wishes to acknowledge the dedicated contribution of Dr. Roger Harris in leading the research process in Lao PDR and throughout the process of producing the draft report. Special thanks go to the national research team\u2019s local researchers, who assisted in data collection in three field locations and provided critical assistance on the ground. UNDP RCB would like to express its gratitude to the Ministry of Information and Communication and the UNDP Country Office in Lao PDR for their invaluable support during the research process and, in particular, for organizing the national stakeholder consultations in March 2009. Particular appreciation must be given to Matthias Meier, Heather Shere-Massey and Sarah Ransom for their substantive contributions and dedication in making the C4E initiative meaningful in the specific context of Lao PDR. Substantive inputs were provided by Chandra Roy, R. Sudarshan and Saara Frestadius in the review process. Furthermore, acknowledgement should be given to Lars Bestle and Ryce Chanchai for coordinating the Regional Initiative on C4E and for providing substantive revisions and their contributions to the overall writing and analysis of the report. Without the views and information provided by various organizations and individuals interviewed and surveyed, particularly the ethnic peoples in the three participating districts, this study would not have been possible. Finally, special appreciation must be given to the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and Communication for Social Change Consortium for their enriching collaboration and partnership and for providing funding mobilized through UNDEF. This made operation of this unique initiative possible at the global, regional and national levels simultaneously and planted the seeds for additional funding to enable expansion of the C4E initiative to other countries in 2010. Foreword Indigenous and ethnic peoples are highly marginalized and vulnerable. Largely excluded from mainstream development processes in many countries, their participation in decision-making and governance is limited. Many ethnic communities have neither the voice nor the means to influence and shape policies and outcomes affecting their lives. On 13 September 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted, by an overwhelming majority, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).1 The Declaration acknowledges that indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices as a result of colonization and dispossession of their lands, territories and resources, and that this has prevented them from exercising their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests. The Declaration is hailed as a landmark instrument and is gaining recognition as the most comprehensive standard by which to articulate the vision, aspirations and rights of indigenous peoples. The Declaration provides a benchmark to guide and inspire our work to promote and protect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. It also recognizes the importance of media in reflecting indigenous cultural diversity. In December 2007, in response to the need to implement the Declaration, UNDP\u2019s Regional Centre in Bangkok launched the Regional Initiative on Communication for Empowerment (C4E) of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples.2 The initiative emphasizes the role of communications as an empowering mechanism to enhance inclusive participation and governance. Lao PDR is a country rich in cultural diversity, with 47 ethnic communities living in peace and harmony. Lao PDR has taken ambitious steps in providing access to information to remote communities as a prerequisite to development, and is engaged in implementing innovative pilot programmes in this field. The prospect of more inclusive participation, access to information and wider communication channels in Lao PDR has been stimulated by changes in the legal and policy environment towards civil society and the media and more generally towards poverty reduction and social inclusion of ethnic peoples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56335269-3c4d-4c30-9685-9df89a09b615": {"__data__": {"id_": "56335269-3c4d-4c30-9685-9df89a09b615", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9a280d4aae8ae5ce8942c0b9904c65977dc626f9705926fd9ab1b329fe157f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1260894-ddf6-4bb5-9a07-30b2e58b2623", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75a0aebab226f0ab076b88f97b76402b0254de7badb349a1f49fed6dcebd094a"}}, "hash": "2b767889c2e996d79c81aec249efb2d507375cc5e319bb46bda8653d474f9950", "text": "As part of the overall effort to strengthen access to information and communication channels among indigenous and ethnic peoples in Asia, UNDP\u2019s Regional Initiative on C4E provided support for an information and communication needs and opportunity assessment as a preliminary approach to identify strategic C4E priorities for Lao PDR.

This study was made possible through a fruitful collaboration between the Ministry of Information and Communication (MoIC), UNDP Lao PDR, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and the Communication for Social Change Consortium. UNDP is dedicated to supporting inclusive media and access to information for marginalized and vulnerable groups in Asia due to the critical importance of these communication elements in making democratic processes participatory, transparent and accountable and inclusive. Evidence shows that access to information and a free, independent and pluralistic media environment encompassing rural and remote areas is essential for fostering inclusive democratic governance. I hope that this report will contribute to the work of UNDP and other development agencies in enhancing and expanding opportunities for ethnic people to access information and communication channels in Lao PDR. We remain committed to making this a reality.

Preface: A Step Towards Inclusive Participation Communication underpins human development because it enables people to access, produce and transfer to others information that is important for their empowerment and progress. Through communication people are able to arrive at their own understanding of issues, to consider and discuss ideas, and to engage in national public debates. Communication thus enables people to negotiate, develop and act on knowledge, and it facilitates the formation of public opinion without which democracy cannot exist. While being very different types of organizations and working with very different mandates, the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and the Communication for Social Change Consortium share an understanding of the importance of communication as a tool and a methodology that can make development strategies more effective, more sustainable, more pro-poor and more gender sensitive. In the case of UNDP, the recently approved 2008-2013 Strategic Plan recognizes that communication channels are key determinants of inclusive participation. Inclusive participation is a focus for the work of UNDP in the area of democratic governance. The approach is rooted in the knowledge that one of the challenges facing developing countries is the lack of inclusion and participation of poor and vulnerable groups in decisions that affect their lives. The Communication for Social Change Consortium fundamentally believes that communication has the power to change societies. Participatory communication approaches can help us to better understand how commonly held social values and beliefs are nurtured and spread within cultures, and this knowledge is a powerful step towards helping people decide upon and begin to make the kind of changes they want and need in order to make their lives better. Said differently, the Consortium helps people to obtain necessary skills and feel empowered enough to advocate for changes that will make their communities healthier, their countries stronger, and their families more productive. When people come together in dialogue \u2013 and plan and act together \u2013 it is the truest form of democracy. One of the most exciting manifestations of democratic principles is understanding how information flows within communities and unleashing the voices of those people who are often not heard or seen. We have looked forward with great anticipation to the findings of the Communication for Empowerment pilot projects. A few years ago, the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre developed the UNDP Guidance Note on Communication for Empowerment, drawing upon the expertise of the Communication for Social Change Consortium. The purpose of this Guidance Note was to turn the above general insights into mainstream planning tools that facilitate an understanding of the information and communication needs of the poor and the marginalized, hopefully also making this a permanent feature in national development planning processes. This report is part of a series of pilot Needs Assessments in five Least Developed Countries, funded by a grant from the UN Democracy Fund. The country pilots will be followed by a global synthesis report that will reflect on the experience of the five pilots and provide tools for national actors to conduct their own assessments and to develop their own strategies for incorporating Communication for Empowerment into national planning processes and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "300991b3-1918-43b3-8842-4598a486f09d": {"__data__": {"id_": "300991b3-1918-43b3-8842-4598a486f09d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3387ff2cbdfb09ee99e8c5afe4add040b05a9ea6e7424a0cc050bf910ac5c1e"}}, "hash": "d3387ff2cbdfb09ee99e8c5afe4add040b05a9ea6e7424a0cc050bf910ac5c1e", "text": "programmes.

On one hand, access to information is a precondition for empowering IPs through understanding of issues and rights. On the other hand, communication means the ability of the people to express their voice, participate in a dialogue and influence decisions that affect their lives. The two complement each other but also embody separate meanings, which are necessary for understanding and implementing the C4E study. Communication for Empowerment (C4E) Approach C4E encompasses the role of communications as an empowering mechanism to enhance inclusive participation and governance. It is based on the fundamental belief that social inclusion and participation through access to information and effective communication channels are integral parts of democratic governance and sustainable development for the poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups. In essence, the C4E approach focuses on the governance dimensions of poverty, which recognizes the lack of voice, participation and choice as a result from social exclusion and discrimination. Indigenous peoples or ethnic peoples The concept of indigenous peoples is not used by the government in Lao PDR. Since the passing of the 1991 Constitution, the government uses the term Son phao Lao, usually understood as meaning \u201cnon-ethnic Lao\u201d, or more general, \u201cethnic group\u201d or \u201cethnic people\u201d. Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those that have a historical continuity to earlier societies and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories and a collective social and cultural identity that is distinct from dominant groups in society. United Nations human rights bodies, ILO, the World Bank and international law apply four criteria to distinguish indigenous peoples: (a) indigenous peoples usually live within (or maintain attachments to) geographically distinct ancestral territories; (b) they tend to maintain distinct social, economic, and political institutions within their territories; (c) they typically aspire to remain distinct culturally, geographically and institutionally rather than assimilate fully into national society; and (d) they self-identify as indigenous or tribal. Despite common characteristics, there does not exist any single accepted definition of indigenous peoples that captures their diversity as peoples. Self-identification as indigenous or tribal is a fundamental criterion for determining whether groups are indigenous or tribal, sometimes in combination with other variables such as \u2018language spoken\u2019 and \u2018geographic location or concentration\u2019. (Source: United Nations, The Concept of Indigenous Peoples, the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 19-21 January 2004; UNDP, UNDP and Indigenous Peoples: A Practice Note on Engagement, 2001; and IWGIA, The Concept of Indigenous Peoples in Asia: A Resource Book, 2008) Voice \u2018Voice\u2019 is defined as representation in formal institutions to enhance participation. In the C4E context, voice means access and representation in the media. It also extends to mean organizing and forming institutions to voice and articulate demands of excluded groups. The outcomes of voice, influence and agency are the extent to which poor and excluded people engage, influence and hold institutions that affect them accountable 1 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Executive Summary Ethnic peoples represent approximately 44 percent of the total population in Lao PDR. They remain marginalized and vulnerable as a group, excluded by and large from mainstream development processes and continuing to suffer from issues related to poverty, social exclusion and lack of access to basic social services. The Communication for Empowerment (C4E) study encompasses both a national overview and a field study. The national overview includes a section on the situation of ethnic peoples and the status of their development, as well as an overview of the current media and information and communication technology (ICT) landscape. The field study includes findings and results of media research conducted in three different locations in Lao PDR inhabited by ethnic peoples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e0c523f-d444-47c6-946a-340333b00d6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e0c523f-d444-47c6-946a-340333b00d6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53154fe136c2c53da1be49b296d533b0abc136752be3859f491863cf5b3d8750"}, "2": {"node_id": "3137dc40-ce1c-4fac-9e94-cb49f87bb3ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cad2560940f0aebff9e39be9903f43b9e293e28dcea19e6cd137eb9b8b46a35"}}, "hash": "7346c72bac7c5f7c6643d7f0848f926c246aa9e64fc585bd271002bd0e61d5e4", "text": "Through analysis of the national and field level assessments, the C4E study identifies both development challenges and opportunities and gives recommendations on how to enhance communication for empowerment of ethnic peoples.

With limited formal and informal representation, and limited ability to express their views and let their voices be heard in society, ethnic peoples will continue to be further marginalized. This results in widening disparities and inequalities in Lao PDR, especially if the existing information and communication divide between urban and rural areas is not bridged in a meaningful way. Challenges in Communication for Empowerment Language barriers and literacy skills Problems of poor communication identified in this study exacerbate the difficulties involved in addressing ethnic development to the extent that such development must take place within the framework of the languages and cultures of the ethnic groups concerned. Given the variety of languages and cultures in Lao PDR, this requirement alone places a huge burden on the development process. With the low literacy rates found among ethnic peoples, written media is not appropriate to assist in this process of communication. Oral communication is more appropriate, as it reaches everyone when it is conducted in the language with which the audience is familiar and it is clearly preferred by the ethnic people themselves over other forms of communication. Ethnic groups largely un-organized and isolated Based on the experiences and data of the field research, it can be said that ethnic people in Lao PDR are isolated along several dimensions. They are socially isolated as a result of illiteracy, even in their own language. This tends to cut them off from interaction among their own people living in neighbouring villages as well as from other ethnic peoples who live farther away but who may share a set of common ideals and goals. Many ethnic peoples are also physically isolated, living in remote locations with poor or non-existent communications and transportation. Many of the people who participated in this study rarely leave their villages. Integration of community radio and other forms of media to overcome isolation and distance The single most important form of contact with the world outside is the radio, which can be found in more than half the households and which has become a trusted and preferred source of information. Perceptions of radio are not conditioned by ownership; it is rated almost equally high by householders who own a radio as it is by those who do not. However, as a two-way form of communication, radio in Lao PDR has yet to achieve its full potential. Word-of-mouth remains the principal form of communication from villagers to authorities. 2 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Scarce relevant information and media content There are some serious gaps in the provision of information and media content for ethnic groups based on their needs and interests. Efforts to raise public awareness about how to use new media and ICT to improve quality of life are constrained by the lack of content in ethnic languages via suitable communication means. Much of the \u2018information poverty\u2019 in the study areas could be alleviated if the requirements for information and communication requirements identified in this study could be met. Principal among these requirements is the need for information in support of better education, health care, sanitation, agriculture, natural resource management, pest control, animal husbandry, enterprise development (especially for women), family planning and irrigation. In addition, local news would be welcomed as well as ethnically-specific cultural entertainment. Limited representation and voices of ethnic peoples in the mainstream media Beyond radio, other types of media have little presence (around 10 percent of households or less) in the villages studied, although access outside the household is much higher, which indicates a community-based approach to technology access. Nearly all sources of information are trusted and are useful, but the representation of ethnic issues is infrequent, except on radio. Again, with the exception of radio, the quality of media treatment of ethnic issues is rather moderate, and more would be welcomed, especially on radio. Ethnic peoples lack voices as they feel that they are generally unable to respond to anything they see or hear in all types of media. All types of media could serve ethnic issues better but, given the varying levels of access to different media, radio is regarded as the most promising. Ethnic people perceive radio as a crucial communication channels for development opportunities within their communities. Opportunities for Communities for Empowerment The study identifies emerging opportunities to overcome some of the challenges in improving access to information and communications for ethnic communities.

They set a course for continuing a positive trajectory toward inclusive participation for ethnic peoples with better access to information and inclusive media as an entry point. Infrastructure and opportunities for new media and ICT in the remote rural areas Currently, Lao PDR has a relatively advanced backbone infrastructure for ICT, which provides opportunities for expanding communication outreach in the remote rural areas. However, local content, application and usage of ICT still has little relevance for marginalized and vulnerable groups, including ethnic peoples. An emerging new media and networked communication environment tapping into modern means of communications via the Internet, wireless technologies and mobile telephony will increasingly influence the space for communicative participation and inclusion of ethnic peoples. Research findings indicate that remote and rural areas will significantly benefit from improved communication channels through the convergence of traditional and new communication technologies. Simultaneously, emergent media and communications technology has great potential to enhance provision of services and empower the local communities to participate in development and address their key concerns. Mobile phones: the promise of the future In Lao PDR, as in most other developing countries, mobile telephony has experienced a dramatic increase in its penetration among all levels of society due to liberalization in the telecom sector, 3 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR cheaper hand-sets and the introduction of pre-paid services. Further cost reductions in the coming years, and telecommunications industry innovations in service and application development, might prove this trend to be the single most important development in terms of expanding communicative space for ethnic development and mitigating societal and economic isolation. Recommendations on Communication for Empowerment The C4E assessment yielded a number of recommendations generated through analysis of the findings and following inputs obtained at a national stakeholder meeting in Vientiane in March 2009. The recommendations encompass the following key areas: y Improving the enabling policy environment on C4E for ethnic peoples; y Proposing C4E programme interventions aimed at increasing ethnic peoples access to information, communication channels, voice and participation in governance processes. Improving an enabling policy environment on C4E for ethnic peoples An enabling policy and legal environment is an essential precursor for media to increase access to information and communication channels among ethnic peoples in Lao PDR, thereby becoming a mechanism for inclusive democratic governance. Both the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) and 6th National Socio- Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) recognize the critical importance of access to information as a means to enhance socio-economic development in the 47 poorest districts in Lao PDR. Both plans emphasize the importance of communication tools in providing relevant information for empowerment, local development and poverty eradication. Introduction of an access to information policy and legislative framework can further strengthen civic engagement in governance processes and help expand the role of the media in Lao PDR. To drive this process, proposed recommendations are: y Access to information policy: As part of other programmes on peoples\u2019 participation in governance, UNDP could take the lead in promoting an access to information policy in Lao PDR in collaboration with MoIC. Particular attention could be paid to access to information for ethnic peoples. y Media assessment: Conditions for community radio and combinations with other new media channels are important steps toward expansion of the communicative space for ethnic peoples. The media assessment based on UNESCO\u2019s Media Development Indicators Framework1 could help to prioritize actions of the government and those of the international donor agencies. This analysis would focus on the enabling environment for the media to strengthen communication outreach and diversity. Priority actions should aim at improving the capacity and enabling legal environment of all forms of media and communications, particularly with a view to remote rural areas. This could also stimulate rural development. y National committee: In order to take the C4E recommendations forward, a national multi- stakeholder committee on information, communication and media should be established with the key tasks to: 1) continue assessment of the C4E situation; 2) formulate a national strategic plan to expand inclusive communication channels; and 3) integrate new media and ICT into other forms of communications to promote inclusive participation and voices of ethnic communities. y Support to CSOs: Enhance awareness and capacity of the new civil society organizations (CSOs) and associations with particular focus on how to utilize communication and media options to enhance participation in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a303c477-a7cb-4186-9976-fe03d84c77ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "a303c477-a7cb-4186-9976-fe03d84c77ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40b7a76a35f6f405b8c36556c8533bfac11ada2dc1930055c227a817db75b35d"}, "3": {"node_id": "5766a02c-3a65-40fd-891b-3dccded67e91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcee9571a5c16cfb0708bc0662f6438b1af329360cf29f40244642a369ef3b2e"}}, "hash": "16e8289a1d2e4458ff23a0026d3ae38cbc30887bb993ea87e91e2169dcb4dce9", "text": "public dialogues or discussions at the national and sub- national levels. y CSO and media collaboration: Establish mechanisms for collaboration between CSOs/ associations, particularly those relating to ethnic peoples and mainstream media as well as community radio as a way to enhance their voices in the public discourse. 1 UNESCO (2008), Media Development Indicators: A framework for assessing media development, The International Programme for the Development of Communication. Paris, 2008. 4 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR y Support to national media: Support Lao National Radio and TV to improve their reporting on ethnic issues at national and sub-national levels. Proposed C4E Interventions Scaling up community radio in Lao PDR At the national level, scaling up any strategic C4E programme would entail more than merely replicating activities that already exist. A wider programme, perhaps on a national scale, would necessarily need to be institutionalized with a set of working practices and procedures capable of being followed by many employees. Accordingly, such a programme should be accompanied by mechanisms for building capacity and sharing experiences as well as generating a forum for further development of the concept. Capacity development at the national level includes: y Legal advice and support y Training and planning assistance y Financial management and resource mobilisation y Community research and impact assessment y Partnership of relevant stakeholders y Local ownership Combining community radio with internet The introduction of additional ICTs to community radio represents an innovative opportunity in Lao PDR. The Internet can intensify radio\u2019s impact in a number of ways by offering the ability to share and disseminate knowledge and information among development agents, policy makers and the beneficiaries themselves. However, in order to have a significant impact on development programmes, ICT services must be readily accessible and meaningful to broad segments of the rural population and the information they carry must be adapted and disseminated in formats and languages that the recipients and participants can comprehend. Experience with community telecentres that provide shared access to computers and the Internet and other ICTs indicates that they are capable of effectively supporting interventions for education, health, agriculture, enterprise development and cultural and social enrichment. While telecentres deliver information to communities, radio can be used in addition to deliver it directly into households. Mobile phones: the promise of the future Mobile phones present a further opportunity for technology synergy. The growth and potential impact of mobile phones are phenomenal. Mobile phones are helping to deliver on every one of the Millennium Development Goals.2 Further increasing mobile penetration into the poorest sections of society will require low-cost handsets and services, innovative funding schemes and, most of all, more efficient markets. Research evidence suggests that it will be possible to almost double current levels of penetration before provision of services becomes uneconomical.3 Moreover, because many developing countries such as Lao PDR are unencumbered by legacy assets, they have the opportunity to leap-frog to newly-available, affordable technologies; mobile and wireless networks will play a large role in this regard. Development of mobile services in Lao PDR has been left largely to the private sector, but these services also can be incorporated into formal development programmes. The volume of telephone calls to the Khoun Community Radio Station is indicative of the potential of telephonic communications and bolsters the case for integrating mobile access into community radio services, even if only at the level of one phone per village. 2 Richard Heeks and Abi Jagun, \u201cMobile phones and development: the future in new hands?,\u201d Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex available at http://www.id21.org/insights/insights69/art00.html (accessed on 9 December 2009) 3 ibid. 5 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Community e-Centres ICTs and community radio can contribute to effective programmes in all areas of the MDGs. In the case of telecentres, experience indicates that they are capable of effectively supporting interventions for education, health, agriculture enterprise development and cultural and social enrichment. For sustainability, they need to be good at a minimum of two of these areas, preferably three or more. Telecentres under UNESCO are called \u2018multipurpose community e-centres\u2019 to emphasize this characteristic. The Internet is already emerging as a powerful force for development and poverty alleviation. Access to the Internet is usually provided to rural communities in the form of community telecentres.4 Community telecentres are seen as a tool for achieving development goals, even for least developed countries (LDCs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5766a02c-3a65-40fd-891b-3dccded67e91": {"__data__": {"id_": "5766a02c-3a65-40fd-891b-3dccded67e91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40b7a76a35f6f405b8c36556c8533bfac11ada2dc1930055c227a817db75b35d"}, "2": {"node_id": "a303c477-a7cb-4186-9976-fe03d84c77ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16e8289a1d2e4458ff23a0026d3ae38cbc30887bb993ea87e91e2169dcb4dce9"}}, "hash": "bcee9571a5c16cfb0708bc0662f6438b1af329360cf29f40244642a369ef3b2e", "text": "Nepal and Bangladesh (both LDCs) have embarked on national programmes for the widespread deployment of community telecentres for delivering Internet access to poor rural populations, following some years of experimentation and in line with similar programmes in other developing countries.

Introduction and Background 8 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR 1. Introduction and Background The Concept of Communication for Empowerment The important role of communication in development processes has been acknowledged by the development community at many levels and for many years. The specific understanding and concept of communication in development is, however, ever-changing. For example, within the United Nations, communication for development has been emphasized mainly in relation to specific development challenges such as HIV/AIDS, education and agricultural development. Today, communication for development is primarily seen as a people-centred approach that can help to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.5 Among the various definitions of \u2018communication for development\u2019 generated at the UN Inter- Agency Round Table on Communication for Development, there seems to be a general consensus to define it as a participatory and two-way process, and distinct from external relations and public relations. This is further emphasized by the formal United Nations definition of Communication for Development, adopted in General Assembly resolution 51/172 Article 6: \u201cCommunication for development stresses the need to support two-way communication systems that enable dialogue and that allow communities to speak out, express their aspirations and concerns, and participate in the decisions that relate to their development.\u201d The concept of Communication for Empowerment [C4E] has emerged to emphasize and address the specific information and communication needs of poor and vulnerable groups. Communication for Empowerment was initially introduced and conceptualized by the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre (OGC) and the Communication for Social Change Consortium in 2006. The C4E approach emphasizes the role of communications as an empowering mechanism to enhance inclusive participation and governance. It is based on the fundamental belief that social inclusion and participation through access to information and effective communication channels are integral parts of democratic governance and sustainable development for poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups. Finally, the C4E approach focuses on the governance dimensions of poverty, which recognizes in essence the lack of voice, participation and choices as a result of social exclusion and discrimination.6 The C4E Practical Guidance Note and Project: Developing Media Strategies in Support of Vulnerable Groups In 2006, the Oslo Governance Centre released a practical guidance note on Communication for Empowerment7 that explains the importance of communications to poverty reduction and outlines a range of ways that UNDP and other development practitioners can best enhance C4E based on the first step of conducting information and communication audits.8 At present, the opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups to voice their concerns through effective communication channels have not been sufficiently identified and documented, particularly at 5 See, United Nations General Assembly Resolution (A63/180), 63rd Session, Communication for Development Programmes in United Nation System 28 July 2008. 6 See, UK Department for International Development, Reducing Poverty by Tackling Social Exclusion, DFID Policy Paper (London, DFID, September 2005). 7 See, United Nations Development Programme, Communication for Empowerment: Developing Media Strategies in Support of Vulnerable Groups, Practice Guidance Note (Oslo, UNDP, March 2006). 8 The Practical Guidance Note aims to demonstrate that media can play a crucial role in empowering vulnerable and marginalized groups. This can best be achieved if media support and media capacity development is directed in a way that enables the media to better respond to and reflect the information and communication needs of these groups. The Note underscores the particular importance of radio in communication for empowerment strategies because of its reach, accessibility to the poor and increasingly interactive character.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4c213ee-ed96-4157-a588-abff8d4ef5a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4c213ee-ed96-4157-a588-abff8d4ef5a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ddd21a97ce4297a0e04acb7eb47bbd3b7af55e45e8b4eba08dd139ab0b9148a"}, "2": {"node_id": "33782c70-6829-4bfb-a2a6-4ee9bb65d50f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bf75624b395c0802ba94dcfa36b02c5e1a4f7145fd239140af72f65fed35a34"}}, "hash": "5f86afbc78f17177975b10ce445c290da3fc657269caa8998c0a9c7521a8a4d5", "text": "It further explains that the media landscape in most developing countries has undergone a revolution over the last 15 years.

Media in many of these countries have been transformed from monopolistic and government-dominated systems to increasingly diverse types. 9 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR local levels. Assessment of communication needs and opportunities in a C4E approach is seen as the first instrumental step. This critical step has largely been ignored by national development planning processes and policy makers. The intended outcome of the information and communication audits is to identify key challenges and opportunities for interventions to empower the poor, marginalized and vulnerable groups through better access to information and enhancement of the skills necessary to engage with the media and take advantage of communication facilities. In so doing, they can exercise their voices and participate more inclusively and meaningfully in decision-making and development processes affecting them. In 2007, with funding from the United National Democracy Fund (UNDEF), the Oslo Governance Centre initiated C4E pilot projects focusing on the information and communication needs assessment in five LDCs: Ghana, Madagascar and Mozambique in Africa and Lao PDR and Nepal in Asia. These C4E pilot projects, which were completed in January 2010, aim to identify information and communication gaps and establish a national stakeholder forum to take the key findings and recommendations forward. The key outputs from the C4E initiative include: y A national C4E report with the key research findings; y A national stakeholder group comprised of representative from the UN system, media, government, bilateral partners and civil society to implement the strategic C4E interventions after the completion of the national C4E report; y A series of gap-filling projects emerging from the national needs assessment process as described in the national report. These projects will be driven forward by the national stakeholder group; y A C4E assessment tool, which will continue to be improved based on lessons from the national studies. The tool will be made available for governments, United Nations agencies, international donor organizations and community-based organizations and institutions. This aims to ensure that the information and communication aspect of good governance will be incorporated into the strategic planning process at all levels. The Regional Initiative on Indigenous Voices: Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples The African pilot projects were implemented directly by the Oslo Governance Centre in collaboration with the respective UNDP Country Offices. The two Asian pilot projects were implemented through UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) under the Asia Regional Governance Programme (ARGP) in partnership with the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme (RIPP). For this reason, the C4E studies in Asia are part of the regional initiative on \u201cIndigenous Voices: Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u201d,9 which in parallel had just commenced. Several synergies between the two initiatives were identified and it was agreed that a regional-level engagement would be worthwhile to optimize the use of scarce resources. In addition to Lao PDR and Nepal, the Asia regional C4E initiative also aims to engage other countries in the Asia-Pacific region in collaboration with interested UNDP Country Offices. RCB and the Oslo Governance Centre share the same overall objectives. Both offices\u2019 initiatives are based on the principle that communication is a central determinant of inclusive participation, which is also a key result area of UNDP\u2019s global strategic plan in the area of democratic governance. The overall approach is predicated on inadequate social inclusion and participation of the poor and vulnerable groups in developing countries in development decisions affecting their lives. The Asia regional C4E initiative consists of various follow-up activities at regional and national levels. In this regard, the C4E study and needs assessment is an initial preparatory step that serves as a foundation to formulate policy and programme interventions to overcome challenges and meet the needs for information and communication of indigenous and ethnic peoples at national and community level. 9 The Communication for Empowerment (C4E) study and assessment in Lao PDR is under the UNDP Regional Project called \u201cIndigenous Voices: Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u201d implemented jointly by the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme (RIPP) and the Asia Regional Governance Programme (ARGP) of UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB). 10 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR The strategic intent of the national C4E study in Lao PDR is to establish the development context of the ethnic groups in the country with particular reference to the media, information and communications.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5b1ce72-ef6a-4d78-b601-3e17e15cdf88": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5b1ce72-ef6a-4d78-b601-3e17e15cdf88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3ed0f8720f6cf8bb88a9c9958e1c40b02ea38524979c7fa5163efd92663e0c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c2d7780-170f-4dcd-bac2-83b3e1bca782", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5cd9a57659cef7bddfbf3cad39e373126920757ece3bdb2bd40bb30f457d9a95"}}, "hash": "171086e9623f5fc7b4639df35b3378754905a5eecbdc6a8ece1c85afdfad0a09", "text": "It aims to propose specific interventions that can help to alleviate some of the challenges faced by ethnic peoples in Lao PDR, including the effective media and information and communication technologies (ICTs).

Within the Asia regional C4E initiative, a number of participating countries in the Asia-Pacific region will contribute towards greater regional endorsement of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), particularly the use of media and ICTs to promote the realization of the rights enshrined in the Declaration. Accordingly, through global and regional partnerships, the C4E initiative will leverage the knowledge and experiences from a wide range of country-level activities that will assist in advising and strengthening one another through a coordinated set of South-South cooperation, while bringing indigenous and ethnic peoples together with common concerns and fostering unity to effectively address them. In line with these wider intentions, the regional project has four outputs: y Output 1: Information needs and media-related legislative conditions for indigenous peoples in Asia identified, and awareness of policy makers improved y Output 2: Increased capacity of indigenous journalists and other media professionals in reporting on indigenous peoples issues and in harnessing ICTs and new media y Output 3: Strengthened capacity of indigenous people\u2019s organizations/communities in setting up or improving a number of indigenous community media and ICT interventions (e.g. local radio, website, multipurpose telecentre, etc.) and to test applications of common interest (e.g. land, culture, poverty, health, access to information, freedom of expression) y Output 4: Knowledge of indigenous media and ICT for development experiences is enhanced through research initiatives and the establishment of a \u2018community of practice\u2019 for sharing of good practices The Asia regional C4E initiative developed a document to describe the approach and research process being used in the country studies.10 Arising from the C4E study in Lao PDR and other participating countries, it intends to provide a procedural manual for implementing the forthcoming country-level activities under the Project for Indigenous Voices: Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples. The methodology for the C4E study and assessment represents a structured approach to promoting an understanding of the situation with regard to the ethnic groups in Lao PDR and their development context with particular reference to the media, information and communication. The approach comprises four sets of activities: y A national overview study, which draws on existing knowledge and data to formulate the overview of the ethnic groups in Lao PDR; y More specific analyses of the relationships between the ethnic groups, the media and ICTs; y Focused grassroots research involving selected ethnic communities; y Presentation of the findings to relevant stakeholders and the formulation of proposals for specific programme interventions to enhance flows of information and communication to and from ethnic groups, especially concerning their development prospects and well-being. In Asia, the C4E approach has been adapted to focus more closely on indigenous peoples. Therefore, in conducting the C4E study, special attention has been paid to the involvement of indigenous communities as well as their equal and informed participation, to have legitimate representation of the indigenous peoples. Indigenous participation is also vital for the process that will lead to greater inclusion. 10 United Nations Development Programme, Research and Activity Guideline for National C4E Study: Information and Communication Needs and Opportunities Appraisals (Draft), January 2009. Unpublished Document. 11 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR In Asia, development of the C4E methodology has been guided by the following principles: y The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which has been largely welcomed by indigenous peoples around the world, enhances legitimacy, importance and urgency to strengthen efforts to realise these rights. Particularly Article 16 on media and communication has guided the methodology;11 y The flow of information among and between indigenous peoples and the rest of society is one of the most significant factors contributing towards the realisation of these rights, especially when the means for generating such information flows \u2014 ICTs and the media \u2014 are under the ownership and control of the indigenous peoples themselves; y The efforts to ensure robust and continued improvement in the use of information and communication should be based on the ownership and management arrangements of indigenous peoples, which will empower their communities to achieve legitimate rights and desired communication outcomes. In accordance with these principles, the methodology adopted by the Asia regional C4E initiative presents an initial step for empowerment of the ethnic groups participating in the study. Through field research, the methodology endeavours to combine the national-level perspective of the situation related to all ethnic groups in Lao PDR with a more focused and in-depth analysis of the realities facing ethnic groups in three selected locations.

National overview National level research that outlines the development context and situation of the county\u2019s indigenous and ethnic peoples. 3. ICTs, media and indigenous peoples Overview analysis of the involvement of indigenous peoples with ICTs and the media, their representation and treatment in mainstream media and the extent to which they have ownership of their own media. 4. Field research Grass-roots examinations of the situation within particular representative indigenous communities, taking the form of Indigenous Communities\u2019 Information and Communication Needs and Opportunities Appraisals.

UNDP CO in Lao PDR took a leading role in identifying a local research team that included researchers from various ethnic backgrounds and languages. The entire C4E exercise in Lao PDR was large in scope due to the amount of information and data collected \u2014 more than any other C4E pilot. This was possible due the CO\u2019s funding contribution for the local research efforts and for the national stakeholder meeting, including participation of district-level stakeholders. In this process, UNDP Country Office in Lao PDR played a critical role in fostering synergies among other national development programmes and initiatives as well as managing the programmatic support to maximize gains from the national consultation process. Through close collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Culture, the UNDP CO gained government support to conduct research and ensure ownership of the C4E study at the national level. The Ministry of Information together with government representatives facilitated field research at the district level. It also took a leading role in hosting and organizing the national stakeholder consultation. In addition, a Democratic Governance Fellowship was granted on C4E by Oslo Governance Centre.12 The fellowship paper that resulted from this has contributed substantially to the analysis and findings presented in the C4E study. The C4E research was closely linked to the \u201cKhoun Radio Support Project: Bringing local news to local people in Xieng Khouang,\u201d which was initiated by the UNDP County Office in Lao PDR. This project aims to increase access to information, especially for ethnic peoples and vulnerable groups in the country. The C4E study and process in Lao PDR sought to identify some potential options for Khoun Radio, including its future prospects, which were debated and discussed at the national stakeholder meeting in Vientiane in March 2009.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a8004bc-ea86-408c-8424-f71925ab160a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a8004bc-ea86-408c-8424-f71925ab160a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f2d32a785201227ca67a7ab932ef5b61d4c116c7ef26c89292dbe79e7b19e3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "42cb084c-ba87-4bfc-9ac5-789cd557d9c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc32be7a6d75eb7edeabd1a891f8331afa3428807334435e63ee0ddba4587972"}}, "hash": "4ec0e3ebcd67b8d3d47d84c1cf9076c4ab7a512b155e084afebccc5954fe470d", "text": "Finally, the Asia regional C4E initiative hopes that the C4E pilot project in Lao PDR will continue to evolve along with the regional C4E initiative and provide lessons learned for other participating countries.

National Overview Study 2.1 Inclusion and Development of the Ethnic Peoples The following chapter provides an overview of the situation of the intended beneficiaries of the C4E initiative, the ethnic peoples of Lao PDR. It establishes the development context and conditions under which the initiative operated, Particular attention is given to their development challenges and opportunities, focusing on the participation of ethnic peoples in mainstream development and governance processes in the existing legal and policy framework in Lao PDR, particularly in national development plans and policies. Map 1: Lao PDR Lao PDR Thailand China Cambodia Viet Nam Indonesia Myanmar Malaysia National Context Lao PDR is a landlocked country and among the 13 so-called Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the Asia-Pacific Region. It ranks 133rd out of 179 countries in the 2008 UNDP Global Human Development Index (HDI). The country is characterized by a very high degree of diversity in geography, ethnicity and languages. It is also marked by poor physical infrastructure and a high incidence of poverty, in particular in rural areas. Public services typically do not extend to remote areas, leaving rural populations \u2014 often ethnic minority groups \u2014 with inadequate access to health care and education. Lao PDR is envisioned by some to become the \u2018power producer country of South-East Asia\u2019, generating hydropower from the Mekong River and distributing the electricity to neighbouring countries. Nevertheless, this remains a distant dream for Lao PDR due to its limited capacity and the conflicting interests among countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The economic growth it has experienced in recent years is largely underpinned by investments in hydro power and mining. The Government aspires for the country to shed its status as an LDC by the year 2020.13 Lao PDR is a one-party state. Authority is concentrated in the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party, which took power in 1975 and asserts itself primarily through four institutions: government, military, bureaucracy and mass organizations. In 1986, the government initiated the New Economic Mechanism, a process of economic reform and liberalization that in essence resulted in abolishing the socialist command economy, increasing the role of market forces and encouraging foreign investment, while maintaining stability and political order.14 13 See Ibid. 14 Ibid. 17 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Demographic Profile Nearly 44 percent of the total population of Lao PDR are regarded as members of various minority ethnic groups. Around 50 percent to 60 percent of the Lao population are known as Lao Loum (Lowland Lao). This group has traditionally had a dominant influence in culture, politics and the economy. Lao is the official language. The Lao 2000 census designated 47 ethnic groups (later increased to 49) with more than 160 sub-branches15 (see Map 2: Ethnic Group Population Percentages by Province). Ethnic classification in Lao PDR is highly debated and has led to lengthy discussions among scholars. The groups are very diverse in cultural and linguistic terms as well as in their adaptive responses to the natural and social environment and their livelihood systems. There are four major ethno-linguistic groups in the Lao PDR: Tai-Kadai, Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic), Hmong-Mein and Tibeto-Burmese. They are officially referred to as \u2018ethnic groups\u2019 or \u2018ethnic peoples\u2019 or by the name of the group of which they are a member, in preference to the term minority. Concepts that have influenced the interactions of the government and ethnic peoples in Lao PDR include modernization and national security and unity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68ba007f-07ef-464c-af6e-e03915e0bfd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "68ba007f-07ef-464c-af6e-e03915e0bfd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62d60105545ab5f1310b0d529d6db179d1837ffcf86245f76f5968ce0dbddeb2"}, "2": {"node_id": "a483add1-b11c-4277-ba19-69a6b49c4a38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "571b95e9cca3cd7cef56cbe9c82a1f054303adaa28e42b2508f6011073cdc0ff"}}, "hash": "f1d3982e191d9ce6f069446f65dd5f5450d480bbde45f7239fdfbe94b654acb8", "text": "This is clearly demonstrated in the government\u2019s plan for rural development, which is based on the demographics of the country \u2014 largely ethnic groups.

Extensive natural forests allow people to live within a subsistence economy16 with little cash-flow but obtaining the basic necessities. Around 44 percent of the population of Lao PDR are estimated to live in poverty (2000 data).17 These people, comprising about 300,000 households scattered in more than 6,300 villages, are largely small farmers dependent on rural livelihoods in remote and highly diversified biophysical environments. Generally, they have undergone several forms of disruption. The vast majority of these rural poor belong to the country\u2019s many ethnic groups. Whilst there is a general recognition that many of the ethnic groups suffer unacceptable disadvantages in areas such as health and education, the government generally favours \u2018non- discriminatory\u2019 approaches. This approach is partly rooted in ethnic divisions and insurgency experienced during the decades of armed conflict that continue to resonate today. Disaggregated data is lacking. The United Nations Common Country Assessment (2006) concluded that \u201cdata disaggregation by sex, location and ethnicity is improving but does not yet support adequate analysis and policy formulation.\u201d Most official statistics in relation to poverty and development are not disaggregated by ethnic groups, thus limiting the space for targeted policy- making. Data collection typically considers the ethnic dimension but comparisons along ethnic lines are discouraged. This point is clearly illustrated in the recently produced Socio-Economic Atlas of Lao PDR, which depicts the data collected for the 2005 census.18 15 The International Working Group on Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA) recognises more than 240 different ethno-linguistic groups in Lao PDR, see IWGIA website available at http://www.iwgia.org/sw16162.asp 16 A subsistence economy is an economy in which enough food is grown, hunted or gathered to provide for the people. A surplus is grown only if a community desires or needs to trade with neighboring communities. 17 Based on the new poverty headcount ratio at $1.25 a day (PPP) (% of population), see World Bank, World Development Indicator (WDI) online database, 2009. 18 Peter Messerli et al, eds.

Although human development data is generally not ethnically disaggregated, studies have shown that rates of literacy, infant mortality, immunization and HIV/AIDS awareness are worse among the smaller ethnic groups than among the Lao Loum people.19 The National Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006-2010 points out that wide development disparities between urban and suburban residents, provinces/territories, economic sectors and different ethnic groups are still a major concern. Access to and quality of education services The net enrolment rate for primary schools in Lao PDR is approximately 86 percent as of 2007.20 About 15 percent of all villages have no access to primary schools and many existing village primary schools are not complete with all five grades. The development of education in isolated, ethnic and highland areas is very slow.21 There is a lack of qualified teachers and a deficit in access to school materials. Many girls do not attend school and many poor families cannot make the long-term investment of school enrolment for improving their lives as their immediate short-term needs are more pressing.

For many ethnic groups, living conditions are difficult and the geographical situation makes it hard to reach them with health services. According to the government, ethnic groups still uphold superstitious beliefs and mainly rely on shamans for cures.22 From hunting and gathering to swidden farming and wet-rice farming The ethnic peoples of Lao PDR have adopted a diverse range of adaptive responses to the natural environment in which they live. Their livelihood strategies range from hunting and gathering to various forms of wet-rice farming and swidden farming. Often, a combination of these basic patterns exists, supplemented by minor cash-crop production, the collection of non-timber forest products for trade, fishing and animal husbandry. Resettlement For some years, the Government of Lao PDR has pursued a policy of internally resettling ethnic communities from the highlands to the lowland areas and along roads. The reasons given are varied, but the policy of resettlement is often justified by the Government as a response to the difficulties of providing access to services as well as concern for the environment, i.e. forest conservation. However, there has been increased recognition by development communities that much of the previous resettlement has resulted in serious problems for the affected people. Nevertheless, some internal resettlement is still continuing and more is planned for the coming years.23 Regional disparities: Spatial distribution of ethnic groups A mapping exercise in 2000 revealed that the spatial distribution of poor districts based on income poverty tends towards an east/west divide that seems to relate to diversity in ethnic groups, farming systems and socioeconomic patterns. The mapping indicates that the poor districts are virtually all mountainous, with a high proportion of ethnic peoples and farming systems that produce little marketable surplus. They are also districts isolated from the national economy with limited social service infrastructure.24 Another map of the poorest districts in Lao PDR25 (Map 4 and 5) illustrates how these two measures correspond. As the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) points out, ethnicity and vulnerability are directly related, as certain ethnic groups have a limited range of assets and mechanisms to manage them. 22 Ibid. 23 Christian Erni, ed.

All acts of creating division and discrimination among ethnic groups are forbidden. The State implements every measure to gradually develop and upgrade the economic and social level of all ethnic groups.\u201d 22 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR In 1992, the ethnic minority policy called Resolution of the Party Central Organization Concerning Ethnic Minority Affairs in the New Era became a landmark of current national ethnic minority policy. It emphasizes livelihood improvement of ethnic peoples and protection of their identity and cultural heritage. The general policy of the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party related to ethnic peoples focuses on the following areas:26 y Enhance national sentiment (national identity); y Realize equality between ethnic groups; y Increase the level of solidarity among ethnic groups as members of the greater Lao family; y Resolve inflexible and vengeful thinking, as well as economic and cultural inequality; y Improve the living conditions of the ethnic peoples step by step; y Expand, to the greatest extent possible, the good and beautiful heritage and ethnic identity of each group as well as their capacity to participate in the affairs of the nation. Institutional mechanisms for ethnic peoples The Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC) was established in 1979 by the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party. It aims to bring together political organizations, social-political organizations and outstanding individuals to promote a sense of solidarity and equality among the population. The LFNC is designated as the advisor to the central committee of the party and the state with reference to ethnic peoples. At the local and district levels, the LFNC has responsibility for implementing programmes related to ethnic peoples\u2019 affairs, including health, education and basic social services. Furthermore, it is responsible for promoting cultural traditions and enhancing the administrative mechanism for greater participation of ethnic peoples. LFNC has representation at the provincial and district levels, and also at the village level in many instances. The LFNC currently recognizes 49 ethnic groups that are categorized into four larger ethno-linguistic families: Lao-Tai, Mon-Khmer, Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan. Responsibility for research into ethnic peoples rests with the Institute for Cultural Research under the Ministry of Information and Culture.27 The Ethnic Affairs Committee under the National Assembly is charged with the responsibility to draft and evaluate proposed legislation concerning ethnic peoples, and lobby for its implementation. It also lobbies for implementation of socioeconomic development plans. International instruments The Lao Government voted in favour of the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 September 2007. Below are listed other relevant international and regional covenants, conventions and agreements that Lao PDR is party to: y The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) y The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) y Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) y Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) y Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) The Constitution defines Lao PDR as a multi-ethnic state that grants equal rights to all ethnic groups. A comprehensive policy review conducted in 2000 by ILO concluded that \u201cLao ethnic minority policy, as it now stands, is in fact adequate and in accordance with the spirit of ILO Convention 26 See, IWGIA, The Constitutional and Political System of Lao PDR available at http://www.iwgia.org/sw17628.asp (accessed on 28 August 2009) 27 Ibid. 23 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries.\u201d28 Its authors conceded elsewhere that the Lao ethnic minority policy is in many aspects more conducive to achieving progress for ethnic groups than that of other countries in the sub-region. At its foundation is a 1992 Party Resolution and associated plan that calls for a wide range of interventions to improve opportunities for ethnic minority groups, as well as their economic, social, cultural and political standing.29 National development plan UNDP contributes to greater social inclusion of ethnic groups in Lao PDR mainly through its work in democratic governance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bf50fcc-d74c-4440-a931-a596e2bb9f29": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bf50fcc-d74c-4440-a931-a596e2bb9f29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f6bb19cc043ef693456278c143398ce7937c8924163cabef5e628f2adaa8747"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc6c7cf1-8a62-4366-b315-fa0e382bd57e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a7f17fa7a8a512073486d074d9449559d65cb7f823bc0841103b8114cc011e8"}}, "hash": "cf2b79286ee95ff67e9d0d0025fa624e3704a4e3fc002e3c49ec77eb2292e2d5", "text": "The Lao PDR Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) formulated in 200330 and the United Nations Development Assistant Framework (UNDAF) for 2007-2011 both make mention of the issues of inequality and disparity, particularly among ethnic groups at the sub-national level.

The Democratic Governance Trust Fund (DGTTF) has proven to be an effective instrument for the UNDP Country Office, which uses the Trust Fund to help advance a people- centred and rights-based agenda for ethnic minorities and civil society at large. Through the DGTTF, the Country Office has responded to emerging opportunities and needs in this area and supported several innovative projects such as the piloting of community radio in Lao PDR (2006); the development of a legal framework for civil society organizations (2007); the (re)introduction of local elected bodies (2008); and the review of customary law practices (most recently in 2009).31 Space for social movements of civil society and ethnic groups Since 2004, the government has begun a process of enabling civil society engagement. Nevertheless, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are still in the very early stages of development and few are devoted specifically to ethnic issues. There has been a noticeable widening of space for civil society, which was traditionally restricted to the activities of selected mass organizations under the direction of the Lao People\u2019s Revolutionary Party. The public at large has remained generally disengaged from political processes but as of 2007, some 100 civil society organizations were registered, according to an estimate by the Public Administration and Civil Service Authority (PACSA). The Constitution allows for the formation of non-profit associations, providing these do not contravene the law. On 29 April 2009, the Prime Minister signed the Decree on Associations, which allows local non-profit associations to register and operate as independent entities for the first time, effective November 2009. According to the Decree, a mobilization committee of three persons must be formed and a membership of at least 25 persons is required to register an association that works at the national level. Associations working at the provincial or capital level are required to have a minimum of 15 members; associations working at the district, municipality or village level are required to have minimum of 10 members. In connection to this requirement, applicants should be granted a supporting document from the government sectors concerned before submitting their application to PACSA or the provincial authorities. Policy and legal implications: inclusion and participation of ethnic peoples Ethnic peoples in Lao PDR are offered the opportunity to take part in the political life of the country through joining the Party, the army, the government and the mass organizations, particularly in provinces with significant ethnic minority populations. However, minority cadres represent ethnic constituencies to a varying degree. Currently one out of nine members of the Politbureau, incidentally also the only woman, is from an ethnic minority.

With the adoption of the 1991 Constitution, the country embarked on a course of re-centralization that reorganized a number of critical state functions, but also led to the dissolution of the local elected bodies, the so-called People\u2019s Councils.

The fundamental recognition and respect for their land and natural resources is critical. Key Challenges and Opportunities for the Ethnic Peoples Inclusive participation, voice and development Challenges y Disparities in development and widened inequalities: The mainstream development process has not paid much attention to promoting inclusive participation of ethnic peoples. The majority of the rural poor in Lao PDR are ethnic peoples who have been largely marginalized and remain vulnerable. Ethnic peoples have limited access to basic social services, particularly in health and education sectors. Unequal opportunities for development and unavoidable livelihood disruptions result in the limited capacity of ethnic peoples to participate in meaningful decision-making or voice their concerns, due in part to the low level of literacy and limited command of the national languages. y Isolated ethnic groups in remote rural areas: Living in remote and often isolated rural locations, ethnic groups lack basic communication services and also suffer from under-developed infrastructure. The wide dispersion of ethnic peoples throughout the country also presents obstacles to improving communications among them. y Lack of meaningful voices and participation in the policy decision making process: Due to a high degree of centralization and narrow representation of the ethnic groups in governance institutions, the issues affecting ethnic communities, including their view and interests, may not be equally represented at the national level. y Implementation of the national policy and legal framework and international instrument: Both national policy and legal frameworks, as well as international instruments, recognize the need 32 Ibid. 33 Matthias Meier, Empowering Indigenous Peoples in Asia through Communication, op. cit. 34 Crawford Young, Ethnic Diversity and Public Policy: An Overview, UNRISD Special Events (2000-2005), the Social Effect of Globalization Paper No. 8, p. 46. 25 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR to improve opportunities for ethnic peoples along with their economic, social, cultural and political standing. More efforts are required to translate policy and legislation into concrete development outcomes for ethnic peoples with particular attention to their participation and voice in development and governance processes. Opportunities y Ethnic knowledge systems: Despite pervasive poverty among the ethnic peoples, they possess invaluable knowledge and understanding of complex ecological structures and natural resource conservation. In this regard, different ethnic groups have distinct strengths, which provide significant opportunities to overcome development challenges. Therefore, the formulation of development programmes through inclusive participation that is based on their strengths would better respond to their specific needs.35 y Increasing space for social movements of civil society and ethnic groups: Over the past few years, the number of civil society organizations has increased as government has continued to cautiously loosen restrictions on civil society and non-governmental organizations. y Recent changes in legislation: Recent changes in the law related to the registration and operation of civil society organizations (CSOs) and associations as independent entities have created new opportunities for enhancing tjhe voice and participation of ethnic organizations. Also, the emerging civil society may help to increase participation of ethnic groups within the processes of national development and policy-making. In this regard, enhancing information and communication channels with particular attention to the ethnic peoples of Lao PDR may help to strengthen the role of civil society and ethnic organizations in governance and development processes. Modest improvement in communications could generate benefits for ethnic people if that improvement takes into account their particular concerns. 2.2 Media and ICT Landscape in Lao PDR Overview of the Media Landscape In Lao PDR, all major media outlets are largely owned and managed by the government. Some recent changes in the media landscape point to a number of new opportunities for a more pluralistic and inclusive media situation in the country. More information has been made available and increasing access is now possible through the introduction of Internet caf\u00e9s, mobile telephony, satellite and cable TV broadcasting networks. These are new trends in the overall mass media landscape. Yet the new sources of information and communication channels remain concentrated in the central and urban areas, particularly in the capital of Vientiane.

Print media has a narrow circulation with a targeted audience, predominantly the urban elite. According to the UNDP Lao Country Office Project Document on Khoun Community Radio Support, the most widely circulated daily newspaper in Lao PDR is Pasaxon (The People) with a circulation of about 6,000 copies a day. A number of special interest periodicals are affiliated with government organizations, mass organizations and associations, including Heng Ngaan or Labor, Sinxay or Sinxay Cultural Club and Menhing Lao or Lao Women.36 Overall, there are some 60 publications, including daily and 35 United Nations Development Programme, National Human Development Report Lao PDR 2001: Advancing Rural Development (UNDP, Vientiane, 2001) available at http://www.undplao.org/whatwedo/factsheets/humandev/ nhdr%20final.pdf (accessed on 30 November 2009) 36 Government of Lao PDR and UNDP Lao PDR, Khoun Radio Support Project: Bringing local news to local people in Xieng Khoung, February 2006. 26 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR weekly newspapers, monthly and quarterly magazines, and journals and news bulletins on a wide range of issues such as trade, tourism, lifestyle and entertainment. Most of them have a limited circulation, averaging 3,000 copies a day due to a relatively small market size in the country.37 Radio Radio is one of the most influential media in Lao PDR. Over 80 percent of the population of 6.3 million people has access to radio. A survey conducted in Luang Prabang and Savannakhet on the reach of radio concluded that radio is the only medium that many people have in their households and that it has also reached a number of people who are not necessarily Lao native speakers.38 As radio is based on verbal communication, it thereby draws on a strong oral tradition in Lao PDR. Radio has proven to be an effective medium of communication, particularly among the poor and those who have limited literacy skills. Radio can also usefully integrate traditional media, such as folk tales and songs practiced by rural communities, into broadcasting formats. Currently, the country has 32 radio stations. Lao National Radio is the main service provider with 70 percent coverage. The remaining 31 stations are regional and provincial stations with varied transmission power. Provincial radio stations have their own editorial and technical broadcasting that produce the local programmes, while local stations broadcast from 5 hours to 12 hours per day. Provincial radio does not reach all districts, leaving pockets of communities in mountainous terrain unreached. Most programmes are still broadcast in the national language. A number of local programmes are translated into major ethnic languages such as Hmong and Khmou. While the local language programmes are needed to ensure outreach of national broadcasting to the population at large, these programmes do not necessarily respond to the information or communication needs of people in rural areas. Radio programmes in ethnic languages that provide information, knowledge and entertainment targeted towards people living in remote areas with limited access to information are much needed. Television After radio, television is widely regarded as the second most popular electronic media in Lao PDR. The state-run Lao National TV and Laos Television 3, a joint venture with a Thai company, are the two main local broadcasters. The television programmes are broadcast in three languages: Lao, French and Vietnamese. According to 2001 statistics, there were 3,000 subscribers to satellite and cable televisions. Approximately 50 percent of the total Lao population has access to television, predominantly in the central and urban areas. Nevertheless, the largest percentage increases of Lao households with television over the recent years were in rural areas. These were areas in the North without all-season roads, in the districts bordering Viet Nam, in minority districts and in first and second priority poverty districts. The population living closer to Thailand\u2019s border can access Thai TV programmes. Most viewers watch both Thai and Lao TV programmes. Lao National TV is watched mainly for news and Thai TV programmes for entertainment, particularly for Thai dramas, or \u2018soap operas\u2019, and also for news. For instance, farmers interviewed in Champasak reported they were learning a lot from Thai programmes on agriculture and new production techniques. Overall, 64 percent of the people interviewed in Vientiane, Pakse and rural Champasak watched mainly Thai TV, 27 percent watched both equally, and only 9 percent watched mainly Lao TV programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a30c33-8351-49c1-bca8-e10ee0db6771": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a30c33-8351-49c1-bca8-e10ee0db6771", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95ecd457d16ced2b366a3f61627ae42917e2de2ec39883ef5b1778dfba3a4f9e"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c95a4c7-d928-4a29-97d0-5ff1e69f0c43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52517dd43b1a6c1be4c534c08f279edbd5bf1e1482341354e88e719f51c7e56f"}}, "hash": "339dbb8aa91a826e973b1e7c9a2806f3af090dd192583d858d498375d5fc456b", "text": "Some 68 percent watched Thai soap operas regularly, particularly women and young people.39 Foreign media Despite a growing demand for new sources of information, the mass media in Lao PDR continues to face intense competition from media of neighbouring countries such as China, Thailand and 37 Southeast Asian Press Alliance, The State of the Press in Southeast Asia, May", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa1e4b4a-29eb-4da2-9c58-dad203826251": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa1e4b4a-29eb-4da2-9c58-dad203826251", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "043a457a154512c3e93d5a4a73b8a938544dfa04dd9a46be65f66a5c69e8a181"}, "3": {"node_id": "28df7379-4654-4bcf-8577-1169bf12f628", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42169abfdac4d592ed7519d38ce6d3812d7bdbfd076602297be7d24155ca12c5"}}, "hash": "866f89e55e6dc201d6ee9734f3244eab254cdfa0e940b9438b7a7fe5246c0fe8", "text": "2008, p. 24. 38 Wolfgang Koch, Most Important Results, Conclusions and Recommendations on Two Radio Audience Research Projects in Luang Prabang and Savannakhet in 2006 (Vientiane, UNICEF, 2006). 39 UNDP, National Human Development Report International Trade and Human Development Lao PDR 2006, available at http://www.nsc.gov.la/Products/NHDR%202006/NHDR2006_Eng.pdf 27 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Viet Nam. Due to similarities in the language, many Laotians are able to consume Thai TV and radio programmes. While Lao PDR has limited number of radio and TV programmes in ethnic languages, certain Chinese radio programmes are able to broadcast in three languages, including Lao Loum, Hmong and Khmou.40 The foreign media has a more competitive advantage in terms of resources, professionalism and modern entertainment and information systems that are more attractive to the larger audience than the mass media produced in Lao PDR. Media Policy and Regulations The role of media in Lao modern history has mainly focused on promoting public policies to the people as well as enhancing national unity in the multiethnic Lao society. However, over the past decades, as the country has been going through a transition towards more openness, increasing diversity in the media landscape has followed. The gradual change of the political climate provides an enabling environment for Lao policy makers to redefine the role and functions of state mechanisms to strengthen accountability, transparency and integrity in the governance system. The government adopted a governance reform agenda in 2003 with the following priority areas:41 y Strengthening bureaucracy; y Increasing people\u2019s participation; y Adhering to the rule of law; and y Sound management of the country\u2019s finances and resources. The overall framework for the governance reform agenda in Lao PDR, the Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Government Issues, recognizes that access to information and professional media are critical for improving accountability and transparency in governance. The creation of \u201cfora to permit a participatory debate on transparent and accountable government and the promotion of ethics in the public service, involving participants from civil society, the media and the private sector\u201d is mentioned as a priority governance initiative.42 As part of this changing political and social context, the Lao media has also gradually changed its traditional role in providing a predominant one-way flow of information. Since 2005, the Ministry of Information and Culture has adopted a strategy to bring radio to the 47 poorest districts in the country.43 Increasing the available information and communication channels allows for a multi-directional flow of information and expanded media coverage in Lao PDR, which can help to address issues of poverty reduction and socio-economic development, including basic social services such as health and education. Recent development of the media law The 1991 constitution of Lao PDR includes a basic legal framework for development of participatory media practices. This is further elaborated in the National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006- 2010, which provides a basis for collaboration with government in designing and implementing more interactive development-oriented media channels. In addition, NSEDP 2006-2010 provides a commitment to aiding access to information for ethnic peoples, in particular recognizing the need for media in applicable languages. The Ministry of Information and Culture led the drafting process of a new mass media law. After several years of deliberation, the media law was adopted in 2008. The law, presented by MoIC, consists of ten chapters and 64 articles that determine the roles, principles, responsibilities, duties and activities of foreign as well as domestic media. Furthermore, it provides journalists with a 40 NRA, Minutes from NRA TWG MRE Workshop, 6 June 2007 (Vientiane, NRA, June 2007). 41 Government of Lao PDR, Public Service Reform, People\u2019s Participation, Rule of Law and Sound Financial Management: Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Governance Issues, Vientiane, March 2003. 42 Ibid., pp.14-15. 43 Report on the National Community Radio Seminar 1-2 November 2007 Novotel Hotel Vientiane, Lao PDR. 28 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR formal mandate and protection to report and criticize abuses such as corruption, low morals or drug abuse.44 It allows for the ownership of media by the private sector as well as associations.

Media capacity Despite these positive trends, Lao media still faces serious resource and capacity constraints in delivering quality public information, particularly in the provincial and district areas. Production and broadcast equipment is largely outdated. Technical support is required to improve equipment as well as the operation of media in Lao PDR. This includes increasing demand for training of media professionals, such as writing, interviewing, editorial, media management and marketing skills. Moreover, the top-down approach among editors and media managers and limited journalism skills are major obstacles hindering the mass media from enhancing their outreach to a wider range of audiences or competing with foreign media. Ethnic Peoples in the Media Mainstream media reporting predominantly focuses on the events and issues related to the national capital. Though the print press has done some investigative reporting, according to Lao journalists, there is very limited coverage on issues concerning ethnic peoples. Media reporting mostly targets the information needs of government officials and urban elites, who are the main audience and subscribers of the mainstream media.45 In this regard, the Lao National Radio both at central and provincial levels is an exception because it has ethnic language windows that enjoy considerable popularity. However, they are in essence translations of mainstream programming; resources for community based programming are still very scarce. Examples of Participatory Communication Channels for Ethnic Peoples Khoun Community Radio for Development46 UNDP has supported the piloting of community radio in Lao PDR and helped to establish the first station in Khoun District. Khoun has a population of 31,000 people belonging to three ethnic groups. The district is among the country\u2019s 47 poorest and is targeted for priority support under the National Socio-Economic Development Plan. The Khoun Community Radio for Development project was supported by UNDP in partnership with UNESCO under the auspices of MoIC. The South-South cooperation played an important part in developing a Lao model for community radio. Exposure visits to community radio stations in neighbouring Thailand provided useful points of reference and helped stakeholders acquire an understanding of key concepts as well as skills to be able to drive the project early on. It is generally maintained that there is not one model of community radio. Rather, community radio should always be an expression and a reflection of a community\u2019s culture, history and concerns and dreams. Many aspects of the Khoun Community Radio had to be adapted in light of the cultural, social and political context of Lao PDR. This was done by the stakeholders of the project in an iterative process of learning, testing, assessing and formalizing. 44 Mass Media Law 2008, the unofficial translation of the draft that was passed to the National Assembly for consideration. The final draft was not yet available when this paper was written. 45 Matthias Meier, Empowering Indigenous Peoples in Asia through Communication, op. cit., p. 28. 46 Ibid., pp. 30-31. 29 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR The Khoun Community Radio for Development project aims to establish a local radio station in the Khoun district.47 The main objective of this project is to provide a platform to enhance voice and participation of the local community through discussion of issues-related development challenges and solutions. Furthermore, the project promotes training of public information officers at provincial and district levels and conducts an audience survey of information needs and demands from the local community.48 Currently, the radio broadcasts for eight hours every day in three languages: Hmong, Khmou and Lao. The programmes cover a wide range of topics, including education, health, agriculture, women, youth, culture, law and security, community announcements and entertainment. The radio also relays national news. Khoun Community Radio officially went on air in October 2007. Since then, it has gained an enthusiastic audience who frequently interact with programme-makers. More than 7,000 phone- ins and more than 3,000 letters from listeners have been received since its inception, containing hundreds of poems and community announcements, primarily in ethnic languages. Establishment of pilot district radio station: Ta-Oi Radio49 The first community radio station in Lao PDR was set up by Oxfam with the support from UNESCO in Ta Oi district, Saravane Province. Ta Oi radio went on air in November 2005. This district contains 21,000 people living in 56 villages, of which 35 are classified as the poorest villages. The languages that are used in the programme are Mon-Khmer languages such as Katang and Ta Oi. A second community radio station was established in Samouai district. The radio stations were set up to broadcast in five ethnic minority languages: Kado, Kanai, Katang, Pako and Ta Oi.

The transmission coverage of Samouai radio station was much broader and went beyond the district boundaries, reaching more than 10,000 people of 51 villages, representing 91 percent of the district population. Some villages in Viet Nam were also able to receive broadcasts from Samouai radio. Each community radio station has a Board Committee of eight members presided over by the Vice District Governor to ensure the accuracy and usefulness of information delivered to the communities. The Committee is composed of representatives from mass organizations, including Lao Women\u2019s Union, Lao Revolutionary Youth Organization and LFNC. Despite this progress, assessment of the Oxfam\u2019 initiative concludes that operation of these community radio stations is not sustainable due to limited resources and capacity, including the lack of qualified human resources and insufficient coordination at the district and provincial levels. Overview of ICT and Telecommunication Landscape Lao PDR has made a significant progress in developing its ICT and telecommunication sector over the past decades, including introduction of joint venture private investment, infrastructure development, and the new telecommunication law adopted in 2001. Nevertheless, the country continues to face a number of challenges in its efforts to expand the ICT and telecommunication services for the majority of its population, particularly in remote rural areas. The use of ICT is limited both in the public and private sectors. Few Laotians have access to computers or the Internet and less than 2 percent of Laotian households have a fixed telephone. 47 Khoun is among the 47 poorest districts identified in the NGPES for priority support. 48 United Nations Development Programme, Khoun Radio Support Project Document (UNDP, Lao PDR, February 2006). 49 UNESCO, International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC), Implementation Reports on Projects Approved and Financed in 2004-2005, 23 February 2006 and UNESCO news service available at http:// portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21254&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html 30 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR The usage of mobile phones among the Laotian population has expanded rapidly since 2000. Nevertheless, only 12.8 percent of the Lao population had a mobile phone in 2007-2008.50 Though there are a number of internet caf\u00e9s in Lao PDR, most of them are concentrated in Vientiane and major cities.51 Therefore, the majority of the population living in rural areas have less access to ICT than those living in the urban and central areas. Telecommunication In Lao PDR, the telecommunication sector continues to grow as a result of public and private investment in the new and existing telecommunication networks across the country. According to the Digital Review of Asia Pacific 2007-2008, Lao PDR has a rigorous programme to enhance the national information infrastructure based on optical fibre. At least 15 out of 17 provinces are already connected and operable. The national fibre backbone is already being used for domestic telecommunication both fixed and mobile as well as for international Internet access. Nevertheless, the domestic part of the Internet is still under-developed.52 Currently, the former state monopoly, Laotel (LTC) and Enterprise of Telecom Lao (ETL) are the two leading players in providing the telecommunication network infrastructure. Other operators include Lao Asia Telecom (LAT) owned by the army and Sky Telecom (LAT). These companies provide all types of telecommunication services, including international gateway, fixed line, mobile telephone, and Internet.53 Mobile telephone services, including VoIP, are provided by Millicom Lao, a joint venture between the Luxembourg-based company Millicom International Cellular and the government.. All of the telecom companies in Lao PDR have some share of state ownership.

One of the main reasons is that the relevant applications for ethnic groups have not been developed or they are not suitable for the needs of the users in remote rural areas. In addition, low economic interest in rural telecommunication services and applications, including financial sustainability, is a key challenge that prevents these services from taking off in the remote rural areas. ICT services and internet Lao PDR was one the last Southeast Asian countries to adopt the Internet. Since 1996 it has enjoyed internet connectivity, but the average usage remains low. Currently, 12 companies, including five telecom operators, have been granted Internet Service Provider (ISP) licenses. Nevertheless, most of the companies run into trouble with the marketing plan and capacity to set up their own internet infrastructure. Over 50 percent of the existing 300 internet caf\u00e9s are in Vientiane. The rest are located in other cities, such as Luang Prabang.54 50 ITU, Country Report on ICT Statistics: Lao PDR, Capacity Building Workshop on Information Society Statistics, Bangkok 6-8 November, 2007. 51 See, UNDP Human Development Indicator 2007/8, available at http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/ cty_ds_LAO.html (accessed on August 20, 2009). 52 Phonpasit Phissarnay, \u201cLao PDR Chapter\u201d, Digital review of Asia Pacific 2007-2008, available at www.digital-review.org 53 Ibid. 54 Ibid. 31 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Recent trends demonstrate that internet usage has continued to increase steadily in Lao PDR. The usage is largely concentrated on chatting and entertainment. Currently about 25,000 people, or 0.4 percent of the total population, are regular internet users, most being students and government officers.55 Most young Laotians and student have access to the internet at internet caf\u00e9s. The internet access that is available at the country\u2019s universities and college is mostly reserved for the faculty and administration. Therefore, use of the internet for education and research, including information and communication exchange, is still limited. Compared to the mass media, the internet is still relatively unregulated. The government monitors e-mails and requests that existing internet service providers submit quarterly reports as well as connect to governmental gateways in order to accommodate the government monitoring system. However, the government\u2019s ability to control the information and communication flows via internet is limited. At present, Inlaonet and Laoupdate are two major local online forums that are popular among students. These two websites allow the exchange of views and commentaries on current affairs and common social challenges with an occasional focus on news reports, but not on politically sensitive issues.56 Apart from these two online social forums, LaoFab provides a forum for sharing information about farmers and agriculture in the country, while Lao44 offers general knowledge-based information in Lao language. ICT Policy and Regulations The ICT sector in Lao PDR is still lagging behind that of its neighbouring countries. ICT is making slow progress compared to other sectors because the ICT and telecommunication sectors have not been identified as priority programmes for national development; more emphasis has been placed on the development of basic infrastructure. The government recognizes that ICT is essential to the country\u2019s overall social and economic growth and development and that it is necessary to increase ICT service penetration to the levels that are available among Lao PDR\u2019s regional neighbours and major trading partners. Although telecommunications have second priority status to roads, water and electrical power, Lao PDR has an aggressive programme to establish a national information infrastructure based on fibre optics. As part of the country\u2019s aspiration to enhance sustainable development and progress beyond the LDC status by 2020, the government outlines key ICT policy priorities as follows:57 y Increasing general access to ICT through the provision of a modern telecommunications infrastructure and computer networks, by fostering enterprise and industry; y Promoting research and development in ICT; y Developing the necessary human resources and institutional capacities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc35fdf7-2bd0-47b9-a6d1-a6ba2e3fe61c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc35fdf7-2bd0-47b9-a6d1-a6ba2e3fe61c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "609c79e54c955d5542a2e487a0ee0a0e844379094871c9c87d009f82710b97ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "13eb188b-46e8-45b5-b989-3edeed2b18f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64b114570a480483412c4ac533763a37eb9b53a3237168577b4cec14a1925951"}}, "hash": "c70f78299ba44c317dea85f23234d9a3b1ec0995a03a5a490ec8357a6a2fc195", "text": "As for the telecommunication sector, the government\u2019s key policy objectives are to:58 y Develop the national telecommunication infrastructure especially in regional and remote areas of the country; y Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of telecommunication service delivery that responses to the demands of the end user; y Promote quality services at affordable prices; y Strengthen regulatory framework and skills among the government officials.

This network infrastructure will be used to deliver public services to provide connectivity to 17 provincial offices, 141 district offices and 1,200 village administration offices. Depending on the current state of this network infrastructure and the geographic areas and terrain condition, the plan is to introduce a combination of a traditional land line and wireless technologies to develop a cost-effective solution for rural communities. This way, according to one observer, \u201cthe current digital divide can be bridged and e-Government programmes and services can be brought closer to the rural communities.\u201d59 This vision will require that other important conditions are taken into account at the same time, such as language diversity, illiteracy and lack of content in local languages. Legal and regulatory environment for ICT In the past, the Science Technology and Environment Agency (STEA), the Lao National Internet Committee (LANIC) and the Ministry of Communication, Post and Construction (MCTPC) were the key players in the policy and legislative process for the ICT and telecommunication sector in Lao PDR. These organizations had some overlapping roles and responsibilities. Reform of the ICT sector, including structural changes, has started to take place in order to promote greater coordination among government agencies. To promote sustainable development of the ICT and telecommunication sector in Lao PDR, the National Authority of Science and Technology (NAST) and National Authority of Post and Telecommunications (NAPT) are the two main organizations currently responsible for the legal and regulatory environment for ICT and telecommunication at the national level. NAST has a supporting and coordinating function to promote science and technology activities, including implementation and translation of policies into specific action. In 2007, NAPT was established under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.60 It is directly responsible for formulating long term policies, strategies and plans for the ICT and telecommunication sector in Lao PDR. This includes the following:61 y Issuing licenses for post and telecom operators; y Overseeing and coordinating the licenses of radio and telephone; y Monitoring investment in telecom equipment and production; y Maintaining the standard of post and telecommunication services; y Coordinating with international and regional organizations, e.g. ASEAN, ITU, etc. The ICT policies focus on the following objectives to: y Increase access to ICT particularly in the underserved regional areas and communities; y Ensure efficient use of resources; y Create an enabling environment for adoption of new technologies; y Eliminate obstacles to competition and anti-competitive practices; y Promote foreign investment; y Develop ICT skills and competencies in government, industry and society; y Enhance the availability of services at affordable prices.

In connection to this, ICT could be a tool for networking ability, which has a wide outreach across all physical barriers. Simultaneously, it can strengthen and transform existing radio initiatives, for instance the introduction of \u2018radio browsing\u2019 to the community radio in Khoun. This particular aspect of ICT can be essential particularly for the ethnic peoples. Infrastructure provides opportunities for expanding ICT services. Rural ICTs Initiatives Over the past decade, there have been a few ICT initiatives in remote and rural areas, including the telecentres and rural ICT projects in Lao PDR. The Jhai Foundation, for example, launched a pilot project to establish internet learning centres as well as the Remote IT Villages project, where power for a computer was generated through pedal power and internet access was achieved via satellite connection. This project primarily focused on bringing internet to the poor and on pure ICT training, as opposed to implementation of ICT as a tool for accelerating an existing developing strategy and poverty reduction. There is one exceptional case of a Jhai Foundation coffee project that utilized the internet for linking coffee farmers directly with business opportunities in California. This initiative helped villages to create 51 village coffee cooperatives.64 ICT for basic service delivery The use of ICT could have a significant impact on promoting efficiency and accelerating improvement of basic services delivery at the local level to meet the needs of the poorest populations in Lao PDR. Through direct involvement of communities, ICT can become a tool for relevant basic service delivery and effective poverty reduction.65 62 Lars Bestle, Improving basic social service delivery with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in rural areas of the Mekong Region: A preliminary assessment of needs, readiness and possibilities in Cambodia Lao PDR and Viet Nam, Asian Development Bank, June 2004, pp. 82-83. 63 The Declaration of the Global Forum of Indigenous Peoples and the Information Society (Geneva, 11 December 2003), available at http://www.worldsummit2003.de/download_en/indigenous-Declaration.rtf (accessed on December 2009) 64 See Jhai Foundation website available at http://www.jhai.org 65 Lars Bestle, Improving basic social service delivery with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in rural areas of the Mekong Region: A preliminary assessment of needs, readiness and possibilities in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam, op. cit. 34 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Healthcare is one of the most promising areas to gain from ICT support for poverty reduction. Currently, health authorities in Lao PDR have not been able to benefit from ICT due to limited awareness and funding as well as the incoherent focus and objectives of the official health strategy. ICT could be incorporated as an integral part of healthcare services. Recommended areas include: 66 y Primary health care centres: Information access through ICT services in primary health care centres would enhance the general knowledge of health workers and enable remote consultation; y Prevention through campaigns: An important component of health care is about communicating with the population, making them aware of daily measures that can prevent simple illnesses and heighten general health. One example is the recent pilot ICT project for primary healthcare launched by ADB in partnership with the Government of Lao PDR in 2008. The project examined the potential development of e-Centres in rural health facilities with the vision to expand health services in the eight Northern provinces. Objectives of the e-centre are to provide relevant skill trainings for rural health workers and communities through e-Health services, develop practical health information, build local capacity in ICT use and sustainable operation of e-Centres in rural communities, and monitor and evaluate outcomes.67 Similarly to the health sector, agriculture is essential for the survival of rural communities in Lao PDR, and ICT could also deliver useful and relevant information in this sector. ICT could transmit farming techniques, agricultural market information, marketing of agricultural products, weather reports and disaster prevention.

A multi-purpose community telecentre was launched as a pilot project in Luang Prabang in March 2003. It provided ICT services that improved the basic ICT skills in the education sector for school and college students and to a certain extent in the local government sector. The services were not able to extend to the rural areas as originally envisaged. Experience showed that the project had little relevance to improve ICT access and skills of local businesses and the general public during the timeframe of the project implementation. The community telecentre provided internet services, but only for a short period of time due to financial constraints and the lack of locally- needed content in Lao language.68 Lessons learned from the pilot telecentre include the need to focus on human resource development and develop better collaboration and partnerships among key stakeholders, including central and local governments, schools, businesses and local communities. Furthermore, there is also a need for a clear development strategy beyond ICT training and internet access in the rural areas. Recent development of rural communication system In September 2007, a number of Lao government officials and international experts were brought together to analyse the rural communication system in Lao PDR. Strong emphasis was placed on the need to establish information centres at all levels and to develop content in local languages. 66 Ibid. 67 ADB, Lao PDR: Piloting Community e-Centres for Better Health, Technical Assistant Report, January 2008. 68 Phonpasit Phissamay, Case Study on the First Telecenter in Lao PDR, Information Technology Centre, Science and Technology Agency, September 2007. 35 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Another critical area, which has been identified as a key challenge in the rural communication system, is the limited number of opportunities for sharing and exchange experiences among development workers in Lao PDR. These development workers are usually isolated by geographical and institutional barriers that prevent them from learning from one another. Though the mechanisms for vertical communication are in place, there are almost no means for horizontal communication among development workers from different organizations and sectors. In order to address these problems, the concept of the Coalition for Lao Information, Communication and Knowledge (CLICK) was recently developed. The strategy of CLICK is to make relevant information openly available in Lao languages via the internet. The internet was proposed as a tool because it is as close as possible to a free and instant distribution system that connects to immense storage capacity and transcends geographical and institutional barriers. Although the internet has not yet been able to bring the information directly to the rural and ethnic peoples in Lao PDR, it can generate information for a growing portion of the development workers who are in direct contact with rural communities and ethnic groups. These people currently use a number of communication methods, including group meetings, drama and local radio, which can have a major impact on the knowledge of rural people if relevant content is available.69 Key Challenges and Opportunities for Ethnic Peoples in Media and ICT Communications, voice and representation In conclusion, the study sheds new light on a number of key challenges to effective communication channels to enhance public participation and social inclusion in governance and development processes. Based on the analysis of this chapter, key challenges and opportunities have been identified at various levels, including national policy and legal framework, infrastructure, capacity development and implementation. Challenges y Policy and legislation: Despite the positive trends of new policies and legislations for more open media environment and sustainable development of ICT, the legal environment for inclusive media and rural ICTs remains equivocal. The government still maintains the authority to monitor, audit and discipline journalists and the new media outlets for any misconduct. Furthermore, greater coordination among government agencies and organizations is required to enhance the provision of services for ethnic peoples and those living in rural areas. y Limited media and communication outreach in remote and rural areas: Despite positive changes in the overall media landscape, new information and communication channels are largely concentrated in larger cities, except the Lao National Radio (LNR), which broadcasts in three main languages and reaches the majority of the population. Besides LNR, ethnic peoples have limited opportunities to access information, particularly in print media due to narrow circulation and limited coverage of issues related to ethnic peoples. y Resource and capacity constraints: Outdated equipment and limited human resources are major challenges to promoting access to information and communication channels for ethnic groups. Skilled human resources at all levels are vital and needed in order for Lao PDR to expand its networked communication", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d51c0261-fde4-4fdb-acc9-6f3908b2898e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d51c0261-fde4-4fdb-acc9-6f3908b2898e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "514ce05e721a75d571c9e0091f5ac97c59f373b97bf9c7aa39c2d6efea1b2203"}}, "hash": "514ce05e721a75d571c9e0091f5ac97c59f373b97bf9c7aa39c2d6efea1b2203", "text": "environment, content and ICT applications for development and inclusion, particularly in rural and remote areas. y Relevant information and media content: There are some serious gaps in providing relevant information and content for ethnic groups based on their needs and interests. Similarly, limited content in ethnic languages via suitable communication means continues to be a major obstacle to raising public awareness about how to use new media and ICT to improve quality of life. 69 See, LaoLink the online technical forum in Lao language which was jointly established by the National Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service (NAFES) and National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), http:// laolink.org 36 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR y Implementation of ICT as a means for development: Another challenge is ability to strategically tap new opportunities for utilizing information and communication as an active resource for development through the means of technology. Currently, the ICT and telecommunication services in Lao PDR have little relevance to the vast majority of the rural population, including ethnic groups. This is because current services and applications are not suitable for needs of the users in remote rural areas. Opportunities y Changes in political climate and the new legal framework: Changes in the political climate over the past decade provide an enabling environment to enhance social inclusion and accountability through increasing participation and broadening access and utilization of information and communication channels, particularly for ethnic peoples. A new media law was adopted by the government in 2008. This provides greater opportunities for mass media to continue to enhance its role. Furthermore, the government recognizes that access to information and professional media are critical to improve governance in Lao PDR. The NSEDP 2006-2010 stated its commitment to promote access to information for ethnic peoples, with particular attention to the need for media in ethnic languages. Simultaneously, the government\u2019s recognition of the importance of ICT and telecommunication as a means for rural development has been reflected in national development plans and strategies for rural development and poverty reduction, providing a useful entry point for action at the present time within the timeframe of the current NSEDP. y Infrastructure for ICT and telecommunication: Lao PDR has a rigorous programme to enhance the national information infrastructure based on fibre-optics. This fibre-optic backbone provides outstanding opportunities for the country to take advantage of this conduit for high speed data and information exchange. The outreach of broadband infrastructure to provincial and district level provides opportunities for media and ICT convergence, if appropriate media and ICT outlets targeting ethnic peoples are piloted. y Integration of traditional media and contemporary means of communications: Community radio is based on a strong oral tradition in Lao PDR and could be an effective medium of communication, especially among the poor and ethnic peoples who have limited literacy skills. It could also help promote access to information for those living in remote rural areas through integration of traditional media with new media (e.g. internet, wireless and mobile telephony) into new community based and interactive radio programming formats. y The presence of young Laotians with ICT experience: The young urban generation of the Lao population will drive ICT development of the country due to their experience with new ICTs as well as their increasing exposure to and connection with other countries such as Thailand and the Laotian Diaspora. By enabling youth with better ICT access and by encouraging their involvement in media (particularly ethnic youth in rural and remote areas), Lao PDR can benefit greatly from this presently underutilized human resource base. y Recent trends in participatory communication channels: Pilot community radio projects are closely link to the Communication for Empowerment (C4E) agenda, which is based on a more comprehensive approach to strengthen governance and inclusive participation. Pilots such as the Ta Oi station supported by Oxfam and the Khoun Community Radio project of UNDP and UNESCO exemplify recent trends. They also demonstrate opportunities to expand media outreach to marginalized and vulnerable populations in rural areas, especially ethnic peoples. These community radio stations provide crucial sources of information and, despite the limited number of two-way formats, they also serve as communication channels for the ethnic people to raise issues related to development challenges and solutions at the local level. As the new CSO law opens up for local associations to work for ethnic development and knowledge sharing, these radio stations will serve as important vehicles for beginning a collaboration between CSO and community radio, thereby enhancing civic engagement and systematization of ethnic voices in the media. y New technologies for communications: Overcoming the communication challenges highlighted above will involve utilizing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "681a5304-f029-4e55-9755-af36715fd383": {"__data__": {"id_": "681a5304-f029-4e55-9755-af36715fd383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b775bd494454304f0ba51dda053686830b1091b3d043c0952d5ddfe7b39c623f"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab1c2189-8c5f-4679-9695-2884e9ce04bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cad637de9b61889d3f5a7d447ef2ebf0becdb36e4b8f5abdd0b0b3487160dc03"}}, "hash": "34b1d1840e1e4fc5e784089b80643f16f0b8c7f07f5180721f419691974195b0", "text": "new and emerging wireless and mobile technologies that are less 37 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR sensitive to distance and topography. These technologies can deliver information in a simple and logical format with particular attention to the development needs and opportunities for ethnic peoples. Mobile telephony has in Lao PDR, as in most other developing countries, experienced a dramatic increase in its penetration among all levels of society due to liberalization in the telecom sector, cheaper hand-sets and introduction of pre-paid services. Further cost reductions will appear in the coming years and telecoms will continue to become more innovative in service and application development in order to penetrate new markets. This trend might become the single most important development in terms of expanding the communicative space for ethnic development and mitigation of their isolation from societal and economic development. 38 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR \u00a9 Roger Harris 39 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR 3. Communication for Empowerment Field Study 40 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR 3. Communication for Empowerment Field Study The methodology for assessing information and communication needs, challenges and opportunities for ethnic peoples aims to complement the national overview study from the perspective of ethnic peoples in Lao PDR. The purpose of the field research is not to provide a representative map of information and communication needs for ethnic peoples in Lao PDR. Rather, findings from the field research in selected districts offer a means of verification to gather evidence and direct experiences of ethnic peoples through participation and involvement of ethnic communities in the research process as the ultimate end-beneficiaries of the C4E process. While data collected from field-level research are not representative for the whole country, the analysis and recommendations generated from field data from three districts are, through extrapolation, applicable to most locations within Lao PDR. In addition, community-level research will help to improve the overall research methodology for national C4E studies to be conducted in other countries. Field Research Methodology The national overview study generates key analysis based on national-level data and information that was collected through secondary sources and interviews with key resource people in the capital of Vientiane. The field study also generates analysis through community level research based on information and data gathered through household surveys and qualitative interviews with ethnic peoples. Site visits were required to conduct field research focusing on development challenges and aspirations of communities to overcome these challenges, particularly the current and potential role of information and communications in promoting the voices and participation of ethnic peoples. Location of districts Field research was conducted as a complement to the findings of national-level research. Research tools consisted of household surveys, structured focus group discussions, individual and household interviews as well as interviews with local officials. Locations for field research were identified during a scoping mission and were selected through consensus with participating stakeholders. Field research was conducted in three locations: Nga District of Oudomxai Province in northern Laos, Khoun District of Xieng Khouang Province in central Laos, and Dakcheung District in Sekong Province of Southern Laos. Map 5 indicates these locations. They were selected as a sample and are not necessarily considered as representative of the ethnic peoples of the whole of Lao PDR. Nevertheless, the selection of locations was intended to demonstrate the diversity in ethnicity, a geographical spread and differences in levels of poverty between more and less remote communities. All locations were required to be classified among the poorest 47 districts in the country. Nga District in Oudomxai Province was chosen as it is the site of the Oudomxay Community Initiative Support Project (OCISP). The project promotes rural development in the midland and upland populations of the province, through community development, agricultural development and natural resources development, rural financial services, rural infrastructure development and institutional strengthening. The intention was for the C4E project to assess the extent to which improved access to media and communication channels might be used to reinforce the activities of OCISP and overcome development challenges faced by ethnic peoples in Lao PDR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab1c2189-8c5f-4679-9695-2884e9ce04bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab1c2189-8c5f-4679-9695-2884e9ce04bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b775bd494454304f0ba51dda053686830b1091b3d043c0952d5ddfe7b39c623f"}, "2": {"node_id": "681a5304-f029-4e55-9755-af36715fd383", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34b1d1840e1e4fc5e784089b80643f16f0b8c7f07f5180721f419691974195b0"}}, "hash": "cad637de9b61889d3f5a7d447ef2ebf0becdb36e4b8f5abdd0b0b3487160dc03", "text": "41 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Map 5: Locations of Field Research for C4E Study 50 0 50 100 Miles Phonsali Louang Namtha Bokeo Oudomxai Louang phrabang Xaingbouli Vientiane Xaing Khoang Houaphan Bolikhamxai Khammouan Sawannakhet Salavan Champasak Xekong Attapu Nga District, Oudomxai Province Khoun District, Xaing Khoang Province Dakcheung District, Xekong Province Khoun District of Xieng Khouang Province was chosen as it is the site of the Khoun Community Radio project.

Dakcheung District in Sekong Province was selected as a particularly remote community in Southern Laos and as a balance to the research, being the least served of all the field sites in terms of communications and media. Household survey The purpose of household surveys was to develop a quantitative overview of the community\u2019s use of information, communications and media with relation to its development. A total of 13 villages in the three provinces were visited, yielding 251 household survey responses. The questionnaire format is shown in appendix 1. The questionnaire was translated into Lao and each one was completed during an interview with the householder that was conducted by a Lao-speaking translator assisted at times by a local language speaker. Each interview lasted approximately 45 minutes. Participating households were selected based on the availability of an adult resident at the time of the research team\u2019s visit. Each village headman was notified in advance of the visit. 42 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR In-depth interviews Open-ended and less structured interviews were conducted with individual householders and local officials. The householder interviews generated additional detailed knowledge by delving more deeply than the survey questionnaire but within a necessarily narrower context. Interviews with local officials helped to ascertain contextual information about development and infrastructural issues and activities at the district level, which helped to make sense of the household data and provide context for generating suitable proposals for potential interventions. Focus group discussions Focus group discussions generated deeper perspectives from suitably selected representative groups in each community. Separate group discussions were conducted wherever possible with different groups, e.g. women, men, farmers and officials. Findings in the Three Districts Nga District in Oudomxai Province Introduction to the district Oudomxay Province, in Northern Lao PDR is one of the poorest in the country. It covers an area of 15,370 km2, of which about 85 percent is mountainous. There are seven districts with 584 villages, 42,400 families and 291,000 people. In Oudomxai Province, the field study was carried out in Nga district, which again is classified among the poorest in the country.

Of the 28,000 people in Nga district, 60 percent are Khmou, 25 percent are Lao Loum and 15 percent are Hmong. There are 68 villages in the district, which is difficult to access because of the mountainous terrain and under-developed road infrastructure. Six particularly remote villages in the district are participating in the construction of a 22 kilometre food-for-work road project that will connect them to each other for the first time in their history. The road will also connect the villages to the district centres and provide them with access to markets and health services. Swidden agriculture is the main livelihood option for the villagers. They also keep livestock and people living along the river build boats. Currently, only 10 villages have electricity. The study was conducted in four villages and the results of the research are depicted in appendix II. In villages in Nga district, many families do not have enough rice to consume for up to half the year. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is planning a joint initiative with UNDP in Nga and Xay districts, in line with the UN reform programme \u201cDelivering as One\u201d. The Joint Sustainable Livelihoods Programme has the primary objective of improving the practical asset base of vulnerable target populations and their resilience to shocks by providing integrated interagency livelihoods support. This programme is expected to bring about increased income and improved food security while preserving the natural resource base, as well as increasing well-being and reduced vulnerability for the villages involved.

Although Oudomxay has only a short international border with China, it is a transit point between China, Viet Nam and Thailand, with a large flow of products. However, only 66 percent of the households have road access in comparison to the Northern regional average of 75 percent and national average of 83 percent. Approximately 85 percent of the population in this province are Khmou. The government is promoting the concept of village clusters (Kum Ban) to facilitate delivery of public services to fewer locations serving wider populations. The main occupations of the population are farming and livestock. Swidden cultivation remains the predominant agricultural practice. The main crop in Oudomxay is corn, especially located in Houn district. Rice is also cultivated in upland areas but the rice production cannot meet the needs of the entire province. Vegetables, fruits and tobacco are also grown. Among the Northern provinces of Lao PDR, Oudomxay has exhibited the highest population growth over the last two decades mainly due to migration from the nearby provinces of Luang Prabang and Phongsaly. Oudomxay province has also been subjected to the highest land area under slash and burn \u00a9 Roger Harris \u00a9 Roger Harris 44 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR agricultural practices in the Northern provinces of Lao PDR. The intensity of occupation and the considerable size of the agricultural plots in many parts of the province indicate high pressure on the land along with low yields per hectare, a combination likely to cause a long-term decline in the productive potential of the uplands for both agriculture and forestry. Several development programmes are in progress in Oudomxay, mostly working in the field of agriculture and livestock farming including; Community Initiatives Support Project (CISP), German Agro Action (GAA), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Helfer Project (Swedish NGO), and Livestock Farmer Support Project (LFSP). There is also a joint programme with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) for social and economic rehabilitation of the former opium poppy growing farmers, the Post Opium Surpass Poverty (PSP) project, which is operating in Oudomxay. Communication situation More than 90 percent of the survey respondents reported illiteracy in their own language and 50 percent in the national language. Radio is the most prevalent communication channel, as reported by 65 percent of the households in the survey. Only two households reported a mobile phone. Radio and the loudspeaker are the most trusted channels and also regarded as the most useful, along with word-of-mouth, but all channels are deemed useful. Radio also rates the highest in terms of frequency and quality of coverage of ethnic issues, whereas newspapers were ranked lowest by respondents. More coverage would be welcomed in all channels, but mostly with radio. Opportunities to respond to what is heard and seen are low for all media channels, although highest for loudspeakers. Respondents felt that all channels could better serve their ethnic group, but they favoured radio and loudspeakers above the others. They also felt that both their current development opportunities and potential opportunities were served best by radio and loudspeakers. In these rankings, print media rated the lowest among the various channels of communication. Overwhelmingly, for almost 94 percent of respondents, word-of-mouth is the predominant means of expressing concerns to authorities.. Information and communication needs and challenges During the focus group discussions, the villagers voiced the problems and challenges they faced for developing their communities. Among them, the following issues emerged that have relevance for the improvement of communications and delivery of more and better information; insufficient schooling, poor sanitation, unstable agriculture and loss of forests, poor agricultural skills, and pest damage to crops. Villagers also expressed their desires and priorities for development activities, e.g. a radio station in Khmou language, education and training, improved transportation and irrigation, a health centre, electricity, more animal husbandry, better housing, family planning, enterprise development (especially for women), cultural entertainment, loudspeakers and mobile phones and a wider variety of crops and fruits.

Communications with authorities are arranged by talking with the village head and through village meetings. Khoun District in Xieng Khouang Province Introduction to the district Xieng Khouang Province lies in the North-East of Lao PDR. It has a population of around 220,000. The study was conducted in five villages of Khoun District: Houay Yes, Phia Wath, Phon Nheng, Phoumungmuong and Sam Nhong. Results of the research in these villages are depicted in appendix III.

Respondents were mostly middle-aged, with more than half between the ages of 21 and 40 years, and roughly equal numbers of men and women. Educational achievement is low; the education level did not extend beyond primary for 42 percent of respondents, while a quarter reported no formal education at all. Farming is the predominant occupation, according to more than 90 percent of respondents. Literacy levels are also worrying; almost 50 percent reported no literacy in either their local language or the national language. According to the District Governor, communication in Khoun is rather limited. There are no newspapers or magazines in the more remote rural areas. Lao television is restricted to one channel broadcast from Vientiane so residents mostly watch TV from Thailand. They use their own generators for electricity. Most villages receive Khoun Radio but the reception for the provincial radio is poor. The Governor attributes the success of Khoun radio to the agricultural information and the health information that it broadcasts. Previously, the local administration had to send officials to the villages to disseminate this type of information, but with the radio, this has become 46 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR easier for them. The District Governor noted that traditional customs make it difficult to change behaviour, although this is less true for the younger generation who, for example, have learned to boil water before drinking it. Due to the radio station, it has also become possible for the technical staff of the Agriculture Department to distribute more agricultural information and more projects are coming to this district. Generally, the Governor said, information is provided by the government and then distributed to the villages. Development situation The past decade has been a period of economic liberalization, and Xieng Khouang Province has begun to rehabilitate its road infrastructure, shifting away from a subsistence economy towards a monetary economy and opening up to increased trade. While livestock is a household activity throughout the province, Xieng Khouang is still not self-sufficient in rice production. Xieng Khouang is rated by the Lao Government as one of the areas with the highest rate of poverty and is therefore prioritized by the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) for improvements in agriculture, forestry, education, health and infrastructure, especially rural roads. Most of its territory consists of a plateau with peaks rising to between 2,000 and 3,000 metres above sea level. The plateau is best known as the location of the Plain of Jars, which contains a number of unusual archaeological sites that attract tourists and which are under consideration by UNESCO for World Heritage status. The Xieng Khouang plateau is also renowned for its inventory of unexploded ordinance (UXO) left over from the United States\u2019 bombardment during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Clearing UXO is an ongoing endeavour as it continues to cause injuries and remains an impediment to development, including tourism, as visitors are only safe at a few cleared locations on the Plain of Jars. The UXO problem prevents development of much-needed agricultural land and land needed for vital infrastructure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28e3cea1-a1ed-4967-a34d-3643dce2a663": {"__data__": {"id_": "28e3cea1-a1ed-4967-a34d-3643dce2a663", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7d941fdcc46ae47dabaa2c4035a958c3c225f50ace2dc05da3c8284eb3c3168"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bff3b39-c39f-482e-9a19-fccc57208fa4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c04186d5783990bc8a3a05096351146e0da160e893c8c25ffa134e9f042a47d"}}, "hash": "a34bd0cca05152427b0a948ac693429b06251da3309c7ba2d03217a219a74d1f", "text": "The UXO problem prevents development of much-needed agricultural land and land needed for vital infrastructure.

Communication situation The survey revealed that among all media channels, radio and mobile phones are the most popular, with ownership in 61 percent and 40 percent of households respectively, with both delivering the most trusted information, and radio perceived as being the most useful. The impact of the Khoun community radio station is clearly indicated in these results. Radio is seen as the media that most often represents ethnic issues and does so better than other channels. Such coverage would be welcomed from most channels, but mostly from radio and television. Despite relatively high access to these popular forms of media, opportunities to respond to what is conveyed on them are not rated highly. Again, radio rates the highest, followed closely by mobile phones, and this bears out the experience of the high volume of phone-ins by listeners to Khoun community radio. Radio is also the most highly rated media in terms of its potential to better serve the ethnic groups and to support their development. In all aspects of the survey relating to use and effectiveness of various media channels, loudspeakers were rated the lowest. Despite the popularity of radio, when respondents asked how they express their concerns to authorities, the majority, 65 percent, indicated word-of-mouth as their preferred means, with radio coming second at 45 percent. Information and communication needs and challenges The focus group discussions with villagers revealed the development activities they desire. Those that carry a component of information provision were dominated by their stated needs for education for the children and for improved skills in weaving, agriculture, enterprise development, health, hygiene, family planning, sanitation and forestry. Given the study findings related to literacy, the short term needs for information can only be satisfied if it is expressed verbally or graphically in the local language. The experience with Khoun community radio is largely positive in this respect and listeners expressed their appreciation of its agricultural and health information broadcasts, as well as the fact that information is local, local messages are free, and information is not dominated by official messages. Listeners would also welcome more local news, more programme variety, agricultural information related to their own area, and increased range of the broadcasts. The radio station has clearly demonstrated its ability to give voice to the communities it serves, leveraging off the spread of mobile phones that are used by listeners to call in messages, comments and queries. Nevertheless, with word-of-mouth remaining as the principal means of expressing concerns to authorities, it seems that the radio station has further potential for acting as the voice of its listeners. Challenges to further use of information and communication in Khoun District include low levels of literacy and education, lack of electricity, lack of skills, poverty and difficult transportation. There seems to be a limited role for mainstream national media, which with the exception of the provincial radio does not reach the villages studied. \u00a9 Roger Harris \u00a9 Roger Harris 48 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Dakcheung District in Sekong Province Introduction to the district The third field study was carried out in Dakcheung District in Sekong Province which is located in the South-East of the country.

Results of the research in these villages are depicted in appendix IV. The findings were drawn from two ethnic groups, Yay and Trieng, with 72 percent of respondents from the Trieng ethnic group. Respondents were mostly middle-aged, with around 60 percent between the ages of 21 and 50 years, and roughly equal numbers of men and women. Educational achievement is low; only 2 percent of respondents advanced beyond primary level and 30 percent reported no formal education at all. Farming is the predominant occupation, reported by 87 percent of respondents. Literacy levels are very low; around 95 percent reported no literacy in their local language with around half reporting moderate or better literacy in the national language. The Head of the Department of Information informed the study that the GPAR project is implementing Village Information Systems and has provided 10 villages with loudspeaker systems and information boards. They have recruited volunteer teams in 20 villages in Tateng District. Village information needs include health and sanitation. They are implementing two community radio stations, in Tateng and Dakcheung districts. The objective of GPAR in Sekong is to improve access to information for the ethnic peoples. The project schedule is from 2007\u20132011. 49 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Development situation Sekong is among the most remote areas of Lao PDR; even some of its largest villages are virtually inaccessible by road for at least six months of the year. The Eastern districts of Dakchung and Kaleum, in particular, are characterized by mostly mountainous terrain that is rugged and difficult to access. This isolation has meant that forest cover, biodiversity and ethnic traditions have changed less in recent years than in other areas in Laos. However, the province has become much less isolated in recent years, with the upgrading of a major road from Pakse, plus two major road projects connecting Sekong to Viet Nam to the East. Remaining forest cover in Sekong Province is high. Government figures classify over 50 percent of the province\u2019s land area as forest. Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade. Sekong is ethnically diverse. Only about 3 percent of the population is ethnic Lao. The majority (97 percent) come from one of at least 14 distinct ethnic minority groups. Among the total Sekong provincial population of 83,000 people, the main ethnic groups are the Alak (21 percent), Katu (20 percent), Trieng (19 percent) and Nge/Krieng (11 percent). Dakcheung district has 86 villages and four ethnic groups: Trieng (46 percent), Yea (35 percent), Trew (20 percent) and Lakang. The local population is predominantly Trieng, of which there are 73,000 in Lao PDR and more than 100,000 in Viet Nam. The Vice District Chief and Co-ordinator of GPAR said that Dakcheung is one of Sekong\u2019s poorest districts and one of the 47 poorest in the country. Before the revolution there were no roads. Incomes are principally obtained from rice and animal husbandry. The predominant local language is Trieng, with Lao being the second most widely spoken.

The frequency of coverage of ethnic issues is perceived to be low for all channels, although when it occurs, it is regarded as representing ethnic groups quite well.

They also reported varying opinions on which media could better serve their ethnic group, with telephones and loudspeakers emerging as those with the most potential. Loudspeakers are also rated highly, along with television and radio, as the media that are currently \u00a9 Roger Harris \u00a9 Roger Harris 50 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR serving their development interests the best, and with loudspeakers rated as having the most potential for serving future development. Overwhelmingly, for 76 percent of households, word- of-mouth is the predominant form of expressing concerns to authorities, with letters coming next, for 25 percent. Information and communication needs and challenges During focus group discussions, residents raised a wide range of development challenges and opportunities. There are many shortages: of land, electricity, education, literacy, health care, clothing, information, transportation, water and money. Villagers also recognized a range of opportunities that would help them overcome these shortages: a primary school, more land for pasture, better exploitation of non-timber forest products, better marketing of their coffee crops, more insecticides, and investment in post-harvest processing of their coffee crops. Villages would appreciate improved road access, a health centre, more latrines, a school agricultural training and a village loudspeaker. Interests in improved flows of information included agricultural, health, natural resources management, family planning, community development and coffee growing. Although the District Office provides limited information assistance, for example on health education, poor communications between villages and the district centre was acknowledged as a serious impediment to further development. Radio and television appear to be used mainly for entertainment purposes. Comparative Analysis of the Three Districts The following table provides a comparative summary of the findings from the three districts. There are significant variations between the districts in levels of education and literacy, but neither parameter extends much beyond 50 percent of the study population. Agriculture also varies somewhat, with Dakcheung standing out as a cash-crop producer. Other marked differences differentiate the district from the other two. Although radio is the most common household communication channel in all three, Dakcheung depicts around half the penetration rate of the others for radio sets. In contrast to the others, mobile phones are more trusted than any other media in Dakcheung and loudspeakers emerge as the most useful form of communication as well as the one with the most potential. It seems clear that Dakcheung, in its isolation, is yet to experience the benefits of radio that, for instance, have been enjoyed in Khoun. It is interesting to note the favourable response to loudspeakers in Dakcheung, which rates the technology significantly higher than the other districts. In all districts, despite the popularity of radio, the concept of two-way communication in so far as it gives a voice to the general population by furnishing them with an opportunity to express their concerns to authorities, is yet to be achieved by any of the media channels.

In addition, local news would be welcomed as well as ethnically-specific cultural entertainment. Challenges The most significant challenge is the low rate of literacy, which restricts the immediate prospects of improvements in information and communications to verbal and visual means. This remains the key obstacle to both the delivery and use of information and communications. Other challenges include lack of electricity, poor health and sanitation, poor access to key infrastructure such as roads and communications70, scarce land availability, difficulties in marketing products, degraded environment, low incomes and poor quality of the agricultural products. In addition, low levels of incomes limit purchasing power of residents contemplating the purchase of household communication devices such as televisions, computers and mobile phones; arrangements for the use of public shared facilities would be indicated in order to make effective use of these devices. Opportunities Given the relatively high level of radio ownership, as well as the popularity of non-Lao language broadcasts for ethnic groups that do not speak Lao, there is a ready opportunity to increase the use of this media to good effect. Additional community radio stations are indicated. Ethnic television broadcasts would also be welcomed, provided arrangements were put in place for community based shared television sets. Loudspeaker systems have emerged with a mixed review in the study; welcomed in some places but less in others. It seems possible that the medium is either popular in the absence of any other (as in Dakcheung) or that it is put to particularly good use there, or both. In any case, there does seem to be a role for this low-cost and simple technology, which can help to overcome the challenges of limited incomes and lack of electricity that impede the further diffusion of other forms of communication. Mainstream national media does not reach the villages studied, with the exception of the provincial radio. Provincial radio satisfies the demand for local language broadcasts, yet the information it provides is less locally focused and less responsive than community radio. Mobile phones demonstrate the most promise in this regard as prices continue to fall and networks extend their reach. They are also less demanding on electricity supplies. 70 Roads are in bad condition and seasonally impassable. 4. Analysis of the Findings from the National Overview Study and Field Research 54 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR 4. Analysis of the Findings from the National Overview Study and Field Research Development Situation for Ethnic Groups Official data point to recent improvements in human development indices for ethnic peoples. It is clear, however, that there is still much to achieve in terms of education, health, food security, the environment, gender equality, agriculture and livelihoods. These areas remain the focus of formal development processes and the study has exposed opportunities for introducing improved communications in their support that will also serve to empower communities towards development that they themselves would welcome. Insofar as poverty is associated with the lack of access to public services, it is evident that rural development in the form of improved services becomes more of a challenge as that access becomes more difficult, as seen in the remote and isolated areas of the country where many ethnic peoples reside. These remote locations suffer most from the least access to communications and would therefore benefit the most from even small improvements. The study indentified problems of poor communications that exacerbate the difficulties involved in addressing ethnic development to the extent that it must take place within the framework of the languages and cultures of the ethnic groups concerned. Given the variety of languages and cultures in Lao PDR, this requirement alone places a huge burden on the development process. With the low literacy rates found among ethnic peoples, written media would not be indicated to assist in this process of communication. Oral communication, however, is more appropriate as it reaches everyone when it is conducted in the language with which the audience is familiar and it is clearly preferred by the ethnic people themselves over other forms of communication. The study notes that the ethnic groups in Lao PDR are largely unorganized, as there are very few organizations representing their interests. Communication within and between the ethnic communities and between them and development officials is further hampered by a scarcity of both ethnic media and non-ethnic (mainstream) media. Moreover, mainstream media seems to pay little attention to ethnic issues and even if it did, the ethnic", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc4b46ca-5c1e-444f-ae08-8cbdaba1ec18": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc4b46ca-5c1e-444f-ae08-8cbdaba1ec18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbfcf9901b9c462a99d143324299a87f5a7ac101223bedf3d09ff11ef65ca53c"}}, "hash": "fbfcf9901b9c462a99d143324299a87f5a7ac101223bedf3d09ff11ef65ca53c", "text": "people have little access to it. An exception is the potential growth of community radio stations, which may be able to help overcome the isolation (both physical and social) suffered by remote communities as well as interactively engaging them in the development process. Communication and Information Needs Research exposed that the ethnic groups experienced problems with their agricultural livelihoods stemming from lack of knowledge and from plant and animal diseases. They could not see any opportunity for inward investment in their agricultural activities. Difficulties with transportation and access to markets as well as adverse terms of trade lessen the potential for enjoying the benefits of any improvements. Schooling for their children is also a major concern, as there are not schools in every village. Local health services are negligible and combined with poor sanitation and water supply, and health is also a major concern. The lack of electricity hinders further development. There is a demand for information on agriculture and enterprise development as well as cultural and environmental information. The people encountered in the research recognized opportunities for development from animal husbandry, handicrafts, and better exploitation of non-timber forest products. The experiences and data of field research indicate that ethnic people in Lao PDR are isolated along several dimensions. They are socially isolated as a result of illiteracy, even in their own language. This tends to cut them off from interaction among their own people living in neighbouring villages as well as from other ethnic peoples living farther afield but who may share a set of common ideals and goals. Many are also physically isolated, living in remote locations with poor or non-existent communications and transportation. Many of the people that participated in this study rarely leave their village. However the single most important form of contact with the world outside is their radio, which can be found in more than half the households and which 55 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR has become a trusted and preferred source of information. Moreover, perceptions of radio are not conditioned by ownership; it is rated almost equally high by householders who own a radio as it is by those that do not. However, as a two-way form of communication, radio in Lao PDR has yet to achieve its full potential. Word-of-mouth remains the principal form of communication from villagers to authorities. Notwithstanding the radio as a general utility, the impression gained again is that aside from the land they own, the only assets ethnic people have are each other. Appropriate Communication Channels for Empowerment, Inclusion and Participation of Ethnic Groups Other than radio, the other types of media have little presence (around 10 percent of households or less) in the villages studied, although access outside the household is much higher, which indicates a community-based approach to technology access. Nearly all sources of information are well trusted and useful, but the representation of ethnic issues is infrequent, except on radio. Again, with the exception of radio, the quality of media treatment of ethnic issues is rather moderate and more would be welcomed, especially on radio. Ethnic people lack a voice insofar as they feel that they are generally unable to respond to anything they see or hear in all types of media. All types of media could serve ethnic issues better but given the varying levels of access to different media, radio is regarded as the most promising. Development opportunities for ethnic people are perceived to be very well-served by radio, but respondents were lukewarm about other forms of media. More coverage of ethnic issues would definitely be welcomed on radio and loudspeakers. Communications for empowerment implies that communities should be able to instigate their own development initiatives and have access to their own media and communication channels according to their own agenda, aspirations and priorities. The findings of the study have highlighted national development priorities as well as revealed the aspirations of the communities themselves and there does appear to be close correspondence between the two. The study has also revealed the preferences that ethnic people have for communications in support of these development priorities, with radio being a strong favourite. Experiences to date with community radio in Lao PDR have been mostly positive, although issues of sustainability are not totally resolved. It is clear that community radio is an effective organ for transmitting information to ethnic groups who do not understand Lao very well or at all. It is less clear that the existing initiatives, of which admittedly there are very few, have yet fulfilled community radio\u2019s promise of providing a voice to the poor and allowing them", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ca4e722-0587-4a1e-a363-2a9c036a1575": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ca4e722-0587-4a1e-a363-2a9c036a1575", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61bb1f312c56a85d68a247352b014d164d51875ba5bff23589a5945cd709a7f5"}}, "hash": "61bb1f312c56a85d68a247352b014d164d51875ba5bff23589a5945cd709a7f5", "text": "to participate more fully in national debates and decision-making on issues that affect them. So far, community radio seems to increase access to information as well as provide a useful communication platform. Further implementation of this form of communication could pursue a more participatory approach to programming formats allowing for interaction among and between indigenous peoples and between indigenous peoples and governmental authorities. The existing messages that are being relayed via community radio imply improvements that would seem to be incremental in nature. In comparison, the introduction of new media, especially the internet, implies the discovery of new information and ways of communication that could be transformational and empowering. The results of the field research imply there is untapped potential for using radio more effectively as a medium for promoting and implementing development activities that are closely aligned with local priorities. The results also indicate that there is room for expanding its potential through more interactive and participatory radio programming formats including convergence with other communication channels such as mobile telephony and the internet. International experience with ICTs, especially the internet, shows that there is also development potential that far exceeds what the communities in the study might be capable of imagining and, under the right circumstances, these communication channels could be made available to them. In line with the rapid expansion of telecommunications in Lao PDR for both mobile telephony and internet access, there are untapped opportunities for exploiting the synergies that exist between different technologies when used together to achieve a more desirable level of interactivity between communities, broadcasters, authorities and the outside world. The volume of phone 56 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR calls from listeners to Khoun Radio testifies to this potential. Such an arrangement would also lend itself to the need for development processes to engage more closely with local knowledge and to take greater account of traditional practices and knowledge within forthcoming development interventions. Effective management and use of traditional knowledge implies the implementation of a robust communication mechanism for continuously gathering ethnic knowledge and feeding it into ongoing development processes. Databases that are accessible to ethnic communities have a role to play here. Experiments in Lao PDR so far with ICTs, e.g. rural telecentres, have given rise to some positive outcomes so the opportunity exists to move forward towards further implementations, as is happening in other Asian countries. The coming focus on communication for empowerment should proceed by replicating more community radio stations. It should also include additional steps towards integrating the use of other newer technologies to further infuse the promise of giving a voice to the ethnic peoples that they can use to good effect, as they themselves would wish to use it. As official policy moves the nation out of LDC status, with civil society having better access to information and affordable communication channels being one of the main drivers, the challenge and opportunity now is to identify ways to empower ethnic communities with the capacity to point change in a direction that they would choose for themselves. 60 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR 5. C4E Recommendations and Proposals for National C4E Interventions Ethnic peoples represent approximately 44 percent of the total population in Lao PDR and largely remain marginalized and vulnerable. By and large, they have been excluded from mainstream development processes and continue to suffer from issues related to poverty, social exclusion and lack of access to basic social services. The national C4E study emphasizes access to information and communication channels as essential elements of advancing democratic governance and alleviating poverty for poor and vulnerable groups, including for the majority of ethnic peoples. With limited formal representation and participation in decision making processes, ethnic peoples will most probably be further marginalized and as a consequence existing disparities and inequalities will widen. An increasing information divide between urban and rural areas will contribute to exacerbating these inequalities. This study has identified both development challenges and opportunities to enhance communication for empowerment of ethnic peoples. One opportunity includes Lao PDR\u2019s efforts towards creating an enabling legal environment for associations and CSOs. This will provide strong entry points in the overall policy for poverty reduction. There are potentials for using the convergence taking place in media and communications technologies not just for enhancing information exchange but also for supporting and promoting the revival of ethnic languages. Effective communication systems and channels can also provide development agencies, including government, a bridge to extend democratic governance and development to the remotest corners of the country.

Broadly the recommendations of the C4E assessment encompass the following key areas: y Improving the enabling policy environment on C4E for ethnic peoples; y Proposing C4E programme interventions aimed at increasing ethnic peoples access to information, communication channels, voice and participation in governance processes. The recommendations also imply the need for follow-up research in key areas as part of the process of implementing pilot projects and/or supporting innovations that already exist. Improving the Enabling Policy Environment on C4E for Ethnic Peoples An enabling policy and legal environment is essential for the media to become a mechanism for inclusive democratic governance through increasing access to information and communication channels among ethnic peoples in Lao PDR. Both the NGPES and 6th NSEDP recognize the critical importance of access to information as a means to enhance socio-economic development in the 47 poorest districts in Lao PDR. The plan emphasizes the importance of communication tools in providing relevant information for empowerment, local development and poverty eradication. The 7th NSEDP (2011-2015) aims to help improve service delivery, accelerate the achievement of the MDGs by 2015, and enable the country to graduate out of the LDC status by 2020. Some pilot interventions are already underway. UNDP\u2019s Governance and Public Administration Reform (GPAR) programme is piloting Village Information Systems in Sekong Province in order to improve access to information for ethnic peoples.71 Furthermore, new legislation on CSO registration and a new media law provide greater opportunities for the mass media to continue to enhance its role. These are first steps in the right direction for associations to obtain better access to information and the media, especially 71 See United Nations Development Programme, GPAR Sekong Project, Project Fact Sheet available at http://www. undplao.org/whatwedo/Projectdocs/update%20November%202009/GPAR_Sekong_Brief_2009_07.pdf 61 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR community media that could be an effective mechanism for empowerment and development of ethnic peoples. Introduction of an access to information policy and legislative framework can further strengthen civic engagement in governance processes and help to expand an investigative role of the media in Lao PDR. Viet Nam and other ASEAN member states have started a process towards formulating an access to information law; this is yet to be considered in Lao PDR. To drive this process, proposed recommendations are: y As part of other programmes on peoples\u2019 participation in governance, UNDP could take the lead in promoting an access to information policy in Lao PDR. Particular attention could be paid to access to information for ethnic peoples. The creation of an access to information policy and law will normally require a long process of consultation and consensus among the government and relevant stakeholders. In this regard, UNDP could play a facilitating role in introducing the process in collaboration with MoIC. y The formulation of an access to information policy and eventually a law would be a step-by- step process, where the actual adoption of the bill could take years. It could be a tangible and potentially high impact output of a governance programme running four to five years. The programme could simultaneously work with the government in setting up a system for information disclosure and establish mechanisms for access to information for the public, including ethnic peoples in rural and remote areas. y Based on the findings of the study, conditions for community radio and combinations with other new media channels seem to be an important step forward towards expansion of the communicative space for ethnic peoples. y An analysis of the enabling environment for the media to strengthen communication outreach and diversity based on UNESCO\u2019s Media Development Indicators Framework72 could help to prioritize actions of the government and those of the international donor agencies. Such priorities should aim at improving the capacity and enabling legal environment of all forms of media and communications particularly with a view to remote rural areas. This could also stimulate rural development. y In order to take the C4E recommendations forward, a national multi-stakeholder committee on information, communication and media should be established with the key tasks to: 1) continue assessment of the C4E situation; 2) formulate a national strategic plan to expand inclusive communication channels; and 3) integrate new media and ICT into other forms of communications to promote inclusive participation and voices of ethnic communities. y Enhance awareness and capacity of the new CSOs and associations with particular focus on how to utilize communication and media options to enhance their participation in public dialogues or discussions at the national and sub-national levels. y Establish mechanisms for collaboration between CSOs and associations, particularly those relating to ethnic peoples and mainstream media as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b6d9b20-2170-47f0-b1a8-9d04e2e2e3e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b6d9b20-2170-47f0-b1a8-9d04e2e2e3e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7749de069da810fd5ef1ad8f2344d0518e89bc6e7b3b1d2b25a73933112957c2"}, "3": {"node_id": "a53c2471-462a-46af-8893-318a1a225beb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d163c3e5e1d9d12b381054a8e3e97f648a9c5c6f0af1e2146189bfb72cf8aa8"}}, "hash": "8f7fccdb655daf86d8724efa54157ebb77651b88b424f32761e0e96151c1d698", "text": "well as community radio as a way to enhance their voices in the public discourse. y Support Lao National Radio and TV to improve their reporting on ethnic issues at the national and sub-national levels. Proposed C4E Programme Interventions Scaling up community radio in Lao PDR At the national level, scaling up any strategic C4E programme would entail more than merely replicating those that already exist. Innovative and pioneering pilot projects, such as community radio stations are usually run by small teams in a flexible and adaptive manner, responding quickly to changes in local circumstances and at the same time building on small successes and working around unforeseen difficulties. However, a wider programme, perhaps on a national scale, 72 UNESCO (2008), Media Development Indicators: A framework for assessing media development, The International Programme for the Development of Communication. Paris, 2008. 62 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR would necessarily need to be institutionalized with a set of working practices and procedures capable of being followed by many employees. Such a programme should be accompanied by mechanisms for building capacity and sharing experiences as well as generating a forum for further development of the concept. Capacity development at the national level includes: y Legal advice and support y Training and planning assistance y Financial management and resource mobilisation y Community research and impact assessment y Partnership of relevant stakeholders y Local ownership Scaling up community radio comprises three dimensions: 1) adding more stations throughout the country; 2) infusing these stations with greater capacity for giving voice to ethnic peoples with two-way communications (both vertically between communities and authorities, and laterally between communities of the same ethnicity and differing ethnicity); and 3) bringing additional ICTs into the mix in a synergistic fashion that would strengthen the capabilities of each towards greater impact in line with nationally agreed development goals. Community radio is an appropriate development tool because it is supported by government policies in Lao PDR. It can help overcome the difficulty in getting messages across to remote villages, as well as the low literacy rates (a common barrier to conveying information). Furthermore, it is cost effective, making it possible for long term sustainability. There is also a demonstrated interest among communities to participate.73 Proposed strategic actions are as follows: y Improve radio programming formats towards better involvement of local level issues and stakeholders; y Provide training programmes for local level journalists or volunteers working at existing community radio stations with particular focus on content development, interviewing techniques and story telling; y Promote more coverage and reporting of ethnic issues through the network of community radio stations that have links to mainstream media; y Foster public debates and discussions on development issues or concerns at the local and community levels; y Combine community radio with internet to enhance the provision of services in the remote and rural areas, particularly for ethnic peoples. Combining community radio with internet The introduction of additional ICTs to community radio represents an innovative opportunity in Lao PDR. The internet represents an opportunity for intensifying radio\u2019s impact in a number of ways by offering the ability to share and disseminate knowledge and information among development agents, policy makers and the beneficiaries themselves. However, in order to have a significant impact on development programmes, ICT services must be readily accessible and meaningful to broad segments of the rural population and the information they carry must be adapted and disseminated in formats and languages that they can comprehend. Experience with community telecentres that provide shared access to computers and the internet and other ICTs indicates that they are capable of effectively supporting interventions for education, health, agriculture, enterprise development and cultural and social enrichment. While telecentres deliver information to communities, radio can be used in addition to deliver it directly into households.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a53c2471-462a-46af-8893-318a1a225beb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a53c2471-462a-46af-8893-318a1a225beb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7749de069da810fd5ef1ad8f2344d0518e89bc6e7b3b1d2b25a73933112957c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b6d9b20-2170-47f0-b1a8-9d04e2e2e3e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f7fccdb655daf86d8724efa54157ebb77651b88b424f32761e0e96151c1d698"}}, "hash": "3d163c3e5e1d9d12b381054a8e3e97f648a9c5c6f0af1e2146189bfb72cf8aa8", "text": "73 See United Nations Development Programme, Khoun Community Radio for Development: Bringing Local News to Local People in Xieng Khouang, Fact Sheet, 2009 available at http://www.undplao.org/whatwedo/Projectdocs/ Khoun_Radio_Brief_2009_07.pdf [accessed on 9 December 2009] and Thongsavanh Khammanichanh and Birgitte Jallov, \u201cTurning Plans and Dreams Real: The Community Leads the Way,\u201d Final Evaluation Report Khoun Radio Support Project, June-July 2007, available at http://www.undplao.org/whatwedo/Projectdocs/Khoun%20Radio%20 evaluation%20report%2007.pdf (accessed on 9 December 2009) 63 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR National community e-centre programmes The internet is already emerging as a powerful force for development and poverty alleviation.

Although telecentres are in their infancy in Lao PDR, the experiences that have accumulated in recent years in other countries in Asia means that late-comers can jump-start the piloting phase by adopting the set of commendable practices that has emerged and move directly into a national commitment to rural development underpinned by internet-based information services. Mobile phones: the promise of the future A further opportunity for technology synergies exists with mobile phones. The growth and potential impact of mobiles are phenomenal. Mobiles are helping deliver on every one of the Millennium Development Goals, including poverty, education, equality and health.75 In Bangladesh, \u2018Mobile Ladies\u2019 (women with a mobile phone in hand) go door-to-door in their villages, listening to problems and advising on how best they can be solved. In about half the cases this involves sending a letter or email via a community-based information worker. For the rest, a mobile phone call is made directly to a helpline and an answer is provided instantly or in a few days. Research also indicates that the poorest people use mobile phones to strengthen their close social networks of immediate family and friends. They also use mobiles for \u2018link-up\u2019 \u2013 short calls averaging 19 seconds \u2013 to broader, more extensive social networks. Further increasing mobile penetration into the poorest sections of society will require low-cost handsets and services, innovative funding schemes and, most of all, more efficient markets. Research evidence suggests, however, that it will be possible to almost double current levels of penetration before services become uneconomic to provide.76 Moreover, because many developing countries such as Lao PDR are unencumbered by legacy assets, they have the opportunity to leap-frog to newly available, affordable technologies and mobile and wireless networks will play a large role in this regard. Development of mobile services has been largely left to the private sector, but this does not mean that they cannot be incorporated into formal development programmes, as in Bangladesh. The volume of telephone calls to the Khoun radio station is indicative of the potential and it makes the case for integrating mobile access into community radio services, even if only at the level of one phone per village. ICTs and community radio support all areas of the MDGs ICTs and community radio are capable of contributing to effective programmes in all areas of the MDGs. In the case of telecentres, experience indicates that they are capable of effectively supporting interventions for education, health, agriculture enterprise development and cultural and social enrichment. For sustainability, they need to be good at minimum two of these, preferably three or more. Telecentres under UNESCO are called \u201cmultipurpose community e-centres\u201d to emphasize this characteristic. The effective application of ICTs, including radio, the internet and mobile telephony, to rural development implies different approaches to development and in particular it favours a territorial approach to rural development. Territorial rural development requires a combination of sectoral approaches with area-based analyses, planning and support mechanisms. In particular, these have to be targeted towards regional economic development, with better access to efficient services 74 Roger Harris, Information and Communication Technologies for Poverty Alleviation (KL, UNDP-APDIP, 2004), available at http://www.apdip.net/documents/eprimers/poverty.pdf (accessed on 9 December 2009) 75 Richard Heeks and Abi Jagun, \u201cMobile phones and development: the future in new hands?,\u201d Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex available at http://www.id21.org/insights/insights69/art00.html (accessed on 9 December 2009) 76 ibid. 64 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR and adequate infrastructure as well as the establishment of suitable institutional and political conditions.77 A territorial approach to rural development is somewhat new to formal development processes, which tend to follow sectoral lines.

She is Khmou, and married with three children; one is working in the field at the time of the interview, another is in school and the third is in the house. She can not read or write. She grows rice on two hectares of land and considers herself better off than her neighbours with ownership of a tractor, a TV, generator and a brick house. The TV is only for playing music VCDs. She never sees newspapers. Her husband only farms. They rarely travel beyond the immediate vicinity of the village; once they went to Muang Xai for their son\u2019s wedding, and occasionally they go to Nga district centre for health problems. They travel by tractor to the river then by bus to the town. The village is better off than five years ago, mainly as a result of development projects, which she welcomes. She hasn\u2019t been involved much with the projects; mostly they bring in materials from outside, such as cement, and the villagers provide the labour for construction. As an example, there is a public shower and toilet block and a dispensary. She has no toilet for her own house. She does not have a radio, but listens to the loudspeaker, which re-broadcasts national radio and Luang Prabang radio in Khmou language. The broadcasts include useful information for overcoming poverty; growing animal fodder, raising cattle, and buffalo, and how to make a profit from these activities. She can understand Lao but doesn\u2019t like to speak it. When asked about her preferences for development, she preferred a clinic to a bridge across the river, and preferred a bridge to a better road. Mr. Khamsone, Ban Khonthoy, Nga District, Oudomxay Province, 25 November 2008 He is Khmou and lives in his own house and his son lives next door. He has three children; one is studying in Nga, one is married and another lives with him. Mr. Khamsone is farmer with a one- acre sesame seed garden. He does not have radio or TV, but he has a motorbike and a rice mill. He takes his sesame seed to Nga district centre to sell. He receives 6,000 Kip for each kilogram and earns around three million Kip in a year (US$350). His income for this year has dropped significantly because rats ate his seed. He used poison to kill the rats before they destroyed his entire crop, but he knows others who were unable to do so. He doesn\u2019t know any better way of killing rats than poisoning them and he is better prepared this year. A buyer from Nga with whom he has an exclusive contract buys his sesame. He couldn\u2019t sell any sesame seeds to the interviewer as this would violate the terms of his contract and threaten his continued relationship with the buyer. All the growers in the area sell to the same buyer, who sets the price, which he doesn\u2019t consider to be a fair price. Although he was once able to negotiate an extra 1,000 Kip per kilo, the price has since come down again. He knows that in Luang Prabang, sesame is sellable at the higher price of 10,000 Kip per kilo. He does not know what happens to his sesame after he has sold it. 76 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR His son also farms. Compared to his neighbours, he considers himself to be worse off. His son next door has more land to farm, grows rice as well as sesame and owns a motorbike.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50b5aa70-46da-4f18-baa9-2ce43d5cca55": {"__data__": {"id_": "50b5aa70-46da-4f18-baa9-2ce43d5cca55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11aa55a129d6b50679009c81df0783d528354010c1f42158fa6d51308404e9e9"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7a51c4e-3687-450c-9a03-56f87c345477", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd74bcb4225ae246b64c3da4cdec157a7e0aaba53e8bb8d807f0bbd1a4228b00"}}, "hash": "338238647be09472cf85bdc1ba1584d204bf91f1ac2e127c1095779d8fd57ebb", "text": "He claims to be happier than where he lived before in a remote location in the mountains.

He welcomes most the information on Khmou traditions and customs. It makes him proud to hear Khmou language on the radio (via the loudspeaker) and to know that there are Khmou people living in Vientiane. Overall, he is interested in everything he hears, especially information on regulations, illegal logging and opium growing. Mr. Phonsavanh Phanthavichith, Director, of Information and Culture, Oudomxay Province, 24 November 2008 Mr. Phanthavichith welcomes the project and is happy about community radio in ethnic language. There are 12 ethnic groups in Oudomxay and 24 sub-groups. The population of the province is 65 percent Kmhou and 25 percent Lao Loum; the rest being made of other groups. Of the seven districts in Oudomxay, six are included the Nation\u2019s list of the 47 poorest, and Nga district is the poorest of these. The population of the district includes Hmong, Kmhou and Lao Loum peoples. The area is mostly mountainous and the roads are unsealed. In the provincial capital, Muang Xai, there is a 10 watt FM radio station that only reaches the local population and a 100 watt TV transmitter. In the villages there are 60 loudspeaker systems, some of which are government operated, some are operated by the villages. The villages welcome information on agriculture, health, sanitation and education. The main method to deliver this is currently radio and loudspeakers, but the mountainous terrain presents a barrier to the radio transmissions. Notwithstanding the needs of Nga district, the Governor extends a request for the project to work in Houn district, which has a larger population. Second Interview: Mr. Phonsavanh Phanthavichith, Director, of Information and Culture, Oudomxay Province, 27 November 2008 Mr. Phonsavanh expects 90 percent of the districts to have radio access by 2015 as there are plans to build a provincial radio station. It will carry programmes in Khmou and Hmong languages. Additional community radio stations would facilitate the extension of the provincial radio signal into remote villages. Mr. Khamsau, President, Lao National Front for Construction, Oudomxay Province, 27 November 2008 Oudomxay has 14 ethnic groups; Kmhou 56 percent; Lau 13 percent; Hmong 12 percent; Lue 7 percent; Tay 2 percent; Nang 2 percent; Ko (Akha) 2 percent; Yau 0.1 percent; Phonsong 0.2 percent; Bith 0.3 percent; Ho 0.6 percent; Phoemoi 0.3 percent; Phongsa 0.3 percent; La Met 0.05 percent. The houses of the different ethnic groups are mixed together. LNFC sends officials to the villages to train people and to disseminate information; mostly on government policies and regulations. TV, radio and newspapers are rare in the more remote locations. Telephones and the internet are not available and there are no skills to use them. Activities are directed by the government based on an annual planning exercise. These have included information for raising awareness on HIV, avian flu, tuberculosis and promotion of education. They provide cassette tapes for the village loudspeakers. Interactive communication is usually by word-of-mouth. The government is promoting the concept of village clusters \u2013 Kum Ban \u2013 to facilitate the delivery of public services to fewer locations serving wider populations. The Front is concerned with training people on settlement policies and the workings of the Kum Ban. Mr. Khamsau is also concerned that the department strengthens its knowledge of the different ethnic groups. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time an official had visited Ban Khonthoy. Each district is expected to one Kum Ban as a model. This would include; an office, and a budget allocation, with one staff each for agriculture, health, education, police, Women\u2019s Union and LFNC. Kum Bans are not ethnic-specific. 77 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Mr.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5932116b-d699-4aff-9f3b-2d6cbc3c6d09": {"__data__": {"id_": "5932116b-d699-4aff-9f3b-2d6cbc3c6d09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR: An assessment of communication and media needs among ethnic peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5add1c5d8ec10cf8e6a82a0886ddd550e3dc41687a866e8cc9a9c047f14869a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b04f445b-ca65-4622-a10e-c4946d83e143", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-lao-pdr-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-ethnic-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce9283b0aa954596afd0518150f2fa3cfb0470d0c6f5b03c1335629cb12d8fe3"}}, "hash": "cc54df2f861c1fba9d1b00c996e78026683c4f4e44ab41404d1ae8f1faa7530f", "text": "77 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Mr. Thongvanh Bounsvath, Deputy District Chief, Nga District, Oudomxay Province, 24 November 2008 The population in Nga district of 28,000 people is 60 percent Khmou, 25 percent Lao Loum and 15 percent Hmong.

There are plans to electrify the district next year; concrete posts have already been erected along the road, but it seems the plans have been postponed.

Ms. Carine Pin, Community Development Advisor, DED German Development Service, Nga District, Oudomxay Province, 24 November 2008 The GAA project is completing a three-year project that provided a revolving fund for loans to women, who can not read, write or count. They have set up village libraries with materials on agriculture. They have piloted training on nutrition and food production. Their plan is to establish nutrition centres, combined with libraries and child centres. Among problems of poor education and illiteracy, the farmers suffer from restricted access to markets and terms of trade in their produce that are monopolised by a single buyer. The paid US$150 deposit for their satellite antenna installation and the monthly charge for internet access is US$60. There are seven computers attached to the connection, which are used by the DED and GAA staff, with occasional use by government officials, for which they are not charged a fee. Mr. Ton Wang, District Governor, Nga District, Oudomxay Province, 26 November 2008 Mr Wang acknowledged that the villages in Nga district need information to help with problems concerning livelihoods, agriculture, health, sanitation and education. He emphasised the problems of remoteness for the district but suggested that the findings of the research may not be accurate as the villagers are not educated and they have a limited scope of knowledge. Accordingly, the survey may not provide all the information we should have and we would need to return in order to learn more. Nevertheless, he strongly believes we should cooperate together and that the project should bring in technical support to improve the provision of better information to the villages. This is because there have been problems disseminating information to villagers and this has adversely affected some development projects. National radio as well as Luang Prabang radio has been useful in spreading information and a local radio station would be very helpful. Mr. Bounta Phetdara, Director and Permanent Secretary, Department for Planning and Investment, and Deputy Provincial Project Director, the Oudomxay Community Initiative Support Project (OCISP), Oudomxay Province, 26 November 2008 The OCISP project has five components; Community Development; Agriculture and Natural Environment; Rural Finance; Rural Infrastructure; and Capacity Building. The project is working in seven districts covering 149 villages with 1,200 households and 22,000 people. Developments include road and bridge building, water supply, school dormitory construction and irrigation. Food has been supplied to school teachers and students under the World Food programme, and basic sanitation has been improved. Capacity building projects for youth have covered income generation and nutrition. Loudspeaker systems have been installed in 36 villages with solar panels and cassette tape players. Each system is operated by Loudspeaker Management Team which has 78 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR been trained in report writing. There is a satellite internet receiving station in Xai district. Internet access was tried but was not successful; the costs are high and there were problems with the telephone network. An AM radio station was planned but the costs were prohibitive.

There are 14 members of his extended family living in his house. All the adults are farmers and they are also engaged in carpentry. He attended primary school. Seven members of his household speak Lao, including him. He has an electricity generator which he uses for his carpentry and for lighting, TV and VCR and a radio. He is married with four children. The house is quite new and was built with the assistance of the whole village. His household is not Buddhist; it follows animistic traditions and beliefs. There is no clinic in the village so he and his family either use traditional healing knowledge or they go to the district centre for treatment. There is a village midwife and his wife gives birth to their children at home. His use of language is mixed between Lao and Trieng. He says it is good to be able to use Lao, which enables him to converse with visitors and people in town. He would consider leaving the village but he says he has no experience or education. He doesn\u2019t know anyone who has ever left. He saw a computer once in a game station but has never used one. He has never heard of the internet. He could read the newspaper but he never sees one. He is not sure of his parents\u2019 ages. He has seen many foreigners coming to the village; to conduct interviews. He has seen projects being implemented from the World Food Programme, the Red Cross and others for school and well construction. There is a lot more scope for local projects; he would welcome a clinic and electricity as top priority, plus telephone. The rice he grows is only for consumption, and then there is not enough to feed the family for the whole year. He considers his household to be about as well off as his neighbours. 89 Communication for Empowerment in Lao PDR Mr. Souphanh, Householder, Ban Dak Vang, Dakcheung District, Sekong Province, 27 January 2009 Mr. Souphanh is 48 years old, of Yeh ethnicity, and his house was built in March 2008. He is a farmer, growing coffee, cassava, sugar cane and bananas. His crops are for consumption and for selling in Dakcheung district centre. He farms three hectares with his wife. They have five children. His family were harvesting coffee, collecting in the forest or in town during the interview. There are ten people living in his house. He attended school up to grade 5 in Salavan Province, where he learned to speak Lao. He has some Yeh cousins in Viet Nam, which is four hours away by motorbike. He visited Viet Nam the last time in 1999, but his relatives have never come to Lao. He never sells his produce across the border. He considers his household to be poorer than his neighbours, mainly because they have received animals as inheritances from their parents. Problems in the village include insufficient rice, lack of a clinic and electricity, although he owns a generator from which he powers lighting and TV but not a radio. His house has a toilet. He dries his coffee before selling it to buyers from Pakxong in Champasak Province. His source of price information is word- of-mouth, there being no newspapers available locally. He believes that he receives a fair price for his coffee. He normally keeps around two kilograms per crop for his own consumption. He has seen but never used a computer and never heard of the internet. He hasn\u2019t seen any foreigners or tourists in the village before.

National radio, in Lao language, reaches the district as does TV via satellite antenna. There are loudspeaker systems and patchy mobile phone access. Viet Nam radio in Vietnamese and Thai radio are also receivable. Lao Telecom fixed line telephone is available. The local population is predominantly Trieng, of which there are 73,000 in Lao PDR and more than 100,000 in Viet Nam. The district has no internet or newspapers. Dakcheung is one of Sekong\u2019s poorest districts and on of the 47 poorest in the country. Before the revolution there were no roads. Livelihoods are principally obtained from rice and animal husbandry. The predominant local language is Trieng with Lao being the second most. During the dry season, most of 86 villages are easily accessible, but not in the wet season when travel is very difficult. Coffee is grown locally. The local rice supply of 1.5 to 2 tonnes annually is sufficient for only about eight months consumption. There are three schools, but more are needed. Cultural festivals around traditional beliefs about spirits are now rare owing to recent economic downturn. Government funds for agriculture loans are generally insufficient for the needs. There are 27 government offices in the district but this number is planned to be reduced. Mining surveys have been conducted by Chinese investors. The villages would welcome improved information provision. Second Interview; Mr. Khanso Bouddaphe, 29 January 2009 Mr. Bouddaphe provided some statistics on Dakcheung District.

UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) led the implementation of the initiative. UNDP RCB wishes to acknowledge the dedicated contribution of Khim Ghale, President of the Association of Nepalese Indigenous Nationalities Journalists (ANIJ), the leadership of Dr. Chaitanya Subba and the local research team, including Krishna Chaudhari, Mangal Menyangbo and Amrit Rai. Binod Bhattarai provided invaluable support and substantive inputs throughout the drafting process and Chhan Bhattachan processed the field research data in a timely and structured manner. Special thanks go to the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN), Foundation of National Indigenous Nationalities (NEFDIN) and the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Federation (NIWF) for their support and cooperation during the study. Without the views and information provided by various organizations and individuals interviewed and surveyed, particularly the indigenous peoples in the three participating districts, this study would not have been possible. UNDP RCB also wishes to express its appreciation to UNDP Nepal, particularly Jorn Sorensen, Sharad Neupane and Tek Tamata for their support throughout the implementation. We would also like to thank the Capacity Development of the National Human Rights Commission Project for their support in the successful organization of the National Stakeholder Consultation on Communication for Empowerment on 19-20 January 2010. The consultation would not have been possible without representative organizations of indigenous peoples in Nepal and their active participation. Valuable insights and comments were shared during the consultation by Pasang Sherpa, President of NEFIN; Barsha Man Pun, Constituent Assembly member; Indra Bahadur Guring; Prithivi Subba Gurung and other stakeholders. Substantive comments were provided by Chandra Roy, Birgitte Jallov, Paavani Reddy, Manohar Bhattarai, Tek Tamata and Sharad Neupane during the finalization of the report. Furthermore, Lars Bestle and Ryce Chanchai coordinated the Regional Initiative on C4E and contributed to the overall writing and analysis of the report. Rukka Sombolinggi co-organized the National Stakeholder Consultation. Finally, special appreciation must be given to UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and Communication for Social Change Consortium for the enriching collaboration and partnership and, above all, for providing the funding mobilized through the United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF). This support made it possible for this unique initiative to operate at the global, regional and national levels simultaneously and planted the seeds for additional funding to enable expansion of the C4E initiative to other countries in 2010. Foreword Nepal is blessed with a remarkable diversity of culture and traditions and is home to people from nearly 60 indigenous ethnic groups and nationalities. On the other hand, the caste system and secular forms of government have fostered the exclusion and marginalization of large population groups. Exclusion and marginalization were root causes of the past decade of armed conflict. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2006 clearly spells out the need for inclusion and giving a voice and equal opportunity to marginalized and excluded groups. Indigenous peoples are among the most marginalized and vulnerable groups in the world. In Nepal, the excluded groups are comprised of women, Dalits (so called \u201cuntouchable\u201d), indigenous peoples (IPs) and religious minorities. People in these groups have little or no voice and participation in decision-making and governance processes. There are large gaps between groups in terms of access, voice, participation and development. Since 2006, Nepal has taken major steps to ensure increased participation of indigenous peoples in policy making through provisions in the Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 and a new electoral law that requires political parties to ensure proportional representation of all excluded groups in parliament.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a46a5e3-d318-4a34-be9a-9a003007a4da": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a46a5e3-d318-4a34-be9a-9a003007a4da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10014a127fdd99bfd13ce885b5590b1407096a64a2c42f7ac35326c158843a67"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2dc1b07-318d-454b-9d0a-dc4f9c5a08d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dea98c1750024e56896df7627b566483d0269cb183cc68d653154cd994869609"}}, "hash": "efec71ab2f5ea4815eede604c3d8fd6c7f65cefc822eee3eb4c3a3325592286b", "text": "Similar measures have been taken in the civil service and other state structures.

Nepal therefore decided to ratify International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. Nepal also endorsed the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), following its adoption on 13 September 2007 by the United Nations General Assembly. Among other things, UNDRIP emphasizes the importance of inclusive communication and media and provides a benchmark to guide and inspire efforts to promote and protect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. In recognition of UNDRIP, the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok launched the Regional Initiative on Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples in December 2007. The initiative emphasized the role of a diverse media and inclusive communication channels as empowering mechanisms to enhance voice, inclusive participation and democratic governance. During the C4E pilot project and at the time of this report, Nepal was in the process of drafting a new Constitution, expected to be ready in May 2010. One of the main challenges has been to ensure that it is fully rights-based and inclusive. The Constituent Assembly (CA) is the most inclusive ever, with 601 members coming from 25 different parties, many of them from traditionally marginalized and excluded groups. For the first time, the CA members travelled across the entire country to solicit the opinions of the people for the new constitution; in addition, many other efforts were made by NGOs and development partners to raise awareness, provide information and encourage the voicing of opinions by all groups of society, in particular the most excluded. Mainstream as well as local media played a very important role in the complex process by giving voice to different views and by ensuring the participation of all marginalized groups in the discussions on state building. This report provides essential insights to how the indigenous peoples of Nepal are organized and represented by the national and local media. The report describes the media landscape in three districts inhabited by indigenous peoples and reveals that Nepal has one of the most vibrant media environments in Asia, particularly in community radio, yet these channels could be strengthened for ensuring voice and participation for indigenous peoples in the future. Alternative channels, using modern technology, should also be explored as a means to bringing information and giving a voice to indigenous peoples, especially in the most remote areas of the country. The report points to specific recommendations and proposes activities that can mutually benefit the media and indigenous peoples. I hope that the findings and recommendations from this report can help to enable indigenous peoples in Nepal to enjoy better access to information, strengthen their communication among and between their communities as well as with the broader Nepalese society, and have a stronger voice in matters that affect their daily lives. Anne-Isabelle Degryse-Blateau Country Director, UNDP Nepal Preface: A Step Towards Inclusive Participation Communication underpins human development because it enables people to access, produce and transfer to others information that is important for their empowerment and progress. Through communication people are able to arrive at their own understanding of issues, to consider and discuss ideas, and to engage in national public debates. Communication thus enables people to negotiate, develop and act on knowledge, and it facilitates the formation of public opinion without which democracy cannot exist. While being very different types of organizations and working with very different mandates, the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre and the Communication for Social Change Consortium share an understanding of the importance of communication as a tool and a methodology that can make development strategies more effective, more sustainable, more pro-poor and more gender sensitive. In UNDP, the recently approved 2008-2013 Strategic Plan recognizes that communication channels are key determinants of inclusive participation. Inclusive participation is a focus for the work of UNDP in the area of democratic governance. The approach is rooted in the knowledge that one of the challenges facing developing countries is the lack of inclusion and participation of poor and vulnerable groups in decisions that affect their lives. The Communication for Social Change Consortium fundamentally believes that communication has the power to change societies. Participatory communication approaches can help us to better understand how commonly held social values and beliefs are nurtured and spread within cultures, and this knowledge is a powerful step towards helping people decide upon and begin to make the kind of changes they want and need in order to make their lives better. Said differently, the Consortium helps people to obtain necessary skills and feel empowered enough to advocate for changes that will make their communities healthier, their countries stronger, and their families more productive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57c28852-5857-4f04-9027-05ca04171456": {"__data__": {"id_": "57c28852-5857-4f04-9027-05ca04171456", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9c079738fda8bda85fd2ed3fed80e1b0fa4ff88b686dd0076dbb6d6f0cfb8d2"}}, "hash": "a9c079738fda8bda85fd2ed3fed80e1b0fa4ff88b686dd0076dbb6d6f0cfb8d2", "text": "When people come together in dialogue \u2013 and plan and act together \u2013 it is the truest form of democracy. One of the most exciting manifestations of democratic principles is understanding how information flows within communities and unleashing the voices of those people who are often not heard or seen. We have looked forward with great anticipation to the findings of the Communication for Empowerment pilot projects. A few years ago, the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre developed the UNDP Guidance Note on Communication for Empowerment, drawing upon the expertise of the Communication for Social Change Consortium. The purpose of this Guidance Note was to turn the above general insights into mainstream planning tools that facilitate an understanding of the information and communication needs of the poor and the marginalized, hopefully also making this a permanent feature in national development planning processes. This report is part of a series of pilot Needs Assessments in five Least Developed Countries, funded by a grant from the United Nations Democracy Fund. The country pilots will be followed by a global synthesis report that will reflect on the experience of the five pilots and provide tools for national actors to conduct their own assessments and to develop their own strategies for incorporating Communication for Empowerment into national planning processes and programmes. We hope that this partnership between UNDP Nepal, other stakeholders in Nepal, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, UNDP Oslo Governance Centre, and the Communication for Social Change Consortium can offer a contribution towards listening more effectively to the needs and views of communities throughout the country, and that these needs and views will increasingly inform our approach to development.

On one hand, access to information is a precondition for empowering IPs through understanding of issues and rights. On the other hand, communication means the ability of the people to express their voice, participate in a dialogue and influence decisions that affect their lives. The two complement each other but also embody separate meanings, which are necessary for understanding and implementing the C4E study. Communication for Empowerment (C4E) Approach C4E encompasses the role of communications as an empowering mechanism to enhance inclusive participation and governance. It is based on the fundamental belief that social inclusion and participation through access to information and effective communication channels are integral parts of democratic governance and sustainable development for the poor, vulnerable and marginalized groups. In essence, the C4E approach focuses on the governance dimensions of poverty, which recognizes the lack of voice, participation and choice as a result from social exclusion and discrimination.

Indigenous peoples or indigenous nationalities Indigenous communities, peoples and nations are those that have a historical continuity to earlier societies and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories and a collective social and cultural identity that is distinct from dominant groups in society. United Nations human rights bodies, ILO, the World Bank and international law apply four criteria to distinguish indigenous peoples: (a) indigenous peoples usually live within (or maintain attachments to) geographically distinct ancestral territories; (b) they tend to maintain distinct social, economic, and political institutions within their territories; (c) they typically aspire to remain distinct culturally, geographically and institutionally rather than assimilate fully into national society; and (d) they self-identify as indigenous or tribal. Despite common characteristics, there does not exist any single accepted definition of indigenous peoples that captures their diversity as peoples. Self-identification as indigenous or tribal is a fundamental criterion for determining whether groups are indigenous or tribal, sometimes in combination with other variables such as \u2018language spoken\u2019 and \u2018geographic location or concentration\u2019.

In the C4E context, voice means access and representation in the media. It also extends to mean organizing and forming institutions to voice and articulate demands of excluded groups. The outcomes of voice, influence and agency are the extent to which poor and excluded people engage, influence and hold institutions that affect them accountable 1 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Executive Summary Indigenous peoples (IPs) in Nepal, known there as indigenous nationalities, remain a marginalized and vulnerable group largely excluded from the mainstream development process. They represent 37.2 percent of the population. A large number of IPs, particularly indigenous women, have been living in extreme poverty and face many development challenges, including limited access to natural resources, unequal access to healthcare, education, water and sanitation. The changing socio-political climate in Nepal is witnessing increasing political participation of the IPs and demands changes in the governance systems in the country. But an informed participation of citizens in governance and other decision making processes requires access to information and effective communication channels. Therefore, this Communication for Empowerment assessment in Nepal aims to identify challenges and opportunities to enhance voice and participation of IPs in the governance and development process. The C4E study is comprised of three main parts: the national overview study, the media and ICT landscape and the field assessment. Inclusion and Development of the Indigenous Peoples Since 2006, Nepal has been going through a major social and political transformation, including the election of the Constituent Assembly and the unprecedented process of creating a constitution to establish Nepal as a federal republic. The new constitution defines a new structure, and the right to self-determination lies at the heart of demands by indigenous peoples for greater recognition in this new structure. Decisions about the state structure and how it will be governed are the most contentious issues in the ongoing debate, and they will have implications for the inclusive participation and development of indigenous peoples for years to come. The national overview study examines the diversity and complexity of the Nepali society with its various caste and ethnic identities. It also illustrates significant dimensions of language, religion, geographic areas and variations in development outcomes among the different groups of indigenous peoples. The expression of grievances and issues of the oppressed groups, including IPs, has brought \u2018identity politics\u2019 to prominence in Nepal. Collective mobilization of these groups has created an environment of ethno-political conflict.1 The cultural, social, political and economic differences between dominant caste groups and the subordinated IPs (and other excluded groups) run deep in the Nepali society. Nepal faces a critical challenge in establishing social cohesion, especially given the conflicting demands among the various social groups. There is very little intergroup dialogue on issues of concern to indigenous peoples, especially in the mass media. IPs groups are often under- represented in major governance institutions. A bureaucracy that is more inclusive and representative could help to ensure more effective development, particularly in the delivery of basic social services to IPs and other commonly excluded groups. The current process of social and political transformation in Nepal provides a unique opportunity for the empowerment and mobilization of indigenous peoples. Over the past decade, groups representing IPs have become more organized and can now lobby and advocate for ending", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3d41a91-de25-429b-8566-7be010048593": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3d41a91-de25-429b-8566-7be010048593", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2790ce6494436bc698ec7e0abc6051fa5bbed55e64ee2f8494cdd5afe10ba73"}}, "hash": "b2790ce6494436bc698ec7e0abc6051fa5bbed55e64ee2f8494cdd5afe10ba73", "text": "inequality and for building more inclusive democratic governance systems. The umbrella organization representing all indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations (IPOs) is the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN). NEFIN notes socio-economic disparity among groups of indigenous peoples and recognizes the need for special efforts to support the livelihoods and development of the \u2018disadvantaged\u2019 groups. 1 Ethno-political conflict, according to Ted Robert Gurr (1997:8,9) \u201chas become the principle source of warfare, insecurity, and loss of life in the contemporary world\u201d and such conflicts \u201care the principle source of humanitarian disasters\u201d (genocide, mass political murder, civilian fatalities, refugee situations and internal displacement, etc.). Conflict experts from dominant groups often express concerns about the consequences of ethno politics or identity politics in Nepal. Intellectuals from subordinated groups argue that cultural or identity politics is eclipsing contemporary Nepali social politics of equality due to the latter\u2019s failure to accommodate differences and deepen democracy. (Subba, 2009) 2 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal The formation of an IPs caucus of representatives in the Constituent Assembly provides an excellent opportunity for amplifying demands and negotiating for desired policies and legal instruments for more inclusive participation. There are thus opportunities for incorporating the rights of IPs into the new constitution. Increasingly, the recent national development plans and policies have recognized the need for specific provisions to advance development of IPs and excluded groups. Currently, Nepal officially recognizes 59 groups of indigenous peoples. However, there is an ongoing process to identify and categorize groups that were not included in the earlier classification. Media and ICT landscape This section examines the media and information and communication technology (ICT) landscape in Nepal as it pertains to indigenous peoples, including the policy and legal environment, challenges and opportunities. Access to traditional media (print, TV and radio) and to new media is examined in terms of physical access, language, different types of media outlets and the use of ICTs. It also explores the role of the mainstream media in amplifying the voice and participation of indigenous peoples\u2019 groups in Nepali society, including the issues related to representation, ownership and coverage of their issues. The key findings from the overview of the media landscape indicate that indigenous peoples\u2019 communities have relatively little access, voice and participation in the mainstream media. By and large, Nepal\u2019s media is owned and controlled by more socially and economically powerful groups or influenced by political parties. IPs and other excluded groups have low representation in the media. Their demands are not always well represented or acknowledged. In addition, language remains a major barrier. Content in their first language (mother tongue) is still limited in the mainstream media. Furthermore, IPs often have low literacy rates in their first language, which means that the written word is not the most effective medium for access to information and communications. Resource and capacity constraints are two other major challenges, particularly for media organizations at the local and community levels. Concurrently, indigenous peoples have very limited access to ICT-enabled communications. While access to telecommunication services is gradually increasing, the usage is rather inconsistent due to the inability to pay for the equipment and services as well as challenges to service reliability. ICT services and applications have very low relevance to the majority of rural Nepalis, including IPs. Services and information provided on the Internet do not match the needs of users. Nevertheless, new opportunities for enhancing access, voice and participation of IPs have emerged as the technological convergence of the traditional and new media comes closer to reality and services become more affordable. In addition, the new media and networked communication environments have transformed the communicative space driven by the use of modern technology such as the Internet, wireless technologies and mobile telephony. Through these new technologies, users and communities, including IPs, can create content themselves. Other opportunities lie in the improvement of the existing media and communication channels, particularly community radio. Potential of community radio and other forms of media Radio remains a major medium for indigenous peoples to communicate with the rest of the society. It is an important source of information and is widely owned and accessible. As of July 2009, Nepal\u2019s broadcasting sector was comprised of 323 licensed FM radio stations and 12 television channels. About 195 FM stations claimed to be community radio stations of which more than 160 were broadcasting at that time. These community radio stations were owned and operated by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), cooperatives and local government bodies. Radio, especially FM, reaches large parts of the country. According to the Broadcast Audience Survey (2006-2007) conducted by Equal Access Nepal, radio is ranked as the second most", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c17f5950-7c47-4324-8556-38312b722fcb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c17f5950-7c47-4324-8556-38312b722fcb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4227bf6cc65ec7e5917f70097f7c003e3bd0eab2389e4ae08fe34095e6f9ca4"}}, "hash": "c4227bf6cc65ec7e5917f70097f7c003e3bd0eab2389e4ae08fe34095e6f9ca4", "text": "preferred source of information (96 percent) after television (99.3 percent) in urban areas. It remains the most preferred information source (98 percent) in rural areas. Although Nepal has a fairly wide network of community radio stations, they have not been used for C4E of the indigenous peoples. This is an opportunity that can be explored as part of the social inclusion process. 3 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Infrastructure and opportunities for new media and ICTs in the remote rural areas Nepal has a basic fibre cable network connecting the plains districts and there are plans to connect all districts within five years. Upon completion, Nepal will have the basic infrastructure needed to expand communication outreach using ICTs and new media. However, there are issues around ownership and pricing of the infrastructure and its use for rural communications that need to be resolved before it can be effectively used to promote voice and participation of IPs. Combinations of mobile phones, new media and mainstream media Mobile telephony is growing rapidly in Nepal. Competition in the telecommunications sector has brought down prices, making this tool accessible to a growing number of people. Some efforts are already underway at using mobile phones for soliciting public opinion in the media. This can be used immediately to bring the voices of more IPs to the forefront on issues put up for vote. Such initiatives can benefit from partnerships between organizations that represent IPs and the mainstream media. Potential opportunities through mobile phones and other ICT applications can help enhance media content and expand space for communications among indigenous peoples in the mainstream media. These communication channels could promote the voices of IPs on issues that matter to them, and ensure that their views are broadly reflected in the media at the national level. Nepal has a National Information Commission for ensuring the right of the people to be informed. This provides another opportunity to ensure that IPs and other marginalized groups can access the information they need to make decisions affecting their lives. Field Assessment The field study on information and communication needs, challenges and opportunities for IPs provides data for verifying and complementing the national overview study as well as the review of the media and ICT landscape. It does not seek to provide a representative view of the entire indigenous population in Nepal. Indigenous peoples were involved in the research process as the targeted beneficiaries of the C4E initiative, and also as partners in participatory development. These findings are expected to assist in devising intervention strategies and actions for addressing information and communication needs of IPs in specific groups and areas. They could also assist in planning C4E interventions for excluded groups in Nepal. The recommendations based on the key findings are, through extrapolation, applicable to other parts of Nepal. In addition, the experiences and lessons from the community level research are also expected to help in improving the methodology for national C4E studies to be conducted in other countries. The study examined information and communications separately and not as interchangeable concepts. On one hand, access to information is a precondition for empowering IPs through understanding of issues and rights. On the other hand, communication means the ability of the people to express their voice, participate in a dialogue and influence decisions that affect their lives. The two complement each other but also embody separate meanings, which are necessary for understanding and implementing the C4E study. The study was conducted in three locations: y Durgauli, Kailali district in mid-western Nepal; y Syaphru, Rasuwa district in the central region north of Kathmandu; and y Basantapur, Tehrathum district in the eastern region of the country. The research locations were selected taking into account the time constraints and they do not necessarily fully represent the three indigenous groups \u2014 Tharu, Tamang and Limbu \u2014 to which the majority of respondents belonged. Nevertheless, the selection of locations was intended to achieve a broad conceptual understanding of the diversity, geographical spread and differences in development outcomes among the different groups. The locations were fairly easily accessible by vehicle and therefore, the IPs at the locations generally represented a higher level of development in terms of access to modern infrastructures compared to those living in remote areas. 4 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal The field research provides insights into the diversity in Nepal and how it influences the lives of the people, particularly their access to information, voice and participation in communications and development. Some of the key issues are common to all IPs. Others are more specific to the different social groups, their geographic locations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fd1bf7c-2da2-43e0-b847-036aa47f5253": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fd1bf7c-2da2-43e0-b847-036aa47f5253", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ef020ea3f2d4f27290202096fde678b691dc3c702b1911f1eddeb24f440ff7e"}}, "hash": "6ef020ea3f2d4f27290202096fde678b691dc3c702b1911f1eddeb24f440ff7e", "text": "and languages. These conditions are reflected in their different priorities. This section attempts to identify the commonalities and differences based on a comparative assessment of the findings from the three field study locations. Access to information and media The level of access to information varied by geographical location. IPs living in both Kailali district and Tehrathum district had higher access to sources of information compared to Rasuwa district. Kailali and Tehrathum also differed in terms of physical access. By and large, eastern Nepal has greater exposure and access to media compared to western Nepal. Ironically, although Rasuwa lies in the central region of Nepal, which has the highest concentration of the media, it lagged behind the two other districts in the study\u2019s findings on access to information. The ability to make use of information in the media also varies across locations and social groups. This is an outcome of the differences in languages, low literacy in the mother tongue and non- availability of information in local languages. Most of the information is available only in the Nepali language. Literacy in the Nepali language is also low among IPs and the levels vary across groups. Language can determine relevance of information to specific groups. At the level of the information \u2018product\u2019, programming formats determine the level of access to information. Generally, the media had very little content on local issues, and even less content on issues of interest to the IPs. Though the community radio in Tehrathum was more advanced in terms of programming for IPs compared to radios in other districts, there is a general need for improving content in all three districts. This can be implemented by enhancing representation of the IPs in the media and building local capacity for producing locally relevant programmes. Despite shortcomings, radio was the preferred media in terms of reliability of information in the study locations. Radio ownership was also high and this suggests that it could be the medium that can provide villagers greatest access to information and voice. Mobile phone ownership was also high across the three districts. However, the mobile phones are used more for personal communications and not as a primary source of information. Across the study locations, the villagers relied on traditional local sources to access information. These included the Katuwal or village-criers in Kailali. Other information sources included teachers, health workers, and people at the markets and social gatherings. Word-of mouth and face-to- face meetings were also identified as information sources. Community media centres, such as telecentres, remain constrained by the lack of Internet connectivity, lack of resources to establish and run the centres, and the need to improve the content available for dissemination through the telecentres. If developed, telecentres could be sources of information to the villagers. Voice and communication Voice and communication can be enhanced when information systems allow interactivity and exchange of different views and opinions. Programme design, content planning and production systems can determine the extent to which people can engage and participate in discussions in the media. In the study locations that had community radios, there were some programme formats that allowed people to discuss issues. The farther away people were from a radio station (e.g. Rasuwa), the more detached they were from media content and its potential benefits. The presence of a large number of radio stations does not necessarily lead to more inclusive voice and communication for indigenous peoples, the study suggests. Rather, numerous stations can potentially exacerbate tension and mistrust among different social groups, especially if these radio stations are co-opted by political parties or other partisan interests. In Kailali, for example, a relatively large number of radio stations are in operation, but this did not seem to play a critical role in enhancing voice and communication for IPs, nor did people consider radio as the most useful communication platform in this district. In contrast, Tehrathum 5 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal had only one station, but it stood out in terms of the people\u2019s references to its programming, its representation of different social groups and its strong focus on local issues. Indigenous Peoples in the media Not only are IPs under-represented in Nepal\u2019s media, they are not always properly and positively portrayed. During the assessment respondents from all IPs groups indicated that the lack of or negative coverage of issue related to their group was due to lack of journalists from their ethnic group in media agencies. This shows a strong need to improve newsroom diversity in order to bring in the voices and increase participation of IPs, and also to ensure more indigenous-sensitive coverage.

There is a greater need for capacity building to prepare and place indigenous journalists in the decision-making and management positions of the mainstream media. This could be a more sustainable and effective means to ensure continued, credible. In addition, it is also important to consider the issue of misrepresentation within the fragile context of state building and strong ethno-politics in Nepal. Additional research and analysis is required to understand if the perception of negative coverage by certain journalists is due to mistrust created by ethno-politics or reflects a lack of capacity of the journalists to present objective stories in the media. Both causes would require different sets of media strategies to meaningfully address the issues. Gender Access to information and communication can play a critical role in gender equality and empowerment of women. In Nepal, patriarchal norms still determine access, voice and participation of women in all spheres of life. Understanding of the gender dimension in Nepal is still constrained by the lack of disagregated data. Observation of proxy indicators across the three field study locations suggest that women, particularly in indigenous peoples\u2019 groups, have much lower literacy and education compared to the national average and that of men. Therefore, they naturally face enormous challenges in accessing information and participating in informed discussions. Media content production is still dominated by men in the three study locations. In addition, it was unclear to what extent women had control over access to information and whether they had equal opportunities to voice their views through existing communication channels. As an alternative, women have been using informal channels to seek information through face-to-face discussions with peers, teachers, female community health workers and other women they meet in the markets. Development situation There are significant variations between the districts in the levels of education and literacy, which could be influenced by factors such as geographic locations, languages and dynamics of social exclusion. These conditions also influence the level of access to information and communications channels among different social groups in different locations. In addition, access to infrastructure and basic services such as electricity was a major factor affecting the choice of preferred medium of communication. Variations in poverty and economic opportunity in the field research locations also influenced the choice of medium. Communication and Information Needs At the national level, recognition of the human rights of indigenous peoples is a central issue in the ongoing process of formulating the country\u2019s constitution. It is also linked to the empowerment of the indigenous peoples in Nepal. The right to self-determination and political rights are among the primary demands of the IPs. Development issues also need to be addressed in conjunction with these political demands, notably the need to improve livelihoods for IPs. Therefore, the information and communication needs must be addressed at two levels: 6 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y Equal access to information and communication opportunities could help ordinary villagers to improve their livelihoods by enhancing voice and participation. This entails understanding the role and impact of information on the process of political transformation and decision- making; and y Improving communications among and between indigenous peoples themselves could help IPs to have more coherent messages to strengthen their positions. Efforts by organizations representing indigenous peoples to advance these two aspects of information and communication have focused on the national level and not on the sub-national level. However, a focus on the sub-national level could help ordinary villagers to improve their livelihoods by enhancing voice and participation. Representation of the indigenous peoples Nepal has about 54 indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations (IPOs) and one very strong representative organization. However, there is a need to enhance the ability of IPOs to interact and communicate with the rest of the Nepali society, a capacity currently constrained by low media coverage and misrepresentation of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues. Key Recommendations Based on the findings from the C4E study and assessment, the proposed recommendations focus on the following priority areas for action in support of indigenous peoples: y Enhancing knowledge of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues and rights; y Building capacity of indigenous journalists and media professionals; y Increasing access to information and media; y Strengthening voices and participation in media and communication platforms; y Mainstreaming C4E, media and ICTs as well as rights into existing development programmes and projects; y Promoting the role of indigenous women in media; y Exchanging experiences and lessons learned on using communication as an empowerment tool to strengthen indigenous peoples\u2019 rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a79cb42-c77e-4d68-8439-dc6e0df11d18": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a79cb42-c77e-4d68-8439-dc6e0df11d18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4898ef054feb1d2f44f42a7e2677b7c7064d4981138871a1215d58b354a5261"}}, "hash": "a4898ef054feb1d2f44f42a7e2677b7c7064d4981138871a1215d58b354a5261", "text": "Enhance knowledge of issues Insufficient knowledge of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and realties is affecting the current political debate on the benefits and challenges of federalism.

Furthermore, the country has ratified ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples and voted in favour of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Both instruments include provisions to promote the rights, voice and participation of IPs. To accelerate this, the proposed areas for C4E intervention aims to: y Support production and dissemination of knowledge on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues, rights and demands for media coverage; y Raise awareness and knowledge of journalists on issues affecting IPs; y Raise awareness of youth from indigenous communities about the media and encourage them to participate in public discussions in the media through media literacy initiatives; y Support interactive media formats and programmes to encourage greater exchanges of 7 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal views and opinions between IPOs and decision makers/opinion leaders in both mainstream and community media. Building capacity of indigenous journalists and media professionals Nepal has vibrant and diverse media outlets, including print and broadcasting. Nevertheless, the low representation of journalists and media professionals from indigenous groups remain one of the key challenges. In addition, journalists from other social groups tend to have limited knowledge about issues related to IPs, which results in poor reporting and coverage of their issues. There is a need to enhance capacity of indigenous journalists and media professionals in the following areas: y Support a range of training programmes (e.g. investigative and in-depth reporting) for addressing the needs of different media; y Support and promote \u2018citizen\u2019s journalism\u2019 including the use of New Media by individuals and IPOs; y Support orientation programmes of media professionals to enable them to better understand the issues affecting IPs. Increasing access to information and media Limited access to information by IPs is a key challenge in making informed choices. At the policy and legislation level, the constitutional guarantee for the Right to Information and Freedom of Expression serves essentially as a starting-point for implementation. Because the process if creating a constitution is now underway in Nepal, there is a rare opportunity to ensure that the new constitution includes these rights. To take advantage of this opportunity, C4E interventions must: y Support efforts to inform all people in Nepal about these rights so that the enjoyment of the rights are shared by all, including IPs; y Ensure availability of information in the languages of IPs; y Initiate efforts to make all public information easily available to all citizens, with special efforts to enhance the access of IPs; y Work with the High-Level Commission for IT and the National Information Commission to develope appropriate applications for facilitating information access for IPs in collaboration with IPOs. Furthermore, strengthening the capacity of the IPOs and indigenous communities to establish or improve indigenous community media could help overcome challenges in access to information. Priority areas for intervention are to: y Set up pilot media and ICT initiatives for IPs at locations that have low media exposure and concentrated populations of IPs; y Support existing community media initiatives to improve inclusiveness of the diverse indigenous people\u2019s groups, including programmes in indigenous languages; y Establish partnerships with the private sector and civil society organizations to devise sustainable models of engagement. Strengthening voices and participation of indigenous peoples in media and communication platforms Existing local communication channels such as community radio can promote voice and participation of IPs in public discourse at the national and local levels. Yet, despite a number of existing community radio stations in Nepal, indigenous peoples\u2019 issues are inadequately covered and often politicized. Little of the local news and programming related to IPs is produced by local radio stations. These challenges can be addressed by strengthening existing local media and communication channels and platforms, including radio, to better serve the poor and marginalized, including IPs. Recommended areas for intervention are to: 8 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y Conduct a strategic review of Nepal\u2019s radio sector to identify areas of intervention to ensure access, voice and participation of marginalized groups; y Develop series of strategic responses based on a community media performance assessment conducted in partnership with media", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4f0929e-1b56-42f9-bfa1-9ac33d872992": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4f0929e-1b56-42f9-bfa1-9ac33d872992", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7eef2d8afe7f2e59203f0de187863c94c77f0fe34d4504ef624365311e5c5c50"}}, "hash": "7eef2d8afe7f2e59203f0de187863c94c77f0fe34d4504ef624365311e5c5c50", "text": "organizations; y Restructure the operations and management to ensure voices and inclusive community participation, including proportionate representation of IPs at all levels; y Build capacity, including inhouse training and coaching of the community media; y Consider setting up model community radio stations for serving marginalized groups, including IPs. Mainstreaming C4E, media and ICTs into existing development programmes and projects Support to media and communications has largely been ad-hoc and preoccupied with advocacy messaging rather than development of the media to be a mechanism for inclusive participation. There is a need for media development activities that can help to narrow the existing the gaps in access, voice and participation for IPs and other excluded groups. Efforts to mainstream C4E, media and ICTs into existing development programmes and projects are equally important. Recommended areas for intervention are to: y Formulate a separate programme in support of C4E of IPs focusing on the role of media and access to information in promoting social inclusion in Nepal; y Assess the potential for establishing a regional mechanism for capacity development and exchanges among groups representing IPs; y Organize a consortium of donors and a national multi-stakeholder groups to support media and C4E initiatives; y Identify linkages with other programmes supporting social inclusion, civil society and democratic participation. Strengthening the role of indigenous women in media Indigenous women in particular are marginalized and underrepresented in media. Mobilizing women\u2019s movements, especially among groups of IPs, could potentially bring about several interrelated benefits. Such movements could enhance the role of women in media, increase the number of women in journalism and management positions, increase sense of ownership among women towards their local media, increase the visibility of women in media, and increase the impact of women on media. In this regard, more efforts are needed to identify strategic responses and capacity building of indigenous women by: y Convening the national meeting among women from indigenous communities to analyze the present situation and identify the reasons for low representation of indigenous women in media; y Supporting capacity building for indigenous women in media, including training and coaching of indigenous women journalists; y Supporting production of media programmes focusing on women\u2019s issues and coverage of issues relevant to women\u2019s lives; y Promoting gender policies for radio stations to ensure the equal participation of women. Exchange of experiences and lessons learned on C4E of indigenous peoples There is a need to generate knowledge and capture lessons learned on indigenous media and C4E experiences as well as to establish a platform for knowledge exchange on C4E. Proposed areas for C4E intervention are to: y Explore potential collaborations with existing regional forums and organizations; y Establish a regional knowledge sharing mechanism to enhance knowledge and implementation of the C4E initiatives; 9 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal y Document, in video and print, issues related to indigenous peoples (e.g. cultures and livelihood outcomes) for sharing knowledge and experience with the larger indigenous community and society; y Set up a mechanism for archiving indigenous knowledge related to C4E. 11 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 1. Introduction and Background 12 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 1. Introduction and Background The Concept of Communication for Empowerment The development community has acknowledged the important role played by communication at many levels of the development process. The specific understanding and concept of communication in development is, however, ever-changing. For many years, the United Nations has defined the role of communication for development in relation to specific development challenges such as HIV/AIDS, education and agricultural development. Today, communication for development is regarded as a people-centred approach that can contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015.2 Among the various definitions of communication for development generated at the UN Inter- Agency Round Table on Communication for Development, there seems to be a general consensus to define it as a participatory and two-way process, and distinct from external and public relations. This is further emphasized by the formal UN definition of Communication for Development, adopted in the General Assembly resolution 51/172 Article 6: Communication for development stresses the need to support two-way communication systems that enable dialogue and that allow communities to speak out, express their aspirations and concerns, and participate in the decisions that relate to their development. The concept of communication for empowerment (C4E) has emerged in recognition of the necessity to emphasize and address the specific information and communication needs of poor and vulnerable groups. It was initially introduced and conceptualized by the UNDP Oslo Governance Centre (OGC) and the Communication for Social Change Consortium in 2006. The C4E approach emphasizes the role of communications", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e89b31b-99a5-4200-9a0f-2c48c20c3fef": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e89b31b-99a5-4200-9a0f-2c48c20c3fef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bae2d31c8e592e1445a928dbdfc85e0a641c272d1c3f02a97890cd34f348e47b"}, "3": {"node_id": "581110f5-7699-4abb-a6a9-99ba4c633de1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02432ca144001fdbf45dd1c48d312a8221421470c648167896603082dabb0136"}}, "hash": "fa674671130d10ba9b2b694e1d5aa43b209f3c2dba55427cface14487ccfdb87", "text": "as an empowering mechanism to enhance inclusive participation and governance. It is based on the fundamental belief that social inclusion and participation through access to information and effective communication channels are integral parts of democratic governance and sustainable development for the poor and for vulnerable and marginalized groups. In essence, the C4E approach focuses on the governance dimensions of poverty, which recognizes the lack of voice, participation and choice as a result of social exclusion and discrimination.3 The C4E Practical Guidance Note and Project: Developing Media Strategies in Support of Vulnerable Groups In 2006, the Oslo Governance Centre released a Practical Guidance Note on Communication for Empowerment4 that explains the importance of communications to poverty reduction. It outlines a range of ways that UNDP and other development agencies can best enhance C4E based on the 2 General Assembly (A63/180): Sixty-third session, Item 49 of the provisional agenda: Information and communication technologies for development\u2019 Communication for development programmes in the United Nations system Report of the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 50/130, including the recommendations of the tenth United Nations Inter-Agency Round Table on Communication for Development. 3 For the underlying concept see Reducing Poverty by Tackling Social Exclusion (2005), a DFID Policy Paper, London. 4 United Nations Development Programme, Bureau for Development Policy, Democratic Governance Group, Communication for Empowerment: developing media strategies in support of vulnerable groups. Practical Guidance Note, March 2006. http://www.undp.org/oslocentre/overview/ogc_communication_empowerment. html 13 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal first step of conducting information and communication audits.5 At present, the opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups to voice their concerns through communication channels have not been sufficiently identified and documented, particularly not at the local level. In a C4E approach, the assessment of communication needs and opportunities is seen as an initial instrumental step in the process of improving the voice and participation of marginalized and vulnerable groups. But this critical step has largely been ignored by national development planning processes and policy makers. The intended outcome of an information and communication audit is to identify key challenges and opportunities for interventions to empower the poor and marginalized and vulnerable groups through better access to information and skills to engage with the media, taking advantage of communication facilities. In so doing, they can exercise their voice and participate more actively and meaningfully in decision-making and development processes affecting their lives. In 2007, with funding from the United Nations Democracy Fund, the Oslo Governance Centre initiated C4E pilot projects targeting five least developed countries: three in Africa and two in Asia. The African countries are Ghana, Madagascar and Mozambique. The countries in Asia are Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Nepal. The pilot project conducted information and communication audits for the purpose of identifying information and communication gaps and establishing a national stakeholder forum that could take the findings and recommendations forward. The implementation of the C4E study and assessment in each country aimed for the following outputs: y A national report with the key research findings; y A stakeholder group to continue the C4E project and programme interventions after the completion of the national C4E research and report. The stakeholder group, which will act as a national coordinating body, will be comprised of participants from the UN system, mass media, government, bilateral partners and civil society; y A series of gap-filling projects emerging from the national needs assessment process as described in the national report. These projects will be driven forward by the national stakeholder group; y A C4E assessment tool. This tool will continue to be improved based on lessons from the national studies and will be made available for governments, UN agencies, international donor organizations and community-based organizations and institutions. This aims to ensure that the information and communication aspect of good governance will be included in the strategic planning process at all levels. The Regional Initiative on Indigenous Voices: Communication for Empowerment of Asia\u2019s Indigenous Peoples The African pilot projects were implemented directly by the Oslo Governance Centre in collaboration with the respective UNDP Country Offices.

This can best be achieved if media support and media capacity development is directed in a way that enables the media to better respond to and reflect the information and communication needs of these groups. The Note underscores the particular importance of radio in communication for empowerment strategies because of its reach, accessibility to the poor and increasingly interactive character. It further explains that the media landscape in most developing countries has undergone a revolution over the last 15 years. This has been marked by increased democratization; an ensuing liberalization of media, particularly of broadcasting; a subsequent decline in government support to former monopoly broadcasting; and greater availability of new and more cost effective information and communication technologies. Media in many of these countries have been transformed from monopolistic and government-dominated systems to increasingly diverse types. 14 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal In addition to Lao PDR and Nepal, the Asia regional C4E initiative also aims to engage other countries in the Asia-Pacific region in collaboration with interested UNDP Country Offices. The RCB and the Olso Governance Centre share the overall objectives, including the RCB\u2019s particular focus on the needs and opportunities for empowering Asia\u2019s indigenous peoples. Both initiatives are based on the same principle that communication is a central determinant of inclusive participation, which is also a key result area of UNDP\u2019s strategic plan (2008-2011)6 in the area of democratic governance. The overall approach is predicated on inadequate social inclusion and participation of the poor and vulnerable groups in developing countries in development decisions affecting them. In accordance with the objectives of the Oslo Governance Centre programme, which have been refined to incorporate the indigenous and ethnic minority perspective, the Asia regional C4E initiative consists of various follow-up activities at regional and national levels. In this regard, the C4E study and needs assessment is an initial preparatory step that serves as a foundation to formulate policy and programme interventions to overcome challenges and meet the needs for information and communication of indigenous peoples at the national and community level. The strategic intent of the national C4E study in Nepal is to establish the development context of the indigenous groups with particular reference to the media, information and communications. It aims to propose specific interventions, including the effective use of media and information and communication technologies (ICTs) that can help to alleviate some of the challenges faced by Nepal\u2019s indigenous peoples. The proposals arising from this study will inform a subsequent component of the regional initiative, which will eventually focus on the implementation of the strategic C4E interventions. Within the regional C4E initiative, a number of participating countries in the Asia-Pacific region will contribute to greater regional implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, particularly the use of media and ICTs to promote the realization of the rights enshrined in the UNDRIP. Through global and regional partnerships, the C4E initiative will leverage knowledge and experiences from a wide range of country level activities to advise and strengthen such efforts through coordinated South-South collaborations. It will also bring indigenous peoples together with common concerns and foster unity to effectively address these concerns. In line with these wider intentions, the regional project has four outputs: y Output 1: Information needs and media-related legislative conditions for indigenous peoples in Asia identified and awareness of policy makers improved; y Output 2: Increased capacity of indigenous journalists and other media professionals in reporting on indigenous peoples\u2019 issues and in harnessing ICTs and new media; y Output 3: Strengthened capacity of indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations/communities in setting up or improving a number of indigenous community media and ICT interventions (e.g. local radio, website, multipurpose telecentre, etc.) and to test applications of common interest (e.g. land, culture, poverty, health, access to information, and freedom of expression); y Output 4: Knowledge of indigenous media and ICT for development (ICT4D) experiences is enhanced through research initiatives and the establishment of a \u2018community of practice\u2019 for sharing of good practices. From the study in Nepal, the regional C4E initiative developed a document to describe the approach and research process that is being used in the Asia country studies.7 It intends to provide a procedural manual for implementing the forthcoming country-level activities. The methodology for the C4E study and assessment represents a structured approach to promoting an understanding of the situation with regard to the IPs in Nepal and their development context with particular reference to the media, information and communication.

Unpublished Document. 15 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal relationships between IPs, the media and ICTs; 3) focused grassroots research involving selected indigenous communities; and 4) presentation of the findings to relevant stakeholders and the formulation of proposals for specific programme interventions to enhance information flow and communications to and from indigenous groups, especially concerning their development prospects and well-being. In Asia, the C4E approach has been adapted to focus more closely on indigenous peoples. Therefore, in conducting the C4E study, special attention has been paid to the involvement of indigenous peoples. Their equal and informed participation is important to ensure accurate and appropriate representation of their rights and priorities, and also as a vital part of a process that will lead to greater inclusion and ownership at the national and local levels. In line with the above, the development of the methodology has been guided by the following principles: y The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides the normative framework and is grounded on human rights principles. It affirms core principles such as the right to equality and non-discrimination and the right to exist as distinct peoples. UNDRIP enhances legitimacy, importance and urgency to strengthen efforts to realise these rights. Article 16 on media and communication has guided the methodology;8 y The flow of information among and between indigenous peoples and the rest of society is one of the most significant factors contributing to the realization of the rights specified in UNDRIP, especially when the means for generating such information flows (i.e. ICTs and the media) are under the ownership and control of the indigenous peoples themselves; y The means to ensure the robust and continued improvement in the use of information and communication should be based on ownership and management arrangements of indigenous peoples, to empower their communities to achieve legitimate rights and desired communication outcomes. In accordance with these principles, the methodology adopted by the Asia C4E initiative presents an initial step for empowerment of the indigenous peoples participating in the study. The methodology endeavours to combine the national-level perspective with a more focused and in-depth analysis through field research in three selected locations. This \u2018T-shaped\u2019 research approach is characterized by: 1) a broad investigation at the national level; and 2) a narrow but deep analysis at the local level. This serves as a reality check for the researchers while providing the opportunity to draw conclusions and propose interventions that are based on first-hand evidence and direct experience. A research and activity guideline was designed for carrying out Output 1 of the regional C4E initiative. It includes information and communication audits in selected countries and locations. It is based on the following key steps: 8 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61/295, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 13 September 2007. See, Article 16: 1 \u201cIndigenous Peoples have the right to establish their own media in their own languages and to have access to all forms of non-indigenous media without discrimination; 2.

The C4E Approach and Process in Nepal This report documents the results of Output 1 in Nepal. The Association of Nepalese Indigenous Nationalities Journalists (ANIJ) led the national C4E study and assessment in close collaboration with various IPOs and the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok. It benefits from the commitment of the ANIJ management and the support of the UNDP Country Office. ANIJ took a leading role in identifying a local research team with researchers from various ethnic backgrounds and languages. A two-day training programme preceded the research. The methodology was discussed and the final field locations (villages) were selected. The questionnaires were translated into Nepali and discussed and finalized at a training workshop held at ANIJ. Three teams of two researchers and one local translator administered the questionnaire and carried out the field interviews. C4E surveys were carried out in the three locations in August and September 2009, focusing on three major indigenous groups: the Tharu in Kailali district in the mid-western plains of Nepal; the Tamang from the mountain district of Rasuwa in central Nepal; and the Limbu from Tehrathum, a hill district in eastern Nepal. The field data was processed using SPSS and the information disaggregated by location was used for the analysis. The idea was to assess the ground realities and also to try and compare the findings of the national overviews with the situation on the ground. Time and resource constraints led to reducing the number of respondents and communities included in the survey. The findings complement the national overview study and broadly reflect the diversity of indigenous communities in Nepal. There are seven large indigenous groups in Nepal, and the three groups selected for the study represented Mountain, Hill and Terai (Plain) ecological zones. They were purposively selected to get localized pictures of the changing conditions of the groups. The empirical evidence gathered by the study were expected to fill the gaps in the macro-level information from the 2003 to 2006 17 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal period.9 The local data were expected to be more reliable for assessing the specific needs of the IPs surveyed. Indigenous researchers carried out the C4E pilot project in Nepal and the key findings were reviewed by the national stakeholders. The C4E study produced key recommendations and proposed areas for interventions that will be taken forward by relevant national stakeholders. In addition, the experiences from Nepal provide important lessons for the implementation of the C4E initiative and for the exchange of knowledge at the regional level. 9 Most disaggregated data used for computing HDI and other indexes were based on the National Living Standard Survey 2003-04 and Demographic Health Survey 2006. 19 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 2. National Overview Study 20 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal 2. National Overview Study 2.1 Inclusion and Development of the Indigenous Peoples This chapter attempts to establish the development context and conditions under which the C4E initiative is to be implemented in Nepal. It provides an overview of the situation of the indigenous peoples, also known as indigenous nationalities. The assessment focuses on their development challenges and opportunities, and the obstacles to their participation in mainstream development and governance processes. For the purpose of this report, \u2018voice\u2019 means representation in formal institutions, because this enriches participation. In the C4E context, voice means access and representation in the media. It also extends to organizing and forming institutions to voice and articulate the demands of excluded groups. The outcomes of voice, influence and agency are the extent to which poor and excluded people \u2013 as part of representative groups and coalitions \u2013 successfully engage, influence and hold institutions that affect them accountable.10 Map 1: Nepal Nepal Thailand India Srilanka China Myanmar History at a glance 1768 Nepal is ruled by the Shah dynasty of kings. 1854 Country Code counts castes and makes Nepali the official language. 1996-2006 The Maoists lead insurgency to overthrow monarchy.

Unequal Citizens: Gender, caste and ethnic exclusion in Nepal. 21 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal National Context Nepal is a small mountainous country in the Himalaya, lying between India and China. It is one of the poorest countries in the world. It ranked 144th out of 182 countries in the global Human Development Index (HDI) of UNDP in 2009.11 Nepal experienced a violent insurgency from 1996 to 2006, when the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) fought to overthrow a longstanding monarchy. Since April 2006, when the People\u2019s Movement II resulted in the abolition of the 240-year-old monarchy, Nepal has been going through momentous social and political changes. The country is in the process of preparing a new constitution for establishing a federal republic. A Comprehensive Peace Accord signed in November 2006 ended a 10-year conflict that had cost the country about Rs 5 billion (approximately US$ 70 million) in lost or damaged infrastructures.12 The Constituent Assembly (CA) elected in April 2008 is now drafting the new constitution. The new statute is to be promulgated by May 2010. Among the proposals on the table is for Nepal to have 14 federal units or provinces. The Constituent Assembly\u2019s Committee on State Restructuring and Distribution of State Powers has proposed a federal structure for Nepal on the basis of a first criteria of identity (i.e. ethnicity/ nationality, language, culture, geographical and historical continuity) and a second criteria of capability (i.e. economic interdependence and capability, status of infrastructure development, availability of natural resources and administrative convenience). The committee rejected other alternative proposals, including six federal units on the basis of capability and one Madhes (plain region) province on the basis of geography. These were recorded as dissenting opinions. The CA\u2019s constitutional committee is to prepare a final draft for approval by the assembly. The CA was discussing Nepal\u2019s political system when this assessment was done in 2009 and early 2010. As of January 2010, the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples (IPs) was at the core of the discussions in the CA. The indigenous nationalities13 see self-determination as the basis for ensuring a lasting peace and social harmony. Many IPs demand that Nepal should have ethnic or identity-based federations, in which marginalized groups have special rights to take leadership positions at the provincial level. In contrast, other social groups that have enjoyed greater access to current political positions and state services argue that the recognition of the right to self-determination of IPs would lead to inter-group conflicts and even the disintegration of Nepal. The IPs assert that the lack of recognition of their distinct identity and the right to self- determination will perpetuate the social discrimination and exclusion in Nepal. The IPs demand constitutional recognition of their rights and their accommodation within the framework of the state, and contend that these measures along with electoral reforms are the only solutions towards a cohesive and peaceful Nepal. Decisions on the state structure will have implications for how the country will be governed in the coming years. The IPs say that identity-based federal provinces and autonomous areas will guarantee their rights in accordance with two United Nations instruments, ILO Convention 169 and UNDRIP. They also say that self-rule with the right to self-determination can help to improve their participation in democratic governance and the resulting outcomes. The position of the IPs is that self- determination does not necessarily mean separation. Instead they see it as a way to ensure access to state governance and opportunities, which they have been denied in the previously unitary state. The structuring of federal units is the most contentious issue within the CA and outside. The Constitutional Committee has started work on a draft that will come up for discussion and approval of the assembly. The issues being voiced in the CA today gained prominence during the 1996-2006 insurgency because the rights of IPs was a major promise of the leading party. 11 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Human Development Report 2009. 12 Ibid., p. 139. 13 Indigenous people in Nepal prefer to call themselves indigenous nationalities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1fccf0e-4f4c-4b88-b298-9234d927cb6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1fccf0e-4f4c-4b88-b298-9234d927cb6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94a360f72965bba4bd1c73d16e5925d43b1fafc03efc8cb6c8ac272073c2382a"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fc8d657-f8ba-4cae-9484-ba38306f5e54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c35e87d14061a5c523bced9de0fc7ef1e59f8b4129e0dd730a9e1870e76bea3"}}, "hash": "0a6a2a154fb219600f5f71d93bead5334220381149e66515cb4a8d35e303fcf1", "text": "139. 13 Indigenous people in Nepal prefer to call themselves indigenous nationalities.

The basic principle of federalism was widely accepted but demarcation of the constituent units (autonomous states/ provinces or areas) remains complex because of conflicting claims and ideological perspectives of different parties and groups. The main issues put forward by the indigenous peoples\u2019 group as demands in the CA are: y Autonomous homelands/ ancestral territories; y Right to self-determination; y Right to self-government; y Rights to land and natural resources; y Official use of indigenous languages; y Right to decide the priority of the projects in indigenous areas. Indigenous peoples\u2019 groups also demand the right to participate in formulating, implementing and evaluating development programmes and projects in indigenous areas. Another key demand is the right to free and prior informed consent on all decisions affecting, including those taken by the CA. Despite all the uncertainties, the political processes in Nepal provide a unique opportunity for the empowerment and mobilization of IPs. Compared to about a decade ago, their groups are also better organized to lobby and advocate their demands for ending inequality and building more inclusive democratic governance systems. According to the National Consultation Report Summary on Inclusion of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights, specific recommendations were made for the actual text of the new Constitution to incorporate the rights of IPs in the following sections:14 y Fundamental rights and directive principles; y Fundamental state principles; y Safeguard against arbitrary amendment of constitutional provisions that safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples; y Natural resources, economic rights and revenue allocation; y Rights of minorities and marginalized communities. IPs in Nepal have had less educational opportunities compared to the dominant groups. This has affected knowledge production and dissemination, which has not always been favourable for understanding their issues and demands. Knowledge and power are intimately linked to political struggles. Those who have access to power, information and knowledge tend to have better control and influence over the public discourse.15 Demographic Profile Nepal has a population with distinctive social characteristics. It is comprised of caste-stratified Hindus with an Indo-Aryan language and egalitarian indigenous peoples speaking Tibeto-Burman languages. Many of these groups had ancestral territories.16 These groups have different caste or ethnic identities. Some of the historical identities were prescribed by the state. The number of groups seeking or asserting identity has increased in successive censuses since the 1980s. The first Country Code (1854) identified about 48 castes and ethnic groups.17 Nepal\u2019s 14 Devasish Roy and John B.

Note: B/C = Brahman and Chhetris In 2002, the government formed the National Foundation for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN) and recognized 59 indigenous nationalities. The 2001 census enumerated only 46 of these groups (see Map 2: Ethnographic map). The largest indigenous groups are Magar who comprised 7.14 percent of the population in 2001. The other large groups were Tharu (6.75 percent), Tamang (5.64 percent), Newar (5.48 percent), Rai (2.79 percent), Gurung (2.39 percent) and Limbu (1.58 percent). Others were very small groups including Kusunda, Hayu, Lapcha, Raute, Raji, Kisan, Meche, Kusbadiya, Bankariya and Surel. The Bankariya and Surel were not enumerated or identified in the census. Other small but recognized groups that were also not reported were Chhairotan, Dolpo, Larke, Lhomi, Lhopa, Marphali, Mugali, Phree, Siyar, Tangbe, Tin Gaunle, Thakali, Thakali, Thudamba and Topkegola. Two groups, the Chhairotan and Phree, are believed to have disappeared. Most IPs had ancestral territories. However, IPs outnumber other groups in only a few districts, due to the migration and integration of the population. The exceptions are Rasuwa, Manang and Mustang districts, where Tamangs and Gurungs have a majority. The mountain region is home to a group formerly known as Bhotes. The Eastern hills are known to be native homeland of Limbu, Lapcha, Yakkha, Rai Kirat (some Kirat groups) and Sunuwar. The central hills are homelands of the Tamang, Thangmi, Hayu, Chepang and Jirel. Similarly, the western and mid-western hills are home to the Tamu (Gurung), Dura, Baramu, Bhujel, Chantyal and Magar. 25 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal Map 2: Ethnographic Map of Nepal (Native Area of Ethnic/Caste Groups) Dipayal IV.

Prior to that, it was officially a Hindu country and Hindu values were promoted, supported and even imposed by the state at the expense of other religious practices, including those of the IPs. Until 1981 the population of Hindus was increasing. It began to decrease after 1991 when Nepal became a liberal democratic state, which was when the IPs began asserting their religions (e.g. animism, shamanism, Kirat, Bonism, Swarna, etc.).21 Historical census data showed increases in the number of Hindus until the 1981census and of Buddhists and people following the Kirat religion after the 1991 census.

Protection and promotion of indigenous languages is critical for assuring effective inclusive participation and voice of the IPs. However, more than three- fourths of indigenous peoples\u2019 languages in Nepal are facing the threat of extinction. Languages can disappear if the groups using them are deprived and do not have resources to invest in their development and standardization. The language policy of the state can be critical for preserving and promoting culture and identity. The CA is expected to decide on a language policy and also outline the mechanisms for the federal units to take decisions on the use of language. Development Situation of the Indigenous Peoples In 2008, Nepal\u2019s population was estimated at 28 million. In 2004, 30.9 percent of the population was living below the poverty line. Since the mid-1980s, the number of the absolute poor has increased and so has inequality. Poverty has become more prevalent and severe in the rural areas. The incidence of poverty in the mid- and far-western regions and in the mountain districts was higher than the national average. There are also large differences in the living standards of those living in Kathmandu Valley and the rest of the country. Differences in caste or ethnicity, cultures, languages and religions have been closely associated with discrimination, exclusion and deprivation in Nepal. These social cleavages created by the inequalities in access to development opportunities have given rise to unrest, political instability, and even hostile confrontations. Collective memories and group experiences of oppression, discrimination and exclusion were reasons behind violent outbursts starting in late 1990s.24 After 2006, group assertion began taking a new shape in Nepal. Oppressed groups, including IPs, began to express grievances through collective mobilization, creating an environment of ethno-political conflicts.25 This is also known as identity politics. The cultural, social, political and economic differences between dominant caste groups and the subordinated IPs (and other excluded groups) run deep in Nepali society. Poverty incidence In 2007, Nepal\u2019s GDP per capita stood at US$ 297. The poverty incidence was 30.9 percent, with rural poverty incidence at 34.6 percent. The net primary school enrolment was 72.4 percent, with enrolment of girls at 66.9 percent. The literacy rate (15 years and above) was 48.6 percent. Roughly 27 percent of the population had access to improved sanitation facilities and 84 percent to improved water sources. The child mortality rate was 51 deaths per 1,000 live births and underweight children numbered 45 percent.26 Using poverty as an indicator for development, the overall outcomes for IPs still lag behind the national average. The incidence of poverty for Hill IPs in 2004 was 44 percent, while the national average was 31 percent. Overall poverty incidence for Hill IPs declined by about 10 percent between 1996 and 2004. That for the Brahmin/Chhetri groups had declined by 46 percent in the same period. The share of the Hill IP groups among the poor rose from 19.7 percent in 1996 to 27.8 percent in 2004.27 Despite improvements in the human development indicators (HDIs), large inequalities continue to persist across different regions and social groups of Nepal. The HDI outcomes vary more widely 24 See Whelpton (1997:39- 78); Bhattachan (2008), Kramer (2003:227- 237), Hachhethu (2009: 20- 22, 35, 50, 64-75, 84- 95), Subba (2006:31- 59), Subba et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5e51c6c-b3b3-46d7-b319-4029a4cdb681": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5e51c6c-b3b3-46d7-b319-4029a4cdb681", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "910bb3a2e09b250f4e96244da9fda6bbca1a64faf2d56a162797929f66132685"}, "2": {"node_id": "c53d96f3-a512-452f-a634-1374913ddf43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b36d49cda897d47f16f89539ab13c9764b4cf5818603c7e001e5924615ce19dd"}}, "hash": "c53e1cdb34a1adc29426b4c57beaaaa9c3895c464fcb8e9e3116595f134c1482", "text": "(2009:51-70, 94-100), among others, for the discussion on IP issues and their movements. 25 Ethno-political conflict, according to Ted Robert Gurr (1997:8,9) \u201chas become the principle source of warfare, insecurity, and loss of life in the contemporary world\u201d, and such conflicts \u201care the principle source of humanitarian disasters\u201d (genocide, mass political murder, civilian fatalities, of refugees and internal displacement, etc.).

The Hill/Mountain IPs groups were doing better (HDI 0.507) compared to those in the Terai (plains) (HDI 0.470). The HDI for all groups of IPs when Newar are included is 0.513.29 The low levels of human development among IPs reflects their limited capacities to participate meaningfully in the governance and development processes. Government policies acknowledge exclusion and its impact on development outcomes. As response, the government has planned initiatives to assist the advancement of marginalized groups. However, implementation remains a major challenge in Nepal. In this regard, the health and education sectors remain at the forefront of the human development agenda, particularly for the IPs. Targeting basic services to socially excluded groups is necessary to enhance the development outcomes for the IPs. Health In the public health sector, the government plans to enhance access to healthcare services in remote rural communities. The management of health facilities is being transferred to local communities with increasing engagement of the private sector and NGOs. Nepal has made progress in the health sector. Nonetheless, public health facilities and resources are still inadequate for the majority of the population. Substantial gaps exist across gender, caste and ethnicity. Access to healthcare and the nutrition of children tends to worsen among the excluded groups, which result in their low standing in human development indicators. Marginalized IPs have higher poverty incidence and therefore are likely to face economic constraints in seeking quality healthcare. Most of the healthcare facilities are located in urban areas and large sections of the population do not have access to basic water and sanitation services. Health outcomes are generally the worst among women of the Muslim community and indigenous groups, especially in the realm of reproductive health (Newars are an exception). The World Bank reports that \u201cThe under-five mortality rate among excluded groups such as the Gurung, Rai, Limbu, Magar and Tamang is about 133, and among Dalits it is 171, which are significantly higher than the national average of 105 (per 1,000 live birth)\u201d.30 Furthermore, language barrier posts a major challenge in terms of access. For linguistic minorities, such as IPs and those who many not speak Nepali, it is difficult to communicate symptoms and understand the treatment instructions. Education There are large disparities in literacy between high caste groups and IPs and also among the indigenous nationalities. About 3.6 million IPs or 46.4 percent of the IP population were illiterate 2001. Illiteracy is very high for some groups, particularly Santhal, Jhangad and Kusbadiya (73 percent). The literacy rate of Santhal, Jhangad, Koche, Kushbadiya, Chepang, Bote, Raji and Raute ranged from 26.9 percent to 28.7 percent, which was lower than that for Hill Dalits (41.9 percent) and higher than Terai Dalits (21.1 percent). Newar and Thakali have the highest literacy among IPs. The literacy rate of 10 indigenous groups (Rai, Gurung, Limbu, Yakkha, Darai, Chhantyal, Byansi, Jirel, Dura, Hyolmo and Meche) exceeded the national average of 53.7 percent.

Social and Political Exclusion Social exclusion The cultures of indigenous nationalities have suffered as a result of the imposition of rules by dominant groups. The so-called nation building process in Nepal involved assimilation measures that were pursued at the expense of cultural preservation, participation and representation of IPs.34 This began with the introduction of the Country Code in 1854. The Country Code transformed Nepal\u2019s society into a hierarchical structure of high, medium and low status groups (Figure 2). Matwalis (alcohol drinking people) were people in specific territories with their own social, cultural, economic and political institutions. They were placed in the middle order and were sub-divided into Masine (enslavable) and Namasine (non-enslavable) categories. From 1854 to 1924 or 1925, large pools of labourers and slaves were drawn from both the indigenous populations and the enslaved Matwalis.35 Enslavement resulted from a number of reasons from tax evasion to slaughtering a cow.36 The caste system was abolished in 1963 but it 32 Source: NIRS, 2006 (Based on Living Standard Survey 2003-04 Data Set). 33 Gurung, 2007: 27/op cit.

Regmi (1978) has discussed the causes of enslavement in late 18th century and throughout the 19th century in Land Tenure and Taxation in Nepal. Accordingly, enslavement was punishment to those guilty of slaughtering cows, violating caste rules, failing to pay debts or government taxes and other levies and for rebelling against state authorities or disobeying government injunctions. 29 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal left a profound impact on socialisation and development of the IPs as a result of the Hinduization or imposition of Hindu values.

Later, many individuals from these communities joined the Maoists because they favoured the idea of establishing ethnic federations.39 After 2005, when King Gyanendra began ruling the country directly, social inclusion and state restructuring became the main agenda of mainstream political parties. People from all walks of life \u2013 including IPs \u2013 joined the protests led by political parties to overthrow King Gyanendra\u2019s regime. The main demands of this movement were social inclusion, restructuring state, election of the Constituent Assembly, democracy without monarchy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and restoration of peace. The movement ended when the King agreed to step down in April 2006. The representation of IPs in political decision-making bodies began to improve when the Interim Parliament was formed in January 2007. Indigenous peoples make up 36 percent of the CA members, which is roughly equal to their proportion in the population. This was possible because of the proportional representation system, which was applicable for 335 of the 601 CA seats. The remaining 240 seats were filled through the first-past-the-post election system but the parties were also required to be inclusive while nominating candidates. The progress in political inclusion was also reflected in other state institutions. The more inclusive political environment also resulted in the formulation of more inclusive national development policies and programmes. The Three-Year Interim Plan (TYIP) \u2013 the first development plan formulated after the political changes of 2006 \u2013 has separate sections with quantifiable indicators for the advancement of excluded groups. Limited participation in the civil services The representation of IPs in public offices has always been very low.40 In 1854, about 95 percent of the signatories of the first Country Code belonged to the high castes; in 1991, the same caste groups held 91 percent of positions in government services.41 The Brahmin/Chhetri groups continue to dominate the bureaucracy. Only the Newar, an urban IP group, have been able to successfully compete and gain these positions. Civil service records of 2006 revealed that officers from indigenous groups other than Newar made up only 3.3 percent of the total.42 These officers came mostly from the Magar, Gurung, Rai, Limbu, Tamang, Tharu and Thakali. Representation of IPs in the police was slightly better than in the civil service: 13 percent of high-level officers came from indigenous communities other than Newar. The representation of IPs in the judiciary was 2.4 percent.43 The over-representation of Brahmin, Chhetri and Newar in government services is due to the larger pool of qualified candidates. It is likely that the Brahmins and Chhetris will continue to dominate the civil service for another 30 to 35 years.44 To change this situation, Nepal would need to find ways to make the bureaucracy more inclusive and representative, which would help to ensure more effective development, particularly the delivery of basic social services to the excluded groups. 39 Essays of Anne de Sales, 2003, Karl-Heinz Kramer, 2002, 2003 Marie Lecomte-Tilouine, 2002, 2004 and several other scholars/researchers, have written about why and how the members of indigenous nationalities, women and Dalits joined the Maoist forces. 40 Low in relation to the dominant groups but higher than Dalits and religious minorities. 41 Gurung, 2007: 18. 42 Nijamati Kitapkhana (Civil Service Records office, 2006). 43 Ibid. 44 Ram Prakash Yadav, 2007: 113. 31 Communication for Empowerment in Nepal National Policy and Legal Framework: Implications for Inclusion of Indigenous Peoples Nepal\u2019s parliament adopted the Interim Constitution in January 2007.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcc6996a-ba50-4c0f-9d91-2a2aaffda130": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcc6996a-ba50-4c0f-9d91-2a2aaffda130", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communication for Empowerment in Nepal: An assessment of communication and media needs among indigenous peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "969456129395f49fac7adff313450ba717ba737fe3d35a99c5dacbd60a640825"}, "2": {"node_id": "17f10f1f-0475-4a3c-996d-83c5f7638f89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communication-empowerment-nepal-assessment-communication-and-media-needs-among-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4742768213e86666441b1fcdffb78461a4a5b68bd0932077ed8e6382c72e2682"}}, "hash": "749ae13766337569b27add098b2793104c8d7aeb0a40b3c9c35c9c06dc43e02f", "text": "The provisions address many concerns of IPs, including the following: y Declaration of a secular state and commitment to form an inclusive federal republic;

However, they have not been successful in seeking leadership positions in government after 1990.47 Apart from the Newar, IPs were underrepresented in parliament until 2007. The IPs blamed the first-past-the-post system of election for their low representation. Representatives of indigenous people have not participated very effectively in constitution making due to their low endowment and empowerment.48 Within parties, members from indigenous groups have been largely sidelined or have not been well-represented in decision-making bodies. The IPs in leadership positions in the political parties have been accused of being more loyal to their parties than their constituents. Similarly, some activists from indigenous groups argue that their CA representatives have not sufficiently addressed their concerns.49 Some IPOs have started demanding the right to select their own representatives in government bodies as opposed to giving that right to political parties or representative organizations of IPs. The Nepal Federation of Indigenous Peoples has 54 affiliated IPOs, the largest representative body of IPs in Nepal. The government has begun consulting NEFIN on decisions related to IPs. Nevertheless, some IPOs have also expressed preferences to have a direct contact with the government. There is a need for more coherent positioning of the indigenous peoples\u2019 groups for the advancement of their demands. There are 218 representatives from indigenous groups in the CA.

The four major pillars of the plan were: 1) high, sustainable and broad-based economic growth; 2) social sector and rural infrastructure development; 3) targeted programmes and social inclusion; and 4) good governance.51 The programmes that were most meaningful to the IPs were grouped under social inclusion and targeted programmes.

The legislative changes to that effect were made in 2007. It was only during the 10th Plan that donors started to recognize that exclusion and discrimination were major problems in Nepal and initiated programmes focused on development of IPs and other excluded groups. Many of the commitments were not implemented owing to political instability and escalation of the Maoist insurgency, which slowed development efforts. Nepal prepared a three-year plan to cover the period of the political transition from 2007 to 2010. It aimed to sustain peace and stability and reduce unemployment, poverty and inequality.53 The plan attempted to make all sectoral programmes more inclusive. It had a separate chapter on gender mainstreaming and inclusion, and a separate section (8.3) devoted to IPs. The plan aimed to promote economic and cultural development of IPs by increasing their access to administrative, social and economic resources.54 Political differences in the ruling coalition prevented a stronger focus on empowerment and development of IPs. The plan included the following quantitative targets for IPs: increase HDI by 10 percent, improve the empowerment index by 10 percent, ensure representation in CA and/or legislative bodies in a manner that is proportionate to their population, and improve the gender empowerment measures of indigenous women by 10 percent.
