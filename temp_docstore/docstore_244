Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 143 Gender-responsive Planning to Address Practical and Strategic Gender Needs Addressing Practical as well as Strategic Gender Needs (PGN/SGN) Practical gender needs are those that arise from the daily performance of women\u2019s roles such as food, housing, safe water, health and educational services for children. These needs are met by involving women as beneficiaries and participants. Measures may improve the conditions of women but not their traditional roles and relations. Strategic gender needs are those that relate to unequal relations of women and men such as gender division of labor, power, and control. They respond to such issues as legal rights, domestic violence, equal wages, and women\u2019s control over their body. lnterventions involve women as agents and enable them to become agents of change. Satisfying strategic gender needs can improve women\u2019s position in society and empower them to transform gender relations. Practical Gender Needs Strategic Gender Interests Tend to be immediate Tend to be long-term Relate to daily needs: food, housing, income, health, children, etc. Relate to disadvantaged positions, subordination, lack of resources and education, vulnerability to poverty and violence, etc. Are easily identifiable by women Can be difficult to identify, i.e., women may have difficulty identifying the reasons for disadvantage and potential ways to overcome it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e4c5f07-ca38-4ad6-b72c-6be237844a56": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e4c5f07-ca38-4ad6-b72c-6be237844a56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cce1dfda389c903e799904e519688afbcdf00751b8a9f7ede182efb8c4141bfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "57b397e9-9bf7-4628-8343-28dd80767368", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b2fcc9ab3d47cc77c593a83c8127d8ad54fa7c31d52dec14b24e4f337bbdeec"}}, "hash": "8960d1f363b1fff3d814a791a5ee237aa991cf6dabe18c2eb89f9714e77149dd", "text": "Can be addressed with specific inputs, e.g., food, hand pumps, clinics, etc. Require change and transformation, e.g., consciousness raising, increasing self-confidence, education, strengthening women's organizations, political mobilization, etc. Meeting Practical Needs Meeting Strategic Interests Meeting practical needs involves women as beneficiaries and sometimes as participants Addressing strategic interests involves women as agents or enables women to become agents Meeting practical needs can improve the conditions of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9230b98e-cefc-428c-8b24-085786e0064a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9230b98e-cefc-428c-8b24-085786e0064a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrating Gender into Community-based Disaster Risk Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrating-gender-community-based-disaster-risk-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "051289569587188fef227f052d4ef187b2585f4692d72419624e1337ad097e7a"}}, "hash": "051289569587188fef227f052d4ef187b2585f4692d72419624e1337ad097e7a", "text": "women\u2019s lives Meeting strategic interests can improve the position of women in society in relation to men (greater equality) Meeting practical needs does not usually change traditional roles and relationships Meeting strategic interests can transform relationships and help women gain control over their lives Source: CIDA, 1997 Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 144 Using Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Framework (Longwe\u2019s Framework) 1. Welfare The material needs and general welfare of women (relative to men) in such areas as food supply, income and medical care should be met. You need to analyze whether there are social or cultural factors that prevent women from enjoying fully the benefits of welfare programs. For example, when you hear a proposal for public health services, you may want to ask whether this will cover the health needs of women across their life spectrum (from infancy to old age). 2. Access \u2014 Women should be able to access productive resources on equal basis with men. These include land, labor, credit, training, marketing facilities, information, and all publicly available services and benefits. Remember that even if public services and benefits are designed to benefit everybody, women have particular constraints for accessing them. For example, credit may not be accessible to women because of such conditions as collateral, complicated application requirements, or a husband\u2019s consent. Information, which is an essential requirement of empowerment, may not always be accessible to women because of their roles and activities. 3. Conscientization \u2014 There is a need to transform the mind set of people, both women and men. Both should be convinced that equal gender relations will work better for them. There are many activities that will promote conscientization. Gender orientation and awareness raising could be among them. The challenge is to work for the conscientization of as many people as possible. 4. Participation \u2014 The participation of women in the processes of development planning is a non negotiable requirement of gender mainstreaming. Women should be physically present and able to articulate their views in the various processes. They should also be provided with information, training and tools that will enable them to get into the stream of public debates. Effective participation of women may require training in assertiveness, leadership and negotiation. Participation of gender aware men in processes that transform gender relations is also essential to gender equality. 5. Control \u2014 Control of women over circumstances that affect them springs from the combined outcomes of interventions in the level of welfare, access, conscientization and participation. It concerns equality of control over the factors of production and distribution of benefits, which means that neither women nor men are put in a position of dominance or subordination. Integrating Gender into Community Based Disaster Risk Management Training Manual 145 Indicators to Monitor Progress Practical and Strategic Needs Areas Indicators WELFARE \u2014 The extent to which the material conditions of women improved; WELFARE - greater food security - improved health - decrease in incidence of sexual and other forms of abuse - decrease in maternal mortality and incidence of common and fatal ailments - increase in average life span - improved sharing of workloads with other household members and levels of happiness and greater satisfaction ACCESS \u2014 The extent to which women\u2019s access and control over resources have changed; The extent to which the positive changes in their access and control over resources contribute to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; ACCESS - improved access to new and highly valued skills and knowledge - credit, income, information, training, technology and social services accessed - access to technology that reduces time and labor spent for domestic and economic drudgeries CONSCIENTIZATION \u2014 The extent to which plans, projects and activities contribute to the raising of awareness about the dynamics of gender relations and how these changed the relationship of women with men and other significant persons in their social, economic and political milieu; PARTICIPATION \u2014 The extent by which women contributed to the attainment of the PPAs\u2019 objectives and how these helped empower them; and PARTICIPATION - increased decision making opportunities and roles - more women organized to take common positions - increase in the number of women in leadership positions - greater support and recognition by others of women\u2019s leadership and participation CONTROL \u2014 The extent to which women generate the power to make decisions affecting their life. Monitoring should also be able to diagnose why the desired results in the aforementioned areas are not happening and to make timely recommendations to address the obstacles.

POVERTY REDUCTION United Nations Development Programme Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A human development perspective Ratnakar Adhikari Mr Ratnakar Adhikari is a co-founder and currently the General Secretary of South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics & Environment (SAWTEE). Previously he served, among others, as a senior adviser to the National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal, and trade programme specialist for the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo. Mr Adhikari has published extensively on trade, regional economic cooperation, competition policy and intellectual property rights issues. He is currently pursuing his PhD in international trade from University of Warwick. The overriding objective of regional cooperation in South Asia is to assist countries in the region to reduce poverty, promote welfare, and accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development. A question often raised in the context of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) has been of crafting a process of regional integration that addresses the structural asymmetries and varying levels of development in the region. South Asia includes four least developed countries (LDCs): Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal (Maldives graduated from its LDC status in January 2011). These four countries are beset with structural and supply-side constraints that limit their meaningful and beneficial participation in intra-regional trading opportunities. In line with its mandate of fostering regional cooperation efforts consistent with human development objectives, the Inclusive Growth and Poverty Reduction Team of UNDP\u2019s Asia- Pacific Regional Centre is pleased to bring out this report: Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A human development perspective. The Report seeks to address the outstanding issues and concerns relating to the South Asian regional integration processes. The study finds that the existing provisions relating to special and differential treatment for the LDCs are neither meaningful nor enforceable. A key issue has been the steady erosion of preferences of the LDCs in the Indian economy, which serves as the largest market in the region. This is ascribed to India\u2019s participation in extra-regional agreements along with India\u2019s recent announcement of unilateral duty-free and quota-free treatment for all LDCs worldwide. LDCs in the South Asia region continue to be handicapped by structural weaknesses, such as a high level of export concentration, economic vulnerability to external shocks and a variety of supply-side constraints that include inadequate infrastructure, lack of human capital and access to credit, and a virtual absence of trade facilitation measures. Restricted transit facilities, geographical constraints, such as being landlocked, act as barriers to trading opportunities as well. A number of policy recommendations have been made including a proposal for setting up of an LDC Integration Fund, promoting liberalization of the services sector and fostering and protecting investments. We hope that this report will be useful to the governments, research institutions, civil society and other stakeholders in the South Asian region in shaping the process of regional integration with a human development orientation.

Second, the modalities and pace of regional trade integration under SAFTA have not taken sufficient account of the human development objectives identified by and included in the SAARC Charter. Left to its own devices, SAFTA is unlikely to contribute to improved human development, particularly in the region\u2019s LDCs. Based on a survey of existing literature, this study takes the position that regional trade agreements (RTAs), although offering only a second-best policy option for trade liberalization, can be potentially beneficial for the participating countries from an economic as well as human development perspective. The study also suggests that RTAs can serve as a building block to multilateral trade liberalization. According to economic theory, South- 1 These are: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal. At the time of writing, Maldives was about to graduate from LDC status. 2 Human development is a concept that was first defined by Mahbub ul Haq (founder of the Human Development Report published annually by the UNDP) as a development paradigm that is \u201cabout creating an environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accord with their needs and interests.\u201d (see: http://hdr.undp.org/en/humandev/.) This concept is supported by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen (2000), who suggests that development policies should be directed towards maximizing peoples\u2019 capabilities \u2014 their ability to live a life they value most. Executive summary 2 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement South trade agreements tend to be more trade diverting than trade creating in nature. However, a number of authors have recently challenged this position on the grounds that the economic theory underpinning the regional integration debate takes into account only static gains or losses and fails to factor in the dynamic gains to be had from a trade and investment nexus, technology transfer and the positive spillover effects of RTAs. Where RTAs are of the shallow integration variety, covering only trade in goods, gains are normally skewed in favour of the larger trading partners. So far, SAFTA only covers trade in goods and does not fully address the issues of para-tariff measures and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). Moreover, it allows members to pursue protectionist policies through the use of sensitive lists, and it does not provide for meaningful and enforceable special and differential treatment for the LDC members. Therefore, the benefits from SAFTA are likely to be limited at best. There is a general consensus among academics and policy makers that if other areas of cooperation are not explored, the prospects for trade and economic growth in the South Asian LDCs are not promising. An assessment of SAFTA from the LDCs\u2019 perspective reveals that their inability to penetrate the largest market of the region \u2014 India \u2014 is a major problem for these weak and vulnerable economies. This is mainly ascribed to the lack of predictability of market access in India, which not only imposes several para-tariff measures and NTBs, but also introduces new barriers whenever under pressure from domestic vested interests. The problem is further compounded by the fact that India has either entered into or is in the process of entering into various transregional trading arrangements, such as the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the India-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) and the European Union-India FTA. These are likely to result in an erosion of preferences for the LDCs, which currently enjoy a certain amount of preferential market access in India.

Finally, the numerous bilateral trade agreements not only tax the negotiating capital of the LDCs but also create confusion due to overlapping rules. They also increase the vulnerability of the LDCs due to their limited negotiating prowess, thus further stymying the LDCs\u2019 abilities to take advantage of SAFTA (Adhikari, 2009a). Based on a conceptual framework for public goods developed by Kaul and Mendoza (2003), this paper argues that SAFTA, as it currently stands, does not fit into the framework of a \u201cregional public good\u201d, which should be the main purpose of a regional integration arrangement of this nature. An analysis of the real and perceived benefits of the various regional and subregional initiatives aimed at better integrating South Asian LDCs reveals that these initiatives fall far short of this objective. The problem is further exacerbated by a lack of political will and severe resource constraints, which limit the ability of these initiatives to enhance LDCs\u2019 integration within SAFTA. The analysis of the trade and human development nexus within the region in general, and in the context of the LDCs in particular, makes it abundantly clear that SAFTA, in its current form, does not promote human development, particularly in the LDCs. It could do so if the regional integration programme was appropriately designed and the domestic systems of governance overhauled to ensure that both contribute to promoting equity, empowerment, productivity and sustainability and to ensuring that people become the true beneficiaries of regional integration. These are necessary conditions for achieving the goal enshrined in the SAARC Charter, which should be the touchstone for evaluating the success, or otherwise, of SAFTA. Regional integration alone does not ensure better human development outcomes, not least because it is the responsibility of the individual countries to design the necessary flanking policies that contribute to poverty reduction and human development objectives. This seemingly depressing picture need not remain so, provided serious thought is given to harnessing the potential of SAFTA, or a broader regional economic cooperation arrangement, for the benefit of the LDCs in general and for furthering their human development objectives in particular. Efforts are required on three fronts: removing market access barriers, overcoming supply-side constraints and expanding the remit of SAFTA. The provision of better market access should involve, as a priority, a reduction in the size of the sensitive lists of the developing countries in the region and the removal of para-tariff barriers and NTBs to products of export interest to the LDCs. Similarly, regional cooperation on infrastructure development, in particular transport and energy, development of human capital, provision of efficient transit facilities, improved trade facilitation, and research, 3 Of the three landlocked LDCs in the region, for transit purposes Bhutan has a greater advantage than Afghanistan and Nepal due to its \u201cextraordinarily warm relations\u201d (Choden, 2004: 121). 4 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement development and innovation, which have not figured prominently in the regional economic cooperation discourse in South Asia thus far, will go a long way towards realizing the true potential of SAFTA. For this, the study recommends that a relatively large-sized LDC Integration Fund be created. Finally, given the limited comparative advantage of the South Asian LDCs in the goods sector, coupled with the lack of a trade and investment nexus, two major areas for expanding the remit of SAFTA are the liberalization of services and protection and promotion of investment. Although the SAARC Framework Agreement on Trade in Services was signed prior to the 16th SAARC Summit in Thimpu, Bhutan on 28\u201329 April 2010 (and this should be considered a welcomed development) negotiations on schedules of commitments are yet to begin. Given the mercantilist predilection4 of South Asian trade negotiators, any agreement schedules of commitments that not only increase trade in services within the region but also leverage such trade for achieving human development objectives is likely to prove contentious. However, the issues of investment protection and promotion and intraregional flows of investment, which could potentially result in tremendous benefits for the LDCs, have not yet received the attention they deserve within SAARC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5caf9908-422a-49a2-9690-bf18359d7563": {"__data__": {"id_": "5caf9908-422a-49a2-9690-bf18359d7563", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef5de13242e81165f051f93fb856c7199b22299077fd61f0700eabfa85172d29"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fc15c34-dfba-47b5-be08-e2c383a2234f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2505eb1e70d22450f345b8a0bd01324e2e11083605f514c7ceb67457dc207622"}}, "hash": "d1c045fe42116a3a3f17f1056d8690d23aecf0308051cc7820cafa3adaf033c6", "text": "4 The fact that trade negotiators are guided by a mercantilist instinct is best elaborated by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman (1997) in his terse analysis normatively titled, \u201cWhat Should Trade Negotiators Negotiate About?\u201d According to him, negotiators get a sense of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ff719cd-8484-4d28-b6ab-f8a5c3ff5219": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ff719cd-8484-4d28-b6ab-f8a5c3ff5219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d949222f164d4015c61e0b24faa61da02ff3af289753a74bf5c0be98325706e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5324480-6d1e-477d-8eb6-eac761f4653a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b694663bdfb361d0ef1dd1c1a471e09cdbd08b01099a205f86f467a8dce64814"}}, "hash": "39c397354b8cabf768f55ef69af4b539016e6e12d64dda36c73953ffd0cc5e4e", "text": "achievement not only by obtaining market access in their partner countries but also by closing market access to their own country\u2019s market.

Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 5 Introduction 1.1 Background South Asian countries are relative latecomers to regionalism and, consequently, among the least regionally integrated countries, though their current pace of integration into the global economy is probably the most rapid in their history. The officially recorded value of intraregional merchandise trade in South Asia constitutes about 5 percent of the region\u2019s total foreign trade (IMF, 2010), as compared with 25 percent for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (WTO, 2008a:3). So far, the implementation of SAFTA since July 2006 has not resulted in a significant increase in the share of intraregional trade.5 In the LDCs of the region, while intraregional imports have been growing rapidly, exports to regional trading partners have been dwindling (Adhikari, 2010). This may be ascribed to, among others, the elaborate sensitive lists of member countries and the existence of non- and para- tariff barriers, including complicated rules of origin (ROO). Theoretical arguments in favour of North-South regional trade agreements (RTAs) as opposed to South-South RTAs are justified, particularly because high most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs on products of trading partners outside an RTA can lead to trade diversion. Many studies have also found that any gains from South-South RTAs accrue mostly to the relatively advanced countries within the RTAs (see, for example, Schiff and Winters, 2003; World Bank, 2000; Ben-David, 1993, 1996). Although some of the empirical findings support this theoretical premise, other studies support rather different findings, arguing instead that South-South RTAs are trade creating (see, for example, Nanda, 2008; Cernat, 2003). Some studies (e.g. Weerakoon and Thennankoon, 2006) have criticized the way in which supposedly empirical findings are derived by using various quantitative analyses, including the gravity model, the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. A careful analysis of the results derived so far leads to the conclusion that the empirical evidence on the benefits of South-South RTAs is inconclusive at best. Various empirical studies that have been conducted over the past 15 years analysing the potential benefits of a preferential trading arrangement (PTA) and/or a free trade agreement (FTA) within South Asia are also clearly divided, not only concerning the benefits but also whether or not there are likely to be asymmetric benefits favouring some members at the expense of others. It is natural that the gains from trade are unlikely to 5 This does not mean that the volume of intraregional trade has not been growing. On the contrary, according to the latest data available from the Direction of Trade Statistics of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), between 2000 and 2008, intraregional trade in South Asia grew by 387 percent (from $6.2 billion to $30.4 billion). However, since the growth in extraregional trade has far outstripped the growth in intraregional trade, the share of intraregional trade in the region\u2019s total trade remains low. Chapter 1 6 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement be shared equally by all the partner countries of an RTA, SAFTA being no exception. The asymmetric benefits within any RTA result from the large variations in size of the economies of the member countries, their economic structures, their institutional endowments, the policy intervention mechanisms they have in place, their productive capacity and efficiency of their enterprises (Razzaque, 2007; Adhikari, 2010). Despite such empirical ambiguity, many South Asian policy makers continue to believe that deeper regional trade integration can create spillover benefits and that it is essential for strengthening ties between the member countries (Weerakoon and Thennakoon, 2006). This is bolstered by the idea that the traditional concept of trade creation and trade diversion should be considered along with the role regional trade can play in promoting intraregional flows of investment as well as transfer of knowledge, skills and technology (Kelegama and Adhikari, 2007; RIS, 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5324480-6d1e-477d-8eb6-eac761f4653a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5324480-6d1e-477d-8eb6-eac761f4653a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d949222f164d4015c61e0b24faa61da02ff3af289753a74bf5c0be98325706e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ff719cd-8484-4d28-b6ab-f8a5c3ff5219", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39c397354b8cabf768f55ef69af4b539016e6e12d64dda36c73953ffd0cc5e4e"}}, "hash": "b694663bdfb361d0ef1dd1c1a471e09cdbd08b01099a205f86f467a8dce64814", "text": "Although intraregional trade in South Asia amounts to more than US$30 billion, the LDCs of the region have benefitted very little from that trade, particularly in terms of their exports.

However, because this study assumes the complete elimination of tariff barriers on goods as the only criterion to judge the utility of SAFTA, the results should be interpreted with caution. The chequered history of the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) \u2013 the predecessor of SAFTA, which made little contribution to enhancing regional trade \u2013 as well as the ambivalence of trade officials concerning the utility of regional trade integration are also cause for concern. Many of those officials believe that SAFTA may not be as useful as was envisaged by the Eminent Persons Group that was constituted by SAARC in 1999 for charting out the course of regional integration in South Asia. This view is reinforced by the long sensitive lists maintained by member countries (as noted), the presence of para-tariff and non-tariff barriers, rigid and cumbersome ROO, overlapping bilateral trade agreements and continued animosity between the two largest economies of the region \u2013 India and Pakistan. Given that the LDCs of the region will be net losers if the status quo is maintained, SAFTA has incorporated several special and differential (S&D) provisions for these countries. They include a longer transition period to implement their liberalization commitments, accelerated liberalization of sectors of interest to them, leeway to maintain a longer sensitive list, favourable ROO, revenue compensation for losses arising from trade liberalization, and technical assistance and capacity-building. However, most of these are \u2018best endeavour\u2019 commitments and lack enforceability (Adhikari, 2004a). Moreover, there are several other impediments to promoting regional trade, particularly from the perspective of the LDCs, including structural and institutional constraints, supply- Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 7 side constraints and geographical constraints. These practical issues are eschewed in discussions about SAFTA or even within SAARC. Finally, it has been argued by several commentators that the real benefit of SAFTA, particularly for the LDCs, lies in liberalization of services and investment (Zaman, 2008; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008; Bhatt, 2006). But the slow progress in negotiations on services, coupled with the apathy of trade officials to include the investment issue on the agenda in discussions on SAFTA, has raised serious concerns among the LDCs about the potential of SAFTA to provide any meaningful benefits to their economies. 1.2 Human development context South Asia is the region with the largest concentration of poverty. The human development indicators for South Asian countries are higher than those for most sub-Saharan African countries but much lower than those for many developing countries with comparable per capita incomes. According to UNDP (2009), of the eight countries in the region, seven were in the category of countries with a medium human development index (HDI) and their rankings, out of 182 countries, were: Maldives (95), Sri Lanka (102), Bhutan (132), India (134), Pakistan (141), Nepal (144) and Bangladesh (146). Afghanistan is the only country in the region with a low HDI (181). These poor rankings notwithstanding, a comparison of the HDIs of the five countries in the region, for which data are available since 1975, shows that they have consistently improved their performance. For example, Sri Lanka improved its HDI performance from 0.619 in 1975 to 0.759 in 2007, and Bangladesh improved its HDI performance from 0.301 to 0.543 over the same period (UNDP, 2007: 172-173). SAFTA aims to promote economic development in the region, create an environment for helping its member countries tackle poverty alleviation and, above all, raise the living conditions of their people. SAFTA should not be viewed in isolation but rather as part of a broader regional cooperation arrangement, as provided for in the SAARC Charter. That charter strives, \u201cto promote the welfare of the peoples of South Asia and to improve their quality of life\u201d as well as \u201cto accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region and to provide all individuals the opportunity to live in dignity and to realise their full potentials\u201d (SAARC, 1985).

As discussed earlier, the present provisions of SAFTA and developments to date suggest that these provisions have been nothing more than \u2018best endeavour\u2019 clauses. Even if serious efforts are made to level the playing field for South Asian LDCs, severe capacity constraints prevent them from deriving the benefits that SAFTA offers. While some of the constraints relate to the underprovisioning of public goods due to limited resources as well as governance failures at the domestic level, others are regional in nature. Therefore, there is a need to probe deeper into the nature and magnitude of the constraints facing the LDCs in order to create an environment conducive to their meaningful participation in the SAFTA implementation processes and their outcomes. This does not absolve the LDC governments from discharging their responsibilities. It is equally important for them to provide adequate public goods in order to, inter alia, enable business enterprises to take advantage of market access opportunities available under the arrangement, develop strong human capabilities for enhancing productivity and enable those who lose their livelihoods because of trade liberalization to adjust to the changing environment. The last goal calls for safety nets, alternative employment opportunities and retraining facilities, all of which are generally underprovided in the LDCs (see also UNDP, 2006: 25). 1.3 Justification for the study A number of studies have analysed the potential implications of SAFTA and have provided some policy recommendations on how to make SAFTA a powerful mechanism for regional integration (see, for example, Rahman, Shadat and Das, 2006; Kelegama and Adhikari, 2007; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008; ADB/UNCTAD, 2008). One study has focused exclusively on the impact of SAFTA on the weaker economies of the region and has proposed some measures to help this group of countries benefit from SAFTA (Razzaque, 2008a). However, none of these studies have: a) focused exclusively on the LDCs and analysed the constraints that prevent their successful integration into the regional economic mainstream; and b) analysed the human development implications of the current pattern of regional economic integration, particularly for the LDCs. This study aims to fill these two gaps. The study developed two fundamental hypotheses and tested them based on available facts and figures. First, despite the political rhetoric, the current process of regional trade integration under SAFTA is indifferent, if not inimical, to the conditions and needs of its LDC members. If corrective measures are not taken, these LDCs are likely to be further marginalized in the RTA. Second, the modalities and pace of regional trade integration under SAFTA do not sufficiently take into account the human development objectives of the SAARC Charter. SAFTA on its own cannot contribute to improving human development, particularly in the LDCs of the region. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 9 1.4 Organization of the study This study is divided into eight chapters. Chapter II reviews some of the major existing literature on the costs and benefits of various RTAs, particularly South-South RTAs, with a special focus on the South Asian LDCs. Chapter III sets out the trade policy context for the South Asian countries and assesses the progress made in regional trade integration. A special focus of this chapter is on the implications of SAFTA for LDC participation in the system. Identifying impediments to the effective participation of South Asian LDCs in SAFTA implementation processes and outcomes is the focus of chapter 4, while chapter 5 presents a critical assessment of the efforts made so far, including various regional and subregional initiatives, for better integrating the LDCs into SAFTA. Chapter VI discusses the potential role of SAFTA in promoting human development objectives, particularly for the benefit of the LDCs of the region. Chapter 7 offers some specific recommendations on a possible agenda for action for ensuring a meaningful participation of the LDCs in SAFTA processes and outcomes as well as for helping the LDCs achieve their human development objectives through enhanced and inclusive regional trade.

Following this, Austria signed bilateral FTAs with five of its neighbours in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The first transcontinental trade agreement in the form of a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation was signed between the United States and France in 1778 (Pomfret, 2002:18). Later, when Britain was promoting free trade globally during the period of its hegemonic ascendency, it made use of \u201cimperial preferences\u201d as a means of enticing its colonies and dominions to engage in trade with itself as well as to maintain its political clout with these entities. The prevalence of imperial preferences as well as various forms of PTAs in the years prior to the signing of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947 led to considerable debate between the proponents of such a trade policy (United Kingdom) and those sceptical of such an arrangement (the United States) at the time of drafting the GATT. Finally, due to the United Kingdom\u2019s strong stance on this issue, the United States agreed not only to grandfather6 imperial preferences in the GATT but also to have a major exception to the MFN principle included in the treaty in the form of Article XXIV.7 A number of integration arrangements were formed during the 1950s and 1960s \u2014 a period sometimes referred to as the era of \u2018old regionalism\u2019 (Ethier, 1998: 1149) \u2014 but most of them either did not survive or became dormant. However, the European Economic Community (EEC), established in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome, has not only survived but also considerably deepened and broadened its coverage. Started initially with six countries, it was later renamed the European Union (EU) and is now the largest regional grouping in the world, with 27 members. It is also the only grouping that has achieved close to full integration. Several authors, including Adam Smith, had written about the costs and benefits of GDAs, including PTAs, RTAs, FTAs and CUs. It was Jacob Viner (1950) who provided a powerful tool 6 In public international law, the new treaties and provisions of the treaties normally prevail over the previous treaties, norms or practices. In some exceptional circumstances, some provisions of the old treaty, norms or practices are carried forward, despite their being somewhat incompatible with the new treaties or their provisions. This process is known in public international law as \u2018grandfathering\u2019. 7 Article XXIV of the GATT titled \u2018Customs Union\u2019 deals with the legal bases, processes and requirements of the regional economic integration arrangements, such as preferential trade agreement, free trade agreement and customs unions (see WTO,1999). Chapter 2 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 11 to analyse the costs and benefits of these arrangements, particularly CUs. By labelling GDAs as second-best instruments for trade liberalization, Viner\u2019s theory on customs unions took \u2018trade creation\u2019 and \u2018trade diversion\u2019 effects of any GDA as the touchstone for evaluating its net benefits. Trade creation occurs when a reduction of preferential tariffs leads to the replacement of high-cost domestic products by imports from partner countries within the trade arrangement. Trade diversion takes place when a reduction of tariffs on imports from partner countries leads to the displacement of products hitherto supplied by the lowest- cost supplier simply because that supplier happens to fall outside the trade arrangement. Although Viner did not pass judgement on the beneficial or harmful effects of CUs, suggesting instead that these arrangements should be considered on a case-by-case basis, his preference for multilateral, non-discriminatory tariff reductions was clearly reflected in his analysis. A number of authors subscribed to Viner\u2019s insight, which is proof of the rapid acceptance and subsequent generalization of his theory and a basis for the criticism of GATT Article XXIV (see Pomfret, 2002: 180). However, an obvious limitation of Viner\u2019s theory was its sole focus on the static effects of integration (i.e. the short-term trade effects resulting from the removal of trade barriers within a particular region). Viner did not look at the dynamic effects of trade liberalization nor did he explore the possibility of firms adapting to the conditions resulting from changes in demand and supply (Andreosso-O\u2019Callaghan, 2005: 55).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a67e180-ebf7-4180-b2b5-55d073c7c9be": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a67e180-ebf7-4180-b2b5-55d073c7c9be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bbd9a5ea40591e7299ca9fe9e591ce5b176055bfbd29bd43ae1b982334c640e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba354540-96fb-4f9e-9b6e-16729ac0e5c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52cc67537e3c310139a93facd7ae26ddcbddf8f3a93bbd91e4a53b09814013f5"}}, "hash": "4debd2df200d565a415c3f352f4f1cf5276bb0ba0648e2747938bb6cea5a3344", "text": "This led to the emergence of new ideas that began to challenge the traditional CU theory, with the major intellectual spur provided by a \u2018new trade theory\u2019 based on models of imperfect competition.

These arrangements, which are considered part of the \u2018new regionalism\u2019, not only liberalized \u2018substantially all the trade\u2019 within the meaning of GATT Article XXIV but also went beyond the removal of tariff barriers. They are clearly GATT- plus in nature, focus on broader and deeper integration (including the removal of NTBs and restrictions on trade in services and investment) and cover a fairly broad range of areas, from competition policy and labour and environmental standards to the harmonization of regulatory standards.8 Regional groupings in Europe are considered pioneers in the growing trend towards regionalism, followed by those in Africa and Latin America, while those in North America and Asia \u2013 particularly the latter \u2013 are seen as latecomers. The United States began considering RTAs only in the 1980s with the start of talks for the formation of NAFTA, and in Asia, the only serious regional arrangement is ASEAN, established initially as a political platform rather than an economic one. The North-East Asian countries of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea joined the trend towards regionalism much later. In the era of the new regionalism, these Asian countries, considered adherents of multilateralism, have also joined the regionalism frenzy that has gripped the world. Similarly, all the countries of South-East 8 See Ethier (1998) for a detailed economic analysis of the \u2018new regionalism\u2019. 12 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Asia as well as South Asia are now members of some RTA or PTA. As noted by Sally (2008: 123), \u201cNow that Asia is playing catch-up, with PTA initiatives spreading like wildfire in the past six years\u201d, there has been a massive surge in the number of RTAs, especially since the early 1990s. Some 462 RTAs were notified to the GATT/WTO by February 2010, of which 271 agreements were in force.9 Some argue that this is due to the slowness of the multilateral process in liberalizing trade, but others disagree, stating that there is no empirical evidence to support this contention (Nanda, 2008). Yet others are of the opinion that it is multilateral trade liberalization that has contributed to the growth of regionalism (Ethier, 1998). As far as the reach of the RTAs is concerned, the integration process is not confined to a particular geographic area; it has moved beyond the regional level to include transregional trading arrangements. These new integration projects, which could have a potentially significant impact on global trade and investment, have been proliferating of late (Cernat, 2003: 3). Three examples are particularly noteworthy. First, the EU, which was initially confined to Western Europe, has now moved eastwards, encompassing, among others, several transition economies. Second, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, which aims to develop into a more global arrangement than any other of its kind, encompassing countries as diverse as Canada, China, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States, is an example of a transcontinental RTA. Finally, NAFTA seems poised to expand southwards as well as reach out to the Caribbean island countries, to form a gigantic Free Trade Area of Americas. Although the latter two arrangements are not progressing as rapidly as the former, they have a considerable symbolic value. Similarly, bilateral trade agreements (BTAs) are assuming transregional proportions, with, for example, the United States signing FTAs with such diverse countries as Singapore and Morocco, and Chile signing FTAs with Australia and the Republic of Korea. 2.2 Economic analysis of RTAs Contemporary economic analyses of RTAs fail to take into account several new dynamics, though Viner\u2019s theory is invoked time and again. With the growing number of RTAs, opinions differ among trade economists as to whether RTAs are \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d or \u201cstumbling blocks\u201d (in the words of Bhagwati (1999)), to multilateral trade liberalization, though they tend to be virtually unanimous that global trade liberalization is the ultimate objective because it tends to be welfare-enhancing.

He contended that an RTA could be used as a device through which regionalism could be employed to accelerate progress towards global trade liberalization and rule-making, and he viewed APEC as a model of \u2018open regionalism\u2019.10 A major analytical contribution to the concept of \u2018open regionalism\u2019 was provided by Baldwin (2000), who argued that the expansion of RTAs was due to the \u2018domino effect\u2019, whereby countries outside the RTAs, which felt worse off after the formation of the RTAs by other countries, would have a strong incentive to join the club. He cited the examples of the EU and NAFTA to explain his theory. He also predicted in 2001 that the domino effect would assume even greater significance in Asia in the future,11 which is borne out by developments in the previous decade, as previously noted (see Sally, 2008: 123). Later, an empirical study by Sapir (2001: 386) found that the \u2018domino effect\u2019 played a major role in the expansion of the EU. The domino theory is in part influenced by the \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 theory developed by Wonnacott (1990), which is yet another major theoretical contribution to the regionalism debate. This theory was developed when the United States was about to enter into an FTA with Mexico. Because Canada already had an FTA with the United States, the former felt that in entering into an FTA with Mexico, the United States would become the hub with Canada and Mexico operating as spokes, which would make Canada worse off. Baldwin (2000) believed that it was to prevent this situation that Canada proposed a regional FTA encompassing all three countries in North America, thereby giving birth to NAFTA. The current wave of intraregional FTAs in South Asia, with India assuming the role of the hub and the other countries in the region vying to sign FTAs with India acting as spokes, is reminiscent of the pattern mentioned above. The opposing camp, which views RTAs as stumbling blocks to multilateral trade liberalization, has been led by Jagdish Bhagwati (1995). He likened the overlapping RTAs and the rules governing such arrangements to a \u2018spaghetti bowl\u2019 and considered the revival of regionalism as an unfortunate development. Expanding on these arguments, Panagariya (1999) argued that due to their high visibility and resultant possibility to energize and unify protectionist lobbies as well as drain the negotiating capital, particularly in poorly endowed countries, RTAs tended to be more damaging to multilateral trade liberalization. Together with Srinivasan (1997), he criticized the idea of \u2018open regionalism\u2019 as an oxymoron. The practical problems of this concept have been highlighted by the current status of APEC and the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC), where progress has been far from satisfactory (Kelegama, 2002). 10 Bergsten was Chair of the Eminent Persons Group of APEC (See Kelegama and Adhikari, 2002). 11 Based on a personal conversation with the author on 22 January 2002 at the World Trade Institute, Bern (Kelegama and Adhikari, 2002; 2007). 14 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement According to other, more nuanced views, RTAs can be building blocks to multilateral trade liberalization, and indeed, regionalism and multilateralism can complement each other, provided certain conditions are fulfilled. One of the proponents of this view is Das (2001), who argued that the favourable impact of an RTA is subject to the proviso that it is able to achieve a deeper degree of economic integration than the multilateral trading system. Ethier (1998) was of the view that regionalism, by internalizing an important externality, plays a key role in expanding and preserving the liberal trading order. Together with Hoekman (1995), whose study focused on services liberalization at the regional and multilateral levels among countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Either (1998) viewed regionalism and multilateralism as complementary rather than competitive. Similarly, an empirical study conducted by the World Bank (2000) on trade creation and trade diversion effects of RTAs also underscored the complementarity between regionalism and multilateralism.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a758bc72-5709-4829-82b3-ec616b11b565": {"__data__": {"id_": "a758bc72-5709-4829-82b3-ec616b11b565", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "205c1438683aa7681b78370eeb1cf0f4f4df78d486e9eb6827ed6d4f27d9aed4"}, "2": {"node_id": "9387224a-c71e-4f4d-a711-740154245947", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca2ed90aebb287e90f9aa16cf9ba19d8e5814b8527008c67429ba269abaa672d"}}, "hash": "5d4d42944b39428823c4a492bbd6673a7b0a2c5e62f86ae7e79f28828b3b389d", "text": "The study revealed that in four of the seven countries analysed, there was no significant trade diversion, but in three countries the problem of trade diversion was noticeably large.

The present study takes this as the conceptual basis for analysing the potential impact of RTAs. 2.3 Nature, contours and economic analysis of South-South RTAs There could be a theoretical justification for arguing that South-South RTAs, unlike North- South ones, are not beneficial for the participating countries, particularly the weaker ones. Indeed, there is even some empirical support for this argument. This can be due to one or more of the following factors. First, in most South-South RTAs the share of intraregional trade is low. For example, in 2008, this share was 25 percent in ASEAN, 14 percent in Mercosur and 8 percent in the Andean Community (WTO, 2008a: 3). In the case of SAFTA, the figure was even lower, at 4.8 percent (IMF, 2010). Meanwhile, the shares of intraregional trade in North-South regional integration arrangements, such as the EU and NAFTA, are 68 percent and 51 percent respectively (WTO, 2008a: 3). Given the low volume of South-South intraregional trade, there is little incentive for the member countries to expand their trade through RTAs. Second, most members of South-South RTAs tend to compete for the same markets \u2013 mostly industrialized-country markets. A classic example is that of textile and clothing exports from South Asian countries, which are concentrated in the two largest markets in the world \u2013 the EU and the United States. This, as the argument goes, could create a sense of competition rather than cooperation among the members of South-South RTAs. Third, implementing an RTA is a costly exercise, entailing high coordination costs to administer strict ROO requirements and implement reform measures. Such measures require not only Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 15 financial resources but also human resources, technical expertise and skills. Because these resources are limited or scarce in developing countries and LDCs, RTAs formed exclusively within and among them tend to be rather ineffective (Kelegama and Adhikari, 2002: 16). Fourth, unlike the North, for many countries in the South, trade taxes are an important source of government revenue, which may decline when they become members of an RTA. This could occur directly as tariffs on intra-FTA trade are reduced and also indirectly when trade diversion occurs, such as when importers switch from importing goods from countries outside the RTA that are subject to tariffs (ibid.). In the context of SAFTA, loss of tariff revenue was a major fear expressed by the LDCs in general and Maldives in particular, where import duties make a significant contribution to government revenues: In 2005, such duties accounted for about 69 percent of the tax revenue and 31 percent of total revenue (Government of Maldives, 2006: 12). Fifth, asymmetric trade creation and trade diversion, resulting from wide disparities in the economic size of the member countries, means that the relatively advanced members gain proportionately more than the relatively weaker members (Razzaque, 2008a). The World Bank (2000) and Venables (2003) cite two East African countries \u2013 Kenya (more competitive) and Uganda (less competitive) \u2013 as examples to support this point. Kenya was able to export more because of improved access to the Ugandan market, whereas Uganda not only lost because of the flooding of its domestic market by Kenyan imports that hurt its domestic manufacturers but also because it could not compete in the Kenyan market (even at zero duty) due to Uganda\u2019s greater comparative disadvantage. This led to income divergence, unlike in the case of RTAs among rich (or less poor) countries, where income convergence has taken place (e.g. Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain after joining the EU) (see, for example, Ben-David, 1993 and 1996). Therefore, within South-South RTAs, poorer countries, which are at a comparative disadvantage, are less likely to cooperate with one another. In fact, the collapse of the East African Common Market in 1977 is ascribed to the failure of poorer countries like Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania to reap the benefits of trade liberalization because the entire benefits accrued to the relatively higher income country, Kenya.

Moreover, given the fact that the relatively more advanced countries tend to engage in more RTAs, weaker economies may suffer from possible trade deflection and preference erosion in the more advanced partner-country markets (Razzaque, 2008a). The weaker members thus face the possibility of being neglected, both as a market and as a supplier. Recent analyses, both theoretical and empirical, which are critical of the preceding arguments, albeit in an indirect manner, tend to suggest that South-South RTAs can be welfare enhancing. Further, based on new insights, these studies also argue that, if appropriate measures are put in place, RTAs can offer considerable advantages even to the weaker economies. Each of these arguments is discussed below. First, the arguments relating to North-South versus South-South trade agreements, despite having a sound theoretical backing, are not always supported empirically. Examples provided in most of the literature either cite the EU (which represents a rather extreme case of a North-South trade agreement) or the East African Common Market (which is another extreme case of a South-South trade agreement). Many of the analyses have not looked at other South-South trading arrangements to validate their findings. A study by Cernat (2003), which evaluated the impact of South-South trade agreements on intraregional trade flows as well as trade flows with countries outside the RTAs (non-members), came up with different findings. The study used a gravity model to analyse the ex post trade effects of seven South-South RTAs, namely the AFTA, the Andean Community, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The results show that five of the seven South-South RTAs examined have been not only trade creating but also trade expanding, increasing overall trade even with third countries, sometimes quite significantly. The only exceptions are the Andean Community and Mercosur, where trade with non-members seems to have fallen, although they have achieved an increase in intraregional trade. The same study used a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for an ex ante analysis of a Framework Agreement on a Trade Preferential System among the Member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and found that despite some potential for trade diversion, the net effect would be trade creation (ibid.). Another empirical analysis conducted by Sanguinetti, Pantano and Posadas (2003) on Mercosur, focusing on the export diversification of Argentina within the region, suggests that the country has been able to take significant advantage of tariff liberalization, particularly in Brazil. The share of Argentina\u2019s exports to the Mercosur region as a whole has increased vis-\u00e0-vis third countries, suggesting that the South-South trade agreement has been beneficial for Argentina. These views are also supported by Nanda (2008), who argues that when countries at a similar level of economic development dismantle trade barriers, the negative effects in the form of deindustrialization, if any, get evenly distributed. He further suggests that the existing firms secure bigger market shares, which helps them increase Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 17 their competitiveness through economies of scale. This is evident from their enhanced exports not only within the region but also outside (ibid.).

In ASEAN, Japanese investment-driven exchanges have contributed to stimulating intraregional trade. ASEAN also started with limited complementarities in the 1970s, with the share of intraregional trade being only 6 percent, but by exploiting the investment-trade nexus, it has managed to increase its intraregional trade share to 25 percent at present.

These experiences, whereby dormant complementarities are invigorated through investment, have been well documented in the literature (ibid.). Third, some of the studies that contend that South-South RTAs are not beneficial for the participating countries have not explored the possibilities offered by those agreements for exploiting the complementarities within the region through \u2018slicing up the value chain\u2019 and achieving overall growth in the trade of those RTAs with third countries. One such example is South Asia, where tremendous potential exists for such cooperation in the textiles and clothing (T&C) sector (Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007). Similarly, Sawhney and Kumar (2008) suggest that there may still be scope for intra-industry trade, despite similar factor endowments and productivity levels, due to differences in skill levels and specialization. And Weerakoon and Thennakoon (2006) argue that the important structural changes that have taken place in intraregional trade in the recent past may be important indicators of future trends, including enhanced intra-industry trade. Increased value addition in the region, particularly in the T&C sector, could help several countries in the region that lack well-developed backward linkages to fulfil the ROO requirements, for example, of the EU on clothing exports, through \u201cregional cumulation\u201d (Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007). Fourth, the supply capacities of the LDCs are, by definition, limited. However, by assuming that these countries will never be able to improve their supply capacity in the future, despite global initiatives such as the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance (IF, which has now moved to the \u2018Enhanced IF\u2019 (EIF) stage) and \u2018aid for trade\u2019, the studies 18 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement may be underestimating the possible growth in the future supply capacities of the relatively weaker economies within South-South trade arrangements.13 Fifth, the role of S&D treatment, whereby the LDCs are often allowed some leeway in the commitments they are required to make and are provided with deeper concessions as well as compensatory transfers, is often ignored in most mainstream discussions. This may be because some mainstream trade economists (see, for example, Srinivasan, 1999; Sally, 2008) are opposed to S&D provisions, even within the multilateral trading system. The role of transfers provided by the EU to the relatively poor countries during their initial phase of integration into the EU and indeed the concept of \u2018variable geometry\u2019 adopted by the EU are often neglected in mainstream discussions. Similarly, the two-speed liberalization approach followed by ASEAN for the original members and late entrants \u2013 Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam \u2013 are often eschewed in mainstream discussions. However, Kelegama and Adhikari (2007) argue that if the regulatory framework in an RTA is correctly designed to accommodate the disparity between member countries, a small country can gain from an RTA. Citing the example of the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA, they contend that the time frame for tariff phase-out, ROO and negative lists were designed to accommodate the lower level of Sri Lanka\u2019s exports and production capacity and that this actually contributed to the success of the FTA. From the foregoing discussion, it appears that the impact of South-South trade agreements on the welfare of the participating countries seems, at best, ambiguous. The arguments of some mainstream trade economists against such agreements should be viewed with caution as new evidence unfolds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd8d288d-2176-4146-9439-ce0494e10cdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd8d288d-2176-4146-9439-ce0494e10cdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69b6fbd88ee47dad3addd5e4c3959df01540de592570ae28b307d77d1141afbe"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b3f00ff-418b-487d-8bf4-bb0c5551e12a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c12da3dab0e9602e25cac37958488f3cf65173dbacd8b3dc850f6b17032dfd1e"}}, "hash": "912a0f349ea905b13fbdc3937c434d91e32bc23724ec3beb84d5ea842b2e0b9e", "text": "Next, we examine whether or not the broad conclusion derived above is applicable in the context of South Asia. 2.4 Situating the debate in the South Asian context Earlier studies on South Asian regional trade integration tended to be relatively more optimistic about the prospects of preferential trade liberalization in the region.

They are of the view that smaller countries can gain more than larger countries from regional integration. Similarly, another study, by Pigato et al. (1997), based on CGE modelling, suggests that regional trade liberalization would generate significant welfare gains for India, but the gains to the other South Asian countries would in no way be smaller if they were to liberalize trade unilaterally. 13 See, for example, Malhotra (2006) on the potential role of aid for trade in helping developing countries in general and LDCs in particular overcome their supply-side constraints. Similarly, Adhikari (2011) suggests that, managed correctly, aid for trade could contribute significantly to alleviate supply-side constraints facing South Asian LDCs, in particular Bangladesh and Nepal. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 19 The findings of most empirical studies on trade prospects and welfare effects of RTAs within South Asia conducted after the turn of the century have been dismal. This is largely because they observe considerable trade diversion as well as asymmetric benefits from the arrangements, as noted above. A study conducted by Bandara and Yu (2003), using the GTAP model to analyse the gains from SAFTA, concludes that India would take the lion\u2019s share of gains under SAFTA, whereas the others, except for Bangladesh, would obtain only marginal gains, and Bangladesh would lose out. The study also suggests that unilateral liberalization would produce greater benefits for South Asia compared with preferential liberalization under SAFTA. Although the latter finding is also shared by Panagariya (2003), he goes on to assert that countries with low tariffs, such as Sri Lanka, would gain significantly from the formation of an FTA in South Asia at the cost of a country like India, which maintains much higher MFN tariffs. Similarly, two other studies, which make use of the gravity model to analyse the gains from SAFTA in terms of greater regional trade flows, find either no impact or an asymmetric impact. The first study, which uses an augmented gravity model, finds that Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are likely to gain from joining SAFTA, whereas Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka would lose out (Rahman, Shadat and Das, 2006). The second study, conducted by Rodriguez and Daniel (2007), predicts that the trade liberalization programme under SAFTA will have little effect, if any, on regional trade flows. Pitigala (2005) and Baysan, Panagariya and Pitigala (2006), on the other hand, contend that given the high level of protection in South Asia vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world (measured by MFN tariffs), there is a high risk of trade diversion. This underscores the need for a reduction in MFN tariffs in the region, a finding shared by Bandara and Yu (2003), Panagariya (2003) and Raihan and Razzaque (2007). The latter study, which is based on the GTAP model, estimates the trade creation and trade diversion aspects of the total welfare effects of various SAFTA scenarios. The study finds that full implementation of SAFTA will lead to welfare gains for India, Sri Lanka and the other South Asian countries, except Bangladesh, which will suffer a welfare loss. According to the study, Bangladesh\u2019s welfare loss will be driven mainly by a negative trade diversion effect (ibid.). The findings of another study, by Razzaque (2008a), which combines a qualitative analysis with three types of quantitative analyses (gravity model, CGE model and GTAP), are more or less consistent with those of Bandara and Yu (2003). He contends that the weaker economies in the region would lose out significantly from SAFTA, at least in its current form. The study shows that the losses for the weaker economies would be due to increased imports from regional partners, only a nominal increase in exports to the region and a loss of tariff revenue. The latter is estimated to be quite substantial: 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for Bhutan, 1.5 percent for Maldives and 1 percent for Nepal (Razzaque, 2008a: 10). Although the LDCs were given some leeway by being allowed to maintain longer sensitive lists, and Bangladesh and Nepal have fully exploited this provision by including 1,254 and 1,335 tariff lines in their respective lists, developing countries were found to be equally crafty 20 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement in maintaining their own sensitive lists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "840878fa-592b-4002-9692-2966963b4f03": {"__data__": {"id_": "840878fa-592b-4002-9692-2966963b4f03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c79dac8300eb714f57ac5be0333cde5c5324501b9b4f824d0ee477775ddca76f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f1fa2c7-a67e-4fb5-b837-514e2cf8f159", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb3024748697643e981ce3c3782d0c997414ffcbd36f906f85918e237d4a9e01"}}, "hash": "bfabf2580d3566d04f6bc0df9b95844456c5a72a2cd52a90eb0e1d7981809aae", "text": "While Pakistan has designated 1,191 tariff lines in its sensitive list, Sri Lanka\u2019s list includes 1,079 tariff lines.

Some of them focus on the potential offered by a formal integration arrangement, such as SAFTA, to bring a huge amount of informal trade into the formal channel (Rahman, Shadat and Das, 2006; Kelegama and Adhikari, 2007; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008). Others point to the possibility offered by SAFTA of augmenting intraregional investment flows in order to exploit the dynamic gains from trade liberalization within the region (RIS, 2004; Rahman, Shadat and Das, 2006; Kelegama and Adhikari, 2007; Razzaque, 2008a), highlighting the complementarity between trade and investment cooperation within the region (Weerakoon and Thennakoon, 2006). This is despite empirical evidence suggesting that RTAs can increase intraregional flows of foreign direct investment but that the benefits are not likely to be evenly distributed (Yeyti, Stein and Daude, 2003). On the issue of investment, the analysis made by RIS (2004) suggests that a SAARC investment area could facilitate an efficiency-seeking restructuring of industries in the region, thus enabling them to exploit economies of scale and specialization. In this event, according to the report, Sri Lanka could emerge as the region\u2019s shipping hub and also the hub for rubber-based industries, Bangladesh for energy-based industries, Bhutan for forest- based industries, India for information technology (IT) and textile industries and Maldives for fishery industries. The study does not specifically point out that Pakistan could be a hub for \u2018other textiles\u2019 (particularly those falling under Harmonized System (HS) code 63) industries and that Nepal could become a hub for herb-processing industries. An earlier study by Lama (2001), based on a report produced by Tata Economic Consultancy Services (1999) that identified 50 such sectors with investment potential in the region, also points to the country-specific investment potential of relatively larger South Asian countries. A number of studies have emphasized the possibility of SAFTA to facilitate intra-industry trade and take advantage of the global supply chain network by \u2018slicing up the value chain\u2019 in myriad sectors, such as T&C (Mukherji, 2004; Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008), agriculture and food processing (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008), and paper and plastics (Mukherji, 2004). A major area for trade cooperation, which has not been covered by SAFTA thus far, is liberalization of trade in services (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008; Razzaque, 2008a). This sector offers potential not only to bring trade in informal services to the formal sector, thereby providing the dual benefits of trade creation (Rahman, 2002; Razzaque, 2008a; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008) and increased government revenue (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008) it also offers prospects for significant trade creation. A major reason for this is the greater capacity of SAARC countries to produce and trade in certain categories of services and the availability of high-quality services in the region. Equally important is the role of new economic geography in driving the tradability of certain services and creating scope for trade and investment complementarities within the region (Chanda, 2010:15). The Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 21 services with potential for intraregional trade include energy, education, health, IT, transport and tourism (Kumar, 2008). Other areas of cooperation that could help harness the intraregional trade potential include: improving supply capacity through investment in infrastructure, particularly road transport (De, 2005), harmonizing of regulatory standards (Rahman, Shadat and Das, 2006) and trade facilitation measures, including streamlining \u2014 if not completely eliminating \u2014 procedural bottlenecks (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008). 2.5 South Asian LDCs\u2019 perspective SAFTA members include five LDCs, which are in no way homogeneous, despite being categorized by the United Nations as LDCs based on their per capita income, human assets index and economic vulnerability index (UNCTAD, 2008). In terms of size of economy, Bangladesh is much bigger than many developing countries in the world, including Sri Lanka within the region, but the vulnerability of its exports (measured by a high export concentration ratio) is greater than that of Nepal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b0cd448-579f-4981-95b4-34eab02086ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b0cd448-579f-4981-95b4-34eab02086ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f6b23adc74cd25bd819110549e98f5f782a0d398b256e0030f0167d11432fc5"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b369d0d-583e-429c-a2f7-e1b3ebdd5e6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fffa53ee21502f0d252e9d7b1a5952bfc28b558736dabd3cdd3c4ce6323812c"}}, "hash": "99e0d9d42bff8e64735e9281f2064dabe632f63c780d57bc825b91d5fe7399f8", "text": "Three landlocked countries \u2013 Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal \u2013 face different challenges, including reliance on a major transit country for their regional and international trade and therefore high transportation costs.

Despite these variations, regional trade remains an important source of external merchandise trade for the LDCs within the region. As shown in table 2.1, for three of the LDCs, intraregional trade constitutes a large proportion of their global trade: 81.8 percent for Bhutan, 63.27 percent for Nepal and 40.69 percent for Afghanistan. Bangladesh and Maldives do not have such a high degree of dependence on regional trade, because they export a major share of their merchandise to countries outside the region. Developing countries such as India and Pakistan do not trade much within the region; the share of intraregional trade in their total trade being 2.41 percent and 6.81 percent, respectively, although Sri Lanka, another developing country, trades reasonably well with its regional partners, their share being 17.33 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s total trade. Of particular note is the share of the LDCs in intraregional trade (table 2.1, column 3), which is not significant. Bangladesh\u2019s share in regional trade (14.3 percent) is the second highest after India (39.01 percent), which is due to the former being the largest importer from the region, importing close to US$4 billion in 2008. It also has a 25 percent share in total intraregional imports. 22 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Table 2 1: Regional merchandise trade of South Asian countries as percentage of overall trade, 2008 Country Intraregional trade (US$ million) Share in intraregional trade (%) Global trade (US$ million) Share of intraregional trade in global trade (%) Afghanistan 2,506 8.24 6,159 40.69 Bangladesh 4,347 14.30 37,724 11.52 Bhutan 335 1.10 409 81.80 India 11,859 39.01 491,168 2.41 Maldives 234 0.77 1,627 14.36 Nepal 2,990 9.84 4,726 63.27 Pakistan 4,191 13.79 67,800 6.18 Sri Lanka 3,939 12.96 22,730 17.33 Total 30,401 100 632,343 4.81 Source: International Monetary Fund, 2010. Note: Because data for Bhutan\u2019s trade are not available, they are calculated based on the export and import data of Bhutan\u2019s trading partners. Despite their excessive dependence on regional trade, LDCs, with the possible exception of Bhutan, are increasingly being marginalized in the SAFTA in terms of exports. Their imports from the region are increasing more rapidly than their exports to the region, with the result that their shares in intraregional exports have been shrinking, causing widening trade deficits (table 2.2). Although Afghanistan is a recent entrant to SAFTA and baseline data for Bhutan are not available, table 2.2 suggests that Bangladesh is the only LDC that has managed to increase its exports to the region more than its imports from the region. The intraregional exports of both Maldives and Nepal have failed to keep pace with the rise in their intraregional imports, while the reverse is true for developing-country members, such as India and Pakistan (Adhikari, 2010).

Within South Asia, LDCs are the worst performing countries in their level of trade integration, both globally and regionally, despite the generous preferential market access opportunities available to them. The problems faced by the South Asian LDCs in their quest for global integration are similar to those faced by them in the regional market. This chapter explores three such problems: a) their difficulties in penetrating the largest market in the region, b) preference erosion resulting from various intraregional and transregional trade arrangements being pursued by some countries in the region and c) the limited comparative advantage of South Asian LDCs in the manufacturing sector. 3.2 Macro indicators of South Asian LDCs In terms of broad economic indicators, Bhutan and Maldives rank higher than the other three LDCs. Although the per capita GDP for Maldives reached US$4,135 in 2008, for Bhutan it was US$ 1,869, and for Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal it was much lower (table 3.1). Bangladesh is the most populous LDC not only in South Asia but also in the world, with the population reaching 160 million in 2008. Afghanistan and Nepal, too, have fairly large populations, at 29.02 million and 28.18 million, respectively. Bhutan and Maldives have 686,789 and 305,027 inhabitants, respectively. In terms of size of the economy, Bangladesh is the largest among the South Asian LDCs, with a GDP of US$79,554 million, followed by Nepal (US$12,615 million) and Afghanistan (US$10,624 million). However, Bhutan and Maldives, which are considered typical small economies, have GDPs of US$1,283 and US$1,261 million, respectively.

In terms of trade-related indicators, Maldives is the most open economy, with a trade-to- GDP ratio of 194 percent, followed by Bhutan (107 percent) and Afghanistan (70 percent). Bangladesh and Nepal are moderately open, with a merchandise trade-to-GDP ratio of 49 percent and 45 percent, respectively (table 3.1). 3.3 LDCs\u2019 position in global trade The 49 poorest countries in the world are categorized by the United Nations as LDCs on the basis of three criteria, as noted earlier: low per capita income, a weak human assets index and a high economic vulnerability index (UNCTAD, 2008). These countries, which host 12 percent of the world\u2019s population, collectively account for less than 2 percent of global GDP (Bhattacharya, 2010). The economic growth rates of a significant number of LDCs have been abysmally low, and the poverty reduction effects of such growth are likely to remain weak (UNCTAD, 2007). Despite their generally lacklustre economic performance, trade integration of the LDCs over the past two decades has been one of the most rapid in history. The degree of integration of the LDCs \u2013 measured by the extent of trade liberalization \u2013 is higher than that of many high- and middle-income countries. Whether trade liberalization is measured by the level of tariff barriers and NTBs or by trade-to-GDP ratio, the LDCs are generally more liberal than some developing countries (Raihan Adhikari and Adhikari, 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22acb18b-b802-4d59-9274-a8532af810fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "22acb18b-b802-4d59-9274-a8532af810fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7caa4ea685e0fd601b27d8568e95980806f91697912931fab1aaa61f703c5617"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5089dc0-05e6-4d8b-a580-ccb3dd9fa81f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "009ffcaace6865aa37a255334d7447c5306ece6558f96be5d9bfd18eb37b6c5a"}}, "hash": "a11c6c17e6d51422edaac9c9ea918b743d49e937acb28779de11aaba177d550a", "text": "Despite their high degree of openness, the LDCs\u2019 performance in terms of increased trade (mainly export trade) to achieve sustained economic growth and poverty reduction has not been encouraging.

Both trends are attributed to the slower demand for these commodities in industrialized countries due to the global economic meltdown.

Notwithstanding these disappointing results, including asymmetric benefits, the LDCs have been making every possible effort to integrate their economies into the global economy. Of the 49 LDCs, 33 are already members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and nine others are at various stages of the accession process (Adhikari, Dahal and Pradhanang, 2008). It is not only for economic reasons that they are being driven to integrate; political economy considerations are also important, such as \u2018locking-in\u2019 domestic reform, becoming part of the global economic community and, for landlocked countries, securing predictable access to transit routes (Adhikari, 2005). The LDCs are poorly represented in the WTO, with some 20 LDCs not having any permanent representation in Geneva. Thus their ability to influence the decision-making process of the WTO is extremely weak (De Vylder, 2007: 34). Their capacity to analyse trade negotiation issues and make an informed judgement is limited, even among capital-based officials (ibid.). Most LDCs are reluctant to engage non-state actors in trade policy-making processes, although some changes have occurred recently in select countries (Rajkarnikar, 2005). Due to growing awareness of the limited benefits the WTO has brought to their economies, they are now becoming highly vocal and have shown remarkable unity when pressing for key Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 27 demands. These general observations apply equally to the South Asian LDCs, as elaborated in the next section. 3.4 Trade policy context Overall, the trade policies of most South Asian LDCs are influenced by the prevailing orthodoxy of the time, which is why they exhibit some degree of similarity. Most LDCs followed protectionist trade policies during the heyday of import-substituting industrialization (ISI). When balance-of-payments crises led these countries to seek assistance from the Bretton Woods institutions, those institutions, guided by the Washington Consensus, \u2018advised\u2019 them to pursue policies of rapid trade liberalization. Consequently, they embarked on a path of \u2018unilateral\u2019 or \u2018autonomous\u201915 trade liberalization by substantially reducing their tariffs and NTBs16 and signed various trade agreements in order to \u2018lock in\u2019 trade liberalization. Although Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal are members of the WTO, they made different sets of commitments at the time of their accession.17 Afghanistan and Bhutan are in the process of acceding to the WTO. Four LDCs, which were among the founding members of SAARC (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal), participated in SAPTA, which was eventually converted to an FTA in the form of SAFTA.18 Afghanistan, a recent entrant to SAARC, has also become a member of SAFTA. Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal are also members of the BIMSTEC FTA (consisting of countries of South Asia and South-East Asia), which aims to reduce the tariff barriers of the participating countries19 by 2017.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02f7f897-9f27-41a1-93d1-321546b2d800": {"__data__": {"id_": "02f7f897-9f27-41a1-93d1-321546b2d800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "840b863bdfffbb889d3f4ff6064a88ba29bd1a73d70dba0fbbef73d7c6224830"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf64c450-b940-4245-8151-2a8755ec933c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1db0d8f3b4d3b628c02cbd6a08ee713851a49a1d9ea2e2dc4e986dcc2b57142a"}}, "hash": "46d78b046a63500964b96de10c5ea651fa663a2925266ac718149fee903b06b2", "text": "It is much more far-reaching than SAFTA in the sense that it not only covers trade in goods but also seeks to cover services, investment, technology and human resources (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2009). Another major similarity between Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal (apart from all three being members of the WTO) is that the composition of their exports has changed significantly in recent years, from mainly primary commodities to mainly manufactured products (UNCTAD, 2008). This achievement would not have been possible without global market imperfections in the T&C sector, a direct consequence of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA). 15 Although there are doubts as to whether these measures were truly \u2018unilateral\u2019 and \u2018autonomous\u2019 or were externally driven (see Adhikari, 2009b). 16 These are considered the main elements on which a country\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed4921ba-499b-4bc0-9663-814629a411ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed4921ba-499b-4bc0-9663-814629a411ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f27279eae369ad5d1ed3f1b1c0f3bba632f8b4177e13e301bc79720261b05ac"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d57c42b-317e-47af-bd0a-338320790a19", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3c48c788485e6433ebac3bb42e9cb8dfa57f84e46a76b8eb60fad6204a4ba0f"}}, "hash": "7e98231401843e4b3d366168ff8a7b928fadce52f4bc4def1b76cadcde94ea24", "text": "openness to external trade is measured (Rodrik, 2002). 17 For example, by virtue of being a founding member of the WTO, Bangladesh is among the countries with the lowest level of commitments. On the other hand, Nepal, having acceded to the WTO much later, in 2004, has had to make commitments that are among the highest of all the LDC members of the WTO. For a comparison of the commitments made by these two countries, see Adhikari (2005). Similarly, Maldives, which is another founding member of the WTO, was not required to make extensive commitments at the time of its accession to the WTO. However, Afghanistan and Bhutan, which are yet to become WTO members, are likely to face similar conditions to those of Nepal. 18 The seven founding members of SAFTA are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan joined later, following its entry into SAARC. 19 Members of BIMSTEC are: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indian, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand. 28 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement The MFA restricted imports from competitive countries so as to provide opportunities to relatively less competitive countries, like Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal, to enable them to take the first steps towards export-oriented industrialization.20 However, Afghanistan and Bhutan could not take advantage of this opportunity. The MFA was later integrated into the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing of the WTO and phased out in 2005, with the result that Maldives has been completely wiped off from the map of T&C-exporting countries, and Nepal is likely to face a similar fate unless it makes conscious efforts to diversify markets (Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007; Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007). Finally, all South Asian LDCs have been beneficiaries of the preferential market access facilities granted by industrialized countries. As a culmination of various efforts to facilitate the integration of developing countries into the world economy, members of the GATT decided to introduce an Enabling Clause21 into the multilateral trading system, which institutionalized the process of granting preferential market access to developing countries on a non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis. This clause, which also envisages deeper preferences for the LDCs (GATT, 1979; see also Pandey, 2003), has indeed helped several developing countries in the process of their industrial development (see, for example, Hoekman, Ng and Olarreaga, 2001; UNCTAD and Commonwealth Secretariat, 2001; Khatun, 2007). Under this arrangement, various industrialized countries have provided duty concessions to developing countries, but the EU has been at the forefront of providing preferences to the LDCs. 22 In May 2001, the EU announced a DFQF market access initiative for the LDCs, popularly known as the Everything-But-Arms (EBA) initiative. This initiative allows LDCs to export virtually everything to the EU free of duty, except for arms and ammunition and three sensitive items (rice, sugar and bananas), although later these three items were phased in. The LDCs in general have not been able to benefit substantially from this arrangement, primarily due to stringent ROO requirements.23 An analysis of the trade patterns of the South Asian LDCs suggests that, barring Bangladesh, which has done remarkably well in terms of exports of readymade garments, other LDCs are on the verge of being marginalized in the global trading system. As can be seen in table 3.3, despite having low average tariffs and liberal trade regimes, as reflected by low average applied tariffs and high trade-to-GDP ratios (shown in table 3.1), their shares in global trade remain dismally small. For example, Afghanistan and Bhutan have minuscule shares in world trade, particularly world exports, which are not even captured by the global trade data up to two decimal points. Even a high-performing exporter such as Bangladesh has only a 0.02 percent share in global exports, despite its being home to 2.67 percent of humanity. 20 For further details, see Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007. 21 This clause is more formally known as Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries\u201d (GATT, 1979). 22 For further details, see Inama, 2002 and UNCTAD, 2004.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d57c42b-317e-47af-bd0a-338320790a19": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d57c42b-317e-47af-bd0a-338320790a19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f27279eae369ad5d1ed3f1b1c0f3bba632f8b4177e13e301bc79720261b05ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed4921ba-499b-4bc0-9663-814629a411ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e98231401843e4b3d366168ff8a7b928fadce52f4bc4def1b76cadcde94ea24"}}, "hash": "f3c48c788485e6433ebac3bb42e9cb8dfa57f84e46a76b8eb60fad6204a4ba0f", "text": "22 For further details, see Inama, 2002 and UNCTAD, 2004. 23 See, for example, Inama, 2002 and Khatun, 2007.

This is because when SAPTA was launched as a precursor to SAFTA, the positive list approach adopted for the liberalization of tariffs allowed little progress on trade liberalization. It was at a time when competing South-South RTAs (such as AFTA and Mercosur) were moving rapidly to dismantle trade barriers. The four rounds of SAPTA negotiations revealed that while the participating countries appeared to be generous in terms of the number of concessions offered, the trade coverage was extremely limited (Kelegama and Adhikari, 2007). And, according to Weerakoon and Wijayasiri (2001), many of the goods for which concessions were offered for stimulating trade were irrelevant because they largely excluded the products of export interest to the trading partners. Due to the ineffectiveness SAPTA, drafters of SAFTA were more accommodating towards a negative list approach to trade liberalization. Their ambivalence was once again exposed when they decided to postpone the negotiations on sensitive goods. This encouraged protectionist interests in each country to unite in favour of maintaining extensive sensitive lists. This tendency, coupled with the mercantilist mindset of the trade negotiators, meant that allowing members to designate up to 20 percent of their tariff lines in the form of sensitive lists was just a formality with which the eighth round of the Committee of Experts (COE) meeting in Kathmandu in April 2005 dutifully complied.24 This gave a clear message that South Asians, despite their political rhetoric, were not interested in pursuing a genuine FTA. 24 Based on a personal conversation with Dr. Posh Raj Pandey, who represented the Government of Nepal at the COE meeting and decided to opt out of the negotiations because of his frustration with what he described as \u201ceverybody trying to protect their own turf\u201d and \u201ca lack of interest amongst the negotiators on liberalizing trade and contributing to meaningful regional integration.\u201d 30 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Although the LDCs were given some leeway by being allowed to maintain longer sensitive lists, and Bangladesh and Nepal have fully exploited this provision by including 1,245 and 1,310 tariff lines in their respective lists, developing countries were found to be geared towards maintaining their own sensitive lists. While Pakistan has designated 1,183 tariff lines in its sensitive list, Sri Lanka\u2019s list includes 1,065 tariff lines. Meanwhile, Bhutan\u2019s and Maldives\u2019 sensitive lists, which cover only 157 and 671 tariff lines, respectively, reflect the narrow range of goods imported by these countries. India\u2019s original sensitive list containing 884 tariff headings was relatively undersized, considering the total volume of its trade with the countries in the region (see table 5.1 in chapter 5), although products were meticulously chosen to afford adequate protection to the domestic producers in India. As discussed further on, India has unilaterally decided to reduce its sensitive list twice, which is not only commendable but also worthy of replication by other countries in the region. Perhaps of greater concern is the fact that there is no formal and binding provision in the SAFTA agreement to prune sensitive lists over time. In contrast, AFTA requires explicitly that the products on its sensitive list \u2014 called the Temporary Exclusion List \u2014 be phased out in five equal instalments. SAFTA only provides for a \u201creview\u201d of the sensitive list at least once every four years \u201cwith a view to reducing the number of items\u201d (SAARC, 2004). The underlying intention may be to prune it, but the provision is very vague and lacks \u2018teeth\u2019 in the sense of requiring member countries to reduce the number of items on their lists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d661068-c6da-4520-8f6f-dd2718390d87": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d661068-c6da-4520-8f6f-dd2718390d87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c77ff61764b28d1f4eff992ce3b2ad9b111495a96331ae18871d64699ca709d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3af79fff-b72a-4212-b18b-585670525dba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32d42e41f181ce8867b64c587f2993cb03118cf9c7b3a0cb97fb9239bdb938c5"}}, "hash": "18b9927d5bcb9e3ca550175ee780da10fa040ca231e672ec50bbb1c6eab9cab2", "text": "Given that SAFTA has left the issue of sensitive lists fairly open-ended \u2014 and even four years is a fairly long period for improvement \u2014 there is a danger that SAFTA will fall short of free trade even in the long run.25 Indeed, the trade-restricting nature of the sensitive lists was highlighted by a study commissioned by UNDP, which found that 53 percent of the actively traded goods in South Asia fall in the sensitive lists (Weerakon and Thennankoon, 2006). This implies that the market access gains envisaged by SAFTA are not likely to be realized until this issue is resolved. 3.6 Problems with LDC participation in SAFTA Before looking at the problems associated with LDCs\u2019 participation in SAFTA, it is necessary to examine overall trade within the region.

However, the LDCs are highly dependent on the regional market for their trade and particularly on the two largest economies of the region, namely India and Pakistan, which account for 92 percent of LDCs\u2019 exports and 78 percent of their imports. While Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal are significantly dependent on India for their exports and imports, Afghanistan is more dependent on Pakistan than on India, but nevertheless dependent on both these countries for more than 99 percent of its regional trade (table 3.4). Similarly, Maldives is more dependent on Sri Lanka for its exports and highly dependent on India for its imports (not shown in the table). 25 Although in 2009, the SAFTA COE decided that each participating country should reduce its sensitive list by 20 percent, the real impact in terms increasing the trade potential of the LDCs can be assessed only after the actual reductions take place.

Note: For Bhutan, see note to table 2.1. This also implies that the LDCs do not trade much among themselves, and except for Maldives, they do not even trade much with Sri Lanka, another developing-country member of SAFTA. Because these high levels of LDCs\u2019 intraregional trade concentration are considered dangerous, efforts should be made to diversify their intraregional trade. And yet, there are enormous barriers to increasing their exports to their traditional trading partners within the region, as discussed further on. 3.6.1 Difficulties penetrating the Indian market The prospects for increasing South Asian LDCs\u2019 exports to India are hampered not only by India\u2019s high MFN tariffs (37.6 percent, on average), but also by India\u2019s sensitive list that includes products of export interest to the LDCs, such as vegetable products (representing 20.2 percent of tariff lines) and textile products (representing 34.2 percent of tariff lines) (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008). As noted, for small LDCs, including Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal, India is a leading destination market. Yet India maintains the highest applied MFN tariffs on goods traded within the region compared with other markets, and only a small share of imports (by value) from the LDCs enter India duty-free (ibid.). For example, India is the second-largest export market for Afghanistan, but imports from Afghanistan face a weighted average MFN tariff of 45.5 percent in India, and only 17.8 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s imports into India are duty-free. Although on paper India has a PTA with Afghanistan, only a few items receive preferential treatment. On the other hand, the Indo-Nepal Trade Treaty is highly liberal from Nepal\u2019s perspective due to virtually non-reciprocal26 duty-free market 26 Nepal\u2019s industrial products are offered non-reciprocal zero tariff access to the Indian market; but for the primary products listed in the Treaty, reciprocity applies. 32 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement access provisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c21303d-9516-464c-84ef-181822ded842": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c21303d-9516-464c-84ef-181822ded842", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4271386d8a52f0866b6de880965c0af83e5e46833502a5f6ad06ed07468e9b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "18701016-b91b-4a76-bfb6-1413b6cd723e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c5838564017f40139918b18b2d56db5f8f8dd1178c3bd0738e0a8af403cdab2"}}, "hash": "725f6b0527048a03c718e397990983302df58a7c187fd018383c3cd7dbe4bdf5", "text": "32 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement access provisions.

Moreover, a recent and fairly comprehensive study conducted by the Centre for Policy Dialogue to explore the prospects of and analyse the impediments to a proposed bilateral trade agreement between Bangladesh and India reveals that standards-related barriers are the most frequently used NTBs in South Asia (table 3.5), a major user of which happens to be India (Rahman, 2010). This is corroborated by Raihan (2009:15), who observes: \u201cAlthough Bangladeshi exporters face some NTBs in Pakistan [the second major market for Bangladeshi exports to the region], the major NTBs they face in South Asia are in the Indian market.\u201d Table 3 5: Share of various NTBs in all NTBs imposed by South Asian countries Non-tariff measures Share (%) SPS, TBT and other related measures 86.3 Tariff quotas 9.8 Anti-dumping measures 7.4 Licence requirements 5.2 Countervailing measures 1.2 Source: Rahman, 2010, based on ADB/UNCTAD, 2008. Note: The shares do not add up to 100 percent because some products face multiple NTBs. SPS= sanitary and phytosanitary; TBT= technical barriers to trade Rahman (2010) also compares the NTBs prevalent in ASEAN with those mentioned previously and finds that technical measures and regulations, such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT), account for only 14.8 percent of the NTBs imposed on intraregional trade in ASEAN, where standards-related NTBs are 27 This becomes relevant when Nepalese exports do not meet the ROO requirement and thus become ineligible for preferential market access. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 33 mostly resolved through agreements pertaining to mutual recognition of standards and certification systems. 3.6.2 Preference erosion The LDCs in South Asia are as likely to face preference erosion at the regional level as at the multilateral level. Because India is the major market for their exports, any FTA or preferential market access arrangements India might enter into on a bilateral or multilateral basis within the region or outside the region are likely to result in preference erosion for the LDC members of SAFTA. For example, when India signed FTAs with Nepal and Sri Lanka, it resulted in preference erosion mainly for Bangladesh, although, fortunately, not of a significant magnitude. However, the FTA India is expected to sign with the EU, giving the parties preferential access to each other\u2019s markets, is likely to result in significant preference erosion for the LDCs (Razzaque, 2008a; Winters et al., 2009). Table 3.6 shows estimates of the extent to which an EU-India FTA would increase the vulnerability of other SAARC members\u2019 exports to the Indian market. As is evident from the table, Nepal and Bhutan are likely to suffer the most from increased competition from the EU (57. 5 percent in the case of Bhutan and 27 percent in the case of Nepal). This is confirmed by Winters et al. (2009), who estimate that Bangladesh is likely to lose US$102 million worth of exports and Nepal could lose US$22 million. Although Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka would suffer the most as a result of average tariff reduction in India for EU goods, in terms of percentage of total trade that is relatively vulnerable to terms-of-trade pressure, Nepal (with 17.58 percent) is likely to suffer the most, followed by Bhutan (9.96 percent).

The magnitude of that erosion has not been determined by any study so far. A study conducted by Laborde (2008), which analyses the potential impact of the granting of full DFQF market access to LDCs by five emerging economies, particularly India, estimates the losses for Nepal resulting from preference erosion to be US$7 million, though no loss is predicted for Bangladesh. 3.6.3 Limited comparative advantage in the goods sector Most LDCs in the region have a much greater comparative advantage in services than in goods, although some of them do possess a comparative advantage in certain products for export to the region. For example, Bangladesh has a comparative advantage in its exports of fish, vegetables, jute, fertilizer (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008) and light engineering products (Raihan et al., 2007) to the region, while Nepal has a comparative advantage in its exports of oilseeds, oleaginous fruits (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008) and herbal products (Raihan et al., 2007). Similarly, Bangladesh, with more than US$15 billion worth of T&C exports, has some comparative advantage in the labour-intensive segment of readymade garments, and it also has a natural comparative advantage in energy exports, which remains underutilized. Likewise, Bhutan and Nepal share a similar level of comparative advantage in hydro electricity supply, which is hugely underutilized, particularly in Nepal. The Maldives and Nepal share a comparative advantage in the tourism trade, which also is underutilized in the context of Nepal. Although most of the LDCs in the region are net importers of health and education services, they are likely to reap net benefits from trade in services (Kumar, 2008). A study commissioned by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Nepal and UNDP found that Nepal possesses a comparative advantage in high-end retail, health and education services but that potential has remained underutilized due to regulatory impediments (SAWTEE, 2008). Because services are not yet included in SAFTA, these LDCs have been unable to realize the full potential for gain from the regional trade in services. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 35 Impediments to effective participation of the LDCs in SAFTA 4.1 Introduction There is a general tendency to attribute the lower level of participation of the LDCs in RTAs to the smallness of their economies. Although standard trade theory considers small size an advantage in international trade and, by extension, in regional trade (see, for example, Thomas, 2004), it is often the smaller countries that are marginalized in trading systems and arrangements. Given the political, if not economic, imperative to help the LDCs integrate their economies into trading systems and arrangements, various forms of S&D treatment are accorded to them. As a rule, countries with large domestic markets are believed to have an advantage in trade negotiations, because they are able to use both carrot (opening up the market) and stick (threat of market closure) (see, Barton et al., 2008; Adhikari, 2009b), but small economies in general, and LDCs in particular, do not have such a bargaining lever. South Asia is uniquely positioned to defy this rule. For example, Bangladesh, despite being an LDC, has a much bigger domestic market than Sri Lanka (a developing country) and possesses significant negotiating clout in trade negotiations. To reiterate a point made earlier, all the LDCs cannot be treated alike when examining factors that impede their effective participation in SAFTA processes and outcomes. This is mainly because there are wide variations among them in terms of their geographic situation (which affects accessibility), institutional endowments (which affect regulatory quality), negotiating capital (which affects negotiation outcomes) and systems of governance (which affects political economy outcomes). Therefore, the constraints discussed in this chapter may not be applicable to all the LDCs alike; some may differ in type and others in magnitude. With these general caveats, this chapter discusses the impediments to South Asian LDCs\u2019 meaningful participation in SAFTA. 4.2 Structural and institutional constraints The LDCs, by definition, are structurally handicapped, which explains their high economic vulnerability index \u2014 one of the three criteria discussed in chapter I for the inclusion of countries in the LDC group.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f9514c4-9b0a-40a5-8577-54b568144a8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f9514c4-9b0a-40a5-8577-54b568144a8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "beccbd995e718819b11fab0703e1d7a6b6668df35be7affce81f2cabe828f1bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "7edde1f1-2610-4650-9fca-7cd2e2860a0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "052ca8a9d859ec0b7b789b93a8d2d3a9a660cc4948bbc4cba3f982b0ea095aac"}}, "hash": "285d719edf492a1ca0c1b2942c177fa5ccc6452766f76df67cf368d3183bed5f", "text": "This section revisits some of the structural constraints mentioned in previous chapters and identifies additional ones.

Therefore, the need for export diversification, in terms of both products or services as well as trading partners, is a major thrust of the trade policies of these countries. The outcomes, however, have not been encouraging so far. Several studies have shown that the quality of institutions can have a significant impact on export growth and, indeed, on overall growth of the economy (see, for example, Rodrik, 2002; Rodrik and Subramanian, 2003; Rodrik, Subramanian and Trebbi, 2004). In South Asian LDCs, institutions, in terms of their regulatory quality, the rule of law and measures for controlling corruption, tend to be of poor quality when compared with those of the developing countries of the region (table 4.1) Table 4 1: Quality of institutions in South Asia, 1998 and 2008 (estimates) Country Regulatory quality (-2.5 to + 2.5 best) Rule of law (-2.5 to + 2.5 best) Control of corruption (-2.5 to + 2.5 best) 2008 1998 2008 1998 2008 1998 South Asian LDCs Afghanistan - 1.58 -2.15 -2.01 -1.71 -1.64 -1.91 Bangladesh -0.82 -0.59 -0.7 -0.82 -1.1 -0.73 Bhutan -0.86 -0.43 0.37 0.27 0.72 0.67 Maldives -0.42 0.85 -0.24 0.4 -0.6 0.1 Nepal -0.66 -0.42 -0.76 -0.14 -0.68 -0.18 Benchmark countries India -0.21 -0.39 0.12 0.23 -0.37 -0.31 Pakistan -0.47 -0.47 -0.92 -0.73 -0.77 -0.82 Sri Lanka -0.28 0.29 -0.01 -0.11 -0.15 -0.12 Source: Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi, 2009. The estimates provided in the table indicate that only Bhutan seems to have a reasonably good quality of institutions among the LDCs. Although Maldives has better scores than other LDCs as well as Pakistan (a developing country), it seems to have neither a satisfactory regulatory quality nor a favourable institutional environment for the control of corruption. In terms of quality of institutions, the other LDCs are not only worse than the two benchmark developing countries (India and Sri Lanka) but also significantly worse than Bhutan. A comparison of the estimates for 2008 and 1998 provides some indication of the magnitude of improvement or deterioration in the institutional indicators. The comparison reveals that there has been a significant deterioration in institutional quality in most South Asian LDCs during this period. For example, in terms of regulatory quality, only one LDC \u2013 Afghanistan \u2013 has shown an improvement, whereas among developing countries, the indicator for India has improved while that for Pakistan has remained unchanged. Sri Lanka, however, seems to have experienced a sharp deterioration. As regards the rule of law, except for Bangladesh Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 37 and Bhutan, there has been a significant deterioration in all the other LDCs but less of a deterioration in two of the developing countries of the region, namely India and Pakistan, while in Sri Lanka there has been marginal improvement. With regard to control of corruption, there has been moderate improvement in Afghanistan and Bhutan but a sharp deterioration in Maldives and Nepal and moderate deterioration in Bangladesh. On the other hand, developing countries in the region have witnessed either marginal improvement (in Pakistan) or only a marginal deterioration (in India and Sri Lanka). In sum, although the estimates indicate that institutional quality in the South Asian region as a whole either deteriorated or improved only marginally in 2008 compared with 1998, the deterioration in the case of LDCs, with a few exceptions, was more pronounced than in the developing countries of the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfade712-572d-4b6a-ab97-1e27900f819f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfade712-572d-4b6a-ab97-1e27900f819f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ff2ebe007d3d98e07427870ca65a180759c41fead937bddb96f2c0df3ed6096"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d303352-e515-4fab-9e9f-1bd25cff8283", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "078912fd2bdcdabf03c950db230ded21d364e4559cdb3b0b17ce45b5fe2ac73d"}}, "hash": "f33e8a26eaec4be3de579fc92f65ae4c72077c5209f37d530185d21418006c43", "text": "4.3 Supply-side constraints Implicit in most analyses that focus on market access barriers as major handicaps preventing the LDCs from benefitting from multilateral trade (see, for example, Inama, 2002; Laird and Puri, 2005; UNCTAD and Commonweath Secretariat, 2001; Hoekman, Ng and Olarreaga, 2001; World Bank and IMF Staff, 2001) is the conjecture that the LDCs have an infinite elastic supply response that enables them to capture market for their exports once trade barriers are removed and market access is guaranteed. This also presupposes a \u2018market- based\u2019 response, whereby enterprises in the LDCs are expected to respond swiftly to market opening (see, for example, Pandey, 2006). This has not happened.

We need to help them build their capacity to supply goods of export quality\u201d. (European Commission, 2000) A number of scholars (e.g. De Vylder, 2007) have echoed these concerns. Even the DTISs \u2013 which were prepared as part of the EIF for the LDCs \u2013 have emphasized that several supply-side problems represent the biggest constraints on the LDCs\u2019 integration into the global economy (IMF and World Bank, 2005: 38). Adhikari (forthcoming) defines suppy-side constraints as \u201cconstraints on domestic productive capacity that limit the ability of a country to produce goods or services for supplying the international market in a competitive manner. Although some of these constraints are due to natural handicaps, the majority of these are owing to governance failure, implying the inability of the government to make optimal provisioning of public goods\u201d. Within policy circles, UNCTAD was one of the first international organizations to raise the issue of supply-side constraints in 1996, as reflected in its least developed countries report for that year. The report states: \u201csupply-side constraints have always been an impediment to development in the LDCs, but their importance has been heightened by globalization and liberalization because of the increasing premium on the efficient production of traded 38 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement good\u201d. (UNCTAD, 1996: III, emphasis added) Further, the entire LDC report for the year 1999 was dedicated to the issue of building productive capacities and competitiveness, in which the issue of supply-side constraints figured most prominently. The report, without underestimating the salience of market access barriers, noted: \u201cThe most pressing development concern of LDCs on the eve of the twenty-first century could be encapsulated as follows: how to address supply-side constraints to enable the countries to produce more competitively for domestic as well as international market\u201d. (UNCTAD, 1999: 74) Later, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP, 2004) brought this issue into sharper focus in the context of Asian developing economies by focusing primarily on their competitiveness (ibid.: 2). It has become even more relevant today in the context of the heightened competitiveness that is emerging as a global concern (see, for example, Krugman, 1994; Watson, 2005). An empirical analysis of the aid and trade relationship by Santos-Paulino (2007), using a sample of 17 LDCs and based on data for the period 1970\u20132001, finds that LDCs\u2019 export response to trade liberalization has been relatively limited compared to that of developing countries, primarily due to weaknesses in \u201cdomestic productive capacities\u201d. This finding is consistent with previous studies that examine constraints on LDCs\u2019 export trade (see, for example, Fugazza, 2004; Redding and Venables, 2004). Similarly, a study focusing exclusively on the Pacific island economies finds that if supply-side constraints were removed, the increase in export receipts would be very promising (Ram, Prasad and Duncan, 2005). Apart from these general studies, a specific study focusing on infrastructure and transportation costs, which are major constituents of suppy-side constraints, reveals that \u201cpoor infrastructure accounts for 40 percent of the predicted transportation cost for the coastal countries and up to 60 percent for landlocked countries\u201d (Venables and Limao, 2001: 252). In addition to traditional suppy-side constraints, the emergence of new types of constraints is adding to the burden of LDC exporters. Some of them, such as health, safety and environmental standards, are linked to market access barriers because LDCs lack the necessary infrastructure, legal systems and administrative apparatus to assure the importing countries\u2019 authorities of their ability to comply with these standards.28 And putting them in place would require resources that are often beyond the means of many LDCs. Some authors have suggested that RTAs could help LDCs overcome these constraints mainly because of their transboundary public good nature and the possibility they offer in the pooling of resources and for expertise and for devising a coordinating mechanism to address these issues at the regional level (Maur, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f49e0688-6554-483f-9550-ad85a6aa3376": {"__data__": {"id_": "f49e0688-6554-483f-9550-ad85a6aa3376", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e8f5bf43097ccfcb84e7eb35290c8cc0f7db170bb73c00597d79c3dfb9b33f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba6a898c-f9cb-499b-987c-940e606e3b89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5165c08b84e51c1efc74926c3dc1e03c913a567550e5b7d16e68bdb4af072da2"}}, "hash": "37de2c8882ee8303f32c5eefb2cb8e7ff88fa39cc6948e5d58e3195545bd45d3", "text": "There are other suppy-side constraints, such as the absence of trade facilitation measures, which are equally costly to overcome despite their unquestionable trade benefits (OECD, 2005; Wilson and Otsuki, 2005).

A study by Bin and Misovicova (2007) suggests that 34 of the 102 RTAs in the Asia-Pacific region now include such provision (cited in Maur, 2008: 16). The institutional set-up of the RTAs, particularly those involving deeper integration, seems well suited for pursuing the trade facilitation reform agenda (ibid.). Three recent studies have attempted to look at the supply-side constraints confronting South Asian LDCs with a view to considering, among others: prospects for enhancing their competitiveness in the T&C sector (Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007); prospects for the South Asian countries, including the LDCs, to unleash their export potential (both intraregional and beyond the region) in the T&C sector; and strategies that could be adopted by the Asian LDCs in general to facilitate their export diversification (Raihan et al., 2007). All these studies, which analyse the supply-side constraints faced by two South Asian LDCs \u2013 Bangladesh and Nepal \u2013 highlight the following binding constraints: \u2022\ufffd Inadequate infrastructure within the region in general and among the LDCs in particular for the efficient transportation of goods (see also De, 2005) prevents these countries from establishing a foothold in markets where efficiency of delivery is a key test to determine the sustainability of business relations.29 \u2022\ufffd The lack of human capital with the education and skills necessary to process exports means that despite low wages, South Asian workers are unable to match the level of productivity of workers in other, highly competitive countries (such as China), even in labour-intensive production (Siddiqui, 2007). \u2022\ufffd Lack of access to credit hinders the prospects of meeting working capital requirements, expanding business volumes and enhancing investments in capital goods. \u2022\ufffd The high cost of inputs resulting from the poor quality of infrastructure and the virtual absence of backward linkages increase the cost of production and thus exports. \u2022\ufffd The virtual absence of trade facilitation measures causes delays in the shipment of goods and raises costs, including in the form of unofficial payments for both imports and exports. The above studies did not quantify the magnitude of the supply-side constraints, and neither did they attempt to compare them with a set of benchmark countries in order to gauge the impact of these constraints. Such comparisons for South Asian countries are attempted here, using the World Bank\u2019s Logistic Performance Index (2010) and Trading Across Borders indicators, the latter being part of the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business Report 2010 (table 4.2). 29 In the context of the LDCs, inadequate road links (Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal), port facilities (Bangladesh) and shipping and airline infrastructure (Maldives) are of particular concern.

Similarly, trading-across-borders indicators, which are another way of measuring trade facilitation indicators, show that South Asian LDCs lag behind the developing countries of the region on a number of counts (table 4.5). Of particular note are the number of documents required and number of days needed for trading imports and exports. These are also reflected in the costs to import and export in the LDCs. It is understandable for a country like Afghanistan, which does not have sound infrastructure in place, to incur the highest costs to export (US$3,350) and import (US$3,000). Afghanistan also ranks the lowest among the countries in the Doing Business Report 2010 in terms of its trading-across-borders indicators. In the case of Nepal and Bhutan, the costs to import and export are very high \u2013 almost three times higher than the least costly exporter (Sri Lanka) and importer (Pakistan) within the region. Although the landlocked status of these countries is partly responsible for this, the lower quality of domestic infrastructure also seems to play a role in increasing their costs of trading across borders. Maldives, being an island country, is in a different situation because its costs to import and export, which incidentally are the same, are significantly Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 41 lower than those incurred by other countries due to the limited number of days required for trading across borders (table 4.3).

The problems relating to transit trade burdening the three landlocked LDCs in South Asia \u2013 Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal \u2013 reduce their competitiveness due to the increased time and cost of transportation. A landmark study by Faye et al. (2004) shows that transportation costs for landlocked developing countries are, on average, 9 percent higher than those for their maritime counterparts and that they also trade, on average, 50 percent less than the latter due to their dependence on transit-providing countries. The study identifies four types of dependence: dependence on neighbours\u2019 infrastructure; dependence on sound cross-border political relations; dependence on neighbours\u2019 peace and stability; and dependence on neighbours\u2019 administrative practices (ibid.: 31). These are discussed further on in the context of South Asian LDCs, though it should be pointed out that some of the problems relate to extraregional trade rather than regional trade. Nonetheless, these are important issues to consider because trade outside the region provides significant economies of scale and opportunities for learning by doing. 4.4.1 Dependence on infrastructure Although the quality of infrastructure facilities in India (the transit country for Bhutan and Nepal) and Pakistan (the first-tier transit country for Afghanistan) is better than that of the LDCs, and significant efforts are being made to expand and upgrade them, they are still 42 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement far inferior to those of their competitors, such as China, in several respects. For example, as illustrated by OECD (2005: 4), as a result of the delays and inefficiencies at Indian ports, Indian companies suffer a 37 percent cost disadvantage in shipping clothing from Mumbai to the United States compared with Shanghai (see also Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007:186).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "372ecd78-eb36-42e9-b807-af1dca9e5126": {"__data__": {"id_": "372ecd78-eb36-42e9-b807-af1dca9e5126", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1959a6ea3606d5425682589b9f4630032706ad863f14077d19808dec7eb75b40"}, "2": {"node_id": "db1b4b31-9026-4dd8-8a84-f5d31ab373e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8f9348c7b10aa8495a47b5f266a8e91b252367ad8d965b9f606adb6b44605f3"}}, "hash": "66dcb5b4d1dd04ab1b78ca1b8ed8e9948ffc8bc08973cca863f32df17a4f9e09", "text": "Even among the LDCs of the region, Nepal has an option to use the Chittagong port in Bangladesh for its exports, but it is heavily constrained by the inefficient operation of that port (IMF, 2007, cited in Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007:186).

Instead, trucks (which cost more) carry the bulk of inland freight: 60 percent of tons per kilometre in India and 95 percent of tons per kilometre in Pakistan. Even the paved roads that the trucks ply have low geometric standards with widths narrower than 5.5 metres, are built with bitumen macadam, have a relatively rough surface and are poorly maintained. Most roads on the trade corridors are either two lanes and/or recently upgraded to multilane, passing through urban areas with a high flow of traffic, and the trucks have to compete with pedestrians, bicycles, agricultural tractors and non-motorized vehicles, which cause congestion and lead to increased transportation costs (ibid.). 4.4.2 Dependence on sound cross-border political relations Landlocked countries have to depend on strong political ties with transit countries. \u201cIf a landlocked country and its transit neighbour are in conflict, either military or diplomatic, the transit neighbour can easily block borders or adopt regulatory impediments to trade\u201d. (Faye et al., 2004: 45) One such example is that of India, the sole transit neighbour for Nepal, imposing an embargo at the border between the two countries in 1989-1990 for political reasons.30 This caused a massive reduction of Nepal\u2019s trade with India and with its other trading partners (ibid.: 46). There are reasons to suspect that the ongoing conflict between Afghanistan and Pakistan could have similar implications for trade between these two countries as well as for regional trade. Transit countries may not have similar relations with all their landlocked neighbours and, accordingly, tend to use their negotiating power to discriminate between what they consider \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 neighbours. Faye et al. (2004: 66), for example, show how the difference in the political relations of India with its two northern neighbours \u2013 Bhutan and Nepal \u2013 has resulted in different outcomes for these landlocked countries. According to them: \u2022\ufffd Nepal and Bhutan are unique in the fact that they have only one transit neighbour, India. This implies complete dependence on India for access to the coast, giving India enormous negotiating power. Interestingly, each has a very different political relationship with India. Bhutan has enjoyed a very close working relationship with its southern neighbour and as a result has been granted liberal access to transit. In fact, India allows Bhutanese 30 During this time, Nepal bought arms from China without consulting India, which India claimed was required in accordance with the spirit of the Indo-Nepal Treaty of 1950. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 43 transit trade to be conducted under the supervision of Bhutanese customs, yielding little administrative hassle. In contrast, Nepal\u2019s relations with India have frequently been strained, with India often seen to have more influence in the negotiation of treaties and disputes. Even when there is no direct conflict, landlocked countries are extremely vulnerable to the political vagaries of their neighbours (Faye et al., 2004: 45). Although, as argued by Faye et al. (2004: 45), \u201cthere is a legal basis for rights of landlocked transit as outlined in Article125 (1) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea\u201d, this does not mean much because \u201cin practice, this right of access must be agreed upon with the transit neighbour (Article125 (2) and (3)) and is determined by the relationship between the countries\u201d. Moreover, Article V of WTO/GATT also provides for similar rights, but this has not been invoked so far, probably due to conflicting interpretations of the provision. Discussions on this issue are taking place at the ongoing Doha Round of trade negotiations of the WTO under the broad rubric of trade facilitation.

Another problem, not directly related to peace and stability but related to the fragile political environment of Nepal and neighbouring Indian states, is that whenever elections take place on either side of the border, the borders are sealed, ostensibly to prevent vote rigging. No trade takes place during these periods. 4.4.4 Dependence on administrative practices Transit countries\u2019 transportation management, administrative and customs-related policies are prepared with certain objectives that suit their own socio-economic and political realities, the shaping of which the neighbouring landlocked countries have no role (UNCTAD, 2004). Therefore, traders in such landlocked countries have no choice but to adapt to those formalities, even if they add to the cost of trading across the border. In the context of Africa, for example, Gupta and Yang (2007: 401) observe that RTAs in general have not generated the expected benefits for the landlocked countries of the region because their coastal neighbours have more often than not created administrative obstacles (customs procedures) in addition to physical ones (roadblocks), resulting in excessively 44 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement high transit costs. Transit costs can be both official and unofficial. The official costs include customs duties and costs associated with loading and unloading of consignments at the border, while the unofficial costs can be bribes to customs officials. Apart from these costs, which are fairly straightforward, international transit also requires burdensome paperwork and bureaucratic procedures that impose an additional cost burden on exporters (Faye et al., 2004: 47). Border crossings also cause long delays in transit time and, as argued by Faye et al. (2004: 48), \u201cIt is regularly noted that the time delays and the variability of time in transit are a greater concern to traders than direct costs, as they hinder the ability to meet delivery contracts without large inventory stocks.\u201d This concern is particularly justified in the context of the finding that each day saved in the shipment to goods is equivalent to a 0.8 percent saving on ad valorem duty (Hummels, 2001). In addition to the costs associated with landlockedness, a mountainous terrain can pose another geographical constraint, adding further to the vulnerability of countries like Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal, for two main reasons. First, road construction to facilitate relatively cheaper means of transport (i.e. surface transport) is highly cost-intensive. Even within this category, rail transport is cheaper, but Bhutan does not have any domestic rail network, Nepal has a very limited and dilapidated rail line along a minor section of Indian border towns, and Afghanistan has short spur rail lines that link with railways in adjoining countries (World Bank, 2008:17). Therefore, most parts of these countries are linked only by air transport, adding hugely to the cost of trade for exporters. Second, due to the scattered locations of buildings, farmlands and unorganized business establishments, it is not cost- effective to provide utilities such as electricity and telephone connections to export-oriented industries and enterprises. This also adds to their cost of trade, preventing their access to the national market, let alone regional and international markets (Adhikari, 2005). This is not to suggest that LDCs located in coastal areas are in a particularly advantageous position. Those located far from the major ports, city centres and markets suffer severe cost disadvantages, even if they use their own ports. Further, they may sometimes depend on ports in neighbouring countries if their volumes do not justify enough ship calls (UNCTAD, 2004). Although Maldives, being an island economy, does not face such a huge cost disadvantage as other landlocked South Asian countries, a diagnostic trade integration study (DTIS) conducted as part of the IF found that transportation costs are a major problem (Government of Maldives, 2006). The major export of Maldives \u2013 fish \u2013 is a perishable item and the competitiveness of fish exports depends on the ability of the country to transport these products to regional and international markets within a short time span. The country lacks an interchange facility with appropriate infrastructure and amenities to ensure quick and efficient movement of goods from foreign-going ships to domestic boats and vice versa. Another form of swift transportation is airlifting the consignments, which, besides being costly, has not been possible due to limited air connectivity between atolls and international airports and lack of cold storage facilities at the main landing sites (ibid.).

While FTAs between India and Nepal, and India and Bhutan predate the formation of SAARC, some of the relatively recent ones, such as the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA, the Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA and the Bangladesh-Bhutan Trade Agreement, seem to be a reaction to the frustration with the slowness of the SAPTA processes. Therefore, as Weerakoon and Thennakoon (2008: 13-14) argue, those countries that were impatient to gain access to important markets within the region and to compete for securing \u2018first-mover\u2019 advantage decided to opt for \u2018fast-track\u2019 liberalization options. The major impetus for such bilateral trade agreements was provided by the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA, signed in 1998, which opened up markets in a selective but substantial manner. Now that both the countries have shown interest in moving beyond trade in goods by signing a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, this Agreement is poised to surpass SAFTA on all counts and create disincentives, particularly for Sri Lanka, to engage in negotiations on SAFTA\u2019s \u2018goods only\u2019 framework (see also Weerakoon, 2007). Similarly, Sri Lanka signed an FTA with Pakistan in 2002, which has been in operation since 2005. This FTA is modelled on the Indo-Sri Lanka FTA, with a few differences in the concessions provided, depending on the products of export interest and on the political economy factors in each country (ibid.). Discussions are now under way on possible FTAs between Bangladesh and Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as well as India and Bangladesh. A World Bank (2006) study suggests there are few, if any, commercial benefits from India signing a bilateral FTA with Bangladesh, however. The competitive FTA frenzy that has gripped the region has several economic and political implications. Some of these are similar to the ones expressed in the heated debate on multilateralism versus regionalism, which has been discussed extensively elsewhere (see, for example, Kelegama and Adhikari, 2007). They deserve some mention here as well, not least because they need to be situated in a broader theoretical context. These discussions centre around first, the issue of whether the two modes of liberalization (regional versus bilateral) that competitive or complementary in nature, and second, the politics of regional cooperation in South Asia and bilateral trade relations among the countries that have signed FTAs with each other. 4.5.1 Nature of trading arrangements Akin to the arguments expressed in the largely inconclusive debate on whether regional trade integration is a \u2018building block\u2019 or \u2018stumbling block\u2019 to multilateral trade liberalization, similar arguments can apply to the spate of FTAs within the region. Most studies suggest that bilateral FTAs within South Asia are acting as \u2018stumbling blocks\u2019 to regional trade integration for the following reasons: 46 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Mini spaghetti bowl: Numerous bilateral FTAs with regional trading partners are likely to create a \u2018mini spaghetti bowl\u2019, with overlapping rules governing each bilateral FTA, SAFTA and the WTO. This is akin to the \u2018spaghetti bowl\u2019 phenomenon observed by Bhagwati (1995) in the context of regionalism in general. Added to this is the fact that five countries in the region are also members of another transregional trading arrangement \u2013 the BIMSTEC FTA. This will not only complicate trading arrangements within the region but will also dampen the prospects of using trade liberalization as a tool for enhancing the flow of cross-border investments (Weerakoon, 2007). Hub and spoke pattern: There is a clear \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 pattern emerging within the region, a concept developed by Wonnacott (1990), as discussed earlier in the context of North America. Applied in the context of South Asia, India seems to be emerging as a hub, while some of the other countries, such as Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka (and probably Bangladesh in the near future), are emerging as spokes. One of the major implications of this pattern is the hegemonic role of the hub, which has the power to alter the negotiating dynamics, which raises concern among the spokes. Weaker countries, in particular the LDCs, are at a greater disadvantage when negotiating with a much stronger trading partner, compared with what they might achieve if all the member countries negotiated on a regional basis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beb5604f-a575-4324-9810-e98d976eb60a": {"__data__": {"id_": "beb5604f-a575-4324-9810-e98d976eb60a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37cb676baf962c092d0f497633283dbec1c0e587c634dfa88a361d25be4270c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3ab193c-b947-456a-8f7e-dcba60a6cb2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5a163359f81fe034e14caedeb30cca238330be90a874137d8b6330eeb0a8fad"}}, "hash": "48e918e15fac36f392363b82d919fd764a2a70f32c2e3548aae8162c425f73c3", "text": "This resembles what is currently happening when developing countries (weaker partners) sign bilateral FTAs with powerful industrialized countries, such as the United States, or with groupings such as the EU or the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).

This is bound to have a deleterious impact on SAFTA negotiations, which are becoming less and less attractive for countries that have signed FTAs with India, the largest market in the region. Trade creation versus trade diversion: Admittedly, there has been some \u2018trade creation\u2019 particularly between India, on the one hand, and Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka on the other, although to a lesser extent between Pakistan and Sri Lanka (Adhikari, 2009a). It is equally important to note, however, that there exists potential for \u2018trade diversion\u2019, although no study focusing on this issue has been conducted so far. For example, if it is cheaper for India to import readymade garments from Nepal \u2013 a relatively higher cost source \u2013 due to zero- tariff access under the Indo-Nepal FTA, India would not purchase them from Bangladesh, despite the fact that the latter is highly competitive in this sector. This is because Bangladeshi readymade garments would be subject to MFN or SAFTA tariffs to access the Indian market. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 47 4.5.2 Political factors Political factors relating to a regional FTA in South Asia can be broadly categorized under two subheadings: a) Indo-Pakistan relations; and b) domestic political economy factors, as discussed below. Indo-Pakistan relations: Rhetoric aside, political relations between these two nuclear rivals have remained sour ever since the creation of SAARC, and there are few, if any, signs of this changing in the near future. Even on the trade front, Pakistan\u2019s denial of MFN treatment to India under SAFTA means that trade between these two countries still operates under the bilateral positive list approach. Although the cost of non-cooperation has been well documented,31 these two countries seem to be attempting to isolate each other from the rest of the region. They seem to be oblivious of the fact that their (in)action is casting a shadow on regional economic cooperation in South Asia. India is in a relatively advantageous position because of the size of its market as well as its geography. It shares land or sea borders with every other country in the region, except Afghanistan, and happens to be the largest trading partner in the region for all the other countries. Therefore, it is attractive for those countries to conclude a bilateral FTA with India. Pakistan, which is the second largest market in South Asia, seems to be reacting to these developments, for example, by signing its own bilateral FTA with Sri Lanka32 and expressing a desire to enter into FTAs with other countries in the region as well, notably Bangladesh and Nepal. Domestic political economy factors: These factors are still strong in most countries in the region, which hinder the prospects of increased trade despite the signing of bilateral FTAs. For example, the fact that a vocal manufacturers\u2019 lobby in Nepal has an interest in exploiting the opportunities offered by an (potential) FTA with India is reflected in the way Nepal\u2019s trade agreement with India was crafted in the first place. Those investors interested in making quick profits invested in sectors such as zinc oxide, synthetic yarn, copper wire and vegetable ghee, in which Nepal did not have a comparative advantage. The investors exported their outputs to India, taking advantage of tariff differentials between Nepal and India, and were not concerned about creating value addition in the Nepalese economy. At the same time, small farmers, who are the least organized, have found themselves at a disadvantage due to increased imports of subsidized agricultural products from India. Another example of the political economy factor at play is that India has been resorting to various types of NTBs to discourage imports from countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, thus jeopardizing the predictability of trade relations whenever India is under pressure from its domestic lobby (Adhikari, 2009a). 31 See, for example, CUTS, 1996. 32 It may not just be a reaction; there could be other, equally important factors at play, such as the excellent political and military relations between the two countries. 48 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 4.6 Informal trade The volume of informal trade among South Asian countries has been a matter of extensive debate in the past few years, with various studies estimating substantial volumes of such trade. For example, Sawhney and Kumar (2008: 5) note, \u201cAmong certain SAFTA Members, informal trade is rather significant and often", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "498d6b53-6b79-4df2-b6bc-80663174e54e": {"__data__": {"id_": "498d6b53-6b79-4df2-b6bc-80663174e54e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c10216c2a40c84b1fd1455071afb3f98298c4a0abbfd9fef35ab15ae2935ccfd"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ab1775b-b1b3-4223-9542-5717c9456a23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b1632b00c7e7930705ed1bca98774dfc9b79582a14c0555544187d67cc83081"}}, "hash": "cf16b0012cae8421a2ae3a16ea1366d4e83edfa12d795f38f9906a289881af4b", "text": "greater in value than the official trade reported between countries.\u201d For instance, the bilateral unofficial trade (exports plus imports) of India with Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka was estimated to be more than the official trade in the 1990s (Sawhney and Kumar, 2008). Tariff barriers are often cited as the reason for traders to engage in informal trade. However, even after the substantial reduction of tariff barriers between India and Nepal on the one hand, and India and Sri Lanka on the other, informal trade continues to thrive (ibid.: 6). Several studies have been conducted to quantify the magnitude of the informal trade of India with Bangladesh (World Bank, 2006; Rahman, 2002), Nepal (Karmacharya, 2004; Taneja et al., 2001), Pakistan (Khan et al., 2005) and Sri Lanka (Taneja et al., 2001) and to assess its policy implications. This subsection therefore focuses on examining the trends in informal trade between two LDCs \u2013 Bangladesh and Nepal \u2013 and India. Informal trade between Bangladesh and India has been prevalent ever since Bangladesh became independent (World Bank, 2006: 57). This trade is essentially of two kinds, with or without the connivance of informal traders and government officials on either side of the border. The first category is called \u2018technical\u2019 smuggling. This type of informal trade mainly takes place in large quantities, mostly by trucks, through the formal legal customs and other channels, though it involves \u201cexplicitly illegal practices such as under-invoicing, misclassification, and bribery of customs and other officials\u201d (ibid.). Another category of informal trade usually involves large numbers of local people individually transporting small quantities, often just as head loads or by rickshaw. In Bangladesh, this type of informal trade is sometimes called \u2018bootleg\u2019 smuggling (ibid.). According to a survey conducted in 2002-2003, Bangladesh\u2019s imports of smuggled items from India totalled more than US$500 million, which was roughly 40 percent of imports through formal channels during the same year (World Bank, 2006: 58) (table 4.4). The above example shows a one-way flow of informal merchandise exports (i.e. from India to Bangladesh). Estimates of informal merchandise exports from Bangladesh to India were not available. Nonetheless a study that has tried to quantify the size of informal services exports from India to Bangladesh estimates that in 1998/99, some US$100 million worth of medical and educational services exports went from Bangladesh to India (Rahman, 2002). To gauge the magnitude of the informal trade between India and Nepal, which share a porous border, two survey-based studies were conducted, one in each country. Those studies found that the magnitude of informal trade between these two countries was between 38 and 103 percent of the formal trade (table 4.5). Although there are several reasons for traders to choose the informal route, the major ones, apart from evading duty payments (which is normally the Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 49 prime motive), include lower transaction costs, avoiding paperwork and/or procedural delays, lower bribes and prompt realization of payments (Karmacharya, 2004: 375).

In this subsection, due to limited information available, we present the case studies of only two countries \u2014 Bangladesh, which is an LDC, and India, which is a developing country. 4.7.1 Case study of Bangladesh Some authors argue that the trade liberalization measures undertaken by Bangladesh have not significantly contributed to an export-growth nexus because exports make only a limited contribution to GDP growth (Razzaque, 2008b: 54-5). This is attributed to the considerably low level of local value-added content in the country\u2019s export products, particularly readymade garments, which, as alluded to earlier, account for an overwhelming majority of Bangladeshi exports. Bangladesh\u2019s huge reliance on imported inputs for producing readymade garments is also explained by the fact that the share of domestic value added as a percentage of exports has increased only marginally, from 4.4 percent in 1991 to 8 percent in 2003 (Razzaque, 2008b: 55). This seemingly dismal increase in domestic value added notwithstanding, the contribution to domestic value added should be seen at a disaggregated level to get a better picture. Bangladesh exports two types of garments \u2013 woven and knit. It has significantly increased the percentage of local inputs in the knitted sector, but the limited increase in the woven sector remains a cause for concern (Raihan, Adhikari and Adhikari, 2007). This has also hampered Bangladesh\u2019s potential to utilize the Generalized System of Preferences facility granted by the EU through the EBA initiative. To comply with the stringent ROO under the EBA, Bangladesh, like other beneficiaries of this preference, has to meet a \u2018double transformation\u2019 requirement in order to be eligible to export to the EU. Although Bangladesh is allowed to make use of the SAARC cumulation rule, which means that fabrics and accessories manufactured in any other SAARC country (including India) would be considered equivalent to domestically sourced inputs, its exports of woven garments under the EBA have been limited. The textile industry in Bangladesh, which has significant political clout, seems to have convinced the Government to prevent Bangladeshi readymade garment manufacturers from using the relatively more competitive Indian textiles as inputs for their export processing (see, for example, Adhikari, forthcoming). As suggested by some, Bangladeshi textile manufacturers have persuaded the Government to prevent the import of textiles from India through the land route, which is the least costly route due to the geographic Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 51 proximity of the two countries.33 Although the real motive of the Government is unclear, it is possibly seeking to promote local value added in the woven garment sector by protecting its textile industry. It also seems that Bangladesh is seeking to achieve backward integration of the garment industry by developing its domestic textile sector, contrary to the advice of various international institutions, such as the WTO (2006), the World Bank (2006) and the IMF (2007). The Government\u2019s restrictions on imports of Indian textiles have undoubtedly prevented Bangladeshi garment exporters, which use textiles as their major inputs, from enhancing their competitiveness in both global and regional markets, although the latter accounts for only a marginal share of those exports. 4.7.2 Case study of India As mentioned earlier, India is the major market for South Asian LDCs. Despite occasional leniency shown by India as a diplomatic gesture, it remains one of the most protected markets, difficult for them to access (except for Bhutan with which India shares an extremely cordial relationship). Bangladesh has tried to access Indian markets for its exports to reduce its trade deficits with the latter, but success has been limited at best. In the case study of Bangladesh, we have highlighted the nature of NTBs imposed by Bangladesh on imports of textile fabrics from India. However, trade barriers on the Indian side are no less pernicious. For example, India protects its T&C sector with high tariffs as well as specific duties, and most of the products in this sector are included in India\u2019s sensitive list (Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "524e9d92-8ffd-46b2-9fbe-423354e4e8e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "524e9d92-8ffd-46b2-9fbe-423354e4e8e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47a62b34a5f78edf88a94f345a49ab6656a3a06a8c39b9a40490bb8bb66ec1d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "5df28017-4c43-4659-b807-ee0f1ba6aded", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c93e0b6734b73fbbc972e2369c2e41c380e748e71cab05cd682dad516a645cf"}}, "hash": "fd8bc9a7cca18dfe340829d40ae266213ec0eb4813b660ac2e0f1af4c906250a", "text": "In addition, some agricultural products, which at least in theory could be exported from Bangladesh to India, are protected by NTBs, such as monopoly importing rights being given to state trading enterprises and tariff-rate quotas (World Bank, 2006).

The Indo-Nepal Trade Treaty signed in 1996 initially provided a major boost to exports from Nepal. However, after the Treaty was implemented and its impacts began to be felt in certain sectors, some vested interests in India started to protest against the liberal provisions of the Treaty. Because the Treaty is supposed to be reviewed every five years, it had become clear by 2001 that the Indian authorities were unlikely to renew it without making substantive revisions to some of the more liberal provisions. Faye et al. (2004: 46) note that between 2001 and 2002 , \u201cIndia instituted significant trade restrictions on Nepal during the negotiation of [the] bilateral trade agreement. These restrictions were alleged to have been instituted to extract concessions in negotiations.\u201d The Treaty was eventually renewed in 2002 but not without revisions incorporating the following restrictive conditions: 33 The control of illegal and smuggling activities on or near the land border customs posts was said to be the primary reason for the ban. Although this ban was lifted, with effect from December 2005 for 100 percent of export-oriented industries (World Bank, 2006), it was lately reimposed (Adhikari, forthcoming). The clout of the textile lobby is such that in 2009 it prevailed on the Government not to accept regional cumulation rules to qualify for duty-free exports to the EU market under the EBA (Harun, 2010: 282). 52 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement \u2022\ufffd Stringent ROO requiring Nepalese exporters to fulfil the twin criteria of 30 percent value addition and changes in tariff headings for the products to be eligible for preferential market access. \u2022\ufffd Tariff-rate quotas for four major products of export interest to Nepal, with zero duty treatment provided for the following in-quota items: vegetable ghee (100,000 tons), acrylic yarn (10,000 tons), copper (10,000 tons) and zinc oxide (2,500 tons); and MFN duty for any exports above these thresholds. \u2022\ufffd Requirement for Nepal to submit the criteria applied for ROO on an annual basis. \u2022\ufffd Clear specification of safeguard clauses that define \u2018injury\u2019 with a much more convenient trigger mechanism for the imposition of a safeguard duty over and above the normal tariff.34 After these provisions, particularly the first three, were enforced, Nepal, as mentioned in the previous chapter, witnessed a significant reduction in the value of exports of vegetable ghee and zinc oxide to India. While the export values of both these products have fallen to nil since 2009/10, the fall in exports of zinc oxide can be singularly attributed to the imposition of a quantitative restriction. In the case of vegetable ghee, yet another reason caused the exports to plunge, as discussed further on (see also figure 4.1). The last provision listed above, however, has not contributed to reducing Nepalese exports to India because the provision has not been invoked so far. Nevertheless, risk of its invocation and the unpredictability associated with it persist. Additionally in the Nepalese side is not without fault. Although Nepal does not impose NTBs on Indian products, the imposition of various para-tariffs is quite common.35 Of the five para-tariffs applied by Nepal, the agricultural development fee (ADF) is particularly targeted at Indian products because it does not apply to imports to which MFN tariffs apply. However, due to the Nepalese commitment at the time of its accession to the WTO to phase out all the other duties and charges, Nepal has started reducing them, and the ADF was accordingly reduced from its previous 10 percent to 5 percent since the fiscal year 2007/08. Moreover, the the budget announcement for the fiscal year 2009/10 has also scrapped the local development fee (LDF), with effect from 16 July 2009 (Adhikari, 2009a). Following a 2009 decision of the Government of India to reduce its tariff on palm oil, which is the raw material for the production of vegetable ghee, Nepalese exports of vegetable ghee to India have fallen, from a peak of 7.08 billion Nepalese rupees in 2001/02 to nil in the first eight months of 2010 (figure 4.1). The figure shows that when the Indo-Nepal Trade Treaty was revised in 2002 and quotas imposed, the impact was immediate.

Although the issue of investment was not discussed earlier, it is pertinent to point out that firms that invested significantly in the manufacture of those products on which trade restrictions have now been imposed have either been compelled to scale down their operations or close their factories. While making such investments, they had a legitimate expectation that market access opportunities provided by India would remain in place. This is no longer the case. The impact has been much more severe on the vegetable ghee industry in Nepal, in which several factories are under threat of closure. This will not only have a major economic impact on Nepal but also the human development consequences due to the ensuing job losses, which could be severe. The recently revised Indo-Nepal Treaty (in effect since October 2009) has been extended to seven years. It includes some provisions aimed at addressing Nepal\u2019s concerns over the imposition of NTBs and para-tariff barriers. This may not provide a major boost to Nepal\u2019s exports to India, not least because the provisions aimed at helping Nepal enhance its exports to India are yet to be fully implemented. Consequently, there is continued scepticism about the real intent of the revised Treaty.36 One of the fundamental issues is that while bilateral FTAs are intended to be permanent agreements, providing an option for any party to exit from them by serving a formal notice of six months to one year to the other party, the 36 See, for example, Kharel, 2009a. 8,000 7,000 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 2001/02 7,081.4 3,812.3 2,959 Treaty revised Tariff on palm oil reduced 4,634.9 3,861.7 4,136.5 2,132.3 9.1 2005/06 2003/04 2007/08 2002/03 2006/07 2004/05 2008/09P 2009/10P 54 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement intention behind providing for a fixed duration of the Treaty, to be revised at a particular interval, is not clear. Due to the unpredictability associated with the possibility of major revisions being made to the Treaty, as occurred in 2002, investors may be reluctant to make long-term investments in Nepal that target the Indian market. This only encourages \u2018fly by night\u2019 investors, which is neither desirable for the long-term growth of an LDC like Nepal, nor likely to promote local value addition in the economy (Adhikari, 2009a). As a result, it represents a lost opportunity for promoting employment, poverty alleviation and human development. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 55 Assessment of existing measures to integrate the LDCs into SAFTA 5.1 Introduction Given the economic vulnerability of South Asian LDCs and their limited capacity to harness the potential benefits from regional trade liberalization, they have not been able to integrate their economies into SAFTA in a beneficial manner. For such integration to occur, they need special measures, some of which are already being undertaken. Although some of those measures are applicable to all South Asian countries (such as the establishment of a regional body for standardization and accreditation), others are designed specifically for the LDCs (such as S&D provisions within SAFTA).

According to Holzinger (2000:1), \u201cTraditionally, two properties of goods are considered as determining their publicness: non-rivalry of consumption and non-excludability from consumption. The necessity for collective provision is based on these two properties, as non-rivalry is the cause of undersupply in the case of public goods and non-excludability the cause of overuse in the case of commons\u201d. Therefore, as Holzinger argues, these two properties create an incentive structure for rational agents that prevents the efficient provision of the public goods. There is no doubt that the major factor that undermines the supply response, in particular, is the under-provisioning of public goods. Although public goods can be national, regional and international (Kaul, Grunberg and Stern, 1999), this chapter confines the discussion to regional public goods. According to Desai (2003: 63), the prevailing theory of national public goods is statist in the sense that the State is expected to finance and make provision for such goods. This is because, as Musgrave (1999) argues, public goods can be efficiently provided by political institutions that are best represented by the State itself. Asserting the primacy of the State Chapter 5 56 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement as an actor in the supply of public goods, Besley and Ghatak (2006:290) argue that the State has been, and will remain, a central player in the provisioning of public goods \u201cas long as it monopolizes coercion\u201d. However, when the question of provisioning of public goods at the regional level arises, it becomes complicated, not least because of the \u2018collective action\u2019 and \u2018free-rider\u2019 problems arising at the level of sovereign State. Kaul and Mendoza (2003) argue for the need to develop methodologies to systematically assess individual public goods and the public domain as a whole against the following three principle criteria of publicness: \u2022\ufffd Publicness in consumption: This relates to the non-exclusiveness of the consumption of public goods across individual countries that participate in the SAFTA processes. It should be underpinned by the two other criteria. \u2022\ufffd Publicness in decision-making: The determination, allocation, distribution pattern and production of public goods should be decided in a participatory manner. \u2022\ufffd Publicness in the distribution of benefits: This relates to the equity aspects of benefits and tests whether the real benficiaries are able to get a fair share of the net benefits from public goods (figure 5.1). Figure 5 1: Triangle of publicness Source: Kaul and Mendoza, 2003: 92. Although the model presented in figure 5.1 was prepared in a national context, it is equally applicable to the regional context and, by extension, to the context of SAFTA. We now take a closer look at what these elements mean in practice in the context of SAFTA. 5.3 SAFTA as a regional public good 5.3.1 Publicness in consumption Due to the free-rider problems associated with the provisioning of public goods, countries may tend to avoid contributing towards the provisioning of these goods. This problem can be resolved through the collective efforts of all the countries participating in RTAs (see, for Publicness in consumption Publicness in decision-making Publicness in the distribution of (net) benefits Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 57 example, Sandler, 2007), such as SAFTA. Given that the countries participating in SAFTA are at different levels of economic development and have different resource endowments and market size, it is futile to argue that they could contribute equally to the provisioning of regional public goods. Therefore, Sandler (2007) states that the concept of aggregation technology, which means \u201cwhether the contributions of the individual actors to a common good are additive or not and whether they can be substituted for each another\u201d (Holzinger, 2000:4), should be taken into consideration. Although States are the major consumers of the public goods provided through RTAs such as SAFTA, other economic actors that have equally important stakes are farmers, business enterprises and consumers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "768c8a32-32ba-4bd5-ad9a-b506b3e2ebf1": {"__data__": {"id_": "768c8a32-32ba-4bd5-ad9a-b506b3e2ebf1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b5de7995d51f23995a500260492b659a9f25147a7dac93c327554ef0b58b368"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1ffcba7-74a1-4c12-b636-92e84257eb6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "608b185a6eff4e4eebc051c428d3170da67f0c89e7a23ca3dedcf76dd16e27bc"}}, "hash": "67ac095b1ff6a0ab973da16e62f345ff69fdcbb881dd91d1816670c15f158130", "text": "However, when these actors are excluded from the benefits, for example of SAFTA, due to the sensitive lists and NTBs, the arrangement assumes the character of \u2018club good\u2019, as opposed to public good because a significant segment of the stakeholders are excluded from \u2018consuming\u2019 the good. 5.3.2 Publicness in decision-making Democratic decision-making is a cornerstone of SAFTA and indeed of the SAARC process as a whole, which is epitomized by the consensus-based decision-making process.

As discussed, trade negotiating power is partly a function of the size of the market, which Bangladesh seems to have utilized reasonably well. Nepal, despite having the second-largest market among the LDCs in the region, has not made any significant impact on SAFTA negotiations.37 This is due, among others, to the lack of institutional memory, frequent transfer of well-trained staff from the commerce ministry and the diversion of negotiating capital to promote other forms of trade cooperation, such as the bilateral agreements discussed previously. Evidence of the mediocre negotiating capacity of the trade negotiators of South Asian LDCs is evident in the S&D provisions of SAFTA. These provisions are contained in three sub paragraphs of Article 3 (Objectives and Principles); four paragraphs of Article 7 (Trade Liberalization Programme); the entire Article 11 (Special and Differential Treatment for the Least Developed Contracting States); and one paragraph of Article 16 (Safeguard Measures). However, as noted in previous chapters, most of these provisions are \u2018best endeavour\u2019 clauses. They are a diplomatic gesture par excellence but meaningless when the LDCs actually want to benefit from them through their enforcement. Among the three sub paragraphs of \u2018Objectives and Principles\u2019, the only effective sub paragraph is the one that states: \u201cThe special needs of the Least Developed Contracting States shall be clearly 37 Nepal\u2019s negotiating strategy during its accession to the WTO was considered satisfactory (Rajkarnikar, 2005), though that was not only because of the personal calibre of the individuals in the negotiating team but also due to the strong support provided by other stakeholders, including civil society organizations (ibid.). 58 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement recognised by adopting concrete preferential measures in their favour on a non-reciprocal basis.\u201d Because no deadline has been set for implementing them in the spirit of this sub paragraph, this provision could also turn out to be ineffective in practice (Adhikari, 2004b). In theory, Article 11 of SAFTA is exclusively devoted to providing S&D treatment to the LDCs. But the non-binding language of this Article renders it rather weak. It uses such wording as: \u201cgive special regard to\u201d, \u201cto the extent practical\u201d, \u201cconsider, where practical\u201d and \u201cspecial consideration shall be given for technical assistance\u201d. The last one is particularly noteworthy because it is a statement of intention, not a commitment, and it sets no deadline. Furthermore, the text of SAFTA appears to offer the LDCs limited S&D treatment, which are similar to those provided in the WTO. It is ironic that those very developing countries that constantly blame industrialized-country members of the WTO for not providing meaningful S&D treatment to the weaker members are themselves demonstrating a reluctance to provide similar treatment to their fellow LDCs within SAFTA (Adhikari, 2004b). Among all S&D provisions contained in the Agreement on SAFTA, only that relating to sensitive lists , providing different sets of commitments towards the LDCs and non-LDCs, has been operationalized so far (table 5.1).

This would be possible in the context of SAFTA only if all the countries had equal opportunities to obtain benefits from the arrangement and importantly, if there was positive discrimation in favour of the weaker members. A fair distribution of benefits means that the system should ensure equity for all its members and promote distributive justice if the equity is lacking (Adhikari, 2009c). Indeed, this is a key premise upon which regional economic integration programmes, such as those of the EU and ASEAN, are built. This was also highlighted by a report produced by the Coalition for Action on South Asian Cooperation (CASAC) nearly a decade ago, which states: \u201cAs experience of other regional organisations have [sic] shown that an equitable sharing of benefits of cooperation is the key to success of regionalism, special care must be taken to ensure that the least developed countries can take full advantage of the freeing of trade by other countries. As a means of compensating [for] the cost incurred by them in moving to a free trade regime, it is important to have special elements in their favour\u201d (CASAC, 2001:19) Given that South Asia as a trading bloc has been fragmented through a web of discriminatory preferences provided to various countries through bilateral trade agreements by the major players in the system, as discussed in chapter VI (Weerakoon, 2007), the potential benefits that could be derived by the weaker countries are substantially reduced. LDCs such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Maldives, which have not entered into bilateral FTAs with any developing country in the region so far, are at a considerable disadvantage in terms of market access opportunities compared with LDCs such as Bhutan and Nepal and a developing country such as Sri Lanka, which have bilateral FTAs with at least one developing country in the region. Another related issue, which was highlighted in the discussion of S&D treatments in the context of SAFTA, is equally important here, not least because such treatment would have helped the LDCs to benefit from equal opportunities and distributive justice. However, the way certain provisions are designed leaves much to be desired. For example, the LDCs are allowed a 10 percent relaxation on the valued-added criteria of 40 percent agreed under the ROO of SAFTA. But several of them have not been able to meet this requirement because of the low level of industrialization and lack of backward linkages/vertical integration. Although ROO are often couched in altrustic terms, such as helping the preference- receiving countries, particularly the LDCs, to industrialize (Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007), there is no evidence to suggest that stringent ROO have helped any such country in its industrialization efforts (WTO, 2005). Although a genuine fear of trade deflection resulting from more liberal ROO cannot be brushed aside, the trade-restricting effects of stringent ROO cannot be underestimated either. 60 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement For example, a study by Raihan (forthcoming) based on a partial equilibrium (WITS/SMART) model, focusing mainly on Nepal\u2019s export potential vis-\u00e0-vis India in the absence of the stringent ROO requirements imposed under SAFTA, finds that Nepal\u2019s exports to India would rise by US$90 million. Because of the ROO, 34 percent of Nepal\u2019s potential exports to India remains unrealized. The study singles out ROO and sensitive lists as the two most pernicious trade barriers hindering the prospects of LDCs\u2019 trade expansion in South Asia. It further estimates that export expansion from a full implementation of SAFTA, without ROO and the sensitive lists, would amount to about US$1.3 billion, of which the bulk of the gain would accrue to India (US$1.01 billion), though the LDCs would also gain significantly: Bangladesh (by US$33 million), Bhutan (by US$ 21 million) the Maldives (by US$3 million) (table 5.2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4754007-5f73-4e4e-8bef-fa4c66544a1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4754007-5f73-4e4e-8bef-fa4c66544a1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb924b4f26e2511623aabc6710135791d229c8c1462262278e92fcb78791ae6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef36c3bd-bd2b-48ea-a311-5e6666232f6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "804b3782c606edd9b74d692209a0ec18c879d5b9442c6696279ee089a6580f76"}}, "hash": "8c286fcfd86569de698c96dcb5a511a1f29e71e0851a077cc8e5d2d7092deffd", "text": "Table 5 2: Simulation results based on trade creation from ROO and sensitive lists under SAFTA (US$ thousand) To From Bangladesh Bhutan India Maldives Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka Total exports Bangladesh - 637.69 26,043.61 7.65 918.84 4,750.44 1,198.28 33,556.51 Bhutan - - 21,693.89 - 113.13 84.88 0.01 21,891.91 India 350,978.32 40,408.25 - 31,576.28 177,182.61 19,6432.19 218,727.26 1,015,305.01 Maldives - - 858.52 - - 58.81 2,262.29 3,179.62 Nepal 22.08 247.99 89,542.48 2.67 - 699.28 30.63 90,545.13 Pakistan 44,637.39 - 6,0452.46 346.21 691.63 - 7,822.05 113,949.71 Sri Lanka 4,301.66 0.81 2,946.48 16,549.71 973.74 7,040.32 - 31,812.72 Total Imports 399,939.51 41,294.74 201,537.44 48,482.52 179,880.01 209,065.91 230,040.51 - Source: Raihan, forthcoming.

SAFTA has done very little to remedy this persistent problem. There was every reason to believe that the special provisions on technical assistance would help the LDCs in a number of ways, including in upgrading their standards-related institutions, construction of warehouses, cold storage facilities and roads and bridges to link small-scale producers with regional markets, implementing customs reforms and training workers and managers to enhance their productivity. Although the Second Meeting of the Sub-Group on Technical Assistance to Least Developed Contracting States, under Article 11 (d) of SAFTA, identified 10 such areas (SAARC, 2005), and some of them do include the above-mentioned wish list, there has been little progress, if any, on the provision of technical assistance so far. This is despite the fact that the European Union\u2019s trajectory towards regional economic Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 61 integration is often touted as a model for economic integration in South Asia. For example, the European Union created a European Regional Development Fund to assist development in the relatively poorer members and late entrants \u2013 Greece, Portugal and Spain \u2013 and significant transfers were made to these countries to help them address their supply-side constraints, build credible institutions and indeed catch up with the rest of the members (EC-9) (see, for example, Winters, 1997). The need to provide an opportunity for the LDCs to fully reap the benefits of regional economic integration within South Asia was also aptly highlighted by CASAC (2001). A centrepiece of its recommendation was the \u201ccreation of a reasonably large-sized fund for the development of [LDCs\u2019] infrastructure, human resources, export production and diversification of capacity\u201d (p.19). Finally, the creation of a revenue compensation mechanism, which was considered a unique provision when SAFTA was signed, has turned out to be mere rhetoric. This is not only because of its short-term nature but also because it is not substantial enough to help the LDCs meet their trade adjustment needs (such as compensating the losers from trade liberalization) or generate the funds needed for overcoming supply-side constraints. 5.4 Other initatives Other measures are also being taken to strengthen the regional trade integration process in South Asia, some of which may not be exclusively applicable to the LDCs. Such measures are broadly divided into two categories: regional initiatives and subregional initiatives. 5.4.1 Regional initiatives This section analyses the most important regional initiatives, other than those already discussed, in terms of their potential contribution to increasing intraregional trade among South Asian countries in general and the LDCs in particular. Establishment of a regional centre on human resource development Human resource development is key to enhancing the productivity of enterprises in the region. Scores of studies have highlighted the significance of human capital, particularly skills enhancement, for productivity improvement and export diversification of the member countries, especially in their move towards the manufacturing of higher value-added items (see, for example, Siddiqui, 2007; Raihan et al., 2007; Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007; Adhikari and Weeratunge, 2007). However, when the SAARC Human Resources Development Centre was established in 1998, its objective was confined to merely enhancing the \u201ccapacity of regional HRD functionaries, policy makers and trainers.\u201d38 Accordingly, most of the research, training and policy advocacy work of the Centre has focused on building the capacity of government officials, with little contribution to building the capacity of managers and workers at the micro level.

Increasingly, both developed and developing countries are realizing that trade facilitation could be instrumental in saving traders considerable difficulties and waste of resources, collectively known as \u2018trade transaction costs\u2019. Because trade facilitation is instrumental in removing import and export bottlenecks, it has also been referred to as the \u2018plumbing\u2019 of international trade. Another major advantage of trade facilitation is its potential to contribute to greater transparency, reducing corruption and increasing government revenues (Milner, Morrissey and Zgovu,2008). Several studies have analysed the benefits and costs of trade faciliation measures, comparing these against the costs of maintaining the status quo (see, for example, Wilson and Otsuki, 2005; Swedish Trade Procedure Council and National Board of Trade, 2002). However, one of the most comprehensive examples of relevance to the present discussion is the case of sub-Saharan African countries documented by Gakunu (2003).

Although all these are important reform measures that should be undertaken in South Asia, one of the major initiatives already taken relates to customs cooperations. In 1996, a Group on Customs Cooperation was set up and entrusted with a mandate to harmonize customs rules and regulations, simplify documentation and procedural requirements, upgrade infrastructure facilities and provide training facilities. Several meetings of the group also culminated in the adoption of a Customs Action Plan in August 2004, which aims at: \u2022\ufffd maximizing harmonization, simplification and uniform application of customs procedures to facilitate move-ment of goods and passengers; \u2022\ufffd ensuring proper application of customs legislation through maximum mutual cooperation and assistance, in particular for combatting commercial fraud and trafficking in illicit drugs; \u2022\ufffd improving the working methods and human resources of the member administrations through the efficient use of resources and training of customs personnel. Despite these objectives, it is difficult to determine to what extent this plan has been helpful in facilitating trade within the region in general and the LDCs in particular, because there is little information available in the public domain on how effectively the plan is being implemented. In the 16th SAARC Summit Declaration, the leaders not only reitered their commitment to accelerate trade facilitation measures but also directed the SAFTA Ministerial Council to work on this issue in a time-bound manner (para 20). It also directed the relevant SAARC bodies to expedite their work in these areas (para 23) (SAARC, 2010). When the provision of better trade facilitation is impaired by the inherent constraints and incapacity of certain members, but with implications for regional integration efforts as a whole, the regional grouping can help the delivery mechanism through joint assistance. This has undoubtedly been possible in those regional groupings in which developed countries are the major players, such as the EU and APEC. But in the context of South Asia, the example of COMESA \u2013 a South-South regional trade arrangement \u2013 is more relevant. With COMESA the South African Revenue Services, for instance, provide direct technical assistance to the regional partners (Maur, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4ec5bc7-38e8-4772-8e56-2940d9931f8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4ec5bc7-38e8-4772-8e56-2940d9931f8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b72a6f037dbd4c973736e6dac4dd0cddb83124d9664e872eceb27581ecd5f71"}, "2": {"node_id": "faa010cc-6523-4efe-818b-4f781fde389e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57376bd8b210785d5a962b56f492c6f24c9c185e3ca8fa44e451a67d91e3e84f"}}, "hash": "3ddabd99c0a26c08c46a52ffea990df73e63969c29e8fccf8f80249d6fee4a0f", "text": "This model is worth replicating in South Asia, where customs administrations in developing countries, particularly India and Pakistan, could train customs officials in the LDCs as well as provide technical support for capacity-building in the latter. 64 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Creation of a SAARC standards body One of the major NTBs that stymie regional trade relates to product standards.

However, due to the non-transparent nature of their application, they can be misused by vested interests because it is often difficult to distinguish between genuinely consumer-friendly standards and protectionist standards (see, for example, Baldwin, 2000). One means of remedying this problem is to create regional standards for products traded both within the region and outside and to implement mutual recognition arrangements on conformity assessment procedures. According to Maur (2008: 986), the requirement of huge sunk costs, the inability to reap the benefits of economies of scale, a lack of technological capabilities and the absence of human resources to handle standards-related tasks make a strong case for setting up a standards-related body or an accreditation body at the regional level. It was probably recognition of this imperative that led the SAARC contracting parties, particularly their standards-related bodies, to recommend the creation of a Standing Group on Standards, Quality Control and Measurement, which was established by the SAARC commerce ministers in May 1998.42 After a series of deliberations among the standards-related bodies of the SAARC countries, the South Asian foreign ministers meeting in August 2008, decided to establish a South Asian Regional Standards Organization (SARSO). The objectives of the organization, as provided for in Article 2 of the Agreement establishing it include: \u2022\ufffd promote and undertake harmonization of national standards of SAARC member States, with a view to removing the technical barriers to trade and facilitating flow of goods and services \u2022\ufffd develop SAARC standards on products of regional/subregional interest \u2022\ufffd facilitate capacity-building among the member States in the fields of standardization and conformity assess-ment through training, workshops and seminars \u2022\ufffd promote mutual recognition arrangements on conformity assessment procedures among the member States. The organization, which is to be established in Dhaka, has not yet come into being because all the member governments have yet to ratify the Agreement. Once it is established and the relevant bodies under it are constituted, it is expected to greatly ease the flow of goods within the region. One major problem with this arrangement is that SARSO will deal only with industrial goods, not with agricultural goods, which form the bulk of the products in which the LDCs have a comparative advatange. 5.4.2 Subregional initiatives The aim of subregional economic cooperation, the result of the collective efforts of the foreign ministries of the countries/areas situated in the eastern part of South Asia, is to provide a boost to economic activities in Bangladesh, Bhutan, the eastern part of India and 42 See SAARC Secretariat website at: www.saarc-sec.org/?t=2.1.7 (accessed 5 June 2009). Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 65 Nepal (BBIN). The idea received official acceptance from SAARC when the Ninth Summit of the Heads of State and Government endorsed the South Asian Growth Quadrangle (SAGQ) as a subregional initiative under SAARC.43 This subregion is unique in three respects. First, it contains the majority of South Asia\u2019s poor,44 and it accounts for most of South Asia\u2019s GDP.45 Second, this subregion has abundant resources, including human resources, fertile agricultural lands, energy potential, natural resources and port facilities. Finally, this subregion is strategically located between South Asia and South-East Asia.46 The ADB is its principal development partner and has been supporting the South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) programme \u2013 a major programme of the SAGQ \u2013 since 2001 through two regional technical assistance projects aimed at better integrating the partners within this subregion and with the rest of South Asia. SASEC working groups have been established in six priority sectors: transport, tourism, trade, investment and private-sector cooperation, energy and power, environment, and information and communications technology (ICT) (ADB, 2006). Although SASEC deals with broader areas of economic cooperation that what is envisaged by SAFTA, trade is unboubtedly a major component of the programme. The programme is inclusive in the sense that the countries outside the subregional framework can also be included in the relevant working groups if they are interested in participating.47 It envisages active cooperation between BBIN, SAARC and the BIMSTEC Secretariat for implementation of the projects identified under the programme, and linking these activities with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0aa3eb31-f708-4ed3-bb0b-99cabf49d11a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0aa3eb31-f708-4ed3-bb0b-99cabf49d11a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8490238b6125832c07c0ee09cab669b7d921b77f183ca0ea0c8e6ae216020f6"}, "2": {"node_id": "90105d16-ad8d-4ec0-8fed-c773d1d30f97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d1765e36d1ac02ac0010cdb8a0536c8df08f887dcf000b87f050684efba1ab5"}}, "hash": "ca9f8683bb7392c473bfd8572f4d0e2901aa0ec4fff4a0c5cbb76fef04a87c71", "text": "The programme is not merely an intra-governmental initiative; it also provides a forum for dialogue with the private sector and other development partners.

The programme seems to have identified the crucial needs of the subregion and is moving in the right direction. However, it could be further strenghtened by also looking into ways of harnessing the trade potential of the rich biodiversity found in the Eastern Himalayan region (ICIMOD, 2006). This aspect has not been covered adequately, although the programme broadly mentions natural resources, the use of which is critical for both sustainable development and human development. Moreover, the programme does not aim to facilitate trade diversification within the subregion and beyond. Pandey (2008:2), who identifies the problems relating to export diversification efforts in Nepal, argues that the \u201clow industrial base, low technological adaptations and innovation at the firm level and low research and development efforts have put a brake on trade diversification efforts and on the movement towards high-technology products. Consequently, the export baskets of most developing countries, including Nepal, continue to be dominated by \u2018poor goods\u2019\u201d.49 Because this observation is valid for the entire subregion, serious efforts need to be undertaken to strengthen exports of manufactured and high-value products, for which investment in research and development and for unleashing the innovative potential of enterprises is indispensable. The subregional programme, however, neglects these issues. 48 The six corridors are: i) Kathmandu to Birganj/Raxaul to Kolkata/Haldia; ii) Thimphu to Phuentsholing to Siliguri to Kolkata/Haldia; iii) Kathmandu to Khakarbitta, via the Phulbari Corridor, to Banglabandha to Khulna/Monghla or Dhaka/Chittagong; iv) Kolkata via Sunderbhans via the Jamuna and Brahmaputra rivers to Guwahati/Assam; v) Kolkata to Gedes/Darsana to Bangladesh; and vi) Kolkata to Petrapole/Benapole to Jessore to Khulna/Monghla or Dhaka/Chittagong (ADB, at: www.adb.org/sasec/about.asp). 49 According to Haussmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2006), \u2018poor goods\u2019 are those products exported by poor countries where value addition, in particular technological content is low.

To the extent that trade contributes to economic growth, it can help countries enhance their human development profiles provided there is a concomitant increase in household spending on health, education and nutrition and that the increased revenue generated through trade is spent by the public sector on building the productive capacity of the economy in general and of people in particular. People can thus infuse dynamism in the economy. Such virtuous relationships, however, are in no way automatic. Therefore, as pointed out by Ranis and Stewart (2005:13), simultaneous investments in both areas (economic growth as well as human development) are necessary to ensure their virtuous relationship. We hypothesized in the introductory chapter of this paper that, left to its own devices, SAFTA would not contribute to improved human development, particularly among the LDCs of the region. This chapter attempts not only to test this hypothesis but also to discuss how domestic governance issues, particularly those relating to the provision of public goods, are equally vital for enhancing human development. 50 Sen (2008) is critical of mainstream economists as well as modern political philosophers for their \u201ccommon attempt to ... see development in the narrow perspective of expansion of the supply of object of convenience (represented, for example, by the gross domestic product or gross national product)\u201d (p. 334). Referring to what modern political philosopher John Rawl calls primary goods (a term he uses for the objective of convenience), Sen further asserts: \u201cThe expansion of primary goods is, of course, important, but we have to take into account the variability of the relation between increases in primary goods and the enhancement of basic human freedoms and capabilities\u201d (ibid.). Chapter 6 68 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 6.2 Dimensions of human development Human development is about enlarging people\u2019s choices and helping them lead longer and healthier lives by providing them access to opportunities for improving their education, skills, health, nutritional status as well as employment opportunities and livelihood conditions (UNDP, 2006: 15-16). This form of development should therefore be based on people\u2019s own capabilities, preferences and choices and cannot be externally driven. For realizing the true human development potential of individuals, it is equally important that they be provided with the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes that affect their access to opportunities. Viewed in this light, human development is a very broad term, the achievement of which depends not only on the ability of people to assert their rights but also on the responsiveness of governance structures and institutional mechanisms. Therefore, the concept of human development challenges the traditional notion of viewing people as an object of development; it asserts that people should be viewed as a subject of development (UNDP, 2003:23). This makes the human development approach both distinct from and more holistic than other approaches to development. \u201cDevelopment of the people builds human capabilities. Development for the people translates the benefits of growth into people\u2019s lives. And development by the people emphasizes that people must actively participate in the processes that shape their lives\u201d. (ibid., emphasis added) 6.3 Framework for analysis For conducting a \u201chuman development impact assessment\u201d of SAFTA, particularly in the context of the LDCs, the major question to pose, as is done by the Regional Trade and Human Development Report of UNDP (2006: 25) is: \u201cDoes human development SEEP to the bottom?\u201d, with SEEP standing for sustainability, equity, empowerment and productivity. Therefore, the framework chosen for our analysis considers whether SAFTA a) promotes sustainability of the present generation without compromising the opportunities for future generations to achieve their human development objectives, b) enhances equity within and across nations, c) empowers people to enhance their \u2018agency\u2019 to live more dignified lives and d) provides opportunities for people to raise their productivity. What follows is an elaboration of this framework and testing of the hypothesis. 6.3.1 Sustainability Sustainability, according to Montes and Memis (2005:14), \u201cis concerned with the durability of social gains and that these gains do not prevent subsequent generations from improving their own welfare\u201d.

For example, one of the major challenges confronting the world today is the problem of climate change, the implications of which are relatively severe for the low-lying as well as mountainous countries of the region. To the extent that SAFTA contributes to an increase in intraregional trade and such an increase substitutes for the larger share of trade that the countries have at present with countries outside the region, it can contribute to mitigating the impact of climate change. This is because transportation accounts for a sizeable share of global carbon emissions, which can be reduced if the goods are transported from/to neighbouring countries instead of to other parts of the world. Even if it were argued that mitigation is not the primary concern of the South Asian countries, which historically have had lower levels of carbon emissions than the developed countries, the role of RTAs in facilitating adaptation cannot be denied. Arguably, it is easier to transfer environmentally sound and climate-friendly technologies within the region than from industrialized countries to the region because the latter transfers involve global intellectual property rights issues and have therefore been rather slow even when they occur (Srinivas, 2009:32). One example of intraregional technology transfer is the technology employed for the production of drought-resistant seed varieties, which can be used by all the countries in the region to adapt to the impact of climate change. However, there are a couple of caveats to the general rule. First, regional trade may have a negative impact on human development \u201cif it does not reflect the real economic, social and environmental costs of production and transport\u201d (UNDP, 2005b: 50; see also UNDP 2005a: 126). If trade between two countries is generated by focusing on artificial comparative advantage in participating countries with little regard to real comparative advantage, such as the export of vegetable ghee from Sri Lanka and Nepal to India, this would foster inefficiencies, contribute very little to value addition, create limited employment opportunities and fail to contribute to either economic growth or human development (UNDP, 2005b). Second, the increased competitiveness of exports generated by neglecting negative social and environmental externalities also contributes very little to human development. Therefore, comparative advantage should truly reflect the social and environmental costs in the exporting countries (ibid.: 50). The above analysis, which is limited to social and environmental sustainability, does not provide a complete picture. When we talk of sustainability in the context of SAFTA, other factors should also be taken into account. For example, a study by Park (2008) in the context of East Asian RTAs describes a quantitative test of sustainability with respect to four conditions: a) country-specific gains, b) distribution of gains between members, c) global welfare gains and d) Pareto efficiency.51 He finds that the sustainability of South-East Asian RTAs would be greatly enhanced if ASEAN were to include an expansionary RTA, such as ASEAN+3 or APEC. 51 In economics, Pareto efficiency refers to a situation in which there is no way of improving the condition of one person without making that of another person worse off. 70 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement One of the major policy implications for SAFTA is that the goal of regional cooperation should be to ultimately move towards global non-discriminatory trade liberalization and expanded cooperation with other regional trading blocs. This finding is consistent with the assertion made by Kelegama and Adhikari (2002) and SAARC (1999) that SAFTA should look to a future expansion of regional cooperation with other regional groupings, such as the EU, NAFTA and ASEAN. A sustainability impact assessment also includes determining whether or not benefits derived by people who are dependent on trade (for example, through production, imports, exports and intermediary functions) will be sustained over a longer time horizon. For this, RTA processes and state policies should be directed towards creating mechanisms that would enable countries as well as communities to achieve dynamic comparative advantage and adjust their resources accordingly. These mechanisms are currently non-existent in SAFTA. However, if policy makers and trade negotiators were better able to appreciate these issues, there is no reason why they could not devise the appropriate processes and mechanisms in the future. One example is to preserve the policy space for providing temporary protection to the subsectors that provide livelihoods to the poor and marginalized or in subsectors where their contribution in the total value added is significantly higher than the sector\u2019s average. 6.3.2 Equity According to Montes", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6708e9ae-3178-4936-b36b-14e67178274c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6708e9ae-3178-4936-b36b-14e67178274c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eb46dd968977c80262d00be27ea12687f24bbe0cdea7d8fe8e4a05bb035f124"}, "3": {"node_id": "7206c16d-0db6-4ae1-8ee9-a5c2aa7a03d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de0f436a53ef8dbdbcff46f03733e4fffc8255a8d21f0fc493eda1615ac1a43d"}}, "hash": "7f679fdc668f89ac1c456a597737f478d9443d10fbc32e2a99f0f8f85145b54a", "text": "and Memis (2005: 14), \u201ca human development approach to trade recognizes that trade by itself cannot address existing or induced inequities and promotes the search for complementary policies\u201d.

However, if equity is not achievable, given the varied levels of development and supply capacities of the member countries, efforts should be made to promote distributive justice (see, for example, Adhikari, 2009b), not only at the regional level but also at the national level. Global trade patterns are generally perceived as skills-biased, in the sense that they benefit the higher skill categories of workers more than the lower skill categories (Montes and Memis, 2005:13). Although such a pattern is not as evident in regional trade under SAFTA due to largely similar levels of skills and technology among the member countries, the LDCs\u2019 predicament might be similar to what they experience when participating in global trade because of their relative lack of skilled human resources and limited access to technology. Due to the lower level of skills among female workers compared with male workers, the benefits they derive from regional trade integration are fewer and they also suffer a disproportionate burden of adjustment. The female-to-male income ratio (in the organized sector where data are available), which is a proxy indicator of the skill endowment of workers, shows that female workers earn significantly lower income than male workers in South Asia (figure 6.1). Although the female-to-male income ratio is higher in LDCs such as Bangladesh (0.51), Maldives (0.54) and Nepal (0.61) than in developing countries such as India (0.32) and Pakistan (0.18), it is much lower than that of some other developing countries, such as Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 71 Mozambique (0.90) Mongolia (0.87), Burundi (0.77) and Colombia (0.71). This suggests that positive discrimination is necessary in South Asian countries in order to reduce the gender- related skill and wage gap and promote equality of access and opportunity to participate in economic activities. The success (or otherwise) of SAFTA in contributing to improved human development in South Asia should be judged, at least in part, by its role in reducing these gaps. Figure 6 1: Ratio of estimated female to male earnings in South Asian countries, 2007 Source: UNDP, 2009: 188-189. Given that SAFTA at the regional level, in its current form does not promote equity, this can be remedied if not immediately then in the longer run, by promoting distributive justice. While the Agreement on SAFTA has enshired S&D provisions for the LDCs, as discussed previously, these measures, although much better in content than at the multilateral level, have not moved beyond rhetoric, and can only be considered \u2018best endeavour\u2019 clauses when actually implemented. A meaningful S&D treatment would, inter alia, entail: a) relaxed ROO that take into account the level of industrialization of each country; b) a leaner list of sensitive products for the LDCs; and c) a genuine provision for technical assistance along with a revenue compensation mechanism. The latter, in particular, is related to strenghtening the supply capacity of the LDCs, as discussed in an earlier chapter. Equity is also an important consideration at the national level because it is natural that trade liberalization \u2013 or regional integration arrangements for that matter \u2013 does not benefit all people equally. For example, it might benefit male skilled workers at the cost of female unskilled workers or the manufacturing sector at the cost of agriculture or the urban population at the cost of the rural population. Therefore, \u201cin order to maximize the welfare gains from trade and to strengthen the political case for participation in trade\u201d, according to UNDP (2005a: 124), \u201cit is important that the winners compensate the losers\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7206c16d-0db6-4ae1-8ee9-a5c2aa7a03d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7206c16d-0db6-4ae1-8ee9-a5c2aa7a03d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5eb46dd968977c80262d00be27ea12687f24bbe0cdea7d8fe8e4a05bb035f124"}, "2": {"node_id": "6708e9ae-3178-4936-b36b-14e67178274c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f679fdc668f89ac1c456a597737f478d9443d10fbc32e2a99f0f8f85145b54a"}}, "hash": "de0f436a53ef8dbdbcff46f03733e4fffc8255a8d21f0fc493eda1615ac1a43d", "text": "Given that the 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India Maldives Nepal Pakistan Sri Lanka 72 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement market is probably the weakest instrument for overcoming these distributive challenges, it is the responsibility of governments, among others, to: a) maintain policy space during trade negotiation processes in order to smoothen the burden of adjustment; and b) put in place a redistributive mechanism, with a view to compensating the losers.

Domestic political actors are expected to design policies that strike a balance between the demands of various pressure groups by putting in place an appropriate mechanism to compensate the losers (Rodrik, 1998; Prakash, 2001). This is where Ruggie\u2019s (1982) theory of \u2018embedded liberalism\u2019 comes into play. This theory explains the post-World War II bargain that made trade liberalization possible by governments assuaging the potential losers. Empirical evidence points to the \u2018political effectiveness\u2019 of such a bargain (Mayda, O\u2019Rourke and Sinnott, 2007). This theory has been adopted in letter and spirit in the industrialized economies that have significant exposure to foreign trade. In the most open countries, such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, spending on income transfers has expanded the most, and trade unions have been given considerable voice in designing adjustment mechanisms (Rodrik, 1998). Thus, institutions that promote domestic equity aid the process of creating long-term support for international trade (Prakash, 2001; Mayda, O\u2019Rourke and Sinnott, 2007). However, the ability of States to design the necessary safety nets to compensate the losers is not only a function of the willingness of their governments but also of the availability of resources, which, unfortunately, are scarce in most developing countries and particularly the LDCs. This does not mean that developing countries do not design safety nets to protect the interests of the losers at all. Some relatively less-resourced countries, such as Ecuador and Mongolia, for instance, have put in place mechanisms for compensating those who lose as a consequence of increased trade liberalization (UNDP, 2006). This shows that, given the political will, developing countries can institute safety net programmes when circumstances so dictate. Such measures are not effectively implemented in most South Asian countries due mainly to resource constraints. There are at least two multilateral initiatives to help these countries in their trade adjustment, namely the Trade Integration Mechanism (TIM) of the IMF and the Aid for Trade (AFT) initiative of the WTO. TIM is exclusively designed to help countries adjust to the unfavourable impacts of trade liberalization only at the multilateral level52 and is therefore not relevant in the context of an RTA like SAFTA. The other initiative does focus on the regional dimension but seems largely preoccupied with the issue of the provisioning of regional public goods, such as roads, transportation and customs infrastructure, with the expectation that such an investment would facilitate, among others, increased intraregional trade. Although such support is welcome, AFT may have a limited role in helping LDCs overcome the redistributive challenge at the regional level. 52 See Bretton Woods Project at: www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-51257 (accessed 20 August 2009). Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 73 6.3.3 Empowerment Empowerment is broadly understood as the \u201ccapability of the members of society to shape the processes and events that affect their lives\u201d (Montes and Memis, 2005: 11). While paid employment opportunities and the resultant increase in incomes provide people with the means to advance their empowerment, this is not sufficient to guarantee improved human development outcomes. What is required is a set of policies that promote people\u2019s empowerment, such as workers\u2019 participation in decisions that affect their right to earn a living \u2014 whether through collective bargaining or otherwise; farmers\u2019 representation on committees established to promote their right to a livelihood; and representation of other stakeholders in shaping trade and industrial policies as well as trade negotiations. According to conventional belief, which has become almost an axiomatic truth, a democratic polity is sufficient to ensure that the views of the people, who will be affected by any decision, are reflected in policy-making. In the context of South Asia where, for the first time in history, all the countries have democratically elected governments, this has not been the case. This is because of the virtual absence of a consultation culture among policy elites, who believe that they represent the interests of the entire country and tend to sideline the views and opinions of the stakeholders they are meant to represent. The issue of empowerment is particularly salient for the poor and marginalized segments of society, especially women, most of whom are at the receiving end of the socio-political spectrum53 and have limited opportunities to enhance their agency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9c40865-0aa6-40bf-9c4b-f0a9dcee6dd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9c40865-0aa6-40bf-9c4b-f0a9dcee6dd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "508fa1bc089fe840fd86e52e11d42f76b8f5de8a116bd2045cf423b8ef0461d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6c9336a-19f3-4a18-bcec-9a7f385d675c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b056f38482efa09966b182e55d898d8c2529a81f97b721709afcf03899baf7e5"}}, "hash": "40b93b08ce2e98c67b4226160630d77ac67dbb09ebab6ac70597816c701ee0d8", "text": "This is because \u201csocial norms, political culture and public attitudes matter as much as income, economic wealth and overall human development in defining opportunities for women\u201d (UNDP, 2005a: 45).

In trade negotiations, as discussed earlier, sovereign economic power \u2013 the ability to provide access to a huge market (carrot) or to foreclose the market (stick) or the ability to provide transit rights (carrot) or to prevent neighbours from using transit facilities (stick) \u2013 can hugely influence the outcome of negotiations (see, for example, Adhikari, 2009b). Given that countries in South Asia have varied levels of economic and political power in trade negotiations, which determines the extent of their ability to tilt the balance of negotiated outcomes in their favour, this asymmetry has resulted in outcomes that are less favourable to the smaller countries. A comparison between the trade figures for 2000 and 2008 reveals that the trade deficits of the LDCs, such as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal vis-\u00e0-vis their regional trading partners, have increased significantly (table 6.1). It is pertinent to mention that a trade deficit at the bilateral level, or even at the regional level, may not be cause for concern as long as the countries with these deficits have trade surpluses vis-\u00e0-vis countries outside the region. 53 They tend to be ruled, not rulers, having to obey rules though not being involved in setting those rules, and they are obliged to rely on men for access to resources and opportunities. 74 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement While this is true to some extent for LDCs such as Bangladesh and Maldives, Bhutan and Nepal have not been as fortunate. It is this asymmetry that needs to be corrected in order to help the LDCs in the region achieve their human development objectives. For this, the LDCs need to be empowered to advance their interests in trade negotiations so that they are not only able to secure access to the markets of developing-country members for products with a relatively higher human development spin-off (such as higher value-added agricultural products or basic manufacturing) but also to enhance their supply capacity in order to take advantage of the market-opening opportunities.

Note: Regarding data for Bhutan, see note to table 2.1. 6.3.4 Productivity The conventional view of productivity simply looks at the labour-to-output ratio, with a higher ratio indicating a higher level of productivity. This view treats productivity as an end in itself. Seen from the perspective of human development, productivity involves \u201cthe raising of human capabilities among members of the society, both as an end in itself and as a means to raise the capability of the society as whole\u201d (Montes and Memis, 2005:12). This view of productivity goes beyond what is predicated by the theory of human capital, which tends to treat human beings as inputs into the production process, not as beneficiaries. Although advances in health, education, skills and other human capabilities are necessary for enhancing productivity, there are at least two conditions that need to be fulfilled to make productivity work for human development. First, the income level of people needs to be increased and they should be protected from income volatility so that households can meet their basic needs, such as food and nutrition security, that are efficiently provided by the households. Second, markets and public institutions should undertake the provisioning of public goods, such as basic health and education, which cannot be provided by individual households (Islam, 2001:7, cited in Montes and Memis, 2005:12).

According to Montes and Memis (2005:13), \u201cby providing the foreign exchange and access to capital imports and technology, trade played a critical role in the success of newly industrializing countries in East Asia\u201d. Moreover, a study by Schiff and Wang (2004), which uses industry-level data for technology transfer for three countries (Mexico, Poland and the Republic of Korea), shows strong evidence of regional technology transfer for Mexico and the Republic of Korea and weaker evidence of such transfer for Poland, suggesting that it is much easier to transfer/acquire technology regionally than multilaterally. This underscores the need for regional cooperation on technology transfer. In the context of South Asia, India is probably the only country in the region that has exhibited an \u201cascendance of certain manufactured exports differentiated between what used to be the industrial countries\u2019 domain, such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals and agricultural implements\u201d (Pitigala, 2005: 22). This evolving comparative advantage is reflected in the fact that India\u2019s exports of these highly segmented industrial products to the region account for 36 percent of its total exports to the region, a feat other countries in the region have not achieved, so far (ibid.). Provided there is increased intraregional trade and capability can be enhanced for technology absorption by investing in human capital and in the technology- intensive sectors of the economy, there is considerable scope for productivity improvement within the region. One of the major considerations that apply to each of these aspects of human development is that these four factors \u2013 sustainability, equity, empowerment and productivity \u2013 interact closely (Montes and Memis, 2005: 15). However, the domestic structure of economic governance can contribute significantly to improving human development outcomes. For example, empowerment of workers, particularly women working in the export sector, to improve their working conditions helps to promote equity. Better working conditions can in turn enable these workers to engage in greater investment at the household level so as to improve their own productivity as well as that of their family members, including children (ibid.). The role of governance is vital for ensuring that the productive workforce is employed in gainful employment sectors, such that there is movement up the technology ladder and that a policy is in place to empower the workers. Finally, at the level of the society or nation, equity and empowerment can in turn engender productivity and sustainability (ibid.). 76 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement The foregoing discussion makes it abundantly clear that SAFTA in its current form does not promote human development, particularly for the LDCs. However, if the regional integration programme is appropriately designed and the domestic system of economic governance overhauled to ensure that human development \u2018SEEPs\u2019, to the bottom and people are made true beneficiaries of regional integration, there is considerable scope for SAFTA to promote human development, as demonstrated by the various examples provided. These are also necessary as well as sufficient conditions for achieving the goal enshrined in the SAARC Charter.

At the same time, according to Sobhan (2001:4), it is important to accord utmost priority to creating \u201cspace and opportunity for the weaker members of SAARC to evolve out of their underdeveloped status through the medium of SAARC\u201d. The weaker economies, particularly the LDCs, \u201cneed to utilize SAARC as a vehicle for their own dynamic expansion and structural transformation, rather than view it as an instrument for their marginalization\u201d (ibid.). Many studies conducted so far (see, for example, ADB/UNCTAD, 2008; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008) recommend enhancing overall trade and economic cooperation in South Asia and, albeit in passing, addressing concerns relating to LDCs\u2019 marginalization. However, the studies do not focus on issues specific to South Asian LDCs and thus do not make substantive proposals beyond the political correctness of suggesting that LDC concerns should be taken on board.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d086454-2b87-4c60-aa7a-45287fa9a1e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d086454-2b87-4c60-aa7a-45287fa9a1e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0063851f120f7c60ce6aa59d8fd505fd71d7169bfe0f3f0e1a2decee084fcd16"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6f8b393-f1b2-43ed-a8ea-47d78c13a406", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "793513b1a4e5a6eff021e008e7ddde55404930fc76c01f00a1ac72cd9ce14de1"}}, "hash": "c12d6c774dee5ba21b73f1c938ca05e862a9932107916c009f7ece6544ddc67c", "text": "To be fair to these studies, their remit was much broader and they were not required to focus exclusively on the South Asian LDCs.

Chapter 7 78 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Tarff barriers According to SAFTA, although tariff barriers will eventually have to be reduced to between 0 and 5 percent by the end of 2013 for the exports of the LDCs to the region\u2019s developing- country markets, the single most important issue that hinders regional integration efforts and especially the LDCs\u2019 participation in regional trade is the sensitive lists maintained by the member countries. This paper does not purport to suggest that sensitive lists are inherently a defective intrument for trade and/or revenue protection. Indeed, sensitive lists may provide much-needed \u2018policy space\u2019 for countries to protect their sensitive sectors for purposes of food security, livelihood security, rural development and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, they need to be maintained according to the needs and priorities of each country. Moreover, some of the countries\u2019 sensitive lists account for more than 20 percent of their respective tariff headings and there is no time limit for pruning them within SAFTA (see, for example, Weerakoon and Thennankoon, 2006; Raihan, forthcoming). But there have been two recent developments concerning these lists. First, a committee of experts in 2009 made the decision to require a reduction of the sensitive lists of each country by 20 percent within four years. Second, India has unilaterally revised its sensitive list twice, in 2005 and 2008. As a result, the number of items included in its sensitive list for LDCs has fallen to 480 from the orginal 763, though this represents only 9.5 percent of the total tariff lines of 5,052 items (table 7.1). Table 7 1: Reduction of India\u2019s sensitive list under SAFTA, 2005 and 2008 (at six digit HS code) LDCs Non-LDCs No. of tariff lines 5,052 No. of tariff lines in orginal sensitive list (2005) 763 884 No. of tariff lines in revised sensitive list (2005) 744 865 No. of tariff lines in revised sensitive list (2008) 480 868 Source: Rahman, 2010. Nothwithstanding this unilateral gesture, the LDCs still face formidable tariff barriers in the Indian market. As noted, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have not prepared separate sensitive lists for LDCs. Taking a cue from other South-South RTAs, such as AFTA,55 it would be useful to reclassify the sensitive lists into three categories: a) temporary exclusion list, not exceeding 10 percent of tariff lines of each member country, with products on the list being phased out over a period of five years; b) sensitive list, not exceeding 5 percent of the respective countries\u2019 tariff lines, to be phased out over a period of 10 years; and c) highly sensitive list, not exceeding 5 percent of tariff lines, which could be maintained by each country for 55 See, for example, UNESCAP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Trade and Investment Agreements Database (AFTA-Goods database) at: www.unescap.org/tid/aptiad/viewagreement.aspx?id=ASEAN%20Goods-AFTA (accessed 3 June 2009).

To allay fears of trade deflection, however, it is necessary to maintain some form of ROO.

This would not only facilitiate the LDCs\u2019 trade expansion but also give them adequate time to develop their industrial base to enable them to source more and more inputs domestically or from within the region (taking advantage of the cumulation rules). As far as regulatory barriers are concerned, the establishment of SARSO is likely to help the LDCs eventually meet the requirements of standards relating at least to industrial goods through mutual recognition of standards with their trading partners. So far, a similar arrangement has not been made for facilitating trade in agricultural goods and commodities. Therefore, forming a regional body along the lines similar to SARSO, or expanding the scope of that organization to include agricultural products is necessary. At the same time, an LDC Integration Fund (discussed further on) could be established to support food and agricultural standards-related institutions within the LDCs to boost trade in these sectors. The establishment of this fund could also be supported by the AFT intitiative of the WTO (also discussed further on). If the human development potential of SAFTA is to be enhanced, South Asian countries should agree to a 10-year moratorium on the imposition of NTBs on products of export interest to the LDCs in general and to all SMEs in the member countries because they are the single greatest employers in these countries. Any difficulty in seggregating products exported by SMEs and non-SMEs at the border of the importing countries could be resolved by authorizing a designated authority of the exporting country to certify that the goods being exported are manufactured by SMEs. 7.2.2 Addressing supply-side constraints Overcoming supply-side constraints in LDCs could help increase their trade prospects in a sustained manner and more effectively than the removal of market access barriers. Removing these constraints would not only help them supply the regional market competitively, it would also provide them with the opportunity to expand their trade in 80 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement international markets. This in turn could help them gain economies of scale, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in both markets. Some of the crucial measures that need to be urgently implemented to overcome the supply-side constraints of the South Asian LDCs are discussed further on. Human capital The SHRDC has begun to appreciate the role of human capital in trade expansion, economic growth and poverty reduction as well as in the achievement of human development objectives. It should develop programmes aimed at expanding its research, training and advocacy efforts without further delay. However, its remit may be limited to training business leaders and managers because its mandate does not cover skills development training for workers at the enterprise level. It is the principal responsibility of each member country to design and implement programmes aimed at enhancing the skills profiles of its workers and managers. Given the limited return on investment, at least in the initial stage of implementation, LDC governments should take the lead in exploring various avenues to involve the private sector, including through public-private partnerships (see Adhikari and Yamamoto, 2007). In addition to these efforts at the national level, regional cooperation can be extremely useful. One possibility is that training institutions for skills development in the LDCs could collaborate with training institutions in developing countries through joint ventures or technical cooperation agreements. Another possibility is that floor-level supervisors of enterprises in the LDCs could be given short courses on skills development in specific fields in various South Asian countries. These supervisors, upon their return to their home countries, could then provide training to other workers down the line. While the short-term measures discussed above have several merits, long-term productivity of workers and managers will depend on sustained investment in tertiary and vocational education at the national level. This should be supplemented by the provision of scholarships for deserving students from the LDCs to enable them to attend universities and vocational training institutions in the developing countries of the region. Trade facilitation The efforts initiated by SAARC through the Group on Customs Reform, including the adoption of a Customs Action Plan, are useful initiatives, but they are yet to produce tangible outcomes that could contribute towards the \u2018plumbing\u2019 of regional trade. At the regional level, small initiatives similar to that of the South Asian Revenue Service for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "535625aa-1bb5-4587-bd61-0a5135ce12a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "535625aa-1bb5-4587-bd61-0a5135ce12a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21702795ac75f7d95831b4b3cfa3a4740ae96cc3b325415d6e95656b9a89c75e"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9f2106e-ea68-48dc-84b9-77f2f9e04729", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "accb709b41d7b93a3a0e8aa340462ad39035a3c2c9c5887a3413b8366c6adabc"}}, "hash": "fdc83e083359aad98210344dbf04be7cfe4916c1516e79cc2302eba41203c669", "text": "building the capacity of its counterparts in COMESA countries could have a noticeable impact. Given its institutional capacity in terms of resources, expertise and skills, the Indian Customs Service is singularly capable of such an undertaking. Because the primary responsibility for improving the trade facilitation set-up in each country lies with the country itself, a domestic reform agenda is equally vital. While Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 81 resource constraints may cause difficulties in the implementation of reform measures for many LDCs, policy makers in these countries should recognize two important aspects concerning resources. First, some measures (such as reducing the number of signatures or documentation requirements for exports and imports), which can be executed through a ministerial decision, do not entail any financial burden for the government. For other tasks, such as the computerization of customs offices and hiring and training of staff, which may require some investments, the LDCs can and should seek funding through multilateral facilities, such as the EIF and AFT (see Adhikari and Yamamto, 2007). Moreover, since efforts are under way under the aegis of the ADB, at least in the context of the South Asian Growth Quadrangle, to help the LDCs remedy this problem, they should aim to derive maximum benefits from this initiative. Second, investments to improve trade facilitation produce benefits for both importers and exporters. They also tend to produce much larger economy- wide benefits, which, more often than not, are found to be greater than the benefits derived from the reduction of traditional trade barriers. Therefore, a considerable proportion of the LDC Integration Fund should be spent on improving trade faciliation measures at the regional level. Research, development and innovation As noted in chapter V, South Asian countries, with the exception of India, continue to produce and export \u2018poor goods\u2019, and their efforts at export diversification have not yielded satisfactory results. Nor are they targeted at moving up the technology ladder. Barring India, the level of research and development (R&D) in South Asia in general is not encouraging, as measured by industrial value addition, the business sophistication index, the innovation index and the technological readiness index. Two LDCs in the region, Bangladesh and Nepal, which were included in the Global Competitiveness Report, 2009-2010 of the World Economic Forum (2009), rank much lower than their developing-country neighbours in South Asia (table 7.2). Table 7 2: Productive capacity, sophistication, innovation and technological readiness in South Asia, 2009\u20132010 (N=133) Country Industrial value addition (% of GDP) 2007 Business sophistication index Innovation index Technological readiness index Rank Score Rank Score Rank Score Bangladesh 29 100 3.5 122 2.5 125 2.4 India 29 27 4.8 30 3.7 83 3.3 Nepal 17 126 3.2 130 2.3 132 2.2 Pakistan 27 81 3.8 79 3.0 104 2.9 Sri Lanka 30 42 4.5 46 3.4 85 3.3 Source: World Economic Forum, 2009. 82 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Thus there is a need for concerted efforts, both nationally and regionally, to enhance the technological and innovative capacity of enterprises in these countries. Presently there is no major programme at either level aimed at overcoming these challenges. Moreover, as noted, since even the ADB, which is providing support for the SASEC initiative, has not included R&D as a major support area, efforts need to be initiated primarily at the national level, which then should be supplemented by funding support from the ADB. While resource constraints are a major problem in this area as well, a few innovative approaches could help produce much greater benefits relative to the costs involved. One way to deal with the resource crunch is to provide tax breaks and other fiscal incentives to private sector enterprises to pool resources for investing in R&D. It should also be possible for the private sector to join hands with national, publicly funded institutions. Provided there is political will to solve this problem, regional efforts should be geared towards providing training to scientists, engineers and other technical profesionals to enhance the technological capabilities of the LDCs as well as ensuring the transfer of technology from developing countries to the LDCs on favourable terms and conditions. Finally, the technical feasibility and economic viability of establishing a regional R&D institution should also be explored.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9f2106e-ea68-48dc-84b9-77f2f9e04729": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9f2106e-ea68-48dc-84b9-77f2f9e04729", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21702795ac75f7d95831b4b3cfa3a4740ae96cc3b325415d6e95656b9a89c75e"}, "2": {"node_id": "535625aa-1bb5-4587-bd61-0a5135ce12a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fdc83e083359aad98210344dbf04be7cfe4916c1516e79cc2302eba41203c669"}}, "hash": "accb709b41d7b93a3a0e8aa340462ad39035a3c2c9c5887a3413b8366c6adabc", "text": "Transit facilities Although it is customary to view transit problems as endemic to landlocked countries, in the context of the South Asian LDCs, transit is also a major problem for a coastal country such as Bangladesh.

For example, tea producers in Nepal, who wanted to export their produce to Pakistan, lobbied the Nepalese and Pakistani governments for the use of Pakistan International Airlines, the only airline that connects Kathmandu with Pakistani cities (earlier Karachi and now Islamabad as well) on concessional terms to help them reduce the costs of airlifting the consignments.56 Likewise, Nepalese and Bangladeshi traders face insourmountable difficulties while transiting through India, not because any restrictions exist officially but because customs and security officials have the power to create several hurdles (Kharel, 2009b). 56 Based on a personal conversation in August 2004 with Suraj Baidya, the then Vice-president and current Senior Vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 83 Providing unfettered transit facilities to neighbours, even if purely for trading purposes, is not only an economic (such as leakage of goods into the transit country) but also a political and, to some extent, a national security issue. It is therefore highly contentious, which could be the reason for the absence of any discussion on this issue within SAARC, despite the enormous costs arising from non-cooperation and inaction. Efforts should be made to initiate discussions on the issue of free and unfettered transit for the movement of goods within the region, at least on a trial basis. This could be done by setting some basic ground rules so that security- and leakage-related problems are also addressed. While leakage may not be a major problem in the context of a gradual reduction of trade barriers as envisaged by SAFTA, security concerns should be addressed effectively. If the costs of monitoring compliance with these rules are found to be lower than the benefits accruing to the entire region, it would certainly justify providing unfettered transit rights for the movement of goods (both inward and outward) within and beyond regional boundaries. One such possibility is to institute a system of random checking of consignments to ensure a reasonably good degree of compliance with secruity as well as anti-deflection norms in the least trade restrictive manner possible, without imposing a too much of a cost burdern on regional traders. Kharel (2009b), for example, makes a strong case for initiating negotiations on a South Asian Transit Arrangement. He argues that the importance of better transit transport facilities is greatest for the landlocked LDCs of the region, but that coastal countries \u2013 the traditional \u2018transit-providers\u2019 \u2013 also stand to benefit from regional cooperation on transit and transport. For instance, as Rahmatullah (2010), an advocate of a free and unfettered transit regime in South Asia, argues: \u201cThe shipment of Assam tea to Europe is required to travel 1,400 km to reach Kolkata port along the \u2018chicken neck\u2019, since no agreement exists for India to use the traditional route through Chittagong port, which would be shorter by 60 percent. The southern border of Tripura State is only 75 km from Chittagong port but goods from Agartala are required to travel 1,645 km to reach Kolkata port through the \u2018chicken neck\u2019. If transport cooperation were there, goods would have traveled only around 400 km across Bangladesh to reach Kolkata\u201d. (Rahmatullah 2010: 178) In exchange for granting India transit rights, Bangladesh could expect India to provide transit facilities to Bhutan and Nepal for their bilateral trade with Bangladesh as well as third-country trade via Bangladeshi sea ports (Kharel, 2009b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b7af473-ab70-4614-8bfa-9d70a701fb6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b7af473-ab70-4614-8bfa-9d70a701fb6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a79d60347c2a8b0c2676ad38466dc214972db707e615dccb946ad2ff1708975e"}, "2": {"node_id": "0dbbcdd6-b34f-4b57-8a21-007e77e24797", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ecbe976c37c8332cbdf8d81da493e7496108e91711ef989ad1245ce23bc04bf"}}, "hash": "84fa8ed5194946e43097e5d131784f33a9cfd9b6e74c1b43ac93dae534528a3a", "text": "Some positive developments that emerged from the visit of the prime minister of Bangladesh to India on 10\u201313 January 2010, as stated in the joint communiqu\u00e9, include: a) Bangladesh\u2019s agreement to allow the use of Mongla and Chittagong sea ports by India; and b) agreement on the availability of Rohanpur-Singabad broad-gauge railway link for transit to Nepal and Bangladesh\u2019s request for a rail transit link to Bhutan (Rahman, 2010).

The Declaration states that the South Asian leaders \u201calso recognized the importance of development of communication system and transport infrastructure and transit facilities [e]specially for the landlocked countries to promote intra-SAARC trade\u201d (para 23) (SAARC, 2010:4). What is now required is continued advocacy from the private sector and civil society organizations urging the leaders to engage in serious discussions on a South Asian Transit Arrangement. Funding arrangements Funding is the single most important cross-cutting issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority while discussing regional cooperation for overcoming supply-side contraints. While some of these issues have been discussed already, this section highlights the need for creating a reasonably large-sized LDC Integration Fund (LIF), as envisaged by CASAC (2001:19), to assist the LDCs in these areas. Adhikari (2010) proposes that for the creation and mobilization of such a fund, it is important to first determine its size. Although difficult to quantify without an adequate needs assessment, an indicative portfolio with an annual contribution of US$1.1 billion, calculated at 0.07 percent of the GDP of the SAARC member States could be created. The figure of 0.07 percent is 10 percent of what the United Nations has urged the OECD Development Assistance Committee to contribute in the form of official development assistance (ODA) (see, for example, United Nations, 2002). Similarly, with regard to its financing, the following modalities could be considered. Core contributions: Three major types of core contributions could be envisaged. First, member States could contribute at least 50 percent of the resource requirements of the LIF, based on their share of intraregional trade. Second, SAARC observers could contribute 25 percent of the total requirement. Third, other multilateral and bilateral donors could contribute another 25 percent of the total requirement. The last two contributions should be in addition to ODA commitments. Project-based contributions: Because creating regional public goods, such as cross-border road linkages, commu-nication and trade facilitation, are among the priority agendas of the WTO\u2019s AFT initiative, it should be possible to acquire seed project-based funding from this source. Examples of existing regional projects include: a multi-donor North-South corridor initiative, jointly implemented by three regional groupings in Southern Africa, an ADB- funded Greater Mekong Subregional Project and the South Asian Sub-regional Economic Cooperation Programme, though the latter is yet to show tangible results. Although the Sub-group on Technical Assistance to Least Developed Contracting States under Article 11(d) of SAFTA identified 10 areas for addressing the LDCs\u2019 supply-side constraints, progress has been minimal. This is partly because of the \u2018best endeavour\u2019 nature Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 85 of this provision but also because the areas identified do not include \u2018hardware\u2019 components, such as creating infrastructure. To make this initiative effective, it should be regionalized and merged with the proposed LDC Integration Fund. The developing-country members should provide assistance by making direct contributions to the fund, over and above their core contributions. While the operational modalities could be decided once the funding issue is settled, entrusting a professional management team with responsibility to manage the fund is an essential condition for the successful imple-mentation of projects in priority areas. Adhikari (2010) proposes the following indicative list of priority areas at the regional and national levels, in addition to what has already been identified by the Sub-group on Technical Assistance for funding support under the LIF: \u2022\ufffd development of transport corridors to improve regional connectivity and rural access \u2022\ufffd construction of a regional grid to facilitate trade in electricity, and a regional pipeline to transport petroleum products \u2022\ufffd trade facilitation, particularly modernization of customs administrations \u2022\ufffd construction of laboratories and testing facilities \u2022\ufffd construction of warehouses and cold storage facilities to enable trade in agricultural products. 7.3 Expanding SAFTA\u2019s remit As discussed in previous chapters, the \u2018goods-only\u2019 framework of SAFTA has come under intense criticism of late (see, for example, Razzaque, 2008a; ADB/UNCTAD, 2008; Sawhney and Kumar, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "999495ae-4840-4c39-8f42-fe0d44e2d62a": {"__data__": {"id_": "999495ae-4840-4c39-8f42-fe0d44e2d62a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a19c94411a7179b9d65a908ca9bd1fd866bbddf4287e004b724541441bf76ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cfe8361-8b6b-46e4-8968-82dd0426f647", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6835bb9cca15a1469e13289b68da88e49c4f21e6a1e8779d1a35c60fa8b958a7"}}, "hash": "41a8e37127659c70eca108a975fa4f1c1ed7e1a748e0d9186c692fe780c3a294", "text": "However, few studies have highlighted the significance of expanding the remit of SAFTA to cover trade in services and rules on cross-border flows of investment.

As suggested by Chanda (2010:15), South Asia\u2019s growing competitiveness in services is illustrated by revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indices for services vis-\u00e0-vis merchandise for the region. Figure 7.1 shows that in 2007, while the RCA index in merchandise fell to below 1 in almost all the countries in the region, the RCA index for services was more than 2 in Maldives and Nepal, about 2 in India, more than 1 in Pakistan and close to 1 in Sri Lanka. This trend is bolstered by the region\u2019s growing trade in services. While South Asia achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.5 percent in services exports between 2001 and 2007, it achieved a CAGR of 13.6 percent in services imports \u2013 both higher than the world average (ibid.).

For a sector that is experiencing rapid growth in trade, growing participation in world markets and rising competitiveness, there is tremendous potential for intraregional trade as well. Realizing the significance of the services sector, a Ministerial Council in Dhaka in April 2006 mandated the COE to examine the possibility of including trade in services in SAFTA and commissioned a study to provide recommendations to this end (Bhatta, 2006).

Following repeated delays, the COE finally managed to complete the draft of the SAFAS in time for signing during the 16th SAARC Summit in Thimpu, Bhutan, in April 2010. This is indeed a welcomed development, but what is now required of the individual member countries is to resist the mercantilist urge and undertake meaningful liberalization commitments while making minimal \u2018carve outs\u2019 for sensitive sectors that are crucial for promoting human development objectives. Despite a number of positive contributions expected from the liberalization of services within SAFTA, there are a few challenges that need to be carefully analysed and necessary safeguards that need to be created so as to address the human development issues and concerns associated with the impending liberalization. One such issue is that of accessibility by the poor and marginalized segments of society to the services provided by foreign 88 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement enterprises should the prices of those services increase because of a \u2018profit-push\u2019 by such enterprises (Bhatta, 2006). Another issue is the weak regulatory capacity of various countries in the region, in particular the LDCs, for ensuring standards and adherence to rules (Zaman, 2008). Third, because of a lack of data and analysis on trade in services, it is difficult, if not impossible, for trade negotiators and stakeholders to gauge the impact of the opening up of certain sectors or subsectors (ibid.). Fourth, due to assymetry in the trade potential of services within the region, with India being the single largest player and other countries making a minuscule contribution to the global trade in services, the other countries might be wary of India taking the lion\u2019s share of the benefits from the liberalization of services (Chanda, 2010). Meanwhile, as suggested by Chanda (2010), South Asian countries other than India should convert what is currently viewed as an assymetry into opportunity by harnessing the potential of a services trade and investment nexus. Thus, they should allow service providers from developing countries, such as India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to deliver services through a commercial presence (mode 3 of GATS). It is equally important that the developing countries provide meaningful S&D treatment to the LDCs by making commitments to liberalize the sectors and modes of export interest to the LDCs and by helping them strenghthen their domestic regulatory capabilities. At the same time, a regional equivalence agreement, whereby every SAARC country recognizes the qualifications of the nationals of all its regional partners, is also vital to enable the free movement of natural persons (mode 4 of GATS). Another area in which SAARC countries and stakeholders alike have shown interest is the possibility of an agreement on investment protection and promotion. While cross-border investments have been taking place in the region, efforts towards increasing them and protecting them from confiscation and appropriation are key to expanding economic opportunities for South Asian countries, in particular the LDCs. While mode 3 of services delivery under GATS \u2013 which all the COE members agreed to as the model in drafting the SAFAS \u2013 deals with cross-border movements of investment for the provisioning of services, the contours of the investment framework for the production and supply of goods have to be prepared. Although intraregional flows of investment have increased in recent years due mainly to the BTAs that India has signed with Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the region falls far short of harnessing the full potential of the trade-investment nexus (table 7.4). Nepal is the only country in the region that has received a substantial share (47 percent) of FDI from within the region, but that is from only one country, India, in 2006/07. Prior to that, it had received FDI from all the countries in the region except Maldives. However, since Nepal does not receive much investment from anywhere else in the world because of the deteriorating investment climate in the country, the large share of FDI from India does not reflect a large amount in absolute terms. Indian investment in Sri Lanka is not significant in percentage terms, but in absolute terms it is higher than its investment in Nepal. According to Bhusnurmath (2009), India\u2019s cumulative FDI in Sri Lanka reached US$170 million in 2006. In contrast, Nepal\u2019s FDI receipts have been extremely limited and volatile (UNCTAD, 2009: 447).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "376aea94-a7fe-41d1-9b15-494fc536aee5": {"__data__": {"id_": "376aea94-a7fe-41d1-9b15-494fc536aee5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ebd392ca7634609f02e93d68e2a646966a715b3142dfa81ee0533786b70eb8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9fb392b-93dd-4e09-b7f4-a67970c88879", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a812bf4d4bb9712016238318fbab8fc43bcb4b4158898b9a40415430b7ddb361"}}, "hash": "760e520f536c9dd6ef4fade95be7f21130ab13ddbbde7872813f60a8ac06f0e1", "text": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 89 The share of intraregional FDI inflows in total inflows of SAARC countries is very low at present (table 7.4), but this could change if the region made sufficient efforts to utilize regional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97e54775-923f-414e-941e-6a55e8607a30": {"__data__": {"id_": "97e54775-923f-414e-941e-6a55e8607a30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f87bfde5221e6a7e08b6fff588b7eb9ec12166549390abacf4ef98d78b3b86e"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ffe3a94-a005-45a8-b907-ccdbc2fa151b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fd028e296370f33aed3f81b09eca79672494429144a3afe7b09e03fb9fa56a6"}}, "hash": "5efa94fdd10f378f84eb93597d99e8b1283d445559cf88323e172726b0d9939f", "text": "trade integration as an instrument for increasing the flow of intraregional FDI. According to the ADB (2008), foreign investors globally do not consider South Asia an attractive destination for investment due to the inherent difficulties associated with doing business in the region. Bhusnurmath (2009) is of the view that shallow regional integration is a major deterrent to increased intraregional investment flows, partly because SAFTA, limited as it is, does not include investment within its scope.

Similarly, intraregional investment figures for Afghanistan, both inward and outward, are not available. During the 15th SAARC Summit, the Heads of State and Government directed that the Draft Agreement on Investment Promotion and Protection be finalized early and that the SAARC Arbitration Council be operationalized to achieve further economic integration. However, it appears that, given the preoccupation of the COE members with the finalization of the draft on a services agreement, very limited efforts have been made towards drafting an investment promotion and protection agreement. The 16th SAARC Summit mentioned the issue of investment only in passing by emphasizing \u201cthe need to strengthen the role of private sector in regional initiatives through appropriate mechanisms including through public-private partnership as well as the need for greater intra-SAARC investment promotion efforts\u201d (para 22).57 This would mean that investment promotion efforts will remain mainly a private sector-driven exercise, with limited commitments by the governments to conclude a binding agreement in this area. 57 See: www.saarc-sec.org/userfiles/16thSummit-Declaration29April10.pdf 90 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement Conclusions As one of the least integrated regions in the world, South Asia faces enormous challenges, both in terms of deriving the potential benefits of broader economic cooperation and in addressing human development issues. These challenges are even more profound for the LDCs of the region, which suffer from several structural weaknesses, have a narrow export base and are unable to take advantage of the limited market-access opportunities provided by SAFTA due to supply-side constraints. The study reflected in this has analysed two hypotheses. First, despite the political rhetoric, the process of regional trade integration taking place in South Asia under SAFTA is indifferent, if not inimical, to the LDCs\u2019 interests. Second, the modalities and pace of regional trade integration under SAFTA do not sufficiently take into account the human development objectives identified by and included in the SAARC Charter. Thus, SAFTA, in its present form, cannot contribute to improved human development, particularly in the LDCs of the region. Based on a survey of existing literature, this study finds that, if economic theory and the empirical analyses conducted so far are any guide, the weaker economies in the region, particularly the LDCs, will lose out from SAFTA. If the Agreement is limited to goods and if other areas of cooperation are not explored, the prospects for trade and economic growth of the LDCs are not encouraging. An assessment of SAFTA from the LDCs\u2019 perspective reveals that their inability to penetrate the largest market in the region \u2013 that of India \u2013 is a major problem for these weak and vulnerable economies. This is mainly ascribed to the lack of predictability of market access in India.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ffe3a94-a005-45a8-b907-ccdbc2fa151b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ffe3a94-a005-45a8-b907-ccdbc2fa151b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integration of Least Developed Countries into South Asian Free Trade Agreement: A Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f87bfde5221e6a7e08b6fff588b7eb9ec12166549390abacf4ef98d78b3b86e"}, "2": {"node_id": "97e54775-923f-414e-941e-6a55e8607a30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integration-least-developed-countries-south-asian-free-trade-agreement-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5efa94fdd10f378f84eb93597d99e8b1283d445559cf88323e172726b0d9939f"}}, "hash": "0fd028e296370f33aed3f81b09eca79672494429144a3afe7b09e03fb9fa56a6", "text": "This is mainly ascribed to the lack of predictability of market access in India.

They are handicapped by structural constraints, such as a high level of export concentration and thus economic vulnerability to external shocks; geographic constraints, such as landlockedness (e.g. Afghanistan, Bhutan and Nepal) and remoteness (Maldives); and supply-side constraints, such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of human capital, limited access to credit and the virtual absence of trade facilitation measures. Their ability to derive benefits from regional trade is further impeded by the prevalence of a large Chapter 8 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement 91 proportion of informal trade \u2013 which dampens their prospects of generating additional revenue and improving governance \u2013 and by the web of bilateral FTAs within the region. Based on a conceptual framework for public goods developed by Kaul and Mendoza (2003), this study has argued that SAFTA, as it currently stands, does not fit into the framework of a \u2018regional public good\u2019 which should be the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of a regional integration arrangement of this kind. This is mainly due to a lack of \u2018publicness\u2019 in the distribution of benefits. The analysis of the real and perceived benefits of various regional and subregional initiatives taken so far to better integrate the South Asian LDCs reveals that these initiatives are far from adequate. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of political will and severe resource constraints, which impede the effectiveness of these initiatives in promoting LDCs\u2019 meaningful integration within the RTA. The analysis of the trade and human development nexus within the region and in the context of the LDCs, clearly reveals that SAFTA, in its current form, does not promote human development, particularly in the LDCs. However, if the regional integration programme is appropriately designed and national systems of economic governance overhauled to ensure that they help promote equity, empowerment, productivity and sustainability, and if people are made the true beneficiaries of regional integration, there is ample scope for SAFTA to promote human development. These are necessary as well as sufficient conditions for achieving the goal enshrined in the SAARC Charter, which should be the touchstone for evaluating the success of SAFTA. The seemingly depressing picture presented by this study need not remain so, provided serious thought is given to harnessing the potential of SAFTA or a broader regional economic cooperation arrangement for the benefit of the LDCs and especially for furthering the human development objectives of all the member countries. To realize this objective, efforts are required on three fronts: removing market access barriers, overcoming supply- side constraints and expanding the remit of SAFTA. The developing countries of the region need to give priority to reducing the size of their sensitive lists and removing NTBs on products of export interest to the LDCs and particularly of interest to SMEs. Similarly, regional cooperation on infrastructure development, development of human capital, provisioning of efficient transit facilities, improved trade facilitation and research, development and innovation will go a long way towards realizing the true potential of SAFTA. Finally, SAFTA needs to be expanded to include liberalization of services and protection and promotion of investment. This is because the LDCs in the region have a limited comparative advantage in the goods sector. At the 16th SAARC Summit, tremendous progress was made towards reaching agreement on the liberalization of services but the issue of investment has not yet received the attention it deserves. Yet it is an area that is crucial to successful economic integration in the region. 92 Integration of Least Developed Countries into the South Asian Free Trade Agreement ADB, Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program, South Asia (2006-2008), Manila, 2006. \u2014\u2014 Foreign Direct Investment in South Asia, South Asia Economic Report, Manila, 2008.

US$ 1.57 trillion. With the advent of new transmission technologies, improved means of transportation, and reorientation in priorities of states away from direct control and management of many commercial activities, both the perception and reality of the tradability of services has increased in the past two decades.

With the formal entry into force of the binding General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the WTO, and commencement of multilateral negotiations in 2000 the role of trade in services in development has become prominent. The stakes are thus high, not only because services include sectors that are the drivers of modern economic growth, with great potential for generating jobs and incomes, but they also include sectors where commercial motivations are secondary to the prime human development objective of ensuring basic well-being through decent health, education, energy, water and sanitation supplies, among others. The share of services in GDP in countries, in fact, systematically correlates with levels of per capita income. In developed countries, such a share typically exceeds 70 percent of national output (73 percent in the U.S.), while in developing countries, it is around 50 percent (lower in the least developed countries, like 25 percent in Lao PDR). Until the end of 1970s, there was a tendency to downplay the role of services in development. It was assumed that growth in services was an outcome of an enlarged development process, mostly sustained by industrial activities, and that as countries entered the post-industrial period, shifts would occur automatically to the services sector. Seen as an offshoot of progress elsewhere, countries did not even find it necessary to have distinct strategies on services (Gibbs and Ognivtsev 2004, 7). It is only since the mid-1980s that the view on the two-way causal relationship between services and economic development has been increasingly accepted. As people\u2019s needs grow, and public institutions in developing countries come under great strain in their attempts to cope with increasing claims on resources, they are compelled to explore a range of options to fill 1 This could be an understatement as not all services activities are captured in formal balance-of-payments statements. For discussion on problems of collecting accurate services data, see Raghavan (2004). Even when available, they may not be sufficiently disaggregated. There is a particular lack of internationally comparable statistics on South-South services trade. 8 glaring gaps: increase in domestic resource mobilisation for public investments in infrastructure, recourse to overseas transfers, grants and loans, and international trade. Trade in services is additionally crucial because it almost subsumes the hugely important subject of investment under the logic that services can be provided through \u201ccommercial presence\u201d in a foreign market by owners of capital belonging elsewhere. This phenomenon had become so pronounced by the turn of the century that services accounted for over 60 percent (or US$ 500 billion) of total FDI inflows during 2001-2002. While in the early years finance constituted most of trade in services, energy, water and telecommunications are now receiving increasing attention: between 1990 and 2002, the value of FDI stock in electric power generation and distribution rose 14-fold (WIR 2004, xx-xxi). In the specific service sectors that are the subject of this paper, the challenge of ensuring universal and affordable access to health, water, sanitation and energy for poor people remains an utmost priority of most national governments. International trade in these services is not and will never be a substitute for conscious national strategies aimed at meeting universal goals in favour of poor people. The provision of most essential services is almost entirely a public prerogative not only because of their strong human rights content, but also because of the large social externalities and market failures2 involved in access to basic health or water supply (e.g., gains from checking spread of disease). However, there are ways and methods to leverage the forces of international trade to directly and indirectly help countries meet aspects of these urgent public needs. This paper makes an attempt to highlight some of these options. International trade in services can take place between two or more countries in the context of bilateral or regional agreements, or even on an ad-hoc basis outside their purview. Since 2000, as per article XIX of GATS, negotiations have also been launched multi-laterally. Contrary to popular perception, however, GATS alone has propelled neither significant trade nor liberalisation of any service in any country, nor has it required revamping of national regulations and laws. Especially compared to the 57-year- old agreement on trade in goods (GATT), which achieved deep cuts in barriers to trade in goods over numerous negotiating rounds, the agreement on services is nascent. Nonetheless, for the purposes of negotiations, the scope of the agreement is sweeping; and proposals on the table in Geneva", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44e88284-7e9b-44ac-95b4-997d50428828": {"__data__": {"id_": "44e88284-7e9b-44ac-95b4-997d50428828", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9e40737568b8b2699ddfdc723cbfffeb166b6c6c16b2bc10a370a1cca277e13"}}, "hash": "c9e40737568b8b2699ddfdc723cbfffeb166b6c6c16b2bc10a370a1cca277e13", "text": "can in theory cover any service in any sector except those \u201csupplied in the exercise of governmental authority.\u201d Article 1.3(c) explains that this means any service, which is supplied neither on a commercial basis nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.3 While GATS does not require privatisation or liberalisation, and governments can choose to make no commitments, or schedule limitations on market access and national treatment when commitments are made, the overall purpose of the agreement is clear. Through \u201cprogressive liberalisation,\u201d it is to eventually achieve for trade in services what GATT has achieved so far for trade in goods. A first-ever agreement of legally enforceable 2 \u201cThe private sector, left to its devices, will not achieve the level of health and education that society desires,\u201d states the World Bank (2004, 3). 3 Commercial basis means that there is a notion of profit seeking involved. And competition means two or more service providers target the same market with substitutable product. 9 rules, GATS draws on GATT principles (such as national treatment), but places them in a different context, while extending the scope to measures affecting issues as diverse as FDI flows, qualification of professionals, movement of data as well as people across borders as service providers (Gibbs and Ognivtsev 2004, 8). To date, with the exception of countries or territories that acceded to the WTO after 2001 (namely China, Cambodia, Nepal and Taiwan Province of China), not many Asia-Pacific countries have undertaken notable commitments. Worldwide, no member has made a commitment at the WTO on water distribution.4 With some developed countries realising that the flexible \u201crequest-offer\u201d approach of GATS negotiations is not opening up foreign markets fast or deep enough, new proposals can be expected in the future that will seek to pressure and expedite opening of \u201ccore critical areas\u201d in developing countries.5 Thus much of the controversy on GATS appears to be not about its present form and outcomes, but what the agreement may evolve into in the future (World Bank 2004, 105). It is against this background of stark human development needs, compelling public investment challenges, recent trends in trade in services, and the political-economic realities surrounding international trade regimes that this paper is written, primarily for constituencies in the Asia-Pacific. The most important motivation behind selecting trade in energy and environmental services is to see to what extent aspects of this trade can contribute to, or upset, the pursuit of human well-being aimed at ensuring universal access to and affordability of essential services by poor people. After detailing the scale of human development challenges in the two sectors, the paper recognises that these sectors also happen to be \u201cbig businesses\u201d with potential benefits in terms of employment, technology transfer, and economic growth. In the two sectors, the paper briefly outlines the nature and scope of reforms including attempts at deregulation, and attachment of social obligations and welfare conditions. With empirical as well as anecdotal references to past experiences within Asia-Pacific and other regions, certain policy lessons are drawn, with the caveat that there can be no application of uniform policy across the diverse countries of Asia-Pacific. The two main sections conclude with suggested approaches to strategically respond to trade negotiating requests so that ultimately, national measures aimed at ensuring access to essential services by the poor are bolstered, not restrained. One framework that will be referred to repeatedly in this paper is the \u201cfour modes of service supply.\u201d First articulated by the UNCTAD Secretariat in the 1980s, this went on to lay the intellectual basis for the incorporation of the idea in all discourses on trade in services. The four modes of supply through which services can be traded are: 4 Further, only 24 developing countries have made commitments on hospital services, 12 developing countries have made commitments on primary education. These contrast with commitments made by WTO members in tourism (90 percent) or financial services (70 percent). 5 See remarks by the Deputy U.S.T.R. at the U.S. Congress on 17 May 2005. On 13 September 2005, the EU, Japan, Korea, Switzerland and Australia also presented proposals at the informal meeting of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods to introduce \u201ccomplementary methods for services negotiations\u201d with a view to opening up a minimum percentage of services sub-sectors, especially in developing countries as many service sectors are already relatively more open in OECD countries. 10 Box 1: The Four Modes Mode 1: cross-border supply \u2013 user in one country receives service from a provider abroad (e.g., IT-enabled medical diagnostics and advice, online energy trading and brokering) Mode 2: consumption abroad \u2013 user moves", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff949f21-f17d-471f-8526-4214607c9762": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff949f21-f17d-471f-8526-4214607c9762", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "395b93363fcb8eeb6ead26fd9ff087dbc9c558e2baa0f67850e2612bc70720ff"}}, "hash": "395b93363fcb8eeb6ead26fd9ff087dbc9c558e2baa0f67850e2612bc70720ff", "text": "abroad to consume a service (e.g., tourists, health patients) Mode 3: commercial presence \u2013 user is offered service by entities owned by foreign providers (e.g., foreign-owned subsidiary in insurance, sanitation, or electricity) Mode 4: movement of natural persons \u2013 service provider moves abroad to supply a service (e.g., nurses, construction workers). 11 II. International trade in environmental services and human development The scale of development challenges In the broadest sense, development is about improving the quality of life. The well-being of millions of people still living in absolute poverty in the Asia-Pacific depends in part on a wide range of environmental resources, including access to and use of fresh drinking water and sanitation. Close to two billion people in Asia lack access to basic sanitation, and over 650 million to safe drinking water (WSSCC 2004, 28). The Pacific Island Countries are three orders of magnitude smaller in size and population than Asia, but they share the same intensity of environmental problems. Child mortality is widely, uniformly and accurately reported across countries and is therefore a reliable indicator of national environmental health.6 Every day 3,900 children die world-wide of diseases associated with water and sanitation that are easily preventable. Almost half the people in the developing world have one or more diseases or infections associated with inadequate water supply and sanitation like diarrhoea, intestinal helminth infections and dracunculiasis. According to The Lancet (2005, vol. 365), schistosomiasis afflicts 160 million people in the world which basic sanitation can reduce by 77 percent; similarly, of the six million people who are blind because of trachoma, a preventable disease, improved access to water could reduce the morbidity by 27 percent. Collectively, these amount to a colossal drain of human potential. The link between health and environmental problems is direct, especially in the ever- growing urban settlements. In Pakistan, 40 percent of infant mortality is due to water pollution; in Bangkok, half the city suffers from air pollution induced respiratory illnesses. In China, two-thirds of its major cities are seriously short of water, with 700 million people drinking water that is contaminated by waste (Becker 2004). In India, which accounts for one-quarter of the world\u2019s child deaths owing to poor hygiene, only 200 of the country\u2019s 3,600 towns and cities are reported to have proper sewerage systems. Given these challenges, it is inconceivable how any of the MDGs can be met without meeting MDG7, which includes targets to halve the proportion of people without access to potable water and to significantly improve the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2015. The disposal of hazardous waste, effluent treatment, contamination of sources of water, and preservation of biological habitats are also broad environmental concerns with a bearing on human health, and in turn, people's capability to lead the kind of life they value. The year 2007 onward, for the first time in human history, the majority of people in the world will live in urban areas, one-third of them in slums. Overcrowding increases risks for contracting communicable diseases. Ignoring of the environmental causes of health burden today will result in a massive \u201chealth debt\u201d which will be far more costly to pay off through curative measures in the future than to prevent the problems now through basic water, sanitation, shelter and public health interventions. One analysis 6 Future research on environmental indices should focus on establishing datasets of child death rates from proximate environmental causes, intestinal infections and respiratory diseases. Statistics for access to safe water and basic sanitation are considered less reliable. 12 suggests that each US$ 1 invested in water and sanitation would yield economic return of between US$ 3 and US$ 34 (Evans et al. 2004). The burden of illness and death from basic diarrhoeal diseases in Asia-Pacific is especially staggering. It is now evident that curing of sanitation problems through installation of facilities alone (e.g., constructing latrines) is inadequate. A complete community approach to sanitation, focusing on hygiene promotion, use of clean food, water and utensils, and hand washing with soap after defecation is more effective in reducing the transmission of diarrhoeal diseases, but these often result from changes in community behaviour and cultural practices which are not spoken of frequently. There is a collective action problem in sanitation, where the actions of a single member affect all others in a community. This requires a collective response in the form of changing attitudes and investing in community infrastructure that follows from individual realization of the \u2018communal\u2019 nature of sanitation problems. This approach is, however, difficult to implement and could explain why sanitation has lagged behind demand for water", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a69e08e-efa4-4dde-b617-021a60b08fd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a69e08e-efa4-4dde-b617-021a60b08fd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0dc02d7f24a6dbdfadafcc46de41568e8ba7f36212cb8c9f200369a99809c38"}}, "hash": "e0dc02d7f24a6dbdfadafcc46de41568e8ba7f36212cb8c9f200369a99809c38", "text": "(World Bank 2004, 174). Other forms of environmental support systems can also make significant contributions toward honouring human dignity and the achievement of the MDGs. Take the unspoken issue of open defecation, a pervasive phenomenon in poor countries, and the scope there lies for enhancing the dignity of hundreds of millions of women and men with the provision of clean, private sanitary facilities. Stakeholders responses to environmental problems In Asia-Pacific, enforceable environmental laws, regulations and institutions were mostly created by governments under pressure from NGOs and in response to the requirements of international funding agencies; public interest has been important but not as powerful as in the industrialised countries where policies responded to industrial technologies of the time as well as popular demand. While by the 1990s, almost all Asian developing countries had formulated environmental standards, the record on compliance is poor in spite of provisions for sanctions to hold governments and commercial interests accountable for their performance. Inaction during the 1990s has been attributed to the view that \u201cthe environment can wait,\u201d which was subsequently overcompensated for by unrealistic regulatory regimes that never found traction (ADB 2000, 2). Environmental institutions in Asia have tested two new approaches: use of market based instruments (MBIs) and increased disclosure of information on environmental violators. Most of the region\u2019s experience has been with fiscal instruments. MBIs have not been used extensively, and so far, only a few have been tested (wastewater permit trading in China, permit trading for CFCs and traffic congestion in Singapore). This is a critical deficit, because market creating instruments are particularly important in the regulation of privatised utilities. Most Pacific Island countries also have environmental regulations, with some using financial incentives for waste management and integrating freshwater resources with coastal management. There has been limited introduction of small advanced water treatment systems. As in Asia, the transference of plans into action in the Pacific Islands has been difficult (SPREP 2001, 24) 13 The comparative responsiveness of private sector may be assessed through the growth in the number of firms certified for ISO 9000 quality and ISO 14000 environmental management standards. China and the Republic of Korea have demonstrated remarkable growth in certification, with China now being the global leader with nearly 100,000 firms certified for quality management. In the leading countries, the dynamism of the private sector is a reason to be optimistic that society will be able to cope with looming issues such as climate change. The lagging countries are not isolated from the impacts of modernity, but have far more fragile coping capacities. The environmental industry and recent trends The environmental industry has grown to over US$ 550 billion in revenues in 2003, accounting for 1.8 percent of the global economy (Ferrier et al. 2003, 10). The environmental services sector constitutes about half the total environment industry, valued in 2000 at approx. US$ 270 billion. The implicit distinction between environmental infrastructural services and environmental non-infrastructural services is important (Zarrilli 2003, 33). Human development priorities and civil society advocacy as well as formal GATS classification of environmental services are more concerned with the first cluster. Broadly, environmental services are defined as those activities, which reduce environmental risk, minimise pollution, and enable efficient resource use. The first set of such activities concerns pollution management (such as air pollution control, waste water management, solid waste management, cleanup of soil and water, noise and vibration abatement, environmental monitoring, analysis, research, assessment, and engineering). The second set of activities covers cleaner technology (aimed at eliminating or reducing the impact of technologies, processes, and products). The third set falls under resource management, such as solid waste recycling and resource recovery. These environmental services have three important characteristics. First, they overlap with activities in just about all other sectors of the economy, from architecture and construction to auditing and risk assessment. Second, they have the properties of quasi- public goods,7 which make pricing based on consumer use difficult and have implications for human development concerns such as equity, universal provision, and affordable access. Third, environmental services typically require large investment to ensure that collection and distribution networks reach the entire population. Owing to their quasi- public goods as well as natural monopoly properties, the public sector has been the primary provider of a range of environmental services until recently. None of the largest environmental companies in the world are from developing Asia- Pacific. The top 71 firms in the sector account for 20 percent of all the revenues generated; most of them are American, but two of the largest firms are French.8 Other countries with leading firms are Germany, Japan, and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cc50d19-6401-4292-8e32-603072f6cb8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cc50d19-6401-4292-8e32-603072f6cb8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d56a7c3ceaa1b11774905c3d3293af342e10884d783ae800ff4de35c31e6054e"}, "3": {"node_id": "f42d614e-4c01-4a69-babe-36f1b76bae59", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfbee6785f50bbdd28ad1d7622fad026f2a94084eab4ae25c0ad9e6745941ce7"}}, "hash": "c7b2dba0866155f5bf42f7ba8bab91c6b0cd7ff9ebd0f5cac93545af8236e12a", "text": "U.K. In terms of sectors within 7 Environmental services are not pure public goods, as classically defined with non-rivalry, non-excludability, and non- divisibility properties. Excludability in the provision of environmental services can be introduced (e.g. disconnecting water supply) and rivalry in consumption also exists (due to congestion in use). 8 There are changes in the fortunes of individual companies in recent years. The aggregate analysis for the distribution of firms remains valid. 14 environmental services, solid waste management, water utilities and water treatment are the largest segments, the latter being the most capital-intensive. Firms in France and the U.K. have a lead in water and wastewater treatment, following past privatisation experiences of segments of their water utilities. In the past, U.S. firms were the most competitive in air pollution control services, largely because of the fact that the first comprehensive air quality legislation, the Clean Air Act, was passed in 1970 in the U.S. Box 2: Thirsty Kathmandu: Private Participation in the Valley\u2019s Water Supply Even after four decades of donor assistance since the start of commercial water supply in 1966, there remains a huge gap in meeting the demand for potable water by the Kathmandu valley\u2019s 1.5 million people. The government formed a High Level Private Sector Participation Committee (PSPC) in 1997 to handover part of the water delivery system to a private operator by 1999. However, the requirement for the private operator to be internationally recognized and experienced in operating facilities similar in scale to the one in the Kathmandu valley resulted in only one company qualifying in each of the two unsuccessful privatisation attempts. In 2001, the World Bank ended its long involvement in the water supply management and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emerged as the new source of funds and advice. ADB helped develop the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Improvement Plan, which includes a proposal to divert water through a 26- kilometer tunnel from the snow-fed Melamchi River. One-third of the estimated US$ 464 million in costs will be financed with an ADB loan. Under this plan, a notice for \u201cexpression of interest\u201d was issued in January 2004 and necessary laws were enacted in April 2005. It is not clear yet if the government can put in place the necessary institutions including Water Supply Management Board, Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission and Water Utility Operator in time to handover operations to a private party by the target date of early 2006. The proposed water supply improvement plan has a provision for a Low-Income Consumer Support Unit (LICSU).

New York: Oxford University Press, based on a joint effort by the United Nation Children's Fund and the World Health Organization 16 As O.E.C.D. markets reach saturation, developing countries are emerging as important destinations for the export of environmental services. While the divergent capacities to address environmental concerns across Asia-Pacific necessitate roles for international trade and resource transfer, countries should nonetheless be careful in their choice of approaches and technologies, noting how they are embedded in specific institutional contexts. Employment-displacing technologies, especially in the solid waste management sector, are one such element of concern. On the other hand, in the state-of-art sub- sectors, such as clean energy, Asia-Pacific countries need to be aware about the abundance of dated approaches, processes and technologies once appropriate for conditions in their countries of origin, but now abandoned or of scrap value there. Given the public monopoly characteristic of many environmental services, opportunities for trade and foreign investment have traditionally been limited. However, the sector has been undergoing significant changes in recent years. With deregulation, privatisation of select activities, and growing trade orientation, environment services are set to become one of the fastest growing service sectors in the future. Barriers to trade in environmental services The significant barriers to trade in environmental services pertain to restrictions on the establishment of commercial presence and on the movement or employment of nationals of the operating company (modes 3 and 4 respectively). The leading exporters have a number of unilateral initiatives to open up Asian markets. For example, eleven industrialising Asian countries were the focus of the United States-Asia Environmental Partnership (U.S.-A.E.P.), with the mission of promoting U.S. exports of environmentally beneficial technologies. After a decade of promotional work that has seen markets emerge and mature in Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan Province of China the A.E.P. has now shifted its search to newer markets in India, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Pressures to open up environmental services are also being introduced through regional and bilateral trade agreements and investment treaties (BITs), especially with the U.S., which typically insists on six forms of provisions for its firms.9 One important consequence of the investment rules under BITs is the risk of undermining the bedrock \u201cPolluters Pay Principle.\u201d The accepted norm worldwide is the obligation of the polluter to pay environmental costs. The investment rules reverse the principle by requiring governments to compensate investors for the economic costs of complying with environmental regulations (CIEL 2002, 7). Among the 44 top environmental market countries in the world, China ranked 12th in size and experienced the fastest growth at a rate of 10.6 percent per annum. In particular, China has experienced unexpected growth in investment in the potable water and wastewater treatment segments. Several other Asian countries, like the Republic of Korea, 9 Entitlement to NT or MFN, whichever is more favourable throughout the life of the investment, limits on expropriation, transferability of all investment related funds including profits, limits to the host government\u2019s ability to require the investor to adopt performance requirements, right of the investor to international arbitration, and management of investor\u2019s choice. 17 Taiwan Province of China, and Vietnam have also increased their investments in drinking water and wastewater treatment. The market in this segment is forecast to increase to US$ 62 billion by 2008 and US$ 117 billion by 2015 (Helmut Kaiser Consultancy 2004, 13). Other segments significant for Asian country imports are solid and hazardous waste, and recycling systems and remediation. The smallest volumes are in monitoring and analysis equipment, but this segment remains important for local capacity building. The main policy concern from a human development angle over emerging attempts to open up trade in environmental services is the sweeping nature of multigenerational commitments that countries voluntarily lock themselves into, often without adequate national consultations. Even when projects may be badly needed and make economic sense, a part of the general public's ex-ante hostility to such schemes emanates from their desire to have these processes subjected to broad civic scrutiny prior to making long-term commitments. Water privatisation within and without trade agreements Comprising 90 percent of the brain, water is the most important molecule for survival of human life. Because it is simply a matter of life and death on the primary level, and its secondary uses are also crucial for conduct of livelihoods, issues surrounding its access, quality and affordability deserve sensitive scrutiny and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fffc4e4-60c9-4198-8ad4-cc522cc0c769": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fffc4e4-60c9-4198-8ad4-cc522cc0c769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c15ffd466b69f0702d016c9d766f6de34eadf79cd497b6dbbed9cfe079a936b"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d3e77e9-2607-4ade-be19-5495e3c4ed55", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4a74cb33529a5062a7c0e1f46efda00a5916252afc34ec905406cf617e4d949"}}, "hash": "6a66c9a682df8a1446e7c9ec7d6dd7393ff3f034cc16e006c94dbe2cc84cf7f8", "text": "restraint in trade talks, especially those that conclude with binding commitments. Civil society organizations are rightly wary of proposals to liberalise systems that collect, purify and distribute water, as expressed vocally during the Third World Water Forum in Kyoto, March 2003, and elsewhere. The Doha Ministerial Declaration in paragraph 31 (iii) mandates negotiations on eliminating or reducing barriers to trade in environmental goods and services. The E.U. has since been actively pursuing the liberalisation of environmental services, and also sectors that have bearing on water distribution and consumption, arguing that its proposal views the entire water cycle holistically with both water distribution and waste-water treatment falling under \u201cresource use.\u201d GATS as a WTO discipline requires no privatisation or deregulation of public services like water distribution. Countries, in fact, have unambiguous policy options that they can retain by: i) maintaining their service as a public or private monopoly, or ii) opening the service to competing suppliers but restricting it to national companies, or iii) opening the service to domestic and foreign suppliers and making no GATS commitments, or iv) making GATS commitment covering the rights of foreign investors while attaching conditions (e.g., on technology transfer, or freer movement of labourers). While all options exist and are available, and no country so far has made any GATS commitment on water distribution, the fact that the issue of water has been brought on to the negotiating table has been hugely controversial. Privatisation and liberalisation are separate processes, but in practice, privatisation is only theoretically distinct from 18 liberalisation given the disparities between the capacities of national firms and multinationals in the sector. Privatisation of environmental services has been successful largely in the context of mature institutional and regulatory structures. Developing countries need to build up such capacities first by incremental experiences with management service contracts, concessions, and joint ventures. Box 3: Water, Waste and FDI in China The first joint venture between Beijing and foreign companies in the sewage treatment sector \u2013 named the Beijing Municipal Drainage Co. Ltd. is the result of collaboration between the government of China and the French Veolia Water Co. Ltd., Onyx waste services division, along with a Malaysia based public utility company. The project, with a daily capacity of 100,000 tons, and a total initial investment of 200 million yuan (approximately US$ 24 million) is expected to improve water quality of the Liangshui River, south of Beijing. The plant, located on the upper reaches of the river is expected to benefit over 350,000 local residents. The French giant has also recently won a US$ 737 million, 30 year contract to supply drinking water for the 2.5 million people in the city of Hohhot, in northern China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region. Separately, the company has also sealed a US$ 233 million deal to provide water to the eastern city of Weinan, home to 300,000 people, and has signed a large contract to provide the city of Shanghai with water services, cited as the company\u2019s \u201cstrategic priority market.\u201d From 2002, Veolia has won contracts worth an approximate US$ 25 billion in total revenue, excluding the contracts which Onyx has separately arranged in the region. Sources: Forbes Magazine, 10/05/04 and the Peoples Daily Online 10/14/04, 4/24/05 There are, however, numerous cases of unilateral privatisation of utilities to treat and distribute water outside of the WTO framework. Their collective result is mixed. The prime trigger for privatisation has been two-fold: i) problems of access and efficiency under public hands, and ii) problems of fresh resource mobilization to keep up the quality and quantity of services to an ever-growing population. Huge amounts of additional resources are needed - up to US$ 180 billion per year in poor countries (from the current US$ 70 billion to US$ 80 billion, according to The World Water Council). In poor countries with narrow tax bases, these kinds of resources and skills can only be viably tapped with official foreign aid or private investment. As one private sector enthusiast puts it, \u201cwater may be god-given, but not the pipes.\u201d10 In China, the world's biggest potential market, the Ministry of Water Resources puts the cost of expected water and sanitation related infrastructure at US$ 26 billion by the end of 2005. Proponents of greater private sector involvement argue there is a growing recognition now that users don\u2019t pay the full cost of the water cycle, which begins in the skies, then the reservoir and ends as waste-water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d3e77e9-2607-4ade-be19-5495e3c4ed55": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d3e77e9-2607-4ade-be19-5495e3c4ed55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c15ffd466b69f0702d016c9d766f6de34eadf79cd497b6dbbed9cfe079a936b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fffc4e4-60c9-4198-8ad4-cc522cc0c769", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a66c9a682df8a1446e7c9ec7d6dd7393ff3f034cc16e006c94dbe2cc84cf7f8"}}, "hash": "a4a74cb33529a5062a7c0e1f46efda00a5916252afc34ec905406cf617e4d949", "text": "When the true value of the environmental resource is not accounted, there\u2019s wastage and resource degradation.

Further, there could be savings on grounds of efficiency. Governments can also put human-development friendly conditions on private suppliers by subjecting them to regulated prices and to offer better billing and customer service to raise revenue, while upgrading the infrastructure for long-term sustainability. There are other models where the full cost is shared between users and taxpayers as a \u201csustainable social price.\u201d There could also be ceiling rates on tariffs that cannot be exceeded, and special provisions for low-income groups. Despite the uproar created by the possibility of private companies managing water sectors, only five percent of the world\u2019s water is actually distributed by the private sector.11 Even when private sectors take charge, they usually follow a process of \u201centrusting\u201d by the public authorities into a fixed-term contract. \u201cPrivatisation\u201d is often a misnomer \u2013 the management model could be a public-private partnership.12 The provisioning of water services through the public sector is thus a viable option, but approaches need to be innovative, yet ensure government oversight and transparency. Instances of public sector successes, e.g., Sao Paolo in Brazil, a city of 22 million, where a notable expansion of service has happened under public hands, provides adaptable lessons for Asia-Pacific. Whatever the model pursued, private companies have had to deal with fierce public opposition at places, sometimes leading to costly withdrawals. Because of high risks and difficulties in making profits in a highly regulated environment, the interest of international water companies in the poorest countries is diminishing. The viability of the market approach for providing these essential services in small markets and the poorest countries deserves a careful assessment (Zarrilli 2005, 3). From a peak of 38 worldwide water and sewerage private projects in 1999, the number was down to 18 in 2002.13 Examples include investors like Suez quitting the American city of Atlanta, Biwater leaving Zimbabwe, and Bechtel having to withdraw from Bolivia where rioting followed a 35 percent increase in water tariff; in fact Bechtel used the Dutch-Bolivia BIT to try to force Bolivia to pay US$ 25 million for losses related to its Dutch subsidiary\u2019s withdrawal from running the Cochabamba municipal water system. In Manila, which adopted a similar model to Buenos Aires (considered a success until the country\u2019s currency was sharply devalued in 2002), conditions were attached for private companies to secure universal access to water by 2006, increase sewerage coverage to 83 percent, offer 24 hour availability, etc. Done through competitive bidding, the city was divided into two to prevent monopoly. But promised results were not attained, and the company responsible, Suez, has pulled out.14 Pointing out that there is no conclusive link between ownership and efficiency, some argue that the issue of efficiency under private hands is exaggerated: corrupt deals between the private and the public sector can be frequent and they can easily wreck the viability of projects. 11 The four big companies are Suez, Veolia, Saur and RWE. 12 In Gabon and Shanghai, 110 million people are served in 30 urban areas. 13 The Economist, \u201cA Survey of Water,\u201d 19 July 2003, p. 8. 14 http://www.environmentprobe.org/ enviroprobe/pubs/ev542.htm 20 In most large cities, a substantial share of the urban population is not adequately served by a utility; instead people rely on water tankers, kiosks, and small-scale, independent water providers. To the extent water is provided by public sector organisations, they may not be profit-seeking, but they could be rent-seeking as illustrated by a practice in the city of Karachi during the early 1990s, when an informal group of water dealers invested in a large number of tankers. In league with groups in the Karachi Water and Sanitation Board (KWSB), they were alleged to have disconnected water supply to a number of areas, making them dependent on the tankers for their daily water requirements. When authorities investigated the KWSB and the water \u201cmafia,\u201d it discovered that the senior management was hostage to an extended kinship network controlling the middle management.

Box 4: Judicial Activism in Delhi\u2019s Air In 1998 Delhi was one of the world\u2019s 10 most polluted cities. The Supreme Court, acting on a public interest litigation in 1996, passed a series of orders, the major being introduction of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for public transport in 1998. Five years later, Delhi won the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Clean Cities International Partner of the Year award for \u2018\u2018bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives.\u201d The city converted its entire public transport fleet to CNG. Compared to 1997, carbon monoxide is down by 32 percent, and sulphur dioxide by 39 percent. The initiative is a testimony to judicial activism. Although the government initially dilly-dallied to modify the Motor Vehicles Act to include CNG in its ambit, by November 2002 all public busses were converted to CNG. The lessons from Delhi to other cities in need of air quality changes are threefold: One, a comprehensive fuel strategy must be decided and agreed upon by all relevant actors; two, clear deadlines must be set for the implementation of policies; and three, a proactive administration is integral to the success of the project. Source: Adapted from Mumbai Newsline (26 May 2004) by K. Gupta. But like privatisation of other utilities, problems of corruption exist in water contracts, where the process often lacks transparency. Big multinational companies can siphon profits to other subsidiaries, and because contracts are very long-term, it is often hard to cancel them. But the fact remains that up to US$ 180 billion worth of investment could be needed to meet the world\u2019s water needs every year, and the most credible source from which this can be raised is the non-public sector (a lower estimate by Water Aid is US$ 35 billion a year, if stand-pipes are considered in country villages.) 21 Pro-poor, indigenous Asian initiatives Discussions on foreign investment often overshadow \u201calternative\u201d success models of low- cost service delivery to the poor. Pakistan's Orangi Pilot Project (OPP), for instance, has been working since 1980 to support people\u2019s efforts in upgrading Orangi township, a low- income informal settlement with over 1 million residents in Karachi (a city whose Water and Sewerage Board does not reach the informal settlements that contain 60 percent of the city's population). The OPP model of sanitation comprises of internal development such as latrines, lane sewers and collector sewers at the neighbourhood levels. It has demonstrated that communities can finance and maintain internal development; contributing US$ 1.5 million, they have constructed hundreds of thousands of running feet of sewerage lines and sanitary pour-flush latrines in 90,000 houses. The OPP model has been replicated in 42 settlements in Karachi and in seven cities across Pakistan with varying degrees of success. The critical factor is the degree to which local government accepts the responsibility for external sanitation comprising of trunk sewers and sewerage treatment (Hasan 1997, 11). In rural China, there exist models of co-operative non-profit water and sanitation delivery systems. In the early 1980s, only 50 percent of the rural population in China had access to safe water. By the end of 2002, this figure had reached 92 percent (868 million people). Among them, rural residents with access to piped water supply system account for 57 percent of the total rural population, a 43 percent increase since 1985. There are some lessons to be learned from this experience: (a) importance of organisational and institutional capacity building, (b) community willingness to participate in financial contributions and sustainability, (c) necessity of sharing knowledge and understanding with users, and (d) integration of sanitation and health education with rural water supply.15 There are other examples.

The more difficult (but more rewarding) work of creating the demand for environmental services is being neglected. At the same time, the recognition of the importance of civic engagement and participation in debates on reforming utilities is growing. Thailand's new constitution, in its Articles 45 and 46, requires stakeholder consultations prior to project undertakings that might affect livelihoods or the environment. In addition to building up and replicating low-cost, pro- poor indigenous models, Asia-Pacific countries need to ensure that liberalisation is 15 http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/reducingpoverty/case-China-RuralWaterandSanitation.html 22 preceded by enhanced domestic legislative and regulatory infrastructures that sustain these approaches. The daunting new demands for services and overwhelming fiscal shortage means that countries will inevitably need to draw on foreign technology and capital. The relevant question to ask, thus, is not whether to open up to foreign investment, but what segment, when, how fast, and with what kind of policy safeguards in place. Liberalisation of environmental services: marrying investment needs with social obligations The overarching need is to match the legitimate investment crunch in environmental services with human-development obligations. Can this be best handled within GATS or unilaterally? If countries decide to undertake commitments on environmental services, or sub-sectors within, at the WTO, what should they see as their framework of potential benefits and losses, and how should they go about framing their responses? Commitments to liberalise in environmental services could be traded off for meaningful reciprocal offers to enhance domestic capacity, or improve access for labour movement, or promote agriculture and fisheries exports. Liberalization on the part of developing countries could also be tied to conditions such as on transfer of technology, which could in turn contribute to implementing Articles IV and XIX of GATS that aim at increasing the participation of developing countries in world trade in services. There is also a long standing argument to treat the two factors of production (labour and capital) symmetrically, and to balance mode 3 and mode 4 commitments. Developing countries should pursue this point with persistence. Some developed countries, using the framework of GATS negotiations, have submitted requests for commitments from Asia-Pacific countries to eliminate barriers to trade in environmental services. It should be noted that such markets are already largely open, although not many Asian countries have made specific commitments in their GATS schedules. Unlike many service sectors, the supply of basic environmental services involves large investments, which could become profitable only over long periods of time, thus making effective control a major factor in investment. At the WTO, there is no agreed template on what environmental services constitute. The current definition includes: sewage services, refuse disposal services, sanitation and similar services, cleaning of exhaust gases, noise abatement services, nature and landscape protection services which draws on a 1991 document called the W120 and refers to the U.N. Central Product Classification. This definition has been criticised for being too narrow and not reflecting market realities. In sending requests to WTO members, E.C. proposed its own classification (based on O.E.C.D.-Eurostat definition16 of environmental which includes, among others, water for human use.17 16 The Eurostat definition of the environmental Industry consists of \u201cactivities which produce goods and services to measure, prevent, limit, minimise or correct environmental damage to water, air, and soil as well as problems related to waste, noise and eco-systems. This includes cleaner technologies, products and services which reduce environmental risk and minimise pollution and resource use.\u201d The EC is approaching the entire water cycle holistically and argues that this is covered under \u201cresource use.\u201d 17 Only 0.1 percent of the world\u2019s water is for human use; over 99 percent is saline, or glacier or snow (UNEP Atlas 2005). 23 The formal state of play in the request/offer process cannot easily be determined, as information is seldom released publicly; but leaked documents relating to the European Commission\u2019s first batch of requests, in 2003, to 109 countries caused a lot of interest. The United States in its initial offer on GATS, while accepting the broader classification of environmental services, has excluded \u201cwater for human use\u201d in the sector specific commitments.

In acceding to the WTO, Nepal undertook commitments strategically. It liberalized 11 services sectors and 70 sub-sectors, which, on the surface is high for an LDC. However, a thorough study of the limitations entered in horizontal commitments as well as market access and national treatment columns tells a different story. Its objective was to liberalise only those services sectors in which: a) Nepali private sector may never get involved given the huge sunk cost and high gestation period (e.g., pipeline transportation); b) Nepali private sector is already competitive and is confident that it would be able to outperform the foreign service suppliers, even if the sector concerned is liberalised (e.g., banking services); and c) sectors where employment potential for the locals are high, e.g., computer and related services (Adhikari 2005). While regional banks and IFIs have often made the case for privatisation of utilities, there have been shifts in recent years. The World Bank now sees the privatisation of water as \u201cproblematic,\u201d calling for building up of regulatory capacity, especially for clarity of roles among various levels of government and the regulatory agency. Concessions and leases are more effective than privatisation to achieve efficiencies of competition while retaining strong public oversight (Kessides 2004, 15). Even so, concerns would remain on the grounds of equity and sustainability. The profit- seeking behaviour of private firms, especially under conditions of monopoly, is likely to result in price hikes, and exclusion of the poor unable to pay increased rates. Environmental sustainability is a concern as well, for example, a private firm may indulge in unsustainable withdrawal of underground water. In fact, all forms of negative externalities need to be rigorously addressed. Efficient waste collection by a private company may be accompanied by more dumping of trash on sensitive wetlands, as has happened in Chennai, India (Sawhney and Chanda 2003, 23). Overall, there is secrecy in GATS negotiations, and an overwhelming lack of understanding of WTO provisions among government officials. The discussions on the assessment of proposals are not transparent, limited as they are to a narrow group of specialised civil servants. Because most stakeholders are not engaged in these discussions in many countries most of the time, negotiators may not be sensitised enough to the importance of environmental services that are needed and potentially available for improving people\u2019s health. 24 Box 5: Types of Private Participation Management service contracts: the government remains the primary provider of the service and private operators are hired to carry out designated tasks. This is a low risk option of service contracts, most appropriate when only operational efficiency is required without significant new investment. Build operate transfer (BOT) and build operate own (BOO): under BOT, private investment is invited to construct and operate new facilities for an extended period so as to allow recovery of cost and earning of profit. Government retains ownership of the infrastructure facility. A BOO (or BOOT) is a long-term concession contract where the infrastructure assets entrusted to the private party remain government property, and the government remains the regulator. Joint ventures: private and public sectors together assume co-ownership of assets and co- responsibility for the delivery of services, by forming a new company or share ownership of an existing company. Full Privatization: the government grants the responsibility of providing the service and ownership to the private party. The government only functions as the regulator of quality and prices. Source: Qutub (2003) Moving forward The human development paradigm views people as the end of all state efforts. The following indicators for empowerment, productivity, equity and sustainability appear most relevant to the environment services industry: Empowerment: Employment Generation; Transparency and Accountability Productivity: Economic Efficiency; Technology Transfer Equity: Basic Access; Fair Access Sustainability: Technological Sustainability; Environmental Quality The advantage of working with these indicators is that they are objectively verifiable. This list can be useful when countries find themselves confronted with requests to liberalise trade in environmental services, and they ask themselves two pertinent questions: i) which sub-sectors offer the best opportunities for enhancing human development through liberalisation? And, ii) at the other extreme, where are the risks for human development? In considering these questions, policymakers should take note of the following sets of issues: First, services provided directly to industry offer a win-win opportunity for stakeholders and society at large. In particular, effluent treatment plants can achieve economies of scale in an industrial estate setting. The clients being industrial establishments, there is no risk of marginalising any poor stakeholder.

A level playing field encourages compliance among users. Management contracts or concessions for industrial wastewater treatment reduce administrative costs and support efficiency. Worldwide experience confirms that feasible levels of pollution charges can meet the capital and operating costs of the services provided. Any surplus 25 revenues can be assigned to improving the quality of the general public welfare. A liberalised private sector regime for Combined Effluent Treatment Plants could thus bring more FDI, break local institutional gridlocks, and provide respectability to Asia-Pacific processors in world markets. The clientele would be industry and there is no risk of excluding the poor. Second, employment displacement in the solid waste management sub-sector is one of the greatest risks associated with trade liberalisation. Excessive mechanisation targets the livelihoods of some of the poorest people. The exclusion of low-income communities from privatised and liberalised water supply and solid waste management services are also serious risks. In addition, there is considerable risk that biodiversity conservation projects managed by international consortiums will fence-off parks and protected areas, and deprive the poor of their traditional access rights. Third, one longer-term strategic opportunity for developing countries is to export labour and skill intensive environmental services. Other opportunities include securing recognition for watershed management in upland areas and traditional biodiversity management as environmental services, traded across borders or consumed abroad. Fourth, on the specific subject of water for human consumption within environmental services, there is a strong human rights dimension that must be recognized as on par with similar rights to basic food and adequate housing. This has been discussed in the UN High Commission for Human Rights where countries have been urged to assess how trade policies impact human rights. The key point is that states have, over the years, undertaken many international human rights treaty obligations which need to be respected by WTO members during their negotiations and while implementing commitments to liberalise trade in managing air, water, and waste. Fifth, multi-lateral negotiations are conducted on the basis of reciprocity which countries should optimize by seeking concessions in areas of export interest to them in return for considered access to environmental market. While there is no evidence that GATS commitments automatically lead to increase in FDI, they could send a signal of sorts to investors. GATS could also lock-in not only economic policy, but also human- development friendly measures that countries could not retract owing to vested pressures at a later date. The flip side, however, is that reneging on commitments can lead to costly trade sanctions. Sixth, with coalition building around such experiential learning, developing countries of the Asia-Pacific could embed reform and investment needs in their national anti-poverty strategies that comprehensively address water, sanitation, and public health challenges through multiple channels: direct public investments, stage-wise privatisation, scaling up of participatory community-led approaches, and engagement in international trade. A comprehensive strategy that leverages all policy possibilities is the only way countries have any chance in filling parts of the glaring gaps in access, use and affordability of mainly water and sanitation. This bottom-up approach of home-grown policies will also assist countries to respond strategically to requests during sectoral trade negotiations at the bilateral, regional and global levels. 26 III. International trade in energy services and human development The scale of development challenges Given its pervasive role in human life, it will be nearly impossible to achieve any of the MDGs without the availability of adequate, affordable and clean energy. Over 1.5 billion people in the world have no access to electricity; most of them live in rural Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The average electrification rate in South Asia is only 41 percent, less than half the average for South East Asia and China (87 percent). Nearly 2.5 billion people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating of which 72 percent live in Asia. The data show that the higher the level of biomass consumption, the higher the extent of poverty. They suggest an inverse correlation between the extent of biomass energy consumption and key demographic indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality. The absence of modern energy undermines efforts to raise the living standards of the poor, especially in rural areas, and prevents them from enhancing their livelihood opportunities. Energy can play a catalytic role in development, but this takes place in conjunction with other complementary development inputs, such as water supply, health facilities, market access and credit. This has been recognized by the UN under its WEHAB (Water and Sanitation, Energy, Health, Agriculture and Biodiversity) Framework presented at WSSD 2002 which highlights the interconnections between", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cec9756-0133-4f0b-957c-1e47d53eefb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cec9756-0133-4f0b-957c-1e47d53eefb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d28e67a733655838906aa149267fe43fea4b725851805f47f21a066333fd3dfc"}}, "hash": "d28e67a733655838906aa149267fe43fea4b725851805f47f21a066333fd3dfc", "text": "energy and other factors that contribute to human development. In developing countries, the important barriers in the way of supplying modern energy services (fuels and electricity) to the poor consist of the following: First, in rural areas, the primary problem is the poor\u2019s inability to access modern energy because supplies simply do not reach them. Transporting electricity and fossil fuels requires capital-intensive distribution networks for which remoteness and low levels of demand are major constraints. The farther the poor are from the reach of such networks, the greater the difficulties of operating supply utilities on financial sustainability principles. Second, the poor lack purchasing power. As a result, even where communities as a whole have access, the poor among them have to forego the benefits of modern energy. The transition from traditional biomass energy and human/animal labour to efficient modern resources and appliances invariably \u2018commercialises\u2019 energy since all modern energy options carry a price. Low incomes set a low threshold of affordability among the poor, with the want of energy competing with other survival needs. Third, insufficient cost-effectiveness is a crucial barrier to enhance affordability. Cost- effectiveness can be ensured when there is a multiplicity of energy services and service providers to select from. The poor in developing countries have limited choices in both, partly due to resource and technology limitations, but equally because of policies restricting the emergence of diverse and competitive energy markets. Fourth, rural poverty affects men and women differently, with women bearing a disproportionate share of hardship. Women are responsible for onerous and time- consuming tasks in collecting and utilizing on rudimentary stoves the traditional fuels. 27 This has direct consequences for women, ranging from serious health impacts caused by indoor pollution to lost opportunities for self-improvement. Energy security and trade An overarching concern in the energy sector is energy security: the growth and preservation of international supply lines for critical fossil fuels and, in some cases, electricity. With growing economic integration, developed and developing countries alike have a shared interest in ensuring transborder energy flows. Developing countries have the added priority of ensuring their domestic security of supply, particularly for the rural majorities that lack access to energy or are affected by unreliable supply networks. The global business turnover in energy products was estimated at US$ 2.4 trillion in 2000 (Evans 2002). The bulk of this, between US$ 1.7-2.0 trillion, featured in trans-border trade, much of it in oil, oil products and gas. Assuming an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent and taking into account the steep increases in global oil prices since 2003, the current volume of globally traded energy likely exceeds US$ 3 trillion a year, making energy the largest component of international trade. This does not include trade in energy services18 (the numerous technology, skill, capital and managerial inputs) that go into each link of different energy chains from exploration to delivery at the point of end use. These are valued at about USS 100 billion a year based on projected energy investment needs alone for the period 2000-2030 (IEA 2003). Box 6: China\u2019s Quest for Energy Security In 2005, China\u2019s most ambitious takeover bid to date was launched by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd. (CNOOC) by overbidding the American oil giant, Chevron, for Unocal, another American company with large natural gas and oil reserves throughout the world. The Chinese bid of US$ 18.5 billion by the 70 percent government-owned oil company trumped the US$16.4 billion offered by Chevron. However, much political hostility at the prospect of a Chinese takeover stalled the process in the U.S., with some lawmakers proposing a ban on the acquisition for reasons of U.S. energy security. Amidst much rancour, CNOOC withdrew its bid on 2 August 2005, but left behind a mark of future ambitions on the global stage. CNOOC is the result of a 1982 government directive that created a joint venture company for oil exploration in Chinese territory, and it is a part of the \u201cinner sanctum\u201d of the top 50 Chinese state-owned companies. At the same time, rising concerns over fossil fuel dependency have prompted the Chinese to pass a law that aims to have wind power provide 10 percent of total energy supplies in the next five years. The new plan, described as ambitious by experts, will see the present 0.01 percent of power grid contribution by wind-power electricity increase substantially through infrastructural investments and price fixing for solar and wind generated electricity.

With energy demand continuing to grow world-wide \u2014 especially in the Asia-Pacific region which is expected to account for one-fifth of global demand by 2010 \u2014 the volume and complexity of transborder energy trade are growing at a rapid pace. Global trade in energy is expected to double by the year 2030 and it will be accompanied by significant 29 structural changes in trade flows. Evidence of this is indicated by the following developments: o Whereas historically international trade in energy took place for the most part between energy-producing (mainly, oil-producing) developing countries and energy-consuming industrialized countries, new actors have emerged to alter this decades old equation. A number of developing countries, notably China and India, are now among the top energy-consuming and import-seeking countries in world energy markets. Malaysia, a net oil exporter, has signalled an imminent reversal of its status to that of an oil importer as its reserves approach the point of saturation. o The limited extent of transborder trade among developing countries traditionally involved neighbouring countries under bilateral agreements. The outreach of this trade is now expanding beyond their immediate borders across continents. China has a 50 percent share in Iran\u2019s Yadavaran oil field; China National Petroleum Corporation owns 60 percent of Kazakhstan's Aktobemunigaz; Sinopec has invested US$ 1 billion in a joint venture with Brazil\u2019s Petrobas for a gas pipeline; and in the latest bold move, China National Offshore Oil Corporation made a US$ 18.5 billion bid for Unocal, a US oil and gas company.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60242e0f-3ae7-433b-9b13-cc5afc522085": {"__data__": {"id_": "60242e0f-3ae7-433b-9b13-cc5afc522085", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87343914b621008c1469de07eee632f979138afa543d15c4166af0550a873bd6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b50277c2-35e5-4193-ac05-d5313011dbf7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccdf548e9f170314fee2651c43bd027eef02ecf967991ff8002371ac5a5f5e5a"}}, "hash": "f6aa3c3da59dcbc202f74ac105a3759eaa17d683e1c97b692b20743c8951968f", "text": "Similarly, India\u2019s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has invested in offshore gas fields in Vietnam, and in energy projects in Algeria, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Venezuela, Libya and Syria; an Indian private group, Reliance Industries, has a stake in an offshore field in Yemen, and ONGC Videsh Ltd. has acquired a 20 percent share in Russia's Far Eastern Sakhalin-1 field.19 o On an intra-regional basis, new initiatives have been launched to foster trade in gas and electricity.

Source: ReFocus, Nov/Dec 2003 Reforming energy markets The structural changes in energy trade outlined above are driven by rapid economic growth in parts of Asia. Faced with the surging energy demand of their economies, China21 and India have emerged as major global players in search of new sources of energy, adding to pressures on existing global energy supply lines from established importers like Japan and the Western countries. With energy demand expanding at comparable rates in other countries, investment in the region\u2019s energy infrastructure will average around 3.5 percent of GDP (more than 8 percent of GDP in some countries like Papua New Guinea), presenting the most compelling reason to seek market transformations capable of attracting private capital.22 Global estimates of energy investment needs vary, with the International Energy Agency placing it at US$ 16 trillion worldwide for 2001-2030 (IEA 2003); and the World Energy Council (WEC) nearly doubling this at US$ 30 trillion. A breakdown of the former indicates that power generation, transmission and distribution will absorb almost 60 percent of the aggregate cost. Investments in the oil and gas sectors will each amount to more than US$ 3 trillion, or around 19 per cent of global energy investment. The coal industry will require US$ 400 billion, or 2 percent. The five largest countries outside the O.E.C.D. \u2014 Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Russia \u2014 will need about one third of global electricity investment. Financing these investments will be one of the biggest challenges of the generation. With the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in February 2005, environmental considerations are becoming a major driver of new energy technology. Advanced technologies being developed today could dramatically alter energy choices and requirements in the longer term. The transfer of these technologies to developing countries will add a new dimension to established patterns 21 China is the second largest importer of oil, presently requiring 2 million barrels of foreign oil per day; this is expected to rise five-fold by 2025 (BBC World News 26 June). 22 APEC (2003) 31 of trade in energy. However, even assuming a generous scale of technology transfer from the rich to developing countries, the energy needs of the latter will continue to grow, in part because of their very low levels of energy consumption per capita at present and in part due to continued population growth.23 Short of dramatic breakthroughs in energy efficiency, the gains from the induction of improved present-day technologies into developing countries will at least be partially offset by absolute growth in their energy demands and higher rates of per capita energy consumption. Against this background, market opening measures have gathered momentum in Asia-Pacific, with a growing number of countries finding it necessary to introduce structural reforms to cut costs and improve economic performance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bad962d0-fcac-4eda-9062-640d09c42c2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bad962d0-fcac-4eda-9062-640d09c42c2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "631954a5a86b7691145702890faaaf4a63b515c087562d42de41791de217c25f"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ff0523e-c7e5-4bcb-8447-2a8446b1a329", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1eee03753b4bc7b2c431d741dcdd968732b51b6863cbe56d37084bf178f8540"}}, "hash": "1d4900bd3b82e3349c6cde2387aaf891cbb7f88307929ccfb4b76d13b040aa15", "text": "These measures include: a) deregulation (reducing state control); b) corporatisation (placing public energy utilities under commercial discipline); c) unbundling (breaking up vertically integrated, state-owned monopolies into smaller units, with portions of the energy supply industry passed on to the private sector); d) private sector participation (joint ventures, energy service companies); and e) privatisation (independent energy producers).

The underlying reasoning is that without massive investments (including foreign investment) it is not possible to meet the growing energy needs of developing countries through public investment and ODA alone. The central aim of the reforms is to enlarge access to cheaper, more efficient energy which, in turn, will enhance the productivity of people and enable them to compete in a globalised world. Significant energy sector reforms are now taking place in at least 13 countries of the region (WEC 1998). While progress is being made, none of the developing countries involved has achieved a substantial level of liberalisation comparable to the industrialised countries. Reforms across the board covering electricity, coal, oil and gas are occurring only in India. In other countries, one or more of these industries are undergoing structural changes, with the majority of countries concentrating on reforms in electricity. The general direction of reforms is towards a diminishing influence of the government, especially in terms of price controls and guaranteed markets. This involves a transfer in ownership either from central government to government-owned independent enterprises, or from government-owned to private companies; removal of import quotas and duties, and a reduction in government subsidies. Progress till date with the reforms has been mixed. In the majority of countries, control of the industry remains with the central or local/state governments. Privately-owned domestically-controlled, and privately-owned domestically- and-internationally controlled power utilities are present only in the advanced economies of Hong Kong SAR, Japan and the Republic of Korea. However, private entities co-exist with public utilities in Sri Lanka where the latter retains its predominance, and in the Philippines where private ownership is more influential. The Power Sector Reform Act and the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act in the Philippines have sought to attract 23 Much of the world population growth up to and beyond 2050 will occur in developing countries. 32 private sector investments while ensuring fair and reasonable energy prices. The former mandates the reduction of electricity prices and addresses the issue of access by stipulating that distribution utilities are required to provide universal service within their franchise areas (Pacudan 2003). In the majority of countries, the electricity industry remains vertically integrated with generation, transmission and distribution vested in government entities, and pricing mostly regulated by the government. Independent regulators or competitive markets have yet to become prevalent. Although, as noted, these reforms have revolved around domestic markets, they have facilitated foreign capital, technology and energy flows. Liberalising trade in energy services So far, the ongoing energy reforms in developing countries have concentrated largely on domestic markets. There are now calls to extend them further into the international arena. Energy resources are not the focus of these moves as states need to retain control of these resources for the welfare of present and future generations. The calls have more to do with the numerous activities, or \u201cservices,\u201d that go into the extraction, production, transformation, transportation and delivery of each \u201cenergy chain.\u201d The energy market is highly segmented with over 30 different types of such services that can be singled out as \u201cadding value\u201d to each stage linking an energy source to the final consumer (Zarrilli 2003, 25). The considerations for liberalising upstream services are different from transportation and downstream services. The Doha Development Agenda is the first time that energy policy measures have come under multilateral trade negotiations. The proposals on energy services are aimed at gaining greater access to markets being liberalised by reducing the potential of residual monopolies to frustrate competition. Initial \u201coffers\u201d at the WTO in the energy sector are difficult to assess because of scattered commitments,24 but qualitatively not much is on the table (South Centre 2005). Classification-related issues have attracted much attention in GATS proposals because they reflect the liberalisation goals of the U.S., Japan, Chile and the E.U. These countries are pressing for liberalization of upstream energy services with the aim of increasing and securing control of supplies. Some proposals also reflect domestic strategies for liberalisation of segments within the energy chain, such as in Indonesia (see box). While it is generally acknowledged that the energy sector will continue to be regulated to pursue public goals, the outcome of negotiations on other key issues on the Doha Agenda could have potential implications for energy policies and human development, including subsidies and countervailing measures. These issues have been raised in negotiations of accession to the WTO, along with \u201cWTO plus\u201d requests in the areas of governmental controls on production and export of petroleum-based products; domestic prices and pricing policy; export tariffs and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf11aad0-b239-4157-b0cc-88d3dab94707": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf11aad0-b239-4157-b0cc-88d3dab94707", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc4486c053d425ea2f513834ff0e330db302c2c26e33298cf20f108cd557b1f2"}}, "hash": "cc4486c053d425ea2f513834ff0e330db302c2c26e33298cf20f108cd557b1f2", "text": "taxation; the operations of state trading enterprises; and \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices (Gibbs 2003). 24 From developed countries, the U.S., Norway, Australia and the EC have made initial offers, and from developing countries, Egypt, Colombia, Chile and India, among a few others. 33 Box 8: Indonesia\u2019s Strategic Approach GATS negotiating positions reflect domestic strategies, such as those of Indonesia which is liberalising the downstream segment of the energy sector to improve its refineries, mainly to be able to refine its own oil. Indonesia hopes to attract foreign investors who would bring the capital and technology needed to improve domestic refinery capacity. Indonesia is also liberalising the upstream segment of the energy sector and has recently privatised the national oil company, Pertamina. However, it wishes to attract only domestic private investors for now, since it believes that domestic companies would not be able to compete with foreign companies right away. In November 2004, Indonesia introduced at the WTO a revised proposal for classification of energy services with the aim of achieving a high level of desegregation in energy service activities. This would allow countries, especially energy- endowed developing countries, to liberalise only the specific sub-segments that they wish to liberalise. Source: Zarrilli (2005) The GATS proposals are consistent with the relative investment priorities outlined in the IEA scenario referred to earlier. They revolve around the markets for electricity, oil, gas and coal. In sheer investment terms, the electricity sector is the most important, followed by the oil and gas sector where, aside from the volume of estimated investment, concerns over supply security are added motivations. As a result, considerable attention is paid to gas transportation and transmission via tankers and pipelines. While coal features in broad- based requests for energy sector-wide access, its relative importance is low. In the case of oil, gas and coal, there is a stress on upstream services that are more capital- intensive than downstream services. Electricity transmission and distribution are, however, of considerable interest since the projected investment in them is larger than that in generation and exceeds the combined total of the oil and gas sectors. Of the four \u2018modes\u2019 of supply, Mode 1 is relevant for online trading and energy brokering and professional services that can be delivered by mail or electronically, such as consulting or legal services. It also covers services related to the cross-border transmission of electricity and gas through pipelines and interconnected grids. Mode 3 is the most important since it covers all different forms of foreign commercial presence, such as BOT25 contractors and IPPs. Mode 4 includes the movement of skilled personnel who deliver technical and managerial services, as well as the movement of semi-skilled and unskilled personnel needed, for example, for the construction and upgrading of grids. Potential human development impacts of energy market liberalisation Access to cheaper, more efficient energy through market reforms and trade liberalisation can mitigate the energy security concerns of developing countries, help sustain their economic growth prospects, and enhance the productivity of their people. These developments can enable developing countries to compete in a globalised world. However, 25 Build, operate and transfer. 34 reforms and liberalisation imply that governments will no longer be able to apply direct measures in the energy sector in support of human development goals, but shall have to pursue them through new regulatory structures. Asian experiences to date with energy market reforms represent a transition whose pace and eventual destination are still uncertain given that the starting point for each country is different, and there are concerns over the human development impacts of open markets for energy. Taking the example of the electricity sector, where the most progressive reforms are taking place, developing countries have to cross several stages \u2014 from initial corporatisation of state utilities to full retail competition \u2014 before achieving the kind of substantially liberalised energy markets that are being advocated by development banks and their shareholding industrialised countries. Recent setbacks with liberalised energy markets in the U.S. have, however, prompted Asian countries to adopt a more cautious approach.26 While these developments should not deter countries from the long-term benefits of energy liberalisation, they are nonetheless a warning against the potentially serious public interest consequences of hasty marketisation. Available evidence suggests that the price reduction benefits of liberalisation are long-term rather than short-term. By contrast, the current emphasis of energy strategies on human development seems to require a higher rather than lower level of regulatory intervention by the state. This points to the need for a graduated approach to liberalisation accompanied by adequate regulatory safeguards in line with equity gaps in individual countries.

A recent review carried out by the UNDP Asia Trade Initiative in five countries of the region sheds light on the nature of these impacts.27 o Energy consumption: in absolute terms, past evidence suggests that market and trade liberalisation will lead to an increase in the growth of modern energy consumption at the overall national level. It is unlikely this will take place evenly across all segments of the population. Countries with large rural populations without access to modern energy cannot expect profit-seeking private firms to enter rural energy markets readily. However, decentralised renewable energy programmes with private initiative can increase modern energy consumption in rural areas. o Energy prices and affordability: energy price increases are likely to occur in almost all cases of liberalisation. Competitive electricity markets do not support price subsidies and cross-subsidies. Price increases could be offset over time by efficient production, construction and transportation/transmission technologies, coupled with subsidies and lifeline rates targeted at the poor. The initial costs of decentralised renewable energy technologies could decrease gradually as market expansion takes place and economies of 26 In 2001, Enron, the world\u2019s largest private energy company \u2014 with 21,000 employees, 25,000 miles of gas pipelines and 9,000 MW of electricity generating capacity in the U.S. and abroad \u2014 collapsed, with subsequent enquiries revealing widespread price-rigging practices. In a related development, the privatised electricity market in California, the privatised electricity market underwent a series of convulsions, leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers without electricity and major power corporations in bankruptcy, requiring repeated governmental interventions to ensure power supply 27 Refer to country case studies (on China, India, Iran, Malaysia and the Philippines) prepared by the UNDP Asia Trade Initiative. 35 scale kick in. However, in the short to medium term, the price impacts are likely to be largely negative. o Universal access: ensuring universal access to electricity and modern fuels implies the supply of a minimum quantity of modern energy to meet the basic needs of all. Market or trade liberalisation can, at best, contribute to the overall state effort aimed at universal access by easing supply constraints. o Employment and income: the potential for income growth due to liberalisation is mixed. For instance, in China, coal industry reforms left 1.5 million workers unemployed. On the other hand, expansion of the energy industry as a whole due to market-opening could add new functions and employment opportunities. New jobs may occur in other economic sectors as higher energy consumption leads to economic expansion. o Rural-urban income disparity and migration: even if liberalisation leads to greater energy availability for rural populations, there is no assurance this will result in rural economic development that can arrest migration and reduce income disparities since energy is one of several inputs to rural development. o Human resource development and capacity building: in all five countries assessed by UNDP, liberalisation has transferred technical and managerial skills and know-how from the developed countries along the energy chain, especially in exploration, production and transmission/transportation facilities. Further liberalisation can enhance these benefits, more so if it leads to enhanced local manufacturing capacity in energy equipment. o Education/literacy: impacts on education and literacy will be negligible. The problem lies with low levels of modern energy supply to rural households. The level of illumination provided by lighting fuels and decentralised electricity is usually inadequate except for basic visibility. This is partly due to supply constraints, but more because of low incomes and the need for households to minimise their energy expenditure. o Health and local environmental protection: liberalisation is expected to usher in new, environmentally cleaner technologies in various activities along the energy chain. Traditional biomass cooking fuels in rural households which are a major cause of local environmental degradation and poor indoor air quality are likely to be replaced by less polluting fuels like kerosene and LPG. However, fossil fuel consumption is likely to increase with liberalisation, with potential adverse effects on health and environment. o Gender equity: the gender dimension of energy has to do largely with the time spent by rural women in the time-consuming tasks of traditional fuel collection, preparation and cooking. Time savings for women in these activities cannot be realised from the promotion of kerosene and electricity as these are intended for non-cooking uses. As a result, their enhanced supply, made possible through private networks and providers under a more open market climate might carry other impacts, but have little effect on women unless household incomes increase sufficiently to make cooking", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81037bfb-60cd-4bfa-ac4d-38fcacf5b550": {"__data__": {"id_": "81037bfb-60cd-4bfa-ac4d-38fcacf5b550", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1346a1d226c95a7055df505e843095cbdeae21b33b4cb97ffddda68a1c75fc2"}}, "hash": "c1346a1d226c95a7055df505e843095cbdeae21b33b4cb97ffddda68a1c75fc2", "text": "fuels like LPG affordable. 36 o Small and medium enterprise development: liberalisation will generally benefit SME development. However, countries with a large unemployed work force could be adversely affected in construction activities where local SMEs could be displaced by multinational presence. Negative impacts are also anticipated in wholesale and retail energy trade activities where foreign firms could replace the traditional role of distribution utilities and local contracting firms. o Energy security and strategic supply control: the ability of governments to retain strategic control over energy production and distribution is generally expected to diminish in a competitive market environment. To the extent that the operation and management of such services pass from the hands of state-owned utilities to free market players, there are potential adverse effects for national strategic interest and for lifeline supplies to marginalised populations. o Policy response flexibility: the ability of governments to exercise policy responses is expected to diminish under a more competitive environment where regulation, taxes and other forms of government intervention in the market give way to more direct interaction between buyers and sellers. Although governments will continue to make broader policy decisions to pursue national strategic interests and welfare goals, these are not likely to allow them the kind of policy response capability that they have through state-owned utilities. o Efficient resource use: resource use is expected to receive a boost as this is a key strength of the market. Subject to continuing regulatory policies that ensure the community and welfare obligations of the government, and also of the private sector, liberalisation will better reflect the scarcity value of primary energy sources in prices, introduce more efficient technologies, allow redundancies in overstaffed state-owned utilities, and bring in more effective financial planning and management tools. Box 9: Health Effects of Biomass Use on Women Biomass cooking on traditional stoves is a major source of concentrated air pollutants, including carbon monoxide and a number of carcinogenic compounds. In some places, the pollutant exposure levels associated with indoor biomass burning in developing countries is many times greater than generally accepted health standards, such as maximum particulate concentrations of 250 micrograms per cubic metre in the U.S. However, in developing countries, people are routinely exposed to indoor particulate concentrations many times higher. These levels rival or even exceed the pollution levels found in the most polluted industrial cities. Women and children are particularly affected, where cooking smoke is confined to indoor settings, to which they are exposed for extended hours each day. Source: WEC 37 Implications for poverty Transforming energy markets does not mean that all forms of government intervention in energy should be disowned or dismantled. That would be irresponsible and premature. Most developing countries in the region are far from achieving universal access to energy, with poor consumers particularly vulnerable to the \u201cliberation\u201d of end-user prices that have been regulated and subsidised by governments for decades under the public utility model. Any liberalisation of energy markets must, as a matter of human development priority, protect the interests of these consumers. A balanced approach to energy market transformation could simultaneously pursue market penetration and market creation, the latter directed at ensuring those enabling conditions that make it easier for the poor to make the energy transition within a predictable time frame. This would involve safeguards like subsidies and lifeline tariffs to cushion the price shocks of market liberalisation, as well as compatible measures to raise the poor\u2019s incomes so that safeguards do not become permanent aberrations of the need to reflect the scarcity value of energy in prices. The preceding assessments indicate some long-term gains to the poor in the form of higher energy consumption and access. However, the near-term losses to them in income, employment and price increases could outweigh the gains. Some would argue that this is a worthwhile trade-off, but the question is: for whom? The poor lack the most basic level of economic security in the form of assets and income. Asking them to endure higher energy prices and loss of livelihood for an uncertain number of years is not justifiable on human development grounds. The removal of pricing subsidies for energy post-liberalisation could prolong poverty, not resolve it. Misdirected subsidies clearly have a corrosive influence on efficiency as they obscure the true value of scarce energy resources. But so long as poverty remains a problem, the response to the abuse of subsidies cannot be to abolish them altogether. This is a reality acknowledged by the World Energy Council which, while supportive of the abolition of subsidies in general, states that: \u201cgovernment or regulatory intervention in energy pricing mechanisms may be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e96e9836-47e7-4dcc-85aa-cebf0334a39e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e96e9836-47e7-4dcc-85aa-cebf0334a39e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "International Trade in Environmental and Energy Services and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/international-trade-environmental-and-energy-services-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6579e9962ecbc30fb6e4e8798d2b9983cb79645623c62cca58e4bbd3b5946bb0"}}, "hash": "6579e9962ecbc30fb6e4e8798d2b9983cb79645623c62cca58e4bbd3b5946bb0", "text": "justified to address certain externalities or to achieve certain social or long-term goals. Energy subsidies, which may be necessary, must benefit those who really need them and should enhance the accessibility, availability and acceptability of energy services. Such subsidies should be visible in terms of their size, transparent in terms of their sources and beneficiaries, and subject to review within a prescribed time period.\u201d The other side of the coin is the poor\u2019s lack of income which inhibits them from participating in the market. Rational pricing policies need to be matched by rational income policies. While energy can play a role in increasing the incomes of the poor, it does so effectively only when combined with other development inputs, implying that energy market liberalisation cannot be considered in isolation of policies in other development sectors. The overall conclusion is that market liberalisation in energy is desirable, but it needs to protect the poor\u2019s interests. While there are a number of powerful economic reasons why liberalisation should be sought, there are equally compelling reasons why governments should draw the boundaries of liberalisation to limit its adverse consequences for the poor. 38 Creating energy markets for growth and access In the face of surging competition for international energy resources and unrelenting volatility in global energy prices, the transition to modern fuels and electricity in Asian developing countries can be accelerated only by diversifying their energy resource base, achieving higher levels of efficiency in energy production and consumption, and introducing greater competition in domestic energy markets which have historically functioned in a government-controlled monopolistic environment. Recent years have witnessed a growing sense of discontent with the concept of energy as a \u201cnatural monopoly,\u201d controlled largely by state-owned energy utilities operating in highly regulated markets. The inability of this model to reach large numbers of people in spite of persistent supply expansion over the years and the limits to governmental investment capacity have prompted calls for policies to enable private investment and initiatives. Pressures to liberalise trade in energy services are an extension of these calls. This implies liberalisation of investment and trade through bound commitments in a sector traditionally viewed as strategic and central to national sovereignty. There are, however, differences between allowing the entry of domestic private providers and opening the doors to foreign investors who may have little interest in rural energy markets because of low projected returns. Trade liberalisation may facilitate the expansion of supply channels in energy, but it might do little to overcome the problem of developing countries in ensuring universal access. Governments are, therefore, cautious of ceding control over all elements of these channels (for example, oil pipelines or power transmission grids) to private players as they strive to strike a balance between growth and equity objectives. Box 10: War, Oil and Prices Dramatic losses of Middle East oil supplies did not materialize either during or after the Iraq war in 2003. OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, had committed to using their spare production capacity. The war\u2019s impact on oil infrastructures were largely confined to Iraq, but this did not eclipse the fact that sizeable energy import dependence from a single region or oligopolistic supplier always remains a supply security risk. Oil prices breached projected levels in 2004 and peaked to US$ 70 per barrel in August 2005 and this trend is predicted to continue. High oil prices on international markets impact domestic energy prices and macroeconomic fundamentals. Costlier fuels raise input costs, damping exports from Asia, a region that accounts for 30 percent of the world economy. Growth rates are being revised downward because of higher oil prices \u2013 forecast for Asia without Japan has reduced from 6.7 percent to at least 6.3 percent, but could fall another 0.6 percent. Partly because of rising energy costs, OECD too has forecast its growth rate at 2.6 percent compared to 2.9 percent in 2004. Issues of energy access and affordability are at the core of the nexus between energy and poverty and while many studies call for reform, if not gradual elimination of price subsidies in petroleum products over the long term, there appears to be a dearth of literature on the short-to-medium term impact of recent oil price increases on poor people\u2019s livelihoods.

Nepal has abundant hydropower potential,28 but it is prohibitively expensive to extend the grid across rugged mountains to its rural majorities; trans-border sales to neighbouring India are one means of generating revenue to pursue decentralised off-grid solutions domestically. On the other hand, the rural majorities, particularly the poor among them, in energy exporting countries might derive no direct benefits from the added revenue flows into their government coffers so long as prevailing regimes of income and wealth distribution remain distorted. The image of a country like Nepal \u2014 with more than a third its population below the poverty line and with nearly 85 percent of the population without electricity \u2014 becoming the largest exporter of hydropower to India is a study in contrast. In fact, the poor in energy exporting countries could well shoulder a greater economic, social and environmental burden than those in the importing countries as new export-oriented production facilities, such as hydroelectric and oil-/gas-fired plants add to local disruptions to livelihood and pollution. At a broader level, increased trans-border trade in energy might do little to redress prevailing rural-urban poverty gaps in both exporting and importing countries. To the contrary, it may exacerbate them given that the primary beneficiaries on either side of the bargain will be governments, industries and urban consumers. Protecting the poor against these risks implies a careful consideration of the benefits and costs of energy trade to the poor. It may require continued regulation to shield the poor from price shocks and other potential pitfalls like physical dislocation, loss of livelihood and adverse health impacts. 28 It has economically feasible hydropower potential of some 42,000 MW, of which only about 600 MW has been developed so far.

Moving forward In the dual economies of developing countries, where a socially and economically backward rural majority co-exists with a modern urban minority, the benefits of economic growth tend to coalesce among the latter. There is a risk of trade liberalisation in energy services following a similar path. However, countries in which the dual economy phenomenon is less pronounced, or those that have mitigated them to a significant extent, can experience faster growth through market-opening measures. Where such growth is accompanied by prudent social policies to safeguard the interests of the marginalised population, progress in human development is conceivable. The challenge, therefore, is to strike the right balance between growth and equity and to sequence trade liberalisation in graduated steps commensurate with levels of a country\u2019s socio-economic resilience to market transformation. The proposals at the WTO for trade liberalisation in energy services seek broad access to markets in developing countries at a crucial juncture when many are implementing domestic reforms with varying degrees of progress.

The prudent course of action is to examine them carefully with in-depth analytical inputs, identify priorities and options specific to the situations and needs of each country, and negotiate a human-development-friendly quid pro quo. Under GATS, developing countries are under no obligation to make commitments against any of the proposals on the table. They have the right to make selective commitments that need not be even across all modes of supply, that is, cross-border supply (Mode 1), commercial presence (Mode 3) and movement of natural persons (Mode 4). Even where commitments are made, countries may schedule qualifications, reflecting their regulations and making access conditional on technology transfer and other human development oriented obligations. Countries could continue to have monopoly energy supply providers, so long as they have an accompanying regulatory body whose functions are open and transparent. They may or may not commit to providing third party access to transportation and transmission facilities. They can, if they wish to, restrict market access to foreign firms 41 and give preference to local firms if they feel it is in their national interest to do so. Even if they make commitments to allow market access and national treatment, they can specify exceptions that allow them the flexibility to limit that access. They may provide subsidies only to local firms, if these are indicated in the national treatment column of their schedules. Finally, they can impose public service obligations on foreign firms as a condition for access. The lack of policy options is not the constraining factor in GATS negotiations, but rather it is insufficient policy enlightenment on the role of energy in human development. Any commitment to liberalise access to energy markets would be made as a part of an overall Single Undertaking. WTO negotiations are based on reciprocity and commitments by Asia- Pacific countries which would provide huge economic advantages to firms from developed countries. They should be contemplated only if developed countries benefiting from such access make commitments and concessions in other goods and service sectors of export interest to Asia-Pacific countries. However, priority should be given to obtaining human development compatible commitments from developed countries in the energy sector itself. Without this basic strategic understanding, developing countries run the risk of entering negotiations with scanty information, inadequate understanding of relative policy priorities, and the possibility of making hasty commitments that may come back to haunt them. The strategy for developing countries in the region could thus involve four core components: First, market access may be limited to those parts of the energy sector that are considered most beneficial and, reciprocally, access may be sought in developed country markets in areas where a developing country has a competitive advantage. Asian countries with skilled human resources could trade energy market access commitments for a more secure movement of their professionals to jobs abroad. Others could seek concessions in agriculture or specific labour-intensive manufactures. Second, the energy needs of certain segments of the population cannot be expected to be served by the market and, therefore, those segments should continue to enjoy price and/or capital cost subsidies, special incentives for rural distribution co-operatives, and continued monopolies in electricity transmission networks. Third, there are many countries in Asia-Pacific which are actual or potential exporters of energy which have distinct needs. They should in particular avoid obligations that would restrict their ability to maintain dual pricing regimes, i.e., they should be able to provide energy to domestic consumers at prices below those at which they export (world prices). Fourth, given the stark facts of energy deprivation in Asian developing countries, the MDGs and the implicit priority they assign to rural energy are of overarching concern. However, this should not confine energy policies to a \u201csmall is beautiful\u201d paradigm. Small-scale energy technologies have made a negligible contribution so far to reducing income poverty. Evidence suggests that income gains are more likely to accrue to rural populations that have access to electricity and modern fuels from centralised energy systems. Attention to trade questions must, therefore, balance issues surrounding both centralised and decentralised energy, with a long term focus on ensuring convergent paths between the two. 42 REFERENCES 1.
