Finally, the Panel\u2019s experience reinforced the critical importance for ISTAPs of listening to the people, communities, and organisations affected by the disaster, as well as analysts in research institutions, non-governmental organisation (NGOs), universities, and the media. Hearing from those who suffered the consequences of the dam collapse, as they explained their grievances, brought home the full weight of the tragedy as well as the difficulties they face in being heard by the institutions that should be responsible for their well-being. 4 SUPPORT FROM IUCN AND OTHER ACTORS 21 At the outset, the Renova Foundation was composed of a relatively small cadre of highly motivated, idealistic leaders, and specialists. But as the largest of the 42 programmes swung into action, and their associated funding increased, Renova grew into one of the region\u2019s largest employers. It was one of the few private organisations in the world to have been tasked with the restoration of a damaged ecosystem and economy after a major environmental and social catastrophe. Over time, Renova evolved as it sought to build a better operational structure and increase its capacity to deliver the 42 programmes. However, this led to increasing compartmentalisation along the lines set out in the TTAC, a factor that was subsequently reinforced as many of the programmes became subject to judicial review. Renova\u2019s exponential growth in addressing the TTAC\u2019s increasingly compartmentalised programmes made the Panel\u2019s work more complex. How to engage with the large number of technically specialised departments and promote an integrated landscape approach and a long-term vision in such a highly compartmentalised framework? 5 WORKING WITH RENOVA: LEARNING BY DOING Above: Restoration work on the church affected by mud in Paracatu de Baixo, Minas Gerais.

These included the CIF, some of the technical chambers that advise it, the public prosecutor\u2019s office, local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations including some that were advising the affected communities, and the CBH-Doce. Renova\u2019s high staff turnover added another layer of complexity. This might have impeded continuity in stakeholder relations and threatened the institutional knowledge base. However, the Renova staff who served as go-betweens for relationships built over five years of Panel activities, remained more stable. From the outset, the Panel was connected to the Institutional Relations and Governance teams at Renova, whose staff and consultants were relatively constant throughout much of the period. They accompanied the Panel on field visits and assisted IUCN with the logistics and programming of face-to-face meetings. The Renova staff tasked with accompanying the Panel offered regular updates on key issues emerging during the restoration and informed the Panel on whether these issues remained relevant. While the Panel\u2019s objectives remained constant since the TTAC was signed, Renova had to adapt to new realities, and this led the Panel to modify its own strategy.

Some may be pertinent to similar situations where ISTAPs or scientific advisory bodies are convened, such as natural and man-made disasters, large-scale investment projects and the longer-term impacts of climate change. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam failure, the most important challenges included the scale and complexity of the disaster, the adversarial nature of the institutional and legal context, the lack of reliable data on the disaster\u2019s impacts, and the compartmentalised nature of the restoration. 6 ISSUES AND CHALLENGES Above: Aerial view of the ruins of the Bento Rodrigues district, 35 km from the center of the historic city of Mariana, two years after the collapse of the Fund\u00e3o dam, by the mining company", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16b3490f-8771-472a-8fba-bdfef93320f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "16b3490f-8771-472a-8fba-bdfef93320f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dae189d856bc5512c2cebdc13801c8544220ddadf1270e3a07d071ca8b5ae17"}, "3": {"node_id": "047d03ef-4a1a-4c10-bbe0-658fc7099276", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b90d1c364000f71008958518330280a43f646b648f16efe491f0b5ec42c9fb6"}}, "hash": "cacc85c9dd5707a66bc11a87f092e283135e30b04b6b0765d01bcd8454df7aa7", "text": "Samarco.

Photo: DIDA SAMPAIO / ESTAD\u00c3O CONTE\u00daDO 24 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 6.1 SCALE AND COMPLEXITY The collapse of the Fund\u00e3o Dam was one of the largest and most complex human-made disasters in recent history. When the 39.2 million m3 of tailings flowed downstream into the Rio Doce, they affected land and human settlements along 670 km of river as well as extensive coastal and marine areas. The disaster had multiple direct and indirect impacts on physical and chemical conditions in the river, on the biota and their maintenance processes, and on the living conditions, economy and society of people living along the river and coastal areas. Given the complexity of the disaster, the vast amount of information generated, and controversies relating to the interpretation and understanding of the data, the Panel decided to rely exclusively on publicly available sources, with a preference for peer-reviewed journals. Many publications were devoted to the disaster, while volumes of consultancy studies were prepared for Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 offices, and the courts. Much of this was made available online. To ensure independence and transparency, the Panel did not cite unpublished materials including those prepared for Renova and other entities. Renova and its parent companies questioned this approach since they had invested heavily in the research. However, much of this work had not been made publicly available and the Panel opted not to cite these sources. Nearly seven years have passed since the disaster, and there is still no comprehensive analysis of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Renova, the public prosecutors\u2019 office, and others have contracted a large number of studies, and peer-reviewed articles have been published in academic journals. But up to the time of this publication no overall synthesis has been published. Similarly, no overall assessment of the reparations has been carried out. The Renova website offers a month- by-month progress report on the programmes, but these have tended to focus on inputs and outputs (amounts spent, numbers of people employed, areas reforested, and so on) rather than on the achievement of the TTAC\u2019s long-term objectives of returning socio-environmental conditions to their pre-disaster condition. When the Panel was convened, therefore, its first priority was to prepare an overview of the situation in the Rio Doce Basin, applying the Panel members\u2019 specialist knowledge. The first thematic report (TR01 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018) synthesised the available information, providing an objective summary of the disaster together with background on the affected regions. Its general recommendations \u2013 which may well be applicable in other, similar situations \u2013 focused on the need for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts and the use of an adaptive management strategy. This latter should start with an evaluation of the mitigation programmes together with the potential threats \u2013 including climate change \u2013 that could undermine their expected outcomes. It also emphasised the importance of managing and disseminating knowledge gained from the disaster response. Subsequently, some of the recommendations conveyed by the initial thematic report were further developed \u2013 with agreement from Renova \u2013 while others were put aside. Renova or other primary stakeholders did not regard them as a priority, since they were prioritising the short-term goals needed to respond to the direct obligations of the TTAC. For example, the Panel saw adaptive management as essential to the long-term viability of the TTAC programmes, but this approach was rarely employed. The restoration effort appeared insufficiently flexible and unable to respond to the learning process required due to the uncertainties and impracticable timelines. Information management is another important theme in a complex post-disaster situation. The Panel offered to help Renova with the development of a strategy to manage the wealth of knowledge generated by the consultancy studies it had contracted as well as the natural and social science studies published by other organisations such as universities and research institutions. Panel members insisted that an effective strategy for knowledge management would be vital to ensure the legacy of the restoration. However, Renova had already decided to contract other consultants on knowledge management and was preparing to set up regional information centres.

This led to the involvement of federal government agencies, two state governments, the Public Prosecutors\u2019 offices in the two states and at least 40 municipal governments in the reparation. These governments and agencies will eventually have to take responsibility for the maintenance of the long-term programmes. As in other regions of Brazil, local government capacity is often severely constrained by the limited population in many municipalities. More than half the affected municipalities in MG, for instance, have less than 10,000 inhabitants. Local governments lack the resources to manage critical services, such as water supply, wastewater treatment, and the disposal of solid waste. Moreover, while everyone benefits from environmental services, they are not as visible as the community infrastructure that attracts votes, especially in small and rural municipalities. Toward the end of its tenure, the Panel aimed its advice not just at Renova but also at government agencies and the other stakeholders represented in the CIF and Technical Chambers (CT). The relations between Renova and the CIF/CT were often more adversarial than complementary, and this complicated efforts to engage effectively with all parties critical to restoration of the Rio Doce Basin. Further obstacles came from the fact that the TTAC was designed to facilitate a disaster response without waiting for the outcome of lengthy legal proceedings, but disagreements between Renova and the CIF/CT have regularly been referred to court. This led to uncertainty and delays in the restoration programmes. In 2020, the Panel decided to make recommendations on governance issues, focusing on the long-term legacy of restoration in the Rio Doce Basin. Drawing on experience from the Rio Doce and other post-disaster situations, the Panel focused on the need to start with a participatory approach that would allow a broad range of stakeholders \u2013 especially the people most directly affected \u2013 to share their vision for the Rio Doce Basin. Their \u2018buy-in\u2019 to a long-term vision was seen as essential to achieve consensus and commitment regarding the restoration and long-term improvement of the basin, and to eventually facilitate the handover of the programmes from Renova to the agencies that will be responsible for their long-term continuity once Renova\u2019s mandate has been fulfilled. In hindsight, it would have been better to initiate the governance review earlier, helping Renova and other key stakeholders (CIF and CT) to think about the reparation\u2019s long-term goals and the need for early engagement as part of a \u201cpolycentric governance\u201d strategy (Ostrom, 2010). But Renova had been conceived as a temporary arrangement, offering a rapid solution to the most immediate and pressing problems of the restoration. The government and other agencies are expected eventually to take over, continue, and complement the investments and programmes that had been initiated and financed by Renova. 6.2 THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT 26 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One conceptual challenge faced by the Panel was to develop a workable framework for the ex post analysis of the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. The conventional frameworks for environmental impact analysis (EIA) have primarily been developed for the ex ante determination of the potential impacts of investments, especially in infrastructure, extractive and industrial projects, where data is collected and analysed, and mitigation measures developed, before a project is started. In 2019, Renova\u2019s management team requested support with implementation of a recommendation from the first thematic report (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2018). In response, the Panel submitted a general framework for assessing the environmental and social impacts of disasters, which was well received. This issue paper (IP04 \u2013 S\u00e1nchez et al., 2019) encouraged Renova to establish an Impact Curatorship (Curadoria de Impactos). In 2021 Renova requested the Panel\u2019s help to develop a framework for assessing the impacts of the dam\u2019s collapse on coastal and marine areas. It was agreed that the scope would be limited to environmental impacts \u2013 which in themselves are extremely complex \u2013 and would not cover the social and economic impacts. These latter impacts were controversial since key decisions were subject to judicial deliberations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68809bae-a6c4-45b5-8058-10136eb874d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "68809bae-a6c4-45b5-8058-10136eb874d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f52fb58688fdaf68eac57a2c3f084c3bf5dae7f4f3d3e89685b7c560d99f0800"}, "2": {"node_id": "24abe91b-8b6f-48d2-86df-6c3910241a5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "757d71631082a4b230c801902bf47161b163f11194dbaa505141c9dc28fa08d8"}}, "hash": "89ece5613dd29d10abb1e031692270f05539a50a11a9216c44b5ba362c6ffcd6", "text": "These latter impacts were controversial since key decisions were subject to judicial deliberations.

The Panel has had to look beyond these existing approaches, however, to develop a systematic, evidence-based framework for ex post EIA in other affected coastal and marine environments. In the study of impacts on coastal and marine areas, the Panel and Renova faced the challenge of working outside the conventional framework for EIA. The challenge was compounded by the absence of reliable data on the pre-disaster situation \u2013 for instance, information on critical areas such as water quality (physical, chemical and biological characteristics). Moreover, it is extremely difficult to distinguish the impacts of the Fund\u00e3o tailings from the cumulative, historical impacts from over 400 years of mining and industrial activity, deforestation of the basin, and contamination from agrochemicals, raw sewage and solid waste. The Panel was able to draw on the available data and were supported by IUCN staff to identify new sources of information from academic journals and other sources to draw inferences regarding the impact of the dam break on coastal and marine habitats. Based on this broad literature review, the Panel emphasised that impact analysis should focus on the medium- to long-term risks to the biota and to human health from dispersal and re-dispersal of the Fund\u00e3o tailings, rather than the immediate impacts after the dam break. 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS AND BASELINE DATA 27 The TTAC requires the restoration to return conditions to the pre-disaster state as it was in November 2015 (Clause 06.II). However, even if adequate data were available to characterise the ex ante environmental conditions, the Panel took the position that such a \u2018causal nexus\u2019 restriction would be neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Panel viewed the restoration as an opportunity to \u2018build back better\u2019, through a wide- ranging programme for the continual recovery of the Rio Doce Basin that could eventually be replicated in Brazil\u2019s other river basins and elsewhere. Renova had been organised to implement the programmes outlined in the TTAC, and the completion of these programmes was the Foundation\u2019s number one priority. However, the TTAC\u2019s emphasis on programme-by-programme implementation led to a compartmentalised approach, which made it more difficult to achieve an overall understanding of the disaster\u2019s impacts and to develop viable long-term solutions for the most chronic and critical impacts. From the start, however, the Panel argued for a more integrated strategy, one that would combine Landscape and S2S approaches. An S2S approach would enable a better understanding of the dynamics between the social, economic and environmental aspects. It would also focus more on the interrelationship between different environmental concerns, such as water quality, wastewater treatment, land use, biodiversity, livelihoods and human health, among others. The integration of Landscape and S2S approaches would therefore allow stakeholders to better understand and plan for the long-term restoration of the Rio Doce Basin, including attention to the estuary, coastal, and marine areas. These approaches should be understood not solely as a theoretical approach but as an innovative set of tools that can combine with participatory stakeholder engagement for an effective restoration plan. 6.4 ADOPTING SOURCE-TO-SEA AND LANDSCAPE APPROACHES 28 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Below: Parts of the Rio Doce estuary, September 7, 2020.

Early on, however, the Panel did address some of the broader economic development issues in an innovative paper (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019), that suggested an alternative vision for the basin, based on more intensive, sustainable agriculture, rural tourism, the vertical integration of value chains, improved standards, and the development of a learning economy to be financed by permanent revolving funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c3a3ccf-e0ba-483b-86f5-3afeb43c2c79": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c3a3ccf-e0ba-483b-86f5-3afeb43c2c79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "152fb1e5b7036395bf7a7b65496f4b34551657cb863ef057c1524135b65de3f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "77304ac8-2a49-4c0b-9b16-4a1471e6e951", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "365e800ed14c8ef3e2e9be6f91afb05565444b77e1bc7ae3e195539079a4e9cf"}}, "hash": "fe569a76f1f90cfd8e4d203f03702157b11eca25b400f9c3338d1c36d340699a", "text": "A second issue paper (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019) argued that the restoration of inland and coastal fisheries would require a unified decision-making framework to determine when and how the responsible authorities could lift the fishing bans following their imposition in the wake of the disaster.

The Panel consistently sought to promote the concepts of \u2018citizen science\u2019 or participatory monitoring at meetings to launch and disseminate its issues papers (IP02 \u2013 Brito et al., 2019; IP05 \u2013 Alonso et", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "750f52a8-7f43-4dee-8a69-b00a79237bb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "750f52a8-7f43-4dee-8a69-b00a79237bb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59ae71673f74acb0ee9dce4c4961d464b2434ba959e53e4a3dcf41ab3c427a87"}, "3": {"node_id": "75b3a615-afc5-4fba-aff1-f6914c1b3daf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "603a131d2256af8bbda257fea2266cff64de3b2a992d6ab270a4e32c66c4a443"}}, "hash": "fa109892ed052c33dc27b3429f9d139caf78f0edb4c733d15cf96a134a07f35e", "text": "al., 2020) and thematic reports (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). In principle, Renova responded positively to this idea, and put the approach into practice by involving local people to monitor water quality. Indeed, bulletins on Renova\u2019s website represent a positive example of how information from monitoring programmes can be obtained and presented in a way that is accessible and comprehensible to the general public. However, this citizen science approach did not go much further even though some of the directly affected communities, such as Degredo, a traditional Afro-Brazilian (quilombola) community on the ES coast, possessed the organisation and qualified professionals needed to permit more ambitious participatory monitoring programmes. These could have included the monitoring of flora and fauna, fisheries, and the quality and availability of ground and surface water. 6.5 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS Below: Rio Doce Panel visiting Instituto Terra and its nursery of native plants used to restore the Rio Doce Basin.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 30 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL One of the most frequently repeated demands to the Panel, made by the affected population, was for better information about the disaster\u2019s impacts on physical and mental health. Such impacts are typically seen as a consequence of direct exposure to the tailings, to tailings dust, and to the contamination of water supplies. But human health can also be affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and irrigated vegetables, as well as the social and psychological impact of community displacement, loss of livelihoods and dependence on monthly indemnity payments to displaced households, fishers, artisanal miners, and other affected groups. The Panel recognised that an integrated treatment of human and ecosystem health would be beneficial for people affected by the disaster. This was thus a serious lacuna in the restoration process. Renova staff have tried to lay the groundwork for a programme of Integrated Environmental and Human Health Management (GAISMA). However, the judicial decisions have required that Renova treat these issues separately. As a result, this integration has been omitted from most remediation and restoration efforts over the seven years since the dam break. The Panel did, however, draw attention to the continued need for an integrative perspective. For example, its final Issue Paper recommended the One Health approach (IP05 \u2013 Alonso et al., 2020). This approach shows how best to coordinate programmes, policies, legislation and research in order to unlock collaboration between the human and animal health and ecosystem conservation sectors, thereby improving public health. IP05 addressed the wider links between human health and the environment, recommending support for public health monitoring and the exchange of information between the formal public health system (SUS, from Portuguese acronym Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade) and organisations in the fields of community and environmental health. These recommendations were not immediately taken up, but public health was later included as a priority theme in the TTAC\u2019s renegotiation. Additional studies would provide a more complete assessment of the disaster\u2019s impacts on human health in the areas most directly affected, but they remain stymied due to dissent in the judicial arena. 6.6 HEALTH IMPACTS Below: Group of people on a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

Photo taken during the Rio Doce Panel\u2019s visit in July 2022. Photo: IUCN/ Rio Doce Panel archive 32 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL When the Panel began its work, it did not prioritise the potential cumulative impacts from tailings deposition and sediment flows on the marine and freshwater biota, but it was agreed that, should the need arise, additional expertise would be sought, either through an external consultant or by adding an extra member to the Panel. As discussed above, however, Renova later sought the Panel\u2019s advice on how to better understand and manage the environmental impacts on the coastal and marine areas. Meanwhile, Renova had contracted a detailed assessment and monitoring of biota in the estuary and adjacent coastal region to a consortium of universities and scientific researchers in Esp\u00edrito Santo, along with parallel studies by the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) and consultants assigned by UNESCO. The emerging complexity and conflicting scientific findings from these overlapping studies pointed to the continued risk from deposition of the tailings. Given the lack of a common basis for describing and assessing impacts, and the need to systematise impacts into a common structure, Renova and the Panel agreed to work on the development of a systematic framework that would enable interpretation of the results generated by these and other studies.

This suspicion has been compounded by the pressure to take decisions and implement them in a timely fashion, since the disaster deprived people of essential environmental services, such as potable water, fisheries and housing. Here, the Panel offers some general suggestions that might be useful for future ISTAPs and Rio Doce stakeholders to help prioritise issues, achieve consensus and implement sustainable, efficient and long-term solutions. 34 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL Left: Aerial view of the Rio Doce below the city bridge.

All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 35 The effects of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster were complex and the process of recovery has to be sustainable in the long run. To ensure such results, the process itself is as important as the outcomes. Thus, successful engagement with government and civil society is key to a sustainable and lasting restoration. The Panel focused its work on issues that contribute to the long- term sustainability of the basin and its inhabitants. To achieve long-term sustainability, these issues depend on successful intervention and engagement with local and regional institutions. Man-made and natural disasters can have devastating impacts on the local population, their economies and social infrastructure, but they can also offer an opportunity for longer-term improvement. Recovery is not simply a return to prior conditions. The opportunities should be mapped and planned with input from diverse stakeholders \u2013 especially those that have been most directly affected \u2013 to achieve a common vision for the future. The full benefits of a shared vision may not be felt for decades. The socioeconomic benefits of changes to economic structure, education, and sanitation may not be felt in the short term, but in the long term they are essential for the continual improvement of the environment, economy and social conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06641379-330a-4757-bfe2-78cbb42b5779": {"__data__": {"id_": "06641379-330a-4757-bfe2-78cbb42b5779", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4daf37c100cc5940741550edfcddb760c321974ab5c62a3b713ac276b4c1f444"}, "2": {"node_id": "73892379-d41f-4825-b9b6-72f548ca7491", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daf8866780c3a5cca5a45c34c9f789fc0e87d5cadb773557508513c529f122aa"}}, "hash": "7732698753f4af031f2ccc050535eb2e26bfce69622839966a76e96d290a8d15", "text": "This is especially true for poor and degraded regions, such as the Rio Doce Basin.

Consultation and engagement are key to achieve a shared vision and to the development of viable programmes with an exit strategy that will ensure the restoration\u2019s continuity and sustainability. Such investments may not have immediately visible results, but they are essential for human and ecosystem health. When adapted to the specific realities of other regions and countries, this model could be applied to most post-disaster scenarios. It could also be adapted to major investments in infrastructure or extractive projects. A participatory process may appear more complex and time-consuming, but it is the only way to guarantee a process of continual improvement that will satisfy the expectations and needs of the people affected. In the Rio Doce case, affected communities were not involved in drawing up the TTAC or in the subsequent decision- making, and this has exacerbated the mistrust and conflicts generated throughout the restoration. Some of this was inevitable, but it could have been lessened by more effective engagement with the different groups of people affected. In the immediate aftermath of disaster, short-term solutions are required to cover people\u2019s immediate needs, reinstating access to potable water, energy supply and housing. Once this has been achieved, and people\u2019s confidence restored through short-term actions, it becomes necessary to start thinking more strategically. This requires longer-term process-oriented programmes that allow for continual improvement. Even shorter-term restoration activities should encourage participation and 7.1 PROMOTE A LONG-TERM, SHARED VISION FOR CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT Below: In the image, a person driving a boat at the mouth of the Rio Doce.

By producing rapid results and \u2018quick wins\u2019, engagement can build trust between the different stakeholders. The Panel consistently recommended the need for affected people to have the opportunity to participate in decisions about the restoration. In the case of the Fund\u00e3o Dam disaster, the decision-making structure established under the TTAC led to drawn-out discussions that extended from federal and state government agencies to the public prosecutors and eventually to the judiciary. It lacked the mechanisms that would allow greater participation by those most directly affected, thus limiting their engagement and commitment to the restoration programmes. Participation is not easy \u2013 but if decision- making is done only by the existing governmental bureaucracy, then it becomes more difficult to empower society and to achieve the long-term changes needed for \u2018building back better\u2019. In the beginning, the Panel focused on making recommendations to Renova. As time went on, however, the Panel realised the importance of engaging with other stakeholders, since different actors had to be involved to achieve lasting results through a more participatory process. One of the lessons that may be applicable to other ISTAPs, therefore, is not to focus exclusively on one or more specific stakeholders, but to share the recommendations more widely and engage directly with all the relevant stakeholders. The Panel had been slow to work with agencies other than Renova, but during the preparation of TR02 (May et al., 2020) Renova expressed its discomfort with managing issues related to climate change. This helped the Panel appreciate the importance of engaging with a broader group of actors. Below: Rio Doce Panel and IUCN secretariat during internal meeting during visit to the Rio Doce Basin.

This underscores an important issue for future ISTAPs. Their need for independence prevents them from acting as an intermediary between business or government agencies and the people directly affected. However, an ISTAP should be able to recognise the concerns of affected people, give voice to their aspirations, and encourage the relevant agencies to engage with them more effectively. 7.2 RECOGNISE THE POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND COLLABORATION Right: Yolanda Kakabadse, Chair of the Rio Doce Panel, during the launching of the 5th article of the series Issue Paper.

Photo: IUCN/Rio Doce Panel archive 38 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL 7.3 LOOK FOR INTEGRATED, MULTIDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS The desire for quick results may lead to the compartmentalisation of discussions and solutions, rather than calling for an integrated approach and acknowledging the complexity of the situation and the wide range of stakeholders. Many restoration issues are in fact connected and the existence of parallel structures can interfere with one another. For example, if the water is contaminated, then the fish may also be contaminated, with implications for people\u2019s livelihoods, nutrition, and health. This is obvious, but when different departments or agencies are responsible for water quality, biota, public health and the economy, it becomes more difficult to attain an integrated approach. The responses of different agencies may even contradict one another as in the case of the fisheries ban discussed in IP02 (Brito et al., 2019). Technical discussions can get lost in minor details that impede the search for effective solutions when they should be considered together, taking a broader landscape perspective to address issues that affect local welfare. The Panel consistently stressed the value of a landscape approach, rather than compartmentalised solutions. Renova did not fully internalise this view, but other stakeholders did acknowledge the need for integrated solutions to the chronic problems facing the Rio Doce Basin and associated coastal and marine areas. In this respect, the Panel played an important role, presenting the S2S approach together with landscape perspectives in a specific thematic report focused on the integration of biodiversity and water quality (TR03 \u2013 Brito et al., 2021). The S2S framework is a practical approach that has been tried and tested, not only in the Fund\u00e3o case, but also in other similar situations. The S2S principle could be applied elsewhere to restore and improve the environmental, social, and economic situation of a disaster-affected region. The impact analysis and the design of medium and long-term measures should avoid a piecemeal approach. Instead, they should adopt a broader perspective, combining landscape and S2S approaches from the start. This makes it easier to respond to the environmental, social, financial, economic, and cultural aspects of the affected region. The approach encompasses not only the spatial dimension (terrestrial and/or coastal areas), but also key flows \u2013 water, biota, sediment, pollutants, materials and ecosystem services. The S2S concept was first introduced by the Panel in its Issue Paper No. 3 (IP03 - Barbosa et al., 2019), in which it was proposed that Renova consider installing a permanent floodgate in the Rio Pequeno to protect waters of the Juparan\u00e3 lake \u2013 an important water source in the lower Rio Doce \u2013 from pollution by the Rio Doce in flooding conditions. The floodgate would have an opening and closing system to control the volume of water in rainy and dry periods to ensure connectivity between ecosystems. The affected territory covers a vast area in two Brazilian states, with distinct social, economic, and cultural characteristics. Both states have been degraded by centuries of extractive activities, unsustainable agricultural practices and contamination with raw sewage and solid waste. Rather than seeking a return to the pre-disaster situation as a baseline, it would be better to seek a negotiated solution that would improve conditions and kick-start a process of continual improvement in the region. This requires engagement with all the relevant parties.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9684dc17-d254-4bca-9be0-fd20f6ae3ef3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9684dc17-d254-4bca-9be0-fd20f6ae3ef3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Briefings UICN para Negociadores, Sess\u00e3o do Tratado Pl\u00e1stico INC-2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aea9a80b02d74461e2e556a4085235bf722ed3a1627e5ec2617026c7da4bdbcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ad4d417-ded5-4b02-aa36-e6f8720fc8ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/briefings-uicn-para-negociadores-sessao-do-tratado-plastico-inc-2", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a00f9811d76b62fee2d7d6e89138b0057f56eac90b95f8a3ec127eca47ec1d17"}}, "hash": "2667df91364147c6b5699fb00d252dd1afa73a55f4308cfae0e8f632d3aeecc4", "text": "This requires engagement with all the relevant parties.

The Panel also recommended that Renova support the establishment of a long-term fiduciary fund to finance continued efforts in the basin (IP01 \u2013 May et al., 2019) investing some of the resources originally intended for reparation. However, Renova rejected the concept on the grounds that it was not consistent with the mandate for immediate and short-term results. However, landscape analysis by Renova, UNESCO, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and other organisations have recommended that additional resources be directed toward a broader basin-level approach, including systematic analysis of the long-term development scenarios. 39 7.5 CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT The climate emergency threatens ecosystems and human well-being. Emerging diseases, water rationing, droughts, and floods will become more frequent in the coming years. Fundamental changes to the economy and social values will be vital to avoid and manage these challenges. Climate change is likely to aggravate the degradation of fragile and degraded landscapes such as the Rio Doce Basin. Restoration plans and programmes should share a common climate strategy, covering both assessment and adaptation to the effects of climate change. The Panel needed to persuade Renova that climate change issues were within its remit. Renova had been doubtful on the grounds that, first, climate change would only impact the region in the distant future, and second, that the impacts of climate change were distinct from those caused by the dam collapse. This underscores the tension between the short and long term, and between the causal impacts of the dam collapse and the need to address the underlying environmental conditions. Renova and its Board of Directors strongly contested the idea, for example, that climate change could be the cause of the extraordinary storm and rainfall events associated with the repeated deposition of tailings along the river. The Panel insisted that the theme was relevant and discussed its recommendations from TR02 (May et al., 2020) with different stakeholders. The process of restoration should consider the long-term governance of the affected region, noting that permanent institutions and those responsible for the restoration may have overlapping and complementary roles to play. The restoration programmes have generated studies, data, information systems, and especially capacity to execute restoration actions, but these may be lost if they are not integrated into the permanent structures of governance for the maintenance of nature\u2019s services. In principle, there should be a balance between tasks assigned to the restoration programme\u2019s institutions and to the long-term, permanent institutions that will eventually continue the restoration\u2019s programmes and investments. Both CIF and Renova have engaged with permanent institutions such as the Rio Doce Watershed Committee, universities, and NGOs in the area, viewing them as valuable sources of expertise. Similarly, the Panel also prioritised permanent institutions when it reached out to other groups of stakeholders. Early on, the Panel completed a stakeholder mapping and analysis of the impacted region (see discussion of the Panel\u2019s ToC, above), allowing the Panel to understand which permanent institutions might manage selected programmes in the longer-term. During the preparation of the thematic report on governance (TR04 - Maroun et al., 2021), this analysis was updated to include a broader range of stakeholders. Key findings were also discussed with various institutions beyond Renova. The key lesson for other ISTAPs is to initiate a process of stakeholder mapping at the outset and to update it regularly. This will provide clear understanding of the governance roles of each actor or agency in the affected region. Understanding the involvement of these actors is fundamental to the early integration of restoration efforts, guaranteeing continuity and long-term improvement. 7.4 ENGAGE AND EMPOWER THE PERMANENT INSTITUTIONS Right: In the image, a stretch of the Rio Doce near its mouth.

Panel members met in person twice a year and held videoconferences at the end of every month. This helped to maintain the Panel\u2019s cohesion and the quality of interaction between its members. It also kept them up to date on the development of the thematic reports and issue papers and the reparation process itself. The Panel also held debriefing sessions following meetings and systematised the relevant information for use in subsequent analyses. Panel members met with the Chair at the end of each face-to-face meeting to evaluate each other\u2019s performance and consider future pathways. Panel members also found it useful to divide into core groups when developing drafts of the thematic reports and issue papers. However, Panel members found it difficult to review these products if more than one paper was being prepared simultaneously. Future ISTAPs are advised to discuss and consider this balance and to review it from time to time, considering the expertise of the Panel members and the need for their participation in selected documents. ISTAPs are also advised to generate shorter, more concise products, even carefully presented intermediate products, rather than high- quality, professionally edited reports that are outdated by the time they are presented.

Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais 41 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS In the wake of the Fund\u00e3o tailings Dam collapse, the establishment of the Rio Doce Panel under the aegis of an institution as credible as IUCN helped to bring independent, impartial, landscape and long-term perspectives to the restoration of the affected area. The negotiations around the restoration and related processes were often extremely complex, since the multiple actors were often suspicious of each other and held distinct and often conflicting views. Moreover, the discussions tended to focus on specific, compartmentalised concerns. Despite the need for short-term solutions to respond to people\u2019s immediate needs, it is also essential to think about solutions to the long-term impacts caused by disaster. An ISTAP can influence the process by highlighting the need for a long-term, integrated perspective, even if implementation of the recommendations is neither direct nor immediate. An ISTAP\u2019s influence may not be felt immediately by stakeholders in a disaster restoration, but it does endure. ISTAPs can also influence important processes indirectly. One of the Panel\u2019s main legacies was the publication of impartial and independent analysis and technical advice that could be used by actors in different contexts, beyond that of the restoration of the Rio Doce watershed. By publishing thematic reports and issue papers throughout its five years of operation, the Panel contributed to discussions to change practices in the sector and to mainstream global concerns, such as climate change. 42 RESTORATION FOLLOWING A MAJOR DISASTER | REFLECTIONS FROM THE RIO DOCE PANEL In the image, parts of the Rio Doce estuary. Renova Foundation. September 7, 2020. Photo: All rights reserved to NITRO Historias Visuais The Panel\u2019s recommendations were grounded in globally relevant scientific literature, and they reflected a long-term approach and landscape perspective. This can be adapted to similar disaster situations, whose frequency is increasing rapidly with climate change. The Panel\u2019s process for developing recommendations was as important as the recommendations themselves. Knowledge of topics and methodologies that would never have been considered without participation of an ISTAP became widely disseminated in the process of consultation with stakeholders.

They are presented here under one of three broad categories: natural, agricultural or urban types of ecosystems. Based on the case studies results, it can be concluded that the several key elements required for successful \u201cNature-based Solutions\u201d interventions are already commonly represented in project design, notably clarity of purpose, design at scale and biodiversity net gain. Areas that appear to be more likely to be overlooked and therefore required attention at the design stage are inclusion of stakeholders, adaptive management, recognition, balancing of trade-offs. Overall, we can conclude that a solid foundation already exists in the country Case study 2: Landscape restoration and sustainable management in the Helan Mountains This case study focuses on restoring the natural ecosystem functions of the mountains to improve safety, ecology and landscape. The overall functionality of these ecosystems has been gradually improved by reducing anthropogenic threats (e.g. mining and overgrazing), restoring ecological corridors and improving landscape connectivity. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has an adequate fit with identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and attaining net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). However, it should seek to improve the trade-offs balancing (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). In further, it is critical to develop an inter-provincial cooperation mechanism or strategy, as the landscape is cross-jurisdictional. Case study 3: Building a community of life in the Fuxian Lake Watershed This case study focuses on the protection of the hydro-ecological environment of the Fuxian Lake Watershed in an effort to safeguard the ecological environment and water security of the Pearl River Basin and to support coordinated rural and urban development in central Yunnan. Through overall spatial planning and site-specific interventions, including reforestation, structural adjustment of agriculture, riparian restoration and conservation and management of the lake, a socio-economic-natural complex system has been developed that provides improved ecosystem functions and services. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case can strongly meet the indicators especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and attaining net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). Additionally, it also adequately fit to Criterion 7 & 8. However, the project can improve its consideration of trade-offs regard to ecological and social aspects. viii After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has an adequate fit with identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and achieving net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). However, it should seek to improve the stakeholder communication and engagement (Criterion 5), trade-offs balancing (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7) of the project. Case study 4: Conservation and restoration for food, water, and people in the Ulansuhai Nur Watershed This case study focuses on improving water security and preventing wind erosion and desertification. It has been implemented to conserve and restore various desert, farmland, mountain, grassland and river ecosystems. In addition, a special financial mechanism has been set up to facilitate private investment. After years of management and restoration, the eco-environmental quality, as well as biodiversity of Ulansuhai Nur Watershed were significantly improved. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has partly fit to the indicators, such as identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1) and designing at scale (Criterion 2). However, the project should improve the long-term stability of funding, so as to ensure stakeholder interests (Criterion 4), developing strategies for stakeholder engagement (Criterion 5) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). Case study 5: Integrated protection and restoration for the Qiantang River source water area This case study focuses on the ecological conservation of Qiandao Lake, located on the upper reaches of the Qiantang River. By addressing pollution control, riparian restoration, forest restoration and mining site rehabilitation, the lake\u2019s water security has been significantly improved.

Case study 6: Nature-based revitalization of Xunjiansi Village in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi This case study focuses on the establishment of a community socio-economic development model based on ecosystem services and goods (e.g. tourism), research and practice through the protection and restoration of ancient water harvesting facilities and farmland ecosystems. The outcomes include village revitalisation, enhanced conservation and efficient use of natural resources, effectively contributing to addressing societal challenges (socio-economic development and disaster risk reduction), while enriching the knowledge base of NbS with traditional knowledge and local expertise from China. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has a strong fit with the indicators, particularly in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2), involving local communities (Criterion 5) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). It also performs well in ensuring sustainability and mainstreaming (Criterion 8). The project could improve in terms of analysing trade-offs (Criterion 6) at the planning stage. Case study 7: Ensuring food security through conservation and the sus- tainable use of black soils in Jilin This case study focuses on the development of a nature-based farming model in line with the concept of conservation agriculture by incorporating correlated, locally specific measures. These efforts have effectively protected black soils, increased the organic matter and carbon storage capacity of arable land, while facilitating an integrated response to food security and climate change mitigation. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that it can strongly adapt to the indicators, especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). The project could add more considerations regarding the early involvement of the local community (Criterion 5). x Part 3: NbS in urban ecosystems Three case studies are presented, focusing on urban areas and emphasising the introduction of NbS in cities. These aim to build an integrated and coherent ecological system within cities, improve ecosystem services in urban areas and enhance the resulting adaptive capacity of cities to climate change. Case study 8: Integrating nature-based approaches for urban regeneration and development in Chongqing This case study focuses on local ecological space conservation and urban regeneration. Through the sustainable use and management of natural resources, the societal challenges effectively addressed by this project include disaster risk reduction, socio-economic development and water security. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has some strengths in terms of designing at city scale (Criterion 2), achieving biodiversity net-gain (Criterion 3) and balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6). The project could consider about alternative approaches (Criterion 4) and improve its strategy for adaptive management (Criterion 7) to maintain the ecosystem function and services.change. Case study 9: Coordinated coastal restoration and management for sus- tainable development of Beihai City, Guangxi This case study focuses on ecological restoration, systematic water pollution control and sponge city development to create a coastal wetland-urban complex system. Restoration is proposed according to zoning and specific measures for reservoirs, rivers, beaches and the sea. The project has improved water quality, biodiversity, disaster risk reduction capacity and the well-being of local communities. security. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case can strongly meet the indicators especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and achieving net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3).

Sponge cities: An answer to flood. http://chinawaterrisk.org/resources/analysis- reviews/sponge-cities-an-answer-to-floods/ Introduction In recent years, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have gained increasing attention at a global scale, given their potential to address some of the most pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, water security, disaster risk reduction and human health. Countries, organisations, experts, and decision-makers around the world have interpreted and discussed the concept from different perspectives. According to IUCN, NbS are \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d. NbS differ from traditional approaches and perceptions that rely upon engineering or technological solutions to solve environmental problems. Instead, they are based on the power of nature-well-functioning ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges, such as climate change, disaster risk reduction, socio-economic development, food security, water security, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and human health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6a75df9-d316-4c3c-acc1-1762961a8826": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6a75df9-d316-4c3c-acc1-1762961a8826", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "741a2cc823e72196e83f122b3b46b4fa67eb2830f678cdb39492d58506ecdc73"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e39a280-6d1a-4106-a8eb-28c1ab8eb332", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8296ccefc2fcaa9eeb021c9b7bb65fb2c1e50cb6dd51bb5bac696cacb79dab88"}}, "hash": "6fe86b09450b3878c27e75bd75b8e368fb1579a0c54157759bdd01185ca74f14", "text": "Within the NbS conceptual framework, NbS are seen as an umbrella type approach that encompasses ecosystem-based and ecosystem-related approaches, all of which address societal challenges, while improving the provision of ecosystem services and carefully considering the trade-offs at their core, for the benefit of people and nature.

Recently, large-scale ecological conservation and restoration programmes have been planned and implemented in China, leading to the emergence of various worthwhile practices in line with NbS. The aim of this publication is to present ten case studies and share Chinese practical experience and knowledge in planning and implementing interventions to address various societal challenges, protect the planet and help reverse trends of ecological degradation and biodiversity loss. While these interventions aimed to be NbS, the Global Standard for NbS had not yet been developed when they were planned and implemented. Therefore, this publication provides a detailed description of these ten case studies and a list of lessons learned from the case study managers and authors on how the Global Standard for NbS would have retrospectively helped to improve or ensure a more successful NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions are an emerging framework recognised by many stakeholders as essential to achieving sustainable development. Launched in 2020, the Global Standard for NbS will be reviewed by the next World Conservation Congress. This publication will help to better understand how NbS is being implemented in China, and the findings and examples will provide insights that will contribute to the upcoming revision of the Global Standard. Given the limited time and knowledge available, this report will inevitably include factors that require further elaboration, and we welcome all comments and suggestions from readers. 2 3 Case study 1: Holistic management and restoration of the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, to safeguard Beijing's water security Authors: Ming Luo, Xu Zhou, Yan Zhou, Chongyao Yang Societal challenges addressed: Ecosystems: F1 Rivers and streams F3 Artificial fresh waters F3.1 Large reservoirs F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands T7.1 Annual croplands T7.3 Plantations Ecosystem services enhanced: Water supply Erosion control and sediment retention Refugia Water security Economic and social development Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss Sustainable Development Goals addressed: Total financing: CNY 2.213 billion Implementation period: 2016-present NbS type approaches implemented: Ecosystem restoration Ecological engineering Ecosystem-based management \u00a9Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC Map data \u00a92022 Tianditu, MNR of the PRC & NavInfo 4 1.1 General background and challenges to address The Sanggan River and the Yang River converge to form the Yongding River in Huailai County of Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, where it flows into the Guanting Reservoir, an important source of water for Beijing. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed covers an area of 280 km 2 and plays a significant role in runoff regulation and storage for flood control and disaster risk reduction. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed is also of high value for biodiversity. Based on the data collected by the Shan Shui Conservation Center and Peking University, various wildlife species have been identified and classified according to the IUCN Red List, including one critically endangered, one endangered, and seven vulnerable species. In addition, 5 first-class and 26 second-class Chinese state protected animals were identified. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed also serves as a stopover for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway. In recent decades, the watershed has faced several environmental challenges: Firstly, in the mountainous areas of the headwaters, quarrying for mining has damaged the massif and contributed to soil erosion; secondly, agricultural and domestic wastes from villages upstream of the Yongding River has caused water pollution; furthermore, in the floodplains, large areas of land have been haphazardly reclaimed for maize cultivation, resulting in severe non-point source pollution from the application of chemical fertilisers; finally, on the banks of the reservoir, riparian ecosystems have been degraded and suffer from poor integrity, connectivity, and habitat fragmentation. 1.2 Main objectives This project aims to safeguard the water security of Beijing through the holistic management of ecosystems such as rivers, streams, and wetlands in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, thereby enhancing the ecosystem services of water regulation, supply, and filtration. Moreover, the planned restoration of the riparian buffer zone can effectively reduce the risk of flooding and the damage it causes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a40b7ca7-2aa1-46c0-ac04-e02b89ff2f12": {"__data__": {"id_": "a40b7ca7-2aa1-46c0-ac04-e02b89ff2f12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7551a22c1d84acc8a15cff2ab2dcf3d0fc1706e9fd43e56f48af1d154d25604a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e97f5cb-69d2-4dc4-88bd-013ec4146b8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dc0eb2daf0be43b299ff932955dcc6ee9d516ba99a727c7918f50a9407855d1"}}, "hash": "17bbe31fc10f3a9f18c439c193165dc79ebd1c9b3b8d1f85b4f8b7781c04ac23", "text": "5 1.3 Methods Preparatory activities To reduce the threat to the ecosystems in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, pollution from 300 illegal polluters was banned at over 400 sites, including racecourses, restaurants, and farmyards.

Fig 2. Illustration of the ecological restoration project in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed (\u00a9 LCRC) Ecological restoration Rehabilitation of mining sites 30 quarries in the northern and southern mountains were closed. Vegetation restoration took place at 128 mining sites. The seven mines that remained in operation were required to fully comply with \u201cGreen Mining Standards\u201d during production [1]. Special bonds worth CNY 375 million were acquired from the local government for the management of the high-steep slope. In addition, various companies had joined forces to restore the high-steep slope. Restoring vegetation and connecting ponds Along the north bank of the reservoir and the entrance, 667 ha of grass and over 60 ha of arbors and shrubs have been planted. Over 33.3 ha of wetland ponds have been constructed to create a tree-grass-water ecosystem and improve water conservation. 6 Restoring river habitat connectivity and natural patterns The restoration of the Yang, Sanggan and Yongding Rivers led to the simultaneous restoration of the river flow. At the same time, the natural patterns of the rivers were restored using ecological engineering, vertical design and micro-topography reconstruction tools. Emphasis was placed on the spatial diversity and structural heterogeneity of the watercourses, and the original meanders, pools and shallows were identified. Fig 3. Original appearance of the mine (\u00a9 LCRC) Agricultural adaptation Some 6,667 ha of maize and other crops were converted to vineyards. This has increased financial income and reduced the use of chemicals by 2,800 tonnes [1]. Fig 4. (a) Photo of the area before restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 4. (b) Photo of the area after vegetation restoration and puddles connection engineering (\u00a9 LCRC) 7 Creation of an ecological buffer zone around the reservoir An ecological buffer zone 30-100m wide has been created around the Guanting Reservoir, consisting of wetlands reclaimed from farmland and aquaculture farms, and vegetation belts of arbors, shrubs and herbs. 7 With a total area of 20 km 2, the buffer zone effectively purifies surface runoff flowing into the reservoir. To avoid single-species selection and the introduction of alien species, moisture-resistant shrub and local arbor species were planted. Biodiversity conservation In the riparian area of the reservoir, the project makes full use of the gently sloping banks and shallow water to artificially adjusts the micro-topography thereby creating create more habitats suitable for a variety of waterfowl. Aquatic vegetation has been restored over large areas, in places where the water flow is smooth and the water level stable. Conversely, in ecologically degraded areas of tidal wetlands, different types of habitat have been created for different water birds to live, feed and breed. When creating the vegetation belts, bulbs and berries were deliberately restored to provide food sources for the birds. In addition, at the confluence of the Yang and Sanggan Rivers, the topography of the wide estuary was adjusted to increase the water area, providing habitats for various waterfowl. Artificial floating islands have been constructed in key water quality control areas to provide additional footholds for birds. Twelve wind turbines that had a negative impact on birds were phased out [1]. Fig 5. (a) Aerial photo of the riparian area before ecological buffer zone construction (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 5.

In addition to the reduction of non-point source pollution, the purification capacity of ecosystems has been strengthened, and the water quality of the Guanting Reservoir Watershed has steadily improved. Since 2019, water monitoring has shown that water quality has reached Class III, according to the national standard. Fertiliser use has been reduced by 2892.4 t/a, pesticide use by 16.45 t/a, COD by 347.46 t/a and NH3-N emission by 69.49 t/a. 8 In addition, ecological integrity and biodiversity have been enhanced. The connectivity of different reservoir ecosystems has been greatly enhanced. The ecological buffer zone functioned well to purify surface runoff. After the restoration intervention, the number of plant species increased from 106 to 318.

The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project managed to safeguard water security and reduce disaster risk by improving relevant ecosystems functions and services in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, seeking to simultaneously reverse environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, and facilitate social and economic development. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project meets the indicators in Criterion 1 focusing on the societal challenges, and effective interventions were planned and implemented. It has made an effort to increase ecosystems integrity, connectivity and resilience by restoration, addressing environmental problems by reducing pollution and removing the real estate projects and wind turbine generators that have negative impacts on birds and their habitats. Hence, the project manages to restore the vegetation, and enhance the provision off ecosystem functions and services - water supply, erosion control, sediment retention and refugia. 5b Box 1.

In fact, the project is included in the third batch of national pilot projects for ecological protection and restoration of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands, with a budgeted investment of CNY 5.366 billion and an additional CNY 2 billion in awards and subsidies from the central government [1]. The relatively fragile ecosystem of the Helan Mountains is located in a transitional zone between arid and semi-arid regions. This natural ecological fragility has been exac- erbated by extensive human disturbance, such as high intensity grazing and long- term continuous open-cut and underground mining. Following the establishment of the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, rapidly expanding populations of blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) have led to overgrazing of the local vegetation.

As a result, local mining industries and communities are shifting their livelihoods towards agroforestry and ecotourism. In addition, an increase in local species has been observed due to the restoration of grasslands from grazing and afforestation of hillsides. 2.3 Methods The project proposes to restore degraded landscapes and reduce human threats for the benefit of safety, ecology and landscape, to restore degraded ecosystems, increase the degree of wilderness, reconnect landscape patches and improve environmental connectivity to restore the overall functionality of the natural ecosystems of the Helan Mountains. Closure of mining sites In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, such remediation has been carried out on more than 150 km 2, with 122 mining sites closed and 169 human activity sites remediated inside the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, as well as 45 sites on the reserve\u2019s periphery that seriously affect the local ecology, and two concentrated coal processing plants. In addition, the policy of \u2018returning pastureland to grassland\u2019 has resulted in the restoration of natural vegetation within the protected area. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone, a total of seven mines in the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, covering 176 ha, have been withdrawn. 9,10 Fig 8.

(b) Eurasian sparrowhawk \u00a9 Petr Saj Large-scale restoration of damaged ecosystems To reduce the disaster potential of landslides and floods, measures such as geological disaster elimination, management of abandoned mines, and improvement of flood control channels have been implemented, with priority given to not blocking ecological corridors or migration channels for plants and animals. Measures such as collection of germplasm resources, expansion of rare plant species and protection of water sources have been carried out in headwater and natural areas in the local typical landscapes and mountains to achieve vertical distribution of forest vegetation. Both transplanting and domestication techniques have been carried out to maintain propagating populations of valuable and rare plant communities, including Tetraena mongolica, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Prunus mongolica, and Glycine soja. In addition, vegetation rehabilitation has been carried out according to rainfall patterns. In montane areas with more than 400 mm/yr rainfall, suitable native tree seeds were sown. In areas with 200-400 mm/yr rainfall, grasses, shrubs and trees were sown, while in areas with less than 200 mm/yr rainfall, rehabilitation focused on grasses and meadows. Enhancement of landscape connectivity and restoration of ecological corridors Restoration activities have been carried out on 5,900 ha of former mining sites. Through geomorphological reshaping, soil reconstruction and the restoration of original vegetation, natural ecosystems and habitats have been regenerated, enlarged and corridors widened with the aim of restoring a systematic and complete food web, while providing a suitable habitat for valuable and rare wildlife, such as the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Great Bustard (Otis tarda), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and other top predators that may be reintroduced in the future, including the Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia). 15 2.4 Outcomes Gradual restoration of degraded ecosystems in the Helan Mountains The regional vegetation has shown an overall growth trend, with the forest cover of the reserve increasing by 1% and the total vegetation cover increasing by 20%, while the forest communities within the reserve are in positive succession. In addition, as a result of the restoration work, the area of scrub now exceeds that of 1964, with the majority of species being nationally protected plants. Amygdalus mongolica, a second class state protected plant, has also reappeared following the restoration of the pastures. 11 Increased biodiversity and carbon sequestration Monitoring data has shown that the restoration measures, including mountain closure and grazing management, have stimulated plant growth and renewal, resulting in a significant increase in plant and animal populations.

Case 2 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, since the Helan Mountains are located in the Yellow River Basin, and the dividing line between the three deserts of Tengger, Mu Us and Ulan Buh at the same time, the project therefore focuses on reducing disaster risk especially to prevent desertification, and safeguard water security. In addition, the relevant restoration interventions can contribute to reverse environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project has adequate matches to the indicators in Criterion 1 in terms of clearly understanding the societal challenges, effective interventions were planned and implemented, and seek to conserve biodiversity (Criterion 3). The project also made an effort to safeguard stakeholder interests through livelihood transformation (Criterion 6) and promote the experience of rewilding (Criterion 8). Hence, the project manages to restore the vegetation, thus enhance the ecosystem functions and services of disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention and refugia. 18 The project has advantages in terms of identifying and responding to societal challenges, managing to safeguard stakeholder benefits, but some aspects can be improved in accordance with NbS Standard. The Helan Mountains locate across two provinces, thus, a provincial trans-boundary mechanism should be established between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia to strength the cooperation with regard to the project in the area of Helan Mountains, in order to improve the synergy and monitoring of the interventions (Criterion 5). Moreover, the project should develop an effective adaptation strategy and a strategy for long-term management (Criterion 7). 9 Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve Management Burea (2017).

A total of 464 tracheophyte species were identified in Fuxian Lake National Wetland Park and surrounding areas. During monitoring between 2017 and 2019, 32 fish species were recorded [1]. Located on a unique low-latitude plateau, Fuxian Lake has a less dynamic water flow, with a modelled water exchange cycle of more than 200 years, which inherently increases the fragility of the ecosystem; once polluted, the lake is extremely difficult to recover. In 2002, a large area of cyanobacteria bloomed in Fuxian Lake, causing the water quality to drop from Grade I to II. Xingyun Lake, which is part of the Fuxian Lake Watershed, has also experienced frequent cyanobacteria blooms, resulting in severely polluted water quality as high as Grade V. The Yunnan provincial government has long attached great importance to protecting the ecology of Fuxian Lake and has made unremitting efforts to do so. In 2017, the Fuxian Lake Watershed Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project was included in the second batch of the Shan-shui Initiative, with a total investment of CNY 9.728 billion, of which CNY 2 billion was provided by the central financial authorities. 21 Human activities such as mining and upland farming have led to a decline in vegetation cover in the local mountain areas, as well as phosphate pollution and soil erosion. In addition, high water and fertiliser consumption has led to serious agricultural non-point source pollution. In particular, fish ponds, farmland and other land uses occupy the lakeshore buffer zone, weakening the filtering function of the wetlands. In addition, invasive species and the negative impact of human activities on natural spawning grounds have led to the depletion of native fish stocks in Fuxian Lake, threatening its biodiversity. Fig 12. Diagram of lake ecosystem cycle \u00a9 Wetland Planning Project Team 3.2 Main objectives The project aims to ensure water security through the structural adjustment of agriculture, the preservation of trees and shrubs in riparian buffer zones, and the construction of an ecological purification zone. These approaches can enhance the ecosystem services of water regulation, supply and purification, while reducing disaster risk. 3.3 Methods The Fuxian Lake Watershed Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project focuses its efforts on the entire basin. Some projects have been carried out to optimise the ecological and agricultural landscape and the spatial layout of the basin, including the relocation of industrial and mining enterprises, the closure of livestock and poultry farms, the construction of sewage networks and treatment plants, and the control of pollution in the rivers. 22 Forest restoration and expansion To strengthen soil and water conservation in montane areas, action has been taken on three fronts: 1. Returning farmland to forest: By matching sites with native tree species 2,700 ha of farmland has been returned to forest. 2. Combating desertification: Efforts have been made to restore and manage the 4,202.1 ha of stone desertification areas, including the planting of environmentally resilient crops with economic value, such as honeysuckle. 3. Ecological rehabilitation of mines: The main types of mines in the basin are phosphorite, clay brick quarry, limestone quarry, etc. The ecology of 400 ha of abandoned mines has been restored. Recognising that the main source of pollution is surface runoff in particular soil pollutants containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and non-point source pollution from agriculture - measures and actions are being taken across mountains, dams, lake shores and water bodies. These include forest restoration and expansion, water pollution prevention and control, and pollution filtration, protection and treatment. 12 Fig 13. Distribution of the four conservation and restoration management units, and 41 sub-projects (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 14. Process of forest restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 23 Structural adjustment of agriculture To effectively reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution, adjustments in agricultural practices have been made in the Fuxian Lake catchment area, such as fallow crop rotation and planting of blueberry, pyrethrum, vetiver or other crops requiring less chemical treatment, as well as rice, lotus root and other aquatic crops with wetland purification effects. As a result, it is estimated that 4,500 and 700 tonnes of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively have been reduced each year (reductions of 78.9% and 63.6% respectively).

Fig 15. Ecological buffer zone (\u00a9 LCRC) 24 Water purification project around the lake Three sub-projects were implemented: the construction of ecological, water-permeable purification zones around the lake (consisting of green belts and gravel beds), water purification of ditches flowing into the lake, and water purification of estuaries flowing into rivers. Estuary wetland and riparian zone enhancement project Trees, shrubs and other plants in the buffer zone are maintained and replanted on a daily basis. Aquatic plants are also harvested. Conservation and management of the lake Research shows that from 1983 to 2015, the number of native fish species decreased by 44%, while the number of exotic fish species increased by 167% [2]. Therefore, the conservation and management of Fuxian Lake mainly focuses on habitat protection and artificial release of native fish species. Specifically: 1. Protecting submerged aquatic vegetation and restoring degraded habitats with native submerged aquatic vegetation. 2. Adding rubble and gravel to the lake to simulate fish habitats and restore sediment. 3. Protection of fish spawning outlets in karst caves and restoration of damaged sediment. 4. Release ~1 million white fish per year into a 5 km 2 small water area delineated by purse seines and buoys within the National Aquatic Germplasm Resource Conservation Area for Endemic Fish in Fuxian Lake. 3.4 Outcomes Reducing ecological risks and reversing ecosystem degradation From 2016 to the first half of 2020, the water quality of Fuxian Lake remained stable at the Grade I level. The total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, permanganate, chlorophyll A and eutrophication indices of Fuxian Lake decreased by 19%, 41%, 13%, 60% and 4% respectively, while transparency and dissolved oxygen increased by 19% and 7% respectively. In addition, the water quality compliance rate remained at 100% at both national and provincial monitoring stations. In total, 74 km 2 of forest were restored and soil erosion was controlled on 6.73 km 2. Overall, the forest cover in the Fuxian Lake Watershed increased from 34.95% to 39.25%, and the corresponding for- est stock increased by 39% [3]. 25 Biodiversity restoration Surveys and statistics have shown that the number of emergent plant species in Fuxian Lake has increased to 12, while the seasonal white fish fishery has resumed for the first time in more than 20 years [3]. The basin has also become a permanent habitat and wintering ground for a wide range of birds and other wildlife. In particular, in March 2019, 25 endangered Plegadis falcinellus, which is listed as a second class state protected animal, were observed there. Fig 16. Glossy Ibis \u00a9 Jan Veber Balanced, greener, and higher quality development Strictly following the agricultural planning development and planting standards, green, ecological and circular agriculture with plateau characteristics has been developed, using fertiliser-, pesticide- and water-saving crops such as lotus root, blueberry, rice, wheat, rapeseed and so on. In addition, industrial and mining enterprises have all moved out of the Fuxian Lake outflow areas, and eco-cultural tourism has been developed in their place. 13 3.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS Box 3.

Ulansuhai is the eighth largest freshwater lake in China and the largest functional wetland in the Yellow River Basin - a rare formation for desert or semi-desert areas. It is located at the intersection of two of the world\u2019s eight major bird migration routes, one from South and Southwest Asia to Central Asia and the other from Southeast Asia to Australia. As a key part of the \u201cNorthern Sand Prevention Belt\u201d in China\u2019s \u201cTwo Barriers and Three Belts\u201d strategic ecological security system, the basin has the important functions of ensuring water security along the Yellow River, conserving biodiversity and regulating regional climate. In addition, as one of China\u2019s three major agricultural areas, the Hetao Plain is an important production base for crops and oils, and plays a critical role in en- suring the country\u2019s food security. Accordingly, the Ulansuhai Lake Watershed comprises the largest area for both agricultural water use and natural purification along the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River. Irrigation water ultimate- ly flows into Ulansuhai, which acts as a natural purifier before being discharged into the Yellow River. Regional water quality and ecosystem functions have been gradually deteriorating since the 1980s, posing a serious threat to the Yellow River\u2019s water security. From 2005 to 2014, the water quality of the lake area remained at the lower Grade V. Specifically, water pollution peaked in 2008, and there was once a widespread outbreak of xanthophyceae in the region. More recently, both the provincial and municipal governments have promoted the transformation of agriculture and livestock farming in the basin into landscapes of conservation and restoration through a national approach known as \u2018Integrated Management of Mountains, Rivers, Forests, Farmlands, Lakes, Grasslands and Deserts\u2019. In 2018, the Ulansuhai Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project was included in the third batch of National Pilot Projects of the Shan-shui Initiative, with a total investment of CNY 5.746 billion, of which CNY 2 billion was invested by the central government.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7af930e5-8ad5-4d4c-bd0d-55d47097d43d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7af930e5-8ad5-4d4c-bd0d-55d47097d43d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29ac11b3c37386abb1341a0907360752c505ccb0461a5bd77ded630d954fdd5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e12da63b-2a47-4aa3-a1c9-db7a1228244b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a1c2f342fcebf38d4841257677b842265de307ba39cc86e682b4c78ee9d8c41"}}, "hash": "03f5384bfc82ffd305b06d9655852e5882ca3782bdb36ba719efa7d59952ac82", "text": "14 29 Human activities, including over-farming, overgrazing, wetland reclamation, mining, and discharge of industrial, municipal and agricultural effluents, have caused serious ecological and environmental problems in the basin, such as desertification, grassland degradation, soil erosion, soil salinisation, water quality degradation, biodiversity loss, and fundamental damage to the basin\u2019s structures and functions.

(b) Photo of the area after desertification control (\u00a9 LCRC) Comprehensive farmland management in Hetao Plain A multi-faceted approach was taken to address several issues, including non-point source pollution and farmland salinisation. From one perspective, sludge dredging, the establishment of a multi-pond purification system, ecological revetment, the construction of ecological floating islands and ecological water replenishment were used to improve water quality and reduce pollutant inputs. From another perspective, the use of chemicals, water and film on agricultural land was controlled as part of a comprehensive saline soil management programme. Wulashan ecological conservation and restoration In order to address the outstanding environmental problems at the Wulashan mine, such as soil erosion and degradation of forest and grassland vegetation, various geological environment, disaster recovery and vegetation restoration measures have been taken to improve the geological and geomorphological conditions of the damaged massif and the water retention capacity. 31 Fig 19. Process of Alaben grassland reastoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Conservation and restoration of the Alaben grassland In order to combat the accelerated degradation of grasslands, desertification, soil erosion, etc., measures have been taken such as grass sowing, in addition to closure and grazing bans, with a combination of natural and artificial approaches for water conservation, vegetation restoration, reduction of pollutant and sediment inflow, windbreak and sand prevention. Management of the Ulansuhai ecological protection belt To address the degradation of Ulansuhai, a water conservation forest has been planted by the lake, grass seeds have been sown in the ecologically fragile areas of fixed and semi-fixed dunes, bird breeding areas have been created, wetland restoration and construction has been carried out in the estuary, and water conveyance channels have been opened to restore connectivity in areas where reeds are dense. Conservation and restoration of the Ulansuhai aquatic ecosystem To address the problems of severe pollution and water surface shrinkage, ventilation and water flow were facilitated in Ulansuhai to improve storage and self-purification capacity. Other measures included the harvesting and utilisation of reeds and underwater plants, the establishment of three-dimensional aquaculture in the lake area, the removal of nutrients from the lake body through a nature-based aquaculture food chain, the establishment of no-fishing areas, etc. 32 Fig 20.

(b) Aerial photo of the riparian area after ecological protection belt management (\u00a9 LCRC) Promoting eco-friendly development The resources for green agriculture in the basin provide the greatest advantage for eco-friendly development, so the local government has made considerable efforts to establish services for green, organic, high-end agriculture, as well as the development of renewable energy, digital economy, eco-tourism and eco-aquaculture. Mobilising private sector to develop new financing mechanisms The project followed the DBFOT (design, build, finance, operate and transfer) approach to facilitate market-based financing, project management and operation. Specifically, a company was empowered to act as a financing platform on behalf of the Bayannur Municipality, with open bidding for project investment, development, operation and financial management.

To date, a total of CNY 3.969 billion has been invested in this project, including CNY 500 million from the central government, CNY 2.403 billion from all levels of provincial and local public budgets, and CNY 1.066 billion from other sources. To explore new opportunities in the private sector, several representatives of the financial sector formed a partnership, the Qiandao Lake Water Fund, which includes the Alibaba Foundation, Minsheng Tonghui Foundation, Wanxiang Trust and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), as the county sought to synergize public funding, private investment and World Bank loans. The lake faces several challenges. In particular, non-point source (NPS) pollution caused by inappropriate agricultural practices and the overuse of pesticides and fertilisers are the main threats to the water quality of Qiandao Lake. The invasion of pests such as Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is also affecting the biodiversity of the local forests. Housing, resorts and other tourist developments near the lake have also led to habitat loss and threatened the ecological safety of the lake. 37 5.2 Main objectives The project aims to ensure water security and maintain ecosystem stability through ecological restoration of wetlands, riparian areas and forests, while rehabilitating abandoned mines. These efforts have improved the provision of ecosystem services such as water regulation, supply and filtration. In addition, the local industrial and mineral industry is being restructured towards agroforestry and ecotourism, reducing pollution and the risk of geological disasters. 5.3 Methods The project has been implemented throughout the Qiandao Lake Watershed (landscape scale), targeting the control of inflow pollution, restoration of forest ecosystems and ecological management in mining areas, as well as ecological improvement, green agriculture and spatial optimisation of the basin. 15 Fig 22. Site location map (\u00a9 LCRC) 38 Fig 23. Riparian restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Spatial planning and management Measures were implemented to strictly follow a zoning-based approach to ecosystem functions, including the establishment of a dedicated natural landscape planning in and around the lakeshore, and the introduction of regulations on lakeshore development and construction. Specifically, a 20m radius from the shore was designated as a no-development zone, while a 20-100m radius was designated as a strict management zone. The project also aimed to improve local water quality by assessing the source and distribution pattern of NPS pollutants in the basin, and identifying the extent of priority management areas and ecological measures for water quality control. Pollution control The water quality of Qiandao Lake has deteriorated over the past three years, with total nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the surface water exceeding standards and maintaining an average mesotrophic water quality. Following an ecological approach to river management, some of the traditional, impermeable, hardened watercourses were replaced with natural, appropriate riparian and lakeshore vegetation. In addition, activities such as revetment construction and dredging were carried out to create ecological corridors and restore river biodiversity. 39 Forest ecosystem restoration Conservation and enhancement work was carried out by implementing activities such as logging bans, afforestation and reforestation, forest maintenance, closing access to hillsides to facilitate regeneration, improving deciduous forest stand structure and diversity to maintain a healthy ecosystem status. For the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases, efforts were made to control Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, remove dead or infected wood and pine, and other tasks to ensure healthier forests. With regard to vegetation restoration and reforestation, measures have been taken to improve stand structure and to establish stands of aesthetic value (e.g. with colourful foliage or valuable species) through afforestation, direct replanting, etc. on barren hills and wasteland. Environmental management of mining sites Control of geological hazards: Investigations of potential hazards and other erosion control measures have been carried out, such as restoring vegetation on barren mountains and mitigating geological hazards and flooding along road sections. Ecological environment management: Efforts were made to rehabilitate and manage 33 abandoned mines and tailings ponds by planting resilient plant species with well-developed root systems capable of surviving extensive management, such as Rosa rugosa, Cynodon dactylon, Lespedeza formosa and Halocnemum strobilaceum.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15c27aa7-5d63-456c-8d30-5b3fdcb2c3f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "15c27aa7-5d63-456c-8d30-5b3fdcb2c3f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "817f77541fc2a5239a614f2f84ca8091ca68169a670564a01e1cf4580813a8ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb5e2568-d270-4784-8162-013b8d392dcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9429693f32067702dd71447163a01de384e98ee9804d27214231e85d0d0c1f32"}}, "hash": "556d8ea6df06ff06d76ea7fc0408a2f01626900a4fa1ca3cf4958a72e1a3c419", "text": "New financing and co-management mechanisms For NPS pollution control, the innovative management and financing Qiandao Lake Water Fund was established with a intial fund of CNY 10 million from Alibaba and Minsheng Tonghui Foundations, and technical support from TNC.

This voluntary, restrictive technique implements nature-based approaches in an agricultural and residential setting by addressing multiple aspects of the natural environment, including land use (building geologically appropriate houses without altering landforms), vegetation (protecting sacred forests, conserving water, and regulating climate), and water resources (maintaining water intakes and ponds,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb32dc46-c7df-4f8e-abe6-1aaf5f936147": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb32dc46-c7df-4f8e-abe6-1aaf5f936147", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afe1ae2580e30f34d96326a37948ea849b9e662ccdaa5755f748cd2bee39e830"}, "3": {"node_id": "73e3d7a4-4ca7-453f-9168-8a5e4d9fc16c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4639d4f8dcd9c7d5895bb7fb360eec801b7b4dc0c068d2b92aac3178abf25ad2"}}, "hash": "c5ad6793df757739ecac6c51599ea25c155861f92eb113387ba8916d66c14370", "text": "and storing water in buildings). Recently, as industrialisation and urbanisation have intensified, there has been a significant out-migration of local populations and a gradual decline in traditional rural communities across China. Xunjiansi\u2019s long-established model of self-sufficiency and traditional agricultural landscape has also faded. In light of this phenomenon, Professor Yu Kongjian from Peking University has been leading a team experimenting with a nature-based lifestyle in Xunjiansi since 2015, called the \u201cWangshan Lifestyle\u201d. The Wangshan lifestyle, which means \u201cmountain view\u201d in Chinese, is one in which can \u201ctruly enjoy the moments of being close to mountains, water and home\u201d. It is an attempt to explore ways to achieve sustainable rural development, a high quality of life and a path towards a vision where \u201cclear waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets\u201d. The primary objective is to further promote revitalising practices in rural areas through the development of green livelihoods and lifestyles. 45 To date, the implementation of the Wangshan Lifestyle in Xunjiansi has been successful through the combined establishment of housing, eco-farming, tourism, research, and cultural practices. Local natural resources are being better protected and used more efficiently, while once desolate and abandoned rural communities are becoming prosperous, supporting the application of NbS to China\u2019s rural revitalisation strategy. As is typical throughout China, the village of Xunjiansi was facing several challenges, such as the channeling and hardening of rivers, the excessive use of chemicals, stagnant development, and low local incomes. In addition, a large number of young and middle-aged residents had emigrated, resulting in an abundance of abandoned land, dilapidated housing, weakened community infrastructure and facilities, and a decline in cultural education. Local landscapes and heritage were ineffectively protected, resulting in the gradual disappearance of the villagers' sense of identity and belonging. 6.2 Main objectives This project aims to reduce regional disaster risk while ensuring food and water security by revitalising the village through smart hydraulic systems and more sustainable agricultural practices. The project strengthens ecosystem services related to water supply through improved filtration and reuse on the field. Such healthy and environmentally friendly recirculation systems will allow local villagers to live and farm in a more ecologically sustainable way, while preserving the village\u2019s indigenous characteristics.

Rural art in the village (\u00a9 LCRC) 46 6.3 Methods Based on a systematic assessment of the natural and cultural baseline, a comprehensive project design was developed in terms of spatial planning for agriculture, housing and conservation, proposing measures for eco-farming, research and education. A novel strategy has been designed to address urban-rural interactions, as well as the production and provision of ecosystem services, to ensure their security, integrity and abundance for human well-being, to lead people to rethink the value of ecosystems, and to achieve a harmonious coexistence with nature alongside the co-prosperity of urban and rural areas. Fig 28. Spatial plan of Xunjiansi Village (\u00a9 LCRC) Creating a sponge landscape and improving ecological infrastructure As a first step, measures have been taken to protect and restore the old water conservation systems (Fig. 28). These small-scale systems can conserve water resources and natural run-off patterns, assist with groundwater recharge, rainwater and wastewater purification, flood regulation and storage, as well as meeting daily water production needs. Fig 29. (a) Photo of the area before river management (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 29. (b) Photo of the area after water conservancy (\u00a9 LCRC) 47 Secondly, efforts have been made to reduce the channelling and hardening of rivers, preserve natural watercourses, maintain aquatic habitats, reduce NPS pollution and recharge groundwater supplies. Thirdly, the project included conservation and restoration efforts of the inlet and its respective forests at the intersection of the village\u2019s water systems. Preserving the inlet and its surrounding forests could help regulate the local microclimate, while contributing to the capacity for soil and water conservation, wind protection and sand fixation. Reviving traditional farming practices Eco-farming in Xunjiansi revived traditional farming practices to restore soil fertility through fallow, crop rotation and straw mulching.

Site research and study event (\u00a9 LCRC) 48 6.4 Outcomes Enhanced ecosystem services The Wangshan Lifestyle explored conservation options, improved local ecosystems and promoted the construction of a sponge city. These activities played an important role in improving the structures and functions of hydrological ecosystems to enhance the ecosystem service of water regulation, thereby addressing the water issue in a comprehensive, systematic and sustainable manner. Significant increase in community development and income A mechanism for the rural revitalization of local communities has been sought through a sustainable model, without absolute reliance on public finance. Firstly, local per capita income in Xunjiansi village has increased by 71% from 2015 to 2021. Second, high-quality agricultural products with higher prices have been developed. For example, black tea was originally produced with chemical fertilizers and pesticides and sold for ~ CNY 100 kg -1. After upgrading to organic, safe and traceable tea with local branding, the price has risen to CNY 4,000 kg -1. Third, eco-cultural tourism is booming. In 2015, few artists came to the village for inspiration, but recently the village has seen a growing number of local homestays and visitors. Cultural heritage protection Tangible and intangible cultural heritage has been systematically protected. Residents have gradually realised the value of local ecosystems, culture and landscapes, and have developed a stronger sense of belonging and identity with their homeland. Villagers are more aware of how \u201cclear waters and lush mountains\u201d can become \u201cinvaluable assets\u201d, while understanding and adopting a sustainable lifestyle that depends on healthy natural ecosystems.

(a) Photo of the area before interventions (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 33. (b) Photo of the area after customary renovation (\u00a9 LCRC) After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project succeeded in ensuring water security and reducing disaster risk by improving relevant ecosystem functions and services in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, while reversing environmental degradation and biodiversity loss and facilitating social and economic development. Box 6. Case 6 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9 Juntao Hu 50 This project and approach has promoted the localisation of NbS in China, while providing experience and references for rural development and revitalisation. It provides a successful example of promoting green livelihoods and lifestyles in rural communities, establishing healthy relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being by creating a sustainable and replicable model. After comparing with the criteria of the NbS Global Standard through self-assessment, we summarise the areas that are strongly related to the Standard and the areas for improvement of the case, which may be considered for referral to practitioners. In this case, the project has a clear objective to address the societal challenges of disaster risk reduction and economic and social development. During the planning and design phase, the design team conducted in-depth interviews in Xunjiansi village and identified the villagers\u2019 suffering from flooding, low incomes, labour shortages and a weak sense of belonging. To improve the living environment and revitalise the village, the team ensured that the provision of ecosystem services such as water regulation, erosion control, sediment retention, food production, recreation and culture were enhanced to achieve the design objectives. According to the Standard, the project adequately addresses the indicators in Criterion 1 in terms of understanding the societal challenges facing the village and the rights holders and beneficiaries. The design team fully respected the local lifestyle and culture and clarified the villagers\u2019 needs. The designers listened to the communities and promoted their restoration activities to the local villagers (Criterion 6). It is also noteworthy that the project included the development of both economic feasibility and adaptive management mechanisms. The village of Xunjiansi created a multi-county tour, research study and cultural innovation activities to monitor and evaluate the long-term NbS effect, to keep learning and improving, and most importantly, the mechanisms provided strong assurance of sustainable income to support the village (this is reflected in the assessment of Criterion 4 & 7).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0185f069-4daf-4a5d-9faa-54667759b70a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0185f069-4daf-4a5d-9faa-54667759b70a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6621e240c54d0ce3d9596b2671474ae18acbc6ca31f04ea0a12619f2bb6eff3"}, "2": {"node_id": "b63bb39b-9cf9-4078-8024-9b597e4de9c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2523c571b015ffab0b0b316686b3430ced80577405dfb928bfd1ab959ebfdc3c"}}, "hash": "52808386c73c3c2657ef65b2fca9d35042420a0bcaaa876172661ec0e712af0c", "text": "51 Although case 6, as a rural regeneration project, meets most of the criteria of the NbS standard, it still needs to pay more attention to biodiversity aspects (Criterion 3).

For example, NbS have been adopted in the EU and the US and have been effectively researched in areas such as sustainable agriculture, which focuses on holistic planning and design; climate-smart agriculture, which supports adaptation to climate change; carbon farming, which aims to sequester carbon in the atmosphere; and regenerative agriculture, which responds to the problems of modern agriculture. One of the world\u2019s three major black soil belts - the black soil of Northeast China - is mainly found in the Liaohe, Songnen, and Sanjiang plains. Natural black soils develop organically on the gravel and clay layers of the Tertiary-Quaternary-Pleistocene or Holocene, while the region\u2019s unique climate, hydrological conditions, and vegetation types have laid the foundation for the ac- cumulation of organic matter, forming a deep and fertile black soil layer. 17 The formation and development of black soils are extremely slow, taking on av- erage ~200-600 years for each 1cm of black soil to form, and is therefore con- sidered an extremely scarce resource. 18 The black soils in this particular region are some of the most fertile in the world, characterized by high carbon content, porosity, and ploughability. They are used as a major base for commodity grain production in China, covering 36 million hectares, or a quarter of the country\u2019s total arable land, making the black soil region a critical and central part of ensuring national food security. 19 However, traditional plowing techniques destroy the protective layer of straw on the surface and alter soil microorganisms and animal communities, in addition to deteriorating the ecological and productive functions of the soil. Therefore, to protect soil ecology and productivity, China has widely adopted a sustainable agricultural NbS method developed, practiced, and promoted by the China Agricultural University (CAU) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), known as the \u201cLishu model\u201d. 54 Due to years of intensive farming and excessive nutrient inputs, the black soils are now subject to severe wind and water erosion, significant amounts of dust are released into the air during spring ploughing and a significant amount of topsoil, which is essential for agriculture, is lost. In areas of high gully erosion, gullies are cut and torn into the land, causing a range of problems including thinning of the topsoil layer, significant reduction in topsoil organic matter and deterioration of soil structure and function. The result is a serious threat to the sustainable health of black soils and thus to national food security. 20 7.2 Main objectives This project aims to safeguard food security by implementing conservation tillage to recover and conserve black soil, which has come to be known as the panda of farmland. a b c d Fig 35.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bba1a38-d8c4-4387-9347-0450f1412827": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bba1a38-d8c4-4387-9347-0450f1412827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6012200c596269c830fd503d8b69fcac13313fab4570e0061db5c12ce64d6c36"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a22ad81-e9af-439a-be61-393e27c09fab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92c90067d61c234f15d9134a0b0ef523edf097c7f5a96b5f1aed624bfba2af95"}}, "hash": "bb0dccbebfaf2f8918e2d9a6ada5a91a8ffccd7319cb243235a208fb987c6aba", "text": "a b c d Fig 35.

In addition, short periods of heavy rainfall in summer can easily generate run-off on hills and gentle slopes, washing away surface soils and creating more gullies that fragment farmland or severely damage the ecosystem, which are the main causes of black soil degradation. Layers of mulched straw, on the other hand, act like a blanket covering the soil, effectively reducing wind and water erosion, limiting run-off and reducing the formation and development of gullies. It is also favourable to the treatment of erosion gullies. Compared to conventional farming practices, conservation tillage can reduce runoff by an average of 60% and soil loss by about 80%. 21 7.3 Methods After more than a decade of research, scientists and researchers from CAU, CAS and other institutions have developed a maize straw mulching cultivation technique (i.e. the \u201cLishu Model\u201d) based on local conditions. With maize straw mulching as the core process, this intervention involves integrated mechanisation of direct seeding, fertilisation, weeding, disease prevention and harvesting processes to effectively protect topsoils and address the key issues of soil degradation caused by maize straw removal on regional black soils. Accordingly, a combination of straw-based mulching methods was used to achieve multiple benefits, including soil protection, water conservation, resistance to erosion, drought and soil hardening. Overall, the system is simple to operate, cost effective and has great potential to increase yields. Stable and high yields Composting straw results in increased organic matter content and organism health, improved soil structure and higher fertiliser utilisation rates. The combination of these favourable factors can lead to stable and high yields, especially in relatively dry years. In fact, the results of a field trial in Gaojia Village of Lishu Town over more than 10 yrs show that the average yield under the Lishu model was 5-10% higher than that of control groups. 21 Biodiversity conservation Known as an \u201cecosystem engineer\u201d, the earthworm is a consumer, decomposer and regulator in the ecosystem, playing an essential role in improving soil structure, water retention and air permeability, while decomposing soil organic matter, allowing more efficient conversion of soil nutrients and generating more nutrients available for plant growth. Earthworms and worm castings provide a desirable substrate amendment for the growth and reproduction of micro-organisms and soil microbes. Additionally, straw mulching has a significant impact on the number and weight of earthworms, reaching 114 individuals\u00b7m -2 and 18.03 g\u00b7m -2 in this project; whereas the quantity of earthworms per square meter, in the conventional ridge tillage and no-tillage, no-mulching practices were 15 and 19, respectively (without any significant difference in weight). 21 Accordingly, the density of earthworms in the straw-covered field was six times higher than in the conventional ridge and furrow field, which is likely to be a major factor in the observed improvement in soil biological properties. Straw mulching also provides shelter and food for wildlife such as game birds and small mammals, thereby increasing biodiversity. Cost-effectiveness and emissions reduction In the Lishu Model, the completion of a single no-tillage seeder operation, rather than \u2265 2 repeated operations as required in conventional practices, means that fewer machines or man hours are required, or that area coverage could be enhanced within the same amount of time or under lower labor intensity, providing cost-effective options on both operation and production sides. In addition to saving CNY 1,000\u20131,400 \u00b7ha -1, it also reduces the power of agricultural machinery by 15\u201320%, energy consumption by 25\u201330%, and it effectively reduces carbon emissions. 21 56 57 7.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly.

This case is unique among all case studies, given that this research practice it aims at conserving the critical resource of black soil, through regenerative agriculture. The findings provide theoretical basis for the application of no-till practices and understanding how to rebuild soil sustainability in the northeast of China.

It pays particular attention to methods that can help a waterfront city adapt to climate change, sustain economic and social development, and ensure human health. 8.3 Methods Over a large scale, the project ensures the connectivity of the ecological network; whereas across smaller scales, measures were taken to improve the ecological infrastructure, create blue and green ecological spaces, and explore techniques to realize the value of ecological products through urban micro-regeneration. Fig 36. Natural landscape map of Chongqing central districts (\u00a9 LCRC) 62 Strengthening planning and regulation to conserve and restore important ecological space Greater efforts are needed to limit the role of the \u2018Three Lines\u2019 (namely the Ecological Conservation Red Lines, the Permanent Basic Farmland, and the Urban Growth Boundaries developed by the Territory Development Plan) in preserving and enhancing important nature reserves and urban eco-spaces. The Jinyun Mountain Nature Reserve, located on the banks of the Jialing River, is a natural ecological barrier to the centre of Chongqing; however, villagers liv- ing within the reserve have been engaged in unsustainable resource extraction. In June 2018, several measures were taken to address these issues, including the demolition of illegally constructed infrastructure to restore green spaces, the reclamation of mining areas, and the sustainable management of lakes and reservoirs. As a result, the Jinyun Mountains have been restored to their \u201cgreen lung\u201d and natural barrier status. Fig 37.

In turn, the island\u2019s natural habitat was restored, preserving Chongqing\u2019s unique ecological landscape. Fig 38. (a) Aerial photo of Guangyang Islet 63 Fig 38.

New development land for business purposes will not be approved until land quotas have been purchased to create market demand; while idle and abandoned development land in rural areas, nature reserves and other areas with important ecological functions must be reclaimed as qualified farmland, forest or grassland before land quotas are issued and economic value is generated through market transactions. 2) Forest Cover Quota Trading Mechanisms. As forest cover is a compulsory target, areas that do not meet the target are allowed to purchase quotas from compliant areas. 65 3) Horizontal Ecological Compensation Mechanism. Districts or counties from upper and lower reaches signed agreements for a two-way compensation system based on the water quality at the river confluence to improve the ecological environment of the downstream areas and increase the fiscal revenues of the upstream areas. 8.4 Outcomes Improvement of ecological benefits through increasing biodiversity There has been a significant increase in biodiversity thanks to ecological restoration efforts, which have been tailored to each ecosystem and have been implemented accordingly. In total, 22 national wetland parks have been established in Chongqing, and the protected wetlands cover an area of 207,200 ha, recording 563 species of vertebrates and 707 species of higher plants. Generation of social benefits through improved urban ecological landscapes As part of efforts to restore urban ecology, 1,263 urban parks (total area 15,834.55 ha) have been built, 45% of which are located in central districts, covering 7,142 ha. From 2018 to 2020, 92 community sports and cultural parks will be built on the undeveloped urban areas to meet the leisure and exercise needs of nearly 3.5 million residents. From 2019 to 2020, 1,198.9 ha of green spaces were added on slopes and precipices in central districts. Enhanced economic benefits through natural capital gains in urban and rural areas From 2018 to 2021, the city traded 286 ha of reclaimed land through the land quota trading mechanism, with a total trade turnover of CNY 801 million [1]. In March 2019, Jiangbei District and Youyang County signed the country\u2019s first horizontal ecological compensation agreement to improve forest cover, with the former paying the latter CNY 187.5 million for a quota of 5,000 ha of forested land. As of January 2021, the city has traded a total of 12,800 ha of forest cover quo- tas through the trading mechanism, with a total trading volume of CNY 480 mil- lion [2]. By the end of 2019, Chongqing has established the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism for 19 secondary rivers with a watershed area of \u2265 500 km 2 and covering \u2265 2 districts and counties, with a total compensation fund of CNY 96.918 million. 66 8.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. This case is unique among all case studies since it is a city regeneration project, with some ecological restoration, conservation and sustainable management. The project aims to reconstruct the relationship between human and nature, reducing disaster risk and safeguard water security. It has enhanced ecosystem functions and services of climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention, refugia and recreation.

The city is rich in natural resources and has three important marine ecosystems - mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs - with rich biodiversity, ecosystem services and high research value. Beihai Binhai National Wetland Park is a typical example of a \u2018freshwater- estuary-coastal\u2019 complex wetland ecosystem, and serve as the central \u2018green lungs\u2019 and core green corridor of the city. The wetland park contains nine spe- cies of mangrove resources under national protection, 17 species of endangered flora and fauna, and 86 species and 38 species of migratory birds jointly protect- ed by Sino-Japan and Sino-Australia [1]. Beihai is characterised by a subtropical marine monsoon climate influenced by monsoon circulation and complex meteorological systems. Various types of meteorological disasters, such as droughts, floods and typhoons, occur simultaneously or in succession, seriously threatening local economic and environmental security, as well as people\u2019s lives and property. 23,24 The rapid development of urbanisation, coastal industrialisation, aquaculture and tourism has created a number of problems in this region. Sewage discharges are a continuous source of pollution and increased siltation in many parts of the waters. 25-27 Coastal wetland ecosystems have been degraded, natural shorelines disconnected, mangrove areas reduced, biodiversity lost, and urban flooding increased. In response, the Beihai Municipal Government has implemented a land-sea coordinated pollution control and ecological restoration programme based on the principle of urban development through ecological approaches. 9.2 Main objectives The project aims to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, while proposing to reduce vulnerability and disaster risk through the restoration of mangrove ecosystems and coastal wetlands. It has also promoted the construction of sponge cities to improve water storage capacity to combat urban waterlogging. 69 9.3 Methods While targeting water pollution control and sponge city development, ecological restoration has been carried out according to the characteristics of coastal ecosystems, local conditions and spatial design. Efforts have also been made to promote eco-tourism and eco-product development. Fig 39. Spatial layout of the ecological restoration activities (\u00a9 LCRC) Sponge city construction Effective control, natural storage, infiltration and purification of surface runoff was achieved by exploiting the role of ecosystems in absorbing, storing and releasing rainwater, thereby reducing urban flooding. Firstly, both engineering (construction of infiltration, storage, retention, harvesting, treatment and discharge facilities) and natural measures (such as green belts or stormwater regulation and treatment ponds) were used to increase the city\u2019s flood control, drainage and water supply capacity, improve the urban environment and create a healthier water cycle. Secondly, measures have been taken to protect natural aquatic environments such as rivers and lakes, to link water systems and to maintain the water storage function of the city itself.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "724fedad-6de6-4bed-9e49-ae908003f63e": {"__data__": {"id_": "724fedad-6de6-4bed-9e49-ae908003f63e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f849b55c1154756bd5b8acfe12e5259c3ad34947f1c7ab29a22b2c8d27e70a5c"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d54e51e-2d23-4f3a-b9ef-c67838512ed6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d92e34c0eb89a5450291d91dca42e4f0a20579109182c1c35b6cdeb8d39fa48"}}, "hash": "aee3cadf7a747c2222ad6f7ef14713a6049ef5d745782a351e09ec9a43804f64", "text": "Systemic ecosystem restoration A comprehensive management approach was adopted to facilitate systemic restoration per planing patterns, zonings, and sites, designed according to different environments (freshwater, brackish, saltwater) and ecosystems (ditches, reservoirs, rivers, mud flats, sea, etc.). 70 The ecological restoration of the upstream reservoir included the rehabilitation of the existing pits and ponds around the Liyudi reservoir, the construction of ecological islands to create new habitats, the extension of the shoreline of the water body and the increase of the self-purification capacity, thereby comprehensively improving the ecological status of the reservoir.

The ecological restoration of freshwater wetlands in the upper and middle reaches of the Fengjiajiang River included the removal of cement weirs to restore natural ecological exchange, and the increase of vegetation along slopes and aquatic plants to enhance purification function and biodiversity. Similarly, freshwater ponds have been transformed into ecological wetlands with pollution trapping and purification functions. The ecological restoration of the brackish water environment in the lower reach of the Fengjiajiang River was undertaken based on a method of self-renewal. Hard weirs were replaced by local associate mangroves favorable to water quality improvement, such as Barringtonia racemosa, and Heritiera littoralis Dryand. These species also provide habitats for birds. Native palms were planted in areas surrounding the estuary as they are saline\u2013alkali resistant, maintain adaptability to harsh environments, and are resistant to typhoons. Fig 40. (a) Photo of the fish ponds (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 40. (b) Photo of the fish ponds after rehabilitation (\u00a9 LCRC) 71 Mangrove forest conservation and restoration entailed the closure of beaches for afforestation, tending to young and middle-aged stands, and planting of local mangrove species (primarily Avicennia marina and Kandelia candel) to conserve the native mangrove diversity, while restoring the biodiversity and stability of wetland ecosystems. To date, about 24.7 ha of mangroves have been successfully restored, and 18 ha of new mangroves have been planted [2]. In addition, non-native mangrove species, such as Laguncularia racemose and Sonneratia apetala have been controlled from further expansion. The restoration of Silver Beach included cleaning up the beach environment, removing seawalls, restoring the shoreline, etc. These activities have helped to strengthen the coastal disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, while improving the natural coastal protection functions of Silver Beach and the overall landscape quality. To date, 7.44 ha of beach and approximately 1.43 km of shoreline have been restored [3]. Fig 41. Grey mangrove \u00a9 Dave Aplin Fig 42. Mangrove forest restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 43. Silver Beach shoreline restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 72 Innovative financing and eco-development To attract private investment, the programme adopted a DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Transfer) model. Initially, the Beihai government and private financiers contributed CNY 76 million and CNY 682 million, respectively, to establish a joint venture company to operate the programme, while the remaining financial gap was filled by bank loans. Under the terms of operation, the municipal government pays CNY320 million each year for the services provided by the programme. Finally, assets in good condition will be transferred to the government free of charge. The programme will improve the environment of Beihai City and the quality of Silver Beach, allowing the public to enjoy improved cultural and recreational services. New development and tourism opportunities may also emerge, promoting sustainable urban development, creating additional jobs and attracting further national and international attention. 9.4 Outcomes Improved water quality To date, an annual reduction of 1,366 tonnes of primary pollutants and 16.5 million tonnes of discharged wastewater has been achieved across the Fengjiajia River Basin, while the quality of surface water, long at Grade V, has risen to or exceeded Grade IV [4]. In addition, the water quality of Silver Beach improved by 40% from 2019 to 2020. Biodiversity gains Initial statistics show that 182 species of coastal birds can now be found across the region, an increase of 46 species since 2017, including the critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper. In addition, the recovery of mudflats is leading to a steady increase in benthic organisms (e.g. peanut worms), from 66 species before 2016 to 153 species. The Chinese horseshoe crab, green turtle and other rare marine species have been found in the estuary, where 17 mangrove species have also been identified [5].

In addition, appropriate measures have been taken to address the problems of this densely populated area, where various issues such as urban wastewater, quality of life, ecotourism and recreation, disaster prevention and mitigation, and socio-economic development need to be addressed. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. Box 9. Case 9 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu 74 In this case, the project aims to address the societal challenges of disaster risk reduction, water security, and economic and social development. It focuses on the water issue, including meteorological disasters and pollution in multiple ecosystems, and restores the site by integrating mangroves, converting fish ponds into wetlands and planting various types of plants to improve water quality. Enhanced ecosystem services include climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control, sediment retention, recreation and culture. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project clearly addresses the challenges of natural disasters, water pollution and wetland degeneration (Criterion 1) in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Fengjiajiang River and other multi-ecosystems (Criterion 2). In addition, according to the natural resource data baseline on the website of the Beihai City Natural Resources Bureau, it is obvious that after the restoration project, the number and species of local birds, benthic organisms and even rare marine animals are increasing in an integrated and connected ecosystem (Criterion 3). Referring to the NbS Global Standard, this project can be improved in terms of economic feasibility (Criterion 4), which considers alternative solutions to ensure the effectiveness of the Beihai City NbS design and analysis, while recording cost-effectiveness studies to measure and monitor the economic variables. In addition, the score for inclusive governance (Criterion 5) is slightly lower than the other criterion scores. It could be suggested that more local residents should be involved in all processes of the NbS intervention and that they should be given more opportunities to express their rights and interests in the project. 23 Huijuan, L.

Bordering both Shenzhen and Hongkong, two of China\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, the wetlands of Shenzhen Bay are the wintering habitat and stopover for one of the world\u2019s nine major bird migratory routes - the East Asian-Australasian Flyway - with some 100,000 migratory birds wintering and passing through each year. To effectively conserve this mangrove wetland ecosystem close to the centre of the megacity, the Shenzhen government has launched a series of coastal mangrove restoration policies in Shenzhen Bay, including mangrove conservation, sustainable management, and restoration, which have led to an increase in the total area of mangrove forests and reversed the trend of mangrove wetland ecosystem degradation. The rapid increase in urbanisation in Shenzhen has been accompanied by a decrease in the mangrove areas. In addition, direct industrial and municipal wastewater discharges have increased harmful pollutants and wetland degradation. Along the coastal estuary, watercourses have been channeled, preventing the exchange of matter and energy between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diked fishponds have also been degraded, reducing the ecological function of providing habitats and feeding grounds for migratory birds. In addition, invasive plant species such as Mikania micrantha and Leucaena leucocephala have taken over large areas, while outbreaks of insect infestations have become more frequent, and local species have been replaced across ecological niches, all of which have led to an oversimplified and increasingly fragile structure of wetland communities. 77 10.2 Main objectives This project aims to improve the disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation capacity of the megacity of Shenzhen through the restoration and conservation of mangrove wetlands. Fig 44. Spatial plan of Shenzhen Bay restoration projects(\u00a9 LCRC) 10.3 Methods The local government has insisted on coordinated land-sea management planning to strengthen environmental protection. For example, improved sewage treatment plants are being built with a pipe system that separates rainwater and sewage. Strict controls are also in place for land-based pollutants, and a number of pioneering pollution treatment projects are being implemented. 28 In terms of ecological restoration and the following criteria, which focus on balancing the needs of wildlife with those of urban development and citizens, pond habitats for aquatic birds have been restored through comprehensive water management. In addition, measures have been taken to prevent and control invasive species, plant diseases and pests, and to restore mangrove forests in order to systematically restore the structure and functions of the mangrove ecosystem in Shenzhen Bay. At the same time, rich and enjoyable nature-related educational activities have been carried out and promoted to increase the interest and participation of the public. To this end, CNY 300 million was invested in the project, of which CNY 270 million came from the central government and CNY 30 million from social investment [1]. 78 Fig 45.

(b) Photo of the ecological watercourse after restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Water management The Fengtang River is the main river flowing through the Futian Mangrove Wetlands in Shenzhen Bay. As it is highly channelized, little vegetation has been able to grow along the river, resulting in a very limited provision of ecosystem services. To address this problem, the first step was to de-channelize the forms and structures of the watercourses, soften the course of the Fengtang River, and re- construct the banks of the river with its branches, removing rigid structures from the surface, lowering the water level, and reforming the side slopes into a gentle gradient. A certain thickness of humus was applied to the side slopes to restore the soil environment for better plant growth. Secondly, according to the ecological characteristics of the environment from the outer tidal flats to the inner banks, various plant communities were restored to rehabilitate the bank vegetation, and a comprehensive ecosystem of man- groves, associate mangroves and riverine plants was developed, contributing to the restoration of both the main mangrove wetland functions and the estuarine ecosystem of the Fengtang River.

Reed communities have been established along the banks to meet the habitat needs of various waterbird species. In addition, to further restore suitable bird habitat, the water levels of the central mudflats are controlled so that the island is completely submerged (> 0.3 m) in summer, preventing plant growth along the slopes. During the winter, water levels are maintained between 0.0-0.1m on the uncovered and shallow mudflats to support waterbird habitats. 30 Fig 46.

By recovering herbaceous communities on the embankment, and providing habitats for the pests\u2019 natural enemies, both the species number and individuals of predatory insects have increased, proving an effective measure for pest and disease prevention. Sparse shrubs and low herbs - such as plants from families Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Compositae, Commelina, Verbena, and Acanthaceae - were planted across vast areas along the buffer zone between mangrove forests and diked fish ponds suitable pest predator habitats. Both heights and densities were reduced in the arboreous communities, creating suitable habitats for insects, including spiders, bees, and flies, while assisting with the recovery of predatory insect numbers of species and individuals. Simultaneously, strong integral connectivity is guaranteed among subsystems of mangrove forests and fishponds, while migratory routes from ponds to mangroves were kept open for the predatory insects to migrate into mangrove forests, and play their essential role in preventing the spread of pests and diseases. 31 Regarding invasive species, alien herbaceous hygrophytes were rooted out through desilting projects, while good-quality local hygrophytes were planted, such as Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. Terrestrial invasive plant species were also artificially removed before supplementing local species, and regular clearing work was conducted throughout the subsequent management on an annual basis to prevent the further spread or growth of invasive species. Specifically, in an attempt to eliminate M. micrantha, the dominant harmful plant species throughout Shenzhen Bay, various ecological control measures were taken, ranging from artificial removal, biological control, and the plant photosynthesis time control. Mangroves and mudflats restoration The mangrove forest restoration project consists of forest plantation and mudflat restoration; these activities have been carried out on an area of 220 ha. in the western estuary of shenzhen bay, work has mainly focused on restoring local mangrove forests, in addition to constructing bird mudflat habitats and artificial mudflats to provide resting places for shorebirds. the reforestation efforts have been effective, with a total of 30.2 hectares of mangrove forests planted to date [1]. 81 Nature related education Thanks to the cooperation of the Futian District Education Bureau, the Futian District Science and Technology Association and the Reserve Authority, MCF organised nature-related education courses on a monthly basis and opened them to all schools in Futian. More than 200,000 citizens, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school students, participated in these educational events.

In addition, close cooperation between the two megacities can be seen in the annual Shenzhen-Hongkong Coastal Wetlands Conservation Forum and the Shenzhen River Governance Project, jointly launched by the two governments, which has successively completed the desilting of waterways, embankment reinforcement, sewage outfall rehabilitation and water surface sanitation. 82 10.4 Outcomes Increasing biodiversity Within the restoration area, mangrove wetlands have recovered from loss of function, and biodiversity has shown a consistent increase. Namely, the richness of Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Bruguiera gymnorhiza has increased with a vegetation coverage > 95%. There has also been a remarkable increase in both the number and diversity of species, particularly following the restoration of fish ponds into bird habitats. Through a series of successive restoration actions, the project is playing an important role in maintaining the ecological status and value of Shenzhen Bay on migratory bird flyways. In particular, the restoration project has led to a positive and steady increase in the number of endangered Platalea minor, with the global population increasing from 825 in 2000 to 4864 in 2020, and from 135 to 361 in Shenzhen Bay alone. Carbon sequestration and climate regulation The method, as proposed by the Blue Carbon Initiative jointly published by Conservation International (CI), the IUCN, and United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2014, has been localized in and applied to Futian Reserve. Results have shown that in Shenzhen Bay, each hectare of mangrove forests absorbs about 40 tCO2\u00b7yr -1 from the atmosphere, highlighting the crucial role mangroves play in carbon fixation, mitigating climate change, and helping achieve carbon neutrality. 32 Moreover, the wide and open water surface of Shenzhen Bay has had vast areas of mangrove forests restored. Accordingly, the cooling effect and direct regulation of climate contributed by water vaporization and plant transpiration greatly mitigate the urban heat from nearby Shenzhen. Achieving human-nature harmony The mangrove forest ecosystem restoration project has succeeded in maintaining the harmony and connectivity between the restoration zone and the surrounding areas, while establishing a natural link between the sea and the city, and between birds and people, thus promoting the synthetic functions of coastal wetland ecosystems. In addition, the project will highlight the characteristics of coastal wetlands and mangroves throughout Shenzhen Bay, enhancing the value of both the environment and human settlements, while contributing to the development of surrounding areas. 83 At present, the coastal mangrove wetlands in Shenzhen Bay serve as a demonstration of how to build an environmentally friendly city, as well as a famous scenic spot for citizens and visitors at home and abroad, providing services such as sightseeing, leisure and science popularisation to more than 10 million visitors every year. 10.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project focuses on addressing the societal challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss. Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves are successfully restored, enhancing the provision of ecosystem functions and services related to climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention, recreation, and culture.

[In Chinese] Data sources: [1] Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Natural Resources 85 General reflections It is important to reiterate that all these case studies were designed and implemented before NbS achieved its current global recognition. This means that although these were established with the intent of incorporating the use and management of ecosystems, they were not designed as NbS per se! However, this still provides an excellent opportunity to consider how close these interventions are to NbS best practice and thereby raise awareness and build capacity by reflecting on the project planning according to the NbS criteria. The overall results are encouraging while noting there is still scope for improvement. We consulted with Yan Zhou, Yan Chen and Chongyao Yang, the authors of most of the case studies (i.e. Case 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10) from the MNR\u2019s Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Centre (LCRC), about the significance of the standard for ecological projects. They praised the NbS Standard for its reference value, particularly in terms of its focus on social benefits, design at scale, stakeholder involvement, trade-offs and adaptive management. They also felt that the localisation process of NbS in China should create more specific and locally adapted guidance for the use of the NbS Global Standard, to make it easier to implement in practice. It is noted that an International Standard Committee exists to provide guidance on how the Standard can be used consistently across a range of different national and local conditions. In 2021, LCRC experts organised NbS self-assessment meetings for several ecological projects, including the case of Fuxian Lake, and drafted a preliminary Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for self-assessment. The experts suggest that NbS self-assessment should be embedded in the project cycle and carried out at least three times for the planning, mid-implementation and post-implementation phases. In general, if self-assessment is carried out during the planning phase, project documentation can be strengthened and used for decision making. Meanwhile, it can also enhance stakeholder empowerment through better awareness and approaches to stakeholder identification and engagement. In addition, current ecological conservation and restoration projects in China often focus on efforts on ecosystems and species rather than treating societal challenges as a primary goal, while the self-assessment leads to more consideration of social benefits. 86 Although the principles of ecological projects in China are not entirely consistent with the NbS Global Standard, the basic concepts are consistent from a theoretical perspective, even if the application of the principles in practice is a weakness and a difficulty. For example, the latest official guideline for ecological conservation and restoration projects issued in 2020 requires projects to be planned and designed at the landscape scale. However, the general situation for large projects in China is that although the provincial government usually coordinates the main project, the sub-projects are submitted by different departments, resulting in fragmentation with different objectives, which can distract from the overall objective. In some projects, local governments have established joint meeting mechanisms or joint working groups to try to improve coordination between different departments, but the process is still arduous and lengthy. In general, the majority of ecological projects in China are led by the central government from a top-down approach and implemented by all levels of government, which has the unique characteristic of being designed on a large scale compared to those promoted from the bottom up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a80b1a2f-5940-44d8-b604-a412cbf33e46": {"__data__": {"id_": "a80b1a2f-5940-44d8-b604-a412cbf33e46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Towards Nature-based Solutions at scale", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7f7821b68934825c8508e558cda8de05f0b5fa9851d723ebc07fbfd0ca1653d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4027d4e3-d3f7-4755-aba1-e6d3c14553f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/towards-nature-based-solutions-scale", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5de97e3c6d3534e4c8f7b564301b7b1b49781f67fb6f40c6c0a3dca3ba2ea588"}}, "hash": "5609fd884c03d01d5baaeeef06431122502953fb53dba07f12e54dccdd672855", "text": "These projects therefore have advantages from the outset in terms of scale-up, government recognition and economic viability.

In addition, adaptive management is an emerging concept for the management system of large-scale ecological projects, and ecological conservation and restoration projects in China still apply the management mechanism of engineering projects. The significance of the NbS concept and the Global Standard is to raise the awareness of adaptive management to deal with the dynamics of ecosystems by decision makers and practitioners to leverage transformative change. 87 The authors suggest that the NbS Global Standard provides strong supportive framework for ecological projects from both a conceptual and operational perspective. Applying the standard during both design and implementation can highlight where best practice is being achieved and these areas where improvements and corrective actions can help strengthen the ability of the project to address societal challenges. Additional detailed and pragmatic guidance for NbS interventions in China, such as technical guidelines, monitoring standards, effectiveness assessment guidelines and adaptive management standards, are now needed for practical application of the Standard. In addition to the cases themselves, the publication of this report also represents knowledge management of these projects through a collaboration between IUCN and Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC. In this way, we promote a deeper understanding of the NbS Global Standard among all interested parties, and share Chinese practices and experiences on a global scale. 33 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2023).

They are presented here under one of three broad categories: natural, agricultural or urban types of ecosystems. Based on the case studies results, it can be concluded that the several key elements required for successful \u201cNature-based Solutions\u201d interventions are already commonly represented in project design, notably clarity of purpose, design at scale and biodiversity net gain. Areas that appear to be more likely to be overlooked and therefore required attention at the design stage are inclusion of stakeholders, adaptive management, recognition, balancing of trade-offs. Overall, we can conclude that a solid foundation already exists in the country Case study 2: Landscape restoration and sustainable management in the Helan Mountains This case study focuses on restoring the natural ecosystem functions of the mountains to improve safety, ecology and landscape. The overall functionality of these ecosystems has been gradually improved by reducing anthropogenic threats (e.g. mining and overgrazing), restoring ecological corridors and improving landscape connectivity. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has an adequate fit with identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and attaining net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). However, it should seek to improve the trade-offs balancing (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). In further, it is critical to develop an inter-provincial cooperation mechanism or strategy, as the landscape is cross-jurisdictional. Case study 3: Building a community of life in the Fuxian Lake Watershed This case study focuses on the protection of the hydro-ecological environment of the Fuxian Lake Watershed in an effort to safeguard the ecological environment and water security of the Pearl River Basin and to support coordinated rural and urban development in central Yunnan. Through overall spatial planning and site-specific interventions, including reforestation, structural adjustment of agriculture, riparian restoration and conservation and management of the lake, a socio-economic-natural complex system has been developed that provides improved ecosystem functions and services. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case can strongly meet the indicators especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and attaining net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). Additionally, it also adequately fit to Criterion 7 & 8. However, the project can improve its consideration of trade-offs regard to ecological and social aspects. viii After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has an adequate fit with identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and achieving net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). However, it should seek to improve the stakeholder communication and engagement (Criterion 5), trade-offs balancing (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7) of the project. Case study 4: Conservation and restoration for food, water, and people in the Ulansuhai Nur Watershed This case study focuses on improving water security and preventing wind erosion and desertification. It has been implemented to conserve and restore various desert, farmland, mountain, grassland and river ecosystems. In addition, a special financial mechanism has been set up to facilitate private investment. After years of management and restoration, the eco-environmental quality, as well as biodiversity of Ulansuhai Nur Watershed were significantly improved. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has partly fit to the indicators, such as identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1) and designing at scale (Criterion 2). However, the project should improve the long-term stability of funding, so as to ensure stakeholder interests (Criterion 4), developing strategies for stakeholder engagement (Criterion 5) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). Case study 5: Integrated protection and restoration for the Qiantang River source water area This case study focuses on the ecological conservation of Qiandao Lake, located on the upper reaches of the Qiantang River. By addressing pollution control, riparian restoration, forest restoration and mining site rehabilitation, the lake\u2019s water security has been significantly improved.

Case study 6: Nature-based revitalization of Xunjiansi Village in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi This case study focuses on the establishment of a community socio-economic development model based on ecosystem services and goods (e.g. tourism), research and practice through the protection and restoration of ancient water harvesting facilities and farmland ecosystems. The outcomes include village revitalisation, enhanced conservation and efficient use of natural resources, effectively contributing to addressing societal challenges (socio-economic development and disaster risk reduction), while enriching the knowledge base of NbS with traditional knowledge and local expertise from China. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has a strong fit with the indicators, particularly in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2), involving local communities (Criterion 5) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). It also performs well in ensuring sustainability and mainstreaming (Criterion 8). The project could improve in terms of analysing trade-offs (Criterion 6) at the planning stage. Case study 7: Ensuring food security through conservation and the sus- tainable use of black soils in Jilin This case study focuses on the development of a nature-based farming model in line with the concept of conservation agriculture by incorporating correlated, locally specific measures. These efforts have effectively protected black soils, increased the organic matter and carbon storage capacity of arable land, while facilitating an integrated response to food security and climate change mitigation. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that it can strongly adapt to the indicators, especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). The project could add more considerations regarding the early involvement of the local community (Criterion 5). x Part 3: NbS in urban ecosystems Three case studies are presented, focusing on urban areas and emphasising the introduction of NbS in cities. These aim to build an integrated and coherent ecological system within cities, improve ecosystem services in urban areas and enhance the resulting adaptive capacity of cities to climate change. Case study 8: Integrating nature-based approaches for urban regeneration and development in Chongqing This case study focuses on local ecological space conservation and urban regeneration. Through the sustainable use and management of natural resources, the societal challenges effectively addressed by this project include disaster risk reduction, socio-economic development and water security. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has some strengths in terms of designing at city scale (Criterion 2), achieving biodiversity net-gain (Criterion 3) and balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6). The project could consider about alternative approaches (Criterion 4) and improve its strategy for adaptive management (Criterion 7) to maintain the ecosystem function and services.change. Case study 9: Coordinated coastal restoration and management for sus- tainable development of Beihai City, Guangxi This case study focuses on ecological restoration, systematic water pollution control and sponge city development to create a coastal wetland-urban complex system. Restoration is proposed according to zoning and specific measures for reservoirs, rivers, beaches and the sea. The project has improved water quality, biodiversity, disaster risk reduction capacity and the well-being of local communities. security. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case can strongly meet the indicators especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and achieving net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3).

Sponge cities: An answer to flood. http://chinawaterrisk.org/resources/analysis- reviews/sponge-cities-an-answer-to-floods/ Introduction In recent years, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have gained increasing attention at a global scale, given their potential to address some of the most pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, water security, disaster risk reduction and human health. Countries, organisations, experts, and decision-makers around the world have interpreted and discussed the concept from different perspectives. According to IUCN, NbS are \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d. NbS differ from traditional approaches and perceptions that rely upon engineering or technological solutions to solve environmental problems. Instead, they are based on the power of nature-well-functioning ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges, such as climate change, disaster risk reduction, socio-economic development, food security, water security, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss, and human health.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff86875b-cddb-4f64-b1ff-fe88b7341457": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff86875b-cddb-4f64-b1ff-fe88b7341457", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0290d1f8f7fffa7ed560f283c9dce798dca79395c5a2ac91995ea0203a29710"}, "2": {"node_id": "46725b97-c002-4dc6-9cec-f6d0f4f6b115", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dbd08eff3f7daeaf7cb3aa3e090f2f904cc99e79cb60458fe807069b93115f6"}}, "hash": "cca0c8cb3ece975a863a997048a8116b796a879feb2fff6daf4f4a768d6fc10b", "text": "Within the NbS conceptual framework, NbS are seen as an umbrella type approach that encompasses ecosystem-based and ecosystem-related approaches, all of which address societal challenges, while improving the provision of ecosystem services and carefully considering the trade-offs at their core, for the benefit of people and nature.

Recently, large-scale ecological conservation and restoration programmes have been planned and implemented in China, leading to the emergence of various worthwhile practices in line with NbS. The aim of this publication is to present ten case studies and share Chinese practical experience and knowledge in planning and implementing interventions to address various societal challenges, protect the planet and help reverse trends of ecological degradation and biodiversity loss. While these interventions aimed to be NbS, the Global Standard for NbS had not yet been developed when they were planned and implemented. Therefore, this publication provides a detailed description of these ten case studies and a list of lessons learned from the case study managers and authors on how the Global Standard for NbS would have retrospectively helped to improve or ensure a more successful NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions are an emerging framework recognised by many stakeholders as essential to achieving sustainable development. Launched in 2020, the Global Standard for NbS will be reviewed by the next World Conservation Congress. This publication will help to better understand how NbS is being implemented in China, and the findings and examples will provide insights that will contribute to the upcoming revision of the Global Standard. Given the limited time and knowledge available, this report will inevitably include factors that require further elaboration, and we welcome all comments and suggestions from readers. 2 3 Case study 1: Holistic management and restoration of the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, to safeguard Beijing's water security Authors: Ming Luo, Xu Zhou, Yan Zhou, Chongyao Yang Societal challenges addressed: Ecosystems: F1 Rivers and streams F3 Artificial fresh waters F3.1 Large reservoirs F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands T7.1 Annual croplands T7.3 Plantations Ecosystem services enhanced: Water supply Erosion control and sediment retention Refugia Water security Economic and social development Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss Sustainable Development Goals addressed: Total financing: CNY 2.213 billion Implementation period: 2016-present NbS type approaches implemented: Ecosystem restoration Ecological engineering Ecosystem-based management \u00a9Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC Map data \u00a92022 Tianditu, MNR of the PRC & NavInfo 4 1.1 General background and challenges to address The Sanggan River and the Yang River converge to form the Yongding River in Huailai County of Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, where it flows into the Guanting Reservoir, an important source of water for Beijing. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed covers an area of 280 km 2 and plays a significant role in runoff regulation and storage for flood control and disaster risk reduction. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed is also of high value for biodiversity. Based on the data collected by the Shan Shui Conservation Center and Peking University, various wildlife species have been identified and classified according to the IUCN Red List, including one critically endangered, one endangered, and seven vulnerable species. In addition, 5 first-class and 26 second-class Chinese state protected animals were identified. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed also serves as a stopover for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway. In recent decades, the watershed has faced several environmental challenges: Firstly, in the mountainous areas of the headwaters, quarrying for mining has damaged the massif and contributed to soil erosion; secondly, agricultural and domestic wastes from villages upstream of the Yongding River has caused water pollution; furthermore, in the floodplains, large areas of land have been haphazardly reclaimed for maize cultivation, resulting in severe non-point source pollution from the application of chemical fertilisers; finally, on the banks of the reservoir, riparian ecosystems have been degraded and suffer from poor integrity, connectivity, and habitat fragmentation. 1.2 Main objectives This project aims to safeguard the water security of Beijing through the holistic management of ecosystems such as rivers, streams, and wetlands in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, thereby enhancing the ecosystem services of water regulation, supply, and filtration. Moreover, the planned restoration of the riparian buffer zone can effectively reduce the risk of flooding and the damage it causes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd5df1ba-5e7a-4952-9b9b-254b5df9ca0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd5df1ba-5e7a-4952-9b9b-254b5df9ca0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f28d64e4cdbc869725f5142bd5521d5d85fd0b6bb939088c784423afd28c675d"}, "2": {"node_id": "290c4587-49e7-42c9-996d-30771837c2e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "666727e2904bd969501bb32d8751aa5c5a1f264ba15c654677fb74024920ef4f"}}, "hash": "26c0cf4e10fed925f58b400ca8605680aeb16b7a92de390a8c9e55efdf1aecd1", "text": "5 1.3 Methods Preparatory activities To reduce the threat to the ecosystems in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, pollution from 300 illegal polluters was banned at over 400 sites, including racecourses, restaurants, and farmyards.

Fig 2. Illustration of the ecological restoration project in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed (\u00a9 LCRC) Ecological restoration Rehabilitation of mining sites 30 quarries in the northern and southern mountains were closed. Vegetation restoration took place at 128 mining sites. The seven mines that remained in operation were required to fully comply with \u201cGreen Mining Standards\u201d during production [1]. Special bonds worth CNY 375 million were acquired from the local government for the management of the high-steep slope. In addition, various companies had joined forces to restore the high-steep slope. Restoring vegetation and connecting ponds Along the north bank of the reservoir and the entrance, 667 ha of grass and over 60 ha of arbors and shrubs have been planted. Over 33.3 ha of wetland ponds have been constructed to create a tree-grass-water ecosystem and improve water conservation. 6 Restoring river habitat connectivity and natural patterns The restoration of the Yang, Sanggan and Yongding Rivers led to the simultaneous restoration of the river flow. At the same time, the natural patterns of the rivers were restored using ecological engineering, vertical design and micro-topography reconstruction tools. Emphasis was placed on the spatial diversity and structural heterogeneity of the watercourses, and the original meanders, pools and shallows were identified. Fig 3. Original appearance of the mine (\u00a9 LCRC) Agricultural adaptation Some 6,667 ha of maize and other crops were converted to vineyards. This has increased financial income and reduced the use of chemicals by 2,800 tonnes [1]. Fig 4. (a) Photo of the area before restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 4. (b) Photo of the area after vegetation restoration and puddles connection engineering (\u00a9 LCRC) 7 Creation of an ecological buffer zone around the reservoir An ecological buffer zone 30-100m wide has been created around the Guanting Reservoir, consisting of wetlands reclaimed from farmland and aquaculture farms, and vegetation belts of arbors, shrubs and herbs. 7 With a total area of 20 km 2, the buffer zone effectively purifies surface runoff flowing into the reservoir. To avoid single-species selection and the introduction of alien species, moisture-resistant shrub and local arbor species were planted. Biodiversity conservation In the riparian area of the reservoir, the project makes full use of the gently sloping banks and shallow water to artificially adjusts the micro-topography thereby creating create more habitats suitable for a variety of waterfowl. Aquatic vegetation has been restored over large areas, in places where the water flow is smooth and the water level stable. Conversely, in ecologically degraded areas of tidal wetlands, different types of habitat have been created for different water birds to live, feed and breed. When creating the vegetation belts, bulbs and berries were deliberately restored to provide food sources for the birds. In addition, at the confluence of the Yang and Sanggan Rivers, the topography of the wide estuary was adjusted to increase the water area, providing habitats for various waterfowl. Artificial floating islands have been constructed in key water quality control areas to provide additional footholds for birds. Twelve wind turbines that had a negative impact on birds were phased out [1]. Fig 5. (a) Aerial photo of the riparian area before ecological buffer zone construction (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 5. (b) Aerial photo of the riparian area after ecological buffer zone construction (\u00a9 LCRC) 8 1.4 Outcomes Water security has improved since the implementation of the holistic management intervention. In addition to the reduction of non-point source pollution, the purification capacity of ecosystems has been strengthened, and the water quality of the Guanting Reservoir Watershed has steadily improved. Since 2019, water monitoring has shown that water quality has reached Class III, according to the national standard. Fertiliser use has been reduced by 2892.4 t/a, pesticide use by 16.45 t/a, COD by 347.46 t/a and NH3-N emission by 69.49 t/a. 8 In addition, ecological integrity and biodiversity have been enhanced.

In fact, the project is included in the third batch of national pilot projects for ecological protection and restoration of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands, with a budgeted investment of CNY 5.366 billion and an additional CNY 2 billion in awards and subsidies from the central government [1]. The relatively fragile ecosystem of the Helan Mountains is located in a transitional zone between arid and semi-arid regions. This natural ecological fragility has been exac- erbated by extensive human disturbance, such as high intensity grazing and long- term continuous open-cut and underground mining. Following the establishment of the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, rapidly expanding populations of blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) have led to overgrazing of the local vegetation.

As a result, local mining industries and communities are shifting their livelihoods towards agroforestry and ecotourism. In addition, an increase in local species has been observed due to the restoration of grasslands from grazing and afforestation of hillsides. 2.3 Methods The project proposes to restore degraded landscapes and reduce human threats for the benefit of safety, ecology and landscape, to restore degraded ecosystems, increase the degree of wilderness, reconnect landscape patches and improve environmental connectivity to restore the overall functionality of the natural ecosystems of the Helan Mountains. Closure of mining sites In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, such remediation has been carried out on more than 150 km 2, with 122 mining sites closed and 169 human activity sites remediated inside the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, as well as 45 sites on the reserve\u2019s periphery that seriously affect the local ecology, and two concentrated coal processing plants. In addition, the policy of \u2018returning pastureland to grassland\u2019 has resulted in the restoration of natural vegetation within the protected area. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone, a total of seven mines in the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, covering 176 ha, have been withdrawn. 9,10 Fig 8.

(b) Eurasian sparrowhawk \u00a9 Petr Saj Large-scale restoration of damaged ecosystems To reduce the disaster potential of landslides and floods, measures such as geological disaster elimination, management of abandoned mines, and improvement of flood control channels have been implemented, with priority given to not blocking ecological corridors or migration channels for plants and animals. Measures such as collection of germplasm resources, expansion of rare plant species and protection of water sources have been carried out in headwater and natural areas in the local typical landscapes and mountains to achieve vertical distribution of forest vegetation. Both transplanting and domestication techniques have been carried out to maintain propagating populations of valuable and rare plant communities, including Tetraena mongolica, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Prunus mongolica, and Glycine soja. In addition, vegetation rehabilitation has been carried out according to rainfall patterns. In montane areas with more than 400 mm/yr rainfall, suitable native tree seeds were sown. In areas with 200-400 mm/yr rainfall, grasses, shrubs and trees were sown, while in areas with less than 200 mm/yr rainfall, rehabilitation focused on grasses and meadows. Enhancement of landscape connectivity and restoration of ecological corridors Restoration activities have been carried out on 5,900 ha of former mining sites. Through geomorphological reshaping, soil reconstruction and the restoration of original vegetation, natural ecosystems and habitats have been regenerated, enlarged and corridors widened with the aim of restoring a systematic and complete food web, while providing a suitable habitat for valuable and rare wildlife, such as the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Great Bustard (Otis tarda), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and other top predators that may be reintroduced in the future, including the Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia). 15 2.4 Outcomes Gradual restoration of degraded ecosystems in the Helan Mountains The regional vegetation has shown an overall growth trend, with the forest cover of the reserve increasing by 1% and the total vegetation cover increasing by 20%, while the forest communities within the reserve are in positive succession. In addition, as a result of the restoration work, the area of scrub now exceeds that of 1964, with the majority of species being nationally protected plants. Amygdalus mongolica, a second class state protected plant, has also reappeared following the restoration of the pastures. 11 Increased biodiversity and carbon sequestration Monitoring data has shown that the restoration measures, including mountain closure and grazing management, have stimulated plant growth and renewal, resulting in a significant increase in plant and animal populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5f15204-e743-46a5-a77e-07375262e3f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5f15204-e743-46a5-a77e-07375262e3f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f7627284ba6b99d39de5483c0774116532e607534938599c9f84ef853818db6"}, "2": {"node_id": "61b0126a-882b-41ae-ac30-3fcbe65efcb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b2f4a011bad4be39fb3764b4bedfe093680345c8290fe93ff746a897aa6e0ea"}}, "hash": "8ccfa8e6c364e75f2053c09071f53b707a52169eb1d14b5507f0612aa9690d1c", "text": "In a sample plot in the southern Helan Mountains, 12 new representative shrubs of Zygophyllum xanthoxylon were found following restoration.

Case 2 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, since the Helan Mountains are located in the Yellow River Basin, and the dividing line between the three deserts of Tengger, Mu Us and Ulan Buh at the same time, the project therefore focuses on reducing disaster risk especially to prevent desertification, and safeguard water security. In addition, the relevant restoration interventions can contribute to reverse environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project has adequate matches to the indicators in Criterion 1 in terms of clearly understanding the societal challenges, effective interventions were planned and implemented, and seek to conserve biodiversity (Criterion 3). The project also made an effort to safeguard stakeholder interests through livelihood transformation (Criterion 6) and promote the experience of rewilding (Criterion 8). Hence, the project manages to restore the vegetation, thus enhance the ecosystem functions and services of disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention and refugia. 18 The project has advantages in terms of identifying and responding to societal challenges, managing to safeguard stakeholder benefits, but some aspects can be improved in accordance with NbS Standard. The Helan Mountains locate across two provinces, thus, a provincial trans-boundary mechanism should be established between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia to strength the cooperation with regard to the project in the area of Helan Mountains, in order to improve the synergy and monitoring of the interventions (Criterion 5). Moreover, the project should develop an effective adaptation strategy and a strategy for long-term management (Criterion 7). 9 Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve Management Burea (2017).

A total of 464 tracheophyte species were identified in Fuxian Lake National Wetland Park and surrounding areas. During monitoring between 2017 and 2019, 32 fish species were recorded [1]. Located on a unique low-latitude plateau, Fuxian Lake has a less dynamic water flow, with a modelled water exchange cycle of more than 200 years, which inherently increases the fragility of the ecosystem; once polluted, the lake is extremely difficult to recover. In 2002, a large area of cyanobacteria bloomed in Fuxian Lake, causing the water quality to drop from Grade I to II. Xingyun Lake, which is part of the Fuxian Lake Watershed, has also experienced frequent cyanobacteria blooms, resulting in severely polluted water quality as high as Grade V. The Yunnan provincial government has long attached great importance to protecting the ecology of Fuxian Lake and has made unremitting efforts to do so. In 2017, the Fuxian Lake Watershed Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project was included in the second batch of the Shan-shui Initiative, with a total investment of CNY 9.728 billion, of which CNY 2 billion was provided by the central financial authorities. 21 Human activities such as mining and upland farming have led to a decline in vegetation cover in the local mountain areas, as well as phosphate pollution and soil erosion. In addition, high water and fertiliser consumption has led to serious agricultural non-point source pollution. In particular, fish ponds, farmland and other land uses occupy the lakeshore buffer zone, weakening the filtering function of the wetlands. In addition, invasive species and the negative impact of human activities on natural spawning grounds have led to the depletion of native fish stocks in Fuxian Lake, threatening its biodiversity. Fig 12. Diagram of lake ecosystem cycle \u00a9 Wetland Planning Project Team 3.2 Main objectives The project aims to ensure water security through the structural adjustment of agriculture, the preservation of trees and shrubs in riparian buffer zones, and the construction of an ecological purification zone. These approaches can enhance the ecosystem services of water regulation, supply and purification, while reducing disaster risk. 3.3 Methods The Fuxian Lake Watershed Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project focuses its efforts on the entire basin. Some projects have been carried out to optimise the ecological and agricultural landscape and the spatial layout of the basin, including the relocation of industrial and mining enterprises, the closure of livestock and poultry farms, the construction of sewage networks and treatment plants, and the control of pollution in the rivers. 22 Forest restoration and expansion To strengthen soil and water conservation in montane areas, action has been taken on three fronts: 1. Returning farmland to forest: By matching sites with native tree species 2,700 ha of farmland has been returned to forest. 2. Combating desertification: Efforts have been made to restore and manage the 4,202.1 ha of stone desertification areas, including the planting of environmentally resilient crops with economic value, such as honeysuckle. 3. Ecological rehabilitation of mines: The main types of mines in the basin are phosphorite, clay brick quarry, limestone quarry, etc. The ecology of 400 ha of abandoned mines has been restored. Recognising that the main source of pollution is surface runoff in particular soil pollutants containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and non-point source pollution from agriculture - measures and actions are being taken across mountains, dams, lake shores and water bodies. These include forest restoration and expansion, water pollution prevention and control, and pollution filtration, protection and treatment. 12 Fig 13. Distribution of the four conservation and restoration management units, and 41 sub-projects (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 14. Process of forest restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 23 Structural adjustment of agriculture To effectively reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution, adjustments in agricultural practices have been made in the Fuxian Lake catchment area, such as fallow crop rotation and planting of blueberry, pyrethrum, vetiver or other crops requiring less chemical treatment, as well as rice, lotus root and other aquatic crops with wetland purification effects. As a result, it is estimated that 4,500 and 700 tonnes of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively have been reduced each year (reductions of 78.9% and 63.6% respectively).

Fig 15. Ecological buffer zone (\u00a9 LCRC) 24 Water purification project around the lake Three sub-projects were implemented: the construction of ecological, water-permeable purification zones around the lake (consisting of green belts and gravel beds), water purification of ditches flowing into the lake, and water purification of estuaries flowing into rivers. Estuary wetland and riparian zone enhancement project Trees, shrubs and other plants in the buffer zone are maintained and replanted on a daily basis. Aquatic plants are also harvested. Conservation and management of the lake Research shows that from 1983 to 2015, the number of native fish species decreased by 44%, while the number of exotic fish species increased by 167% [2]. Therefore, the conservation and management of Fuxian Lake mainly focuses on habitat protection and artificial release of native fish species. Specifically: 1. Protecting submerged aquatic vegetation and restoring degraded habitats with native submerged aquatic vegetation. 2. Adding rubble and gravel to the lake to simulate fish habitats and restore sediment. 3. Protection of fish spawning outlets in karst caves and restoration of damaged sediment. 4. Release ~1 million white fish per year into a 5 km 2 small water area delineated by purse seines and buoys within the National Aquatic Germplasm Resource Conservation Area for Endemic Fish in Fuxian Lake. 3.4 Outcomes Reducing ecological risks and reversing ecosystem degradation From 2016 to the first half of 2020, the water quality of Fuxian Lake remained stable at the Grade I level. The total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, permanganate, chlorophyll A and eutrophication indices of Fuxian Lake decreased by 19%, 41%, 13%, 60% and 4% respectively, while transparency and dissolved oxygen increased by 19% and 7% respectively. In addition, the water quality compliance rate remained at 100% at both national and provincial monitoring stations. In total, 74 km 2 of forest were restored and soil erosion was controlled on 6.73 km 2. Overall, the forest cover in the Fuxian Lake Watershed increased from 34.95% to 39.25%, and the corresponding for- est stock increased by 39% [3]. 25 Biodiversity restoration Surveys and statistics have shown that the number of emergent plant species in Fuxian Lake has increased to 12, while the seasonal white fish fishery has resumed for the first time in more than 20 years [3]. The basin has also become a permanent habitat and wintering ground for a wide range of birds and other wildlife. In particular, in March 2019, 25 endangered Plegadis falcinellus, which is listed as a second class state protected animal, were observed there. Fig 16. Glossy Ibis \u00a9 Jan Veber Balanced, greener, and higher quality development Strictly following the agricultural planning development and planting standards, green, ecological and circular agriculture with plateau characteristics has been developed, using fertiliser-, pesticide- and water-saving crops such as lotus root, blueberry, rice, wheat, rapeseed and so on. In addition, industrial and mining enterprises have all moved out of the Fuxian Lake outflow areas, and eco-cultural tourism has been developed in their place. 13 3.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS Box 3.

Ulansuhai is the eighth largest freshwater lake in China and the largest functional wetland in the Yellow River Basin - a rare formation for desert or semi-desert areas. It is located at the intersection of two of the world\u2019s eight major bird migration routes, one from South and Southwest Asia to Central Asia and the other from Southeast Asia to Australia. As a key part of the \u201cNorthern Sand Prevention Belt\u201d in China\u2019s \u201cTwo Barriers and Three Belts\u201d strategic ecological security system, the basin has the important functions of ensuring water security along the Yellow River, conserving biodiversity and regulating regional climate. In addition, as one of China\u2019s three major agricultural areas, the Hetao Plain is an important production base for crops and oils, and plays a critical role in en- suring the country\u2019s food security. Accordingly, the Ulansuhai Lake Watershed comprises the largest area for both agricultural water use and natural purification along the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River. Irrigation water ultimate- ly flows into Ulansuhai, which acts as a natural purifier before being discharged into the Yellow River. Regional water quality and ecosystem functions have been gradually deteriorating since the 1980s, posing a serious threat to the Yellow River\u2019s water security. From 2005 to 2014, the water quality of the lake area remained at the lower Grade V. Specifically, water pollution peaked in 2008, and there was once a widespread outbreak of xanthophyceae in the region. More recently, both the provincial and municipal governments have promoted the transformation of agriculture and livestock farming in the basin into landscapes of conservation and restoration through a national approach known as \u2018Integrated Management of Mountains, Rivers, Forests, Farmlands, Lakes, Grasslands and Deserts\u2019.

From one perspective, sludge dredging, the establishment of a multi-pond purification system, ecological revetment, the construction of ecological floating islands and ecological water replenishment were used to improve water quality and reduce pollutant inputs. From another perspective, the use of chemicals, water and film on agricultural land was controlled as part of a comprehensive saline soil management programme. Wulashan ecological conservation and restoration In order to address the outstanding environmental problems at the Wulashan mine, such as soil erosion and degradation of forest and grassland vegetation, various geological environment, disaster recovery and vegetation restoration measures have been taken to improve the geological and geomorphological conditions of the damaged massif and the water retention capacity. 31 Fig 19. Process of Alaben grassland reastoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Conservation and restoration of the Alaben grassland In order to combat the accelerated degradation of grasslands, desertification, soil erosion, etc., measures have been taken such as grass sowing, in addition to closure and grazing bans, with a combination of natural and artificial approaches for water conservation, vegetation restoration, reduction of pollutant and sediment inflow, windbreak and sand prevention. Management of the Ulansuhai ecological protection belt To address the degradation of Ulansuhai, a water conservation forest has been planted by the lake, grass seeds have been sown in the ecologically fragile areas of fixed and semi-fixed dunes, bird breeding areas have been created, wetland restoration and construction has been carried out in the estuary, and water conveyance channels have been opened to restore connectivity in areas where reeds are dense. Conservation and restoration of the Ulansuhai aquatic ecosystem To address the problems of severe pollution and water surface shrinkage, ventilation and water flow were facilitated in Ulansuhai to improve storage and self-purification capacity. Other measures included the harvesting and utilisation of reeds and underwater plants, the establishment of three-dimensional aquaculture in the lake area, the removal of nutrients from the lake body through a nature-based aquaculture food chain, the establishment of no-fishing areas, etc. 32 Fig 20.

Mobilising private sector to develop new financing mechanisms The project followed the DBFOT (design, build, finance, operate and transfer) approach to facilitate market-based financing, project management and operation. Specifically, a company was empowered to act as a financing platform on behalf of the Bayannur Municipality, with open bidding for project investment, development, operation and financial management. A dedicated development fund was established with joint contributions from both the municipal state-owned company and the winning bidder, as initiated by the latter.

Case 4 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu This case shares some characteristics with the cases of Helan Mountains and Fuxian Lake. The Ulansuhai Nur Watershed plays an important role in both desertification prevention and water retention. Therefore, the project mainly aims to safeguard water, reducing disaster risk and facilitate sustainable economic and social development. The project manages to restore the various ecosystems to enhance the provision of their functions and services such as disturbance regulation, water regulation, water supply, erosion control and sediment retention, waste treatment, refugia and food production. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project has adequate matches to Criterion 1 & 2, in which indicate explicit identification of societal challenges, and project design was conducted at different levels of scale. Moreover, the project established an innovative financing mechanism to ensure economic feasibility (Criterion 4). After assessing the case study against the Global Standard\u2019s criteria and indicators, some aspects can be improved accordingly, such as better involvement of local communities in project implementation and maintenance (Criterion 5), including trade-offs on aspects like biophysics, time and interests (Criterion 6), and specific strategy of adaptive management (Criterion 7). 35 Case study 5: Integrated protection and restoration for the Qiantang River source water area Authors: Yong Jin, Tong Jin, Hua Cheng, Quan Mu Societal challenges addressed: Total financing: CNY 5.208 billion Implementation period: 2019-2022 Ecosystems: F3.1 Large reservoirs F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands T2.4 Warm temperate laurophyll forests Sustainable Development Goals addressed: NbS type approaches implemented: Ecosystem restoration Ecological engineering Ecosystem-based management Ecosystem services enhanced: Water regulation Water supply Erosion control and sediment retention Food production Culture Water security Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss Economic and social development Map data \u00a92022 Tianditu, MNR of the PRC & NavInfo \u00a9Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC 36 5.1 General background and challenges to address Qiandao Lake, which literally means \u201cThousand Island Lake\u201d, is an ultra-large reservoir located in Chun\u2019an, Zhejiang Province, and is the largest artificial freshwater lake in the Yangtze River Delta with large number of islands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27b2b8c9-e09a-47ff-ab85-34dd2077cfe5": {"__data__": {"id_": "27b2b8c9-e09a-47ff-ab85-34dd2077cfe5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b90fc031d5bdd31c71e174e6f13175ee9b13a2fb0ece1830f344fee34a10647"}, "2": {"node_id": "15ca277c-55f8-477a-adbd-ec242a3aa7aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "122c86ce2b9acd42962227b8a5eb31210a00ef893e6db4b4ac2a57acbd0b20d1"}}, "hash": "041d0da667c72eaa24be9d4f5d495decced4932b5083adf5107e1c50ab13ccd0", "text": "With a normal storage capacity of 17.84 billion m 3 and a water surface area of 567.40 km 2, the water quality of Qiandao Lake is relatively high among China\u2019s major reservoirs, and it plays an important role in ensuring water security while providing regulatory services such as flood control and disaster risk reduction.

To date, a total of CNY 3.969 billion has been invested in this project, including CNY 500 million from the central government, CNY 2.403 billion from all levels of provincial and local public budgets, and CNY 1.066 billion from other sources. To explore new opportunities in the private sector, several representatives of the financial sector formed a partnership, the Qiandao Lake Water Fund, which includes the Alibaba Foundation, Minsheng Tonghui Foundation, Wanxiang Trust and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), as the county sought to synergize public funding, private investment and World Bank loans. The lake faces several challenges. In particular, non-point source (NPS) pollution caused by inappropriate agricultural practices and the overuse of pesticides and fertilisers are the main threats to the water quality of Qiandao Lake. The invasion of pests such as Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is also affecting the biodiversity of the local forests. Housing, resorts and other tourist developments near the lake have also led to habitat loss and threatened the ecological safety of the lake. 37 5.2 Main objectives The project aims to ensure water security and maintain ecosystem stability through ecological restoration of wetlands, riparian areas and forests, while rehabilitating abandoned mines. These efforts have improved the provision of ecosystem services such as water regulation, supply and filtration. In addition, the local industrial and mineral industry is being restructured towards agroforestry and ecotourism, reducing pollution and the risk of geological disasters. 5.3 Methods The project has been implemented throughout the Qiandao Lake Watershed (landscape scale), targeting the control of inflow pollution, restoration of forest ecosystems and ecological management in mining areas, as well as ecological improvement, green agriculture and spatial optimisation of the basin. 15 Fig 22. Site location map (\u00a9 LCRC) 38 Fig 23. Riparian restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Spatial planning and management Measures were implemented to strictly follow a zoning-based approach to ecosystem functions, including the establishment of a dedicated natural landscape planning in and around the lakeshore, and the introduction of regulations on lakeshore development and construction. Specifically, a 20m radius from the shore was designated as a no-development zone, while a 20-100m radius was designated as a strict management zone. The project also aimed to improve local water quality by assessing the source and distribution pattern of NPS pollutants in the basin, and identifying the extent of priority management areas and ecological measures for water quality control. Pollution control The water quality of Qiandao Lake has deteriorated over the past three years, with total nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the surface water exceeding standards and maintaining an average mesotrophic water quality. Following an ecological approach to river management, some of the traditional, impermeable, hardened watercourses were replaced with natural, appropriate riparian and lakeshore vegetation. In addition, activities such as revetment construction and dredging were carried out to create ecological corridors and restore river biodiversity. 39 Forest ecosystem restoration Conservation and enhancement work was carried out by implementing activities such as logging bans, afforestation and reforestation, forest maintenance, closing access to hillsides to facilitate regeneration, improving deciduous forest stand structure and diversity to maintain a healthy ecosystem status. For the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases, efforts were made to control Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, remove dead or infected wood and pine, and other tasks to ensure healthier forests.

Development of green agriculture (\u00a9 LCRC) 5.4 Outcomes Significantly reduced risks and improved catchment ecology Significant progress has been made in the control of NPS pollution. The use of physical and biological techniques has progressed, while the development of green agriculture and the establishment of circular farming has led to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Soil conservation measures have been applied to 3,527 ha of the target area, reducing the area of soil and water loss by 7.54% and further improving the status of local soil and water [1]. Approximately 7,753 ha of forest has been restored, and biodiversity has been enhanced. Currently, Chun\u2019an maintains a forest cover of 78.63%. The drainage of wastewater from tailings has been effectively prevented, and 50 ha of mining area have been rehabilitated. Fig 25. (a) Photo of the area before river management (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 25.

Recently, as industrialisation and urbanisation have intensified, there has been a significant out-migration of local populations and a gradual decline in traditional rural communities across China. Xunjiansi\u2019s long-established model of self-sufficiency and traditional agricultural landscape has also faded. In light of this phenomenon, Professor Yu Kongjian from Peking University has been leading a team experimenting with a nature-based lifestyle in Xunjiansi since 2015, called the \u201cWangshan Lifestyle\u201d. The Wangshan lifestyle, which means \u201cmountain view\u201d in Chinese, is one in which can \u201ctruly enjoy the moments of being close to mountains, water and home\u201d. It is an attempt to explore ways to achieve sustainable rural development, a high quality of life and a path towards a vision where \u201cclear waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets\u201d. The primary objective is to further promote revitalising practices in rural areas through the development of green livelihoods and lifestyles. 45 To date, the implementation of the Wangshan Lifestyle in Xunjiansi has been successful through the combined establishment of housing, eco-farming, tourism, research, and cultural practices. Local natural resources are being better protected and used more efficiently, while once desolate and abandoned rural communities are becoming prosperous, supporting the application of NbS to China\u2019s rural revitalisation strategy. As is typical throughout China, the village of Xunjiansi was facing several challenges, such as the channeling and hardening of rivers, the excessive use of chemicals, stagnant development, and low local incomes. In addition, a large number of young and middle-aged residents had emigrated, resulting in an abundance of abandoned land, dilapidated housing, weakened community infrastructure and facilities, and a decline in cultural education. Local landscapes and heritage were ineffectively protected, resulting in the gradual disappearance of the villagers' sense of identity and belonging. 6.2 Main objectives This project aims to reduce regional disaster risk while ensuring food and water security by revitalising the village through smart hydraulic systems and more sustainable agricultural practices. The project strengthens ecosystem services related to water supply through improved filtration and reuse on the field. Such healthy and environmentally friendly recirculation systems will allow local villagers to live and farm in a more ecologically sustainable way, while preserving the village\u2019s indigenous characteristics. Fig 26. Villagers' vision to the futural community (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 27. Rural art in the village (\u00a9 LCRC) 46 6.3 Methods Based on a systematic assessment of the natural and cultural baseline, a comprehensive project design was developed in terms of spatial planning for agriculture, housing and conservation, proposing measures for eco-farming, research and education. A novel strategy has been designed to address urban-rural interactions, as well as the production and provision of ecosystem services, to ensure their security, integrity and abundance for human well-being, to lead people to rethink the value of ecosystems, and to achieve a harmonious coexistence with nature alongside the co-prosperity of urban and rural areas. Fig 28. Spatial plan of Xunjiansi Village (\u00a9 LCRC) Creating a sponge landscape and improving ecological infrastructure As a first step, measures have been taken to protect and restore the old water conservation systems (Fig. 28). These small-scale systems can conserve water resources and natural run-off patterns, assist with groundwater recharge, rainwater and wastewater purification, flood regulation and storage, as well as meeting daily water production needs. Fig 29. (a) Photo of the area before river management (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 29. (b) Photo of the area after water conservancy (\u00a9 LCRC) 47 Secondly, efforts have been made to reduce the channelling and hardening of rivers, preserve natural watercourses, maintain aquatic habitats, reduce NPS pollution and recharge groundwater supplies. Thirdly, the project included conservation and restoration efforts of the inlet and its respective forests at the intersection of the village\u2019s water systems. Preserving the inlet and its surrounding forests could help regulate the local microclimate, while contributing to the capacity for soil and water conservation, wind protection and sand fixation.

Site research and study event (\u00a9 LCRC) 48 6.4 Outcomes Enhanced ecosystem services The Wangshan Lifestyle explored conservation options, improved local ecosystems and promoted the construction of a sponge city. These activities played an important role in improving the structures and functions of hydrological ecosystems to enhance the ecosystem service of water regulation, thereby addressing the water issue in a comprehensive, systematic and sustainable manner. Significant increase in community development and income A mechanism for the rural revitalization of local communities has been sought through a sustainable model, without absolute reliance on public finance. Firstly, local per capita income in Xunjiansi village has increased by 71% from 2015 to 2021. Second, high-quality agricultural products with higher prices have been developed. For example, black tea was originally produced with chemical fertilizers and pesticides and sold for ~ CNY 100 kg -1. After upgrading to organic, safe and traceable tea with local branding, the price has risen to CNY 4,000 kg -1. Third, eco-cultural tourism is booming. In 2015, few artists came to the village for inspiration, but recently the village has seen a growing number of local homestays and visitors. Cultural heritage protection Tangible and intangible cultural heritage has been systematically protected. Residents have gradually realised the value of local ecosystems, culture and landscapes, and have developed a stronger sense of belonging and identity with their homeland. Villagers are more aware of how \u201cclear waters and lush mountains\u201d can become \u201cinvaluable assets\u201d, while understanding and adopting a sustainable lifestyle that depends on healthy natural ecosystems.

The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project succeeded in ensuring water security and reducing disaster risk by improving relevant ecosystem functions and services in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, while reversing environmental degradation and biodiversity loss and facilitating social and economic development. Box 6. Case 6 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9 Juntao Hu 50 This project and approach has promoted the localisation of NbS in China, while providing experience and references for rural development and revitalisation. It provides a successful example of promoting green livelihoods and lifestyles in rural communities, establishing healthy relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being by creating a sustainable and replicable model. After comparing with the criteria of the NbS Global Standard through self-assessment, we summarise the areas that are strongly related to the Standard and the areas for improvement of the case, which may be considered for referral to practitioners. In this case, the project has a clear objective to address the societal challenges of disaster risk reduction and economic and social development. During the planning and design phase, the design team conducted in-depth interviews in Xunjiansi village and identified the villagers\u2019 suffering from flooding, low incomes, labour shortages and a weak sense of belonging. To improve the living environment and revitalise the village, the team ensured that the provision of ecosystem services such as water regulation, erosion control, sediment retention, food production, recreation and culture were enhanced to achieve the design objectives. According to the Standard, the project adequately addresses the indicators in Criterion 1 in terms of understanding the societal challenges facing the village and the rights holders and beneficiaries.

For example, NbS have been adopted in the EU and the US and have been effectively researched in areas such as sustainable agriculture, which focuses on holistic planning and design; climate-smart agriculture, which supports adaptation to climate change; carbon farming, which aims to sequester carbon in the atmosphere; and regenerative agriculture, which responds to the problems of modern agriculture. One of the world\u2019s three major black soil belts - the black soil of Northeast China - is mainly found in the Liaohe, Songnen, and Sanjiang plains. Natural black soils develop organically on the gravel and clay layers of the Tertiary-Quaternary-Pleistocene or Holocene, while the region\u2019s unique climate, hydrological conditions, and vegetation types have laid the foundation for the ac- cumulation of organic matter, forming a deep and fertile black soil layer. 17 The formation and development of black soils are extremely slow, taking on av- erage ~200-600 years for each 1cm of black soil to form, and is therefore con- sidered an extremely scarce resource. 18 The black soils in this particular region are some of the most fertile in the world, characterized by high carbon content, porosity, and ploughability. They are used as a major base for commodity grain production in China, covering 36 million hectares, or a quarter of the country\u2019s total arable land, making the black soil region a critical and central part of ensuring national food security. 19 However, traditional plowing techniques destroy the protective layer of straw on the surface and alter soil microorganisms and animal communities, in addition to deteriorating the ecological and productive functions of the soil. Therefore, to protect soil ecology and productivity, China has widely adopted a sustainable agricultural NbS method developed, practiced, and promoted by the China Agricultural University (CAU) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), known as the \u201cLishu model\u201d. 54 Due to years of intensive farming and excessive nutrient inputs, the black soils are now subject to severe wind and water erosion, significant amounts of dust are released into the air during spring ploughing and a significant amount of topsoil, which is essential for agriculture, is lost. In areas of high gully erosion, gullies are cut and torn into the land, causing a range of problems including thinning of the topsoil layer, significant reduction in topsoil organic matter and deterioration of soil structure and function. The result is a serious threat to the sustainable health of black soils and thus to national food security. 20 7.2 Main objectives This project aims to safeguard food security by implementing conservation tillage to recover and conserve black soil, which has come to be known as the panda of farmland. a b c d Fig 35.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bda2d51a-f155-4545-a9f4-53c61590f567": {"__data__": {"id_": "bda2d51a-f155-4545-a9f4-53c61590f567", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52f1cda58a4a01ea2ffefb1ac221262ffe80eeba3ed2c760ad211a072cf728e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a456fd1c-ef9a-459e-9831-d65a71ad6871", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94f1a752653c40c77c2283509b76c3bf3dbb0cf737648f8c0530aaacad835770"}}, "hash": "8062697c4a5cc8c4eac61ccf78ff11052dd11496806c2bf80f3a7b54f140273b", "text": "a b c d Fig 35.

In addition, short periods of heavy rainfall in summer can easily generate run-off on hills and gentle slopes, washing away surface soils and creating more gullies that fragment farmland or severely damage the ecosystem, which are the main causes of black soil degradation. Layers of mulched straw, on the other hand, act like a blanket covering the soil, effectively reducing wind and water erosion, limiting run-off and reducing the formation and development of gullies. It is also favourable to the treatment of erosion gullies. Compared to conventional farming practices, conservation tillage can reduce runoff by an average of 60% and soil loss by about 80%. 21 7.3 Methods After more than a decade of research, scientists and researchers from CAU, CAS and other institutions have developed a maize straw mulching cultivation technique (i.e. the \u201cLishu Model\u201d) based on local conditions. With maize straw mulching as the core process, this intervention involves integrated mechanisation of direct seeding, fertilisation, weeding, disease prevention and harvesting processes to effectively protect topsoils and address the key issues of soil degradation caused by maize straw removal on regional black soils. Accordingly, a combination of straw-based mulching methods was used to achieve multiple benefits, including soil protection, water conservation, resistance to erosion, drought and soil hardening. Overall, the system is simple to operate, cost effective and has great potential to increase yields. Stable and high yields Composting straw results in increased organic matter content and organism health, improved soil structure and higher fertiliser utilisation rates. The combination of these favourable factors can lead to stable and high yields, especially in relatively dry years. In fact, the results of a field trial in Gaojia Village of Lishu Town over more than 10 yrs show that the average yield under the Lishu model was 5-10% higher than that of control groups. 21 Biodiversity conservation Known as an \u201cecosystem engineer\u201d, the earthworm is a consumer, decomposer and regulator in the ecosystem, playing an essential role in improving soil structure, water retention and air permeability, while decomposing soil organic matter, allowing more efficient conversion of soil nutrients and generating more nutrients available for plant growth. Earthworms and worm castings provide a desirable substrate amendment for the growth and reproduction of micro-organisms and soil microbes. Additionally, straw mulching has a significant impact on the number and weight of earthworms, reaching 114 individuals\u00b7m -2 and 18.03 g\u00b7m -2 in this project; whereas the quantity of earthworms per square meter, in the conventional ridge tillage and no-tillage, no-mulching practices were 15 and 19, respectively (without any significant difference in weight). 21 Accordingly, the density of earthworms in the straw-covered field was six times higher than in the conventional ridge and furrow field, which is likely to be a major factor in the observed improvement in soil biological properties. Straw mulching also provides shelter and food for wildlife such as game birds and small mammals, thereby increasing biodiversity. Cost-effectiveness and emissions reduction In the Lishu Model, the completion of a single no-tillage seeder operation, rather than \u2265 2 repeated operations as required in conventional practices, means that fewer machines or man hours are required, or that area coverage could be enhanced within the same amount of time or under lower labor intensity, providing cost-effective options on both operation and production sides. In addition to saving CNY 1,000\u20131,400 \u00b7ha -1, it also reduces the power of agricultural machinery by 15\u201320%, energy consumption by 25\u201330%, and it effectively reduces carbon emissions. 21 56 57 7.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly.

In the process of rapid urbanisation, conflicts between man and nature are increasing, and the downtown or central areas are becoming overcrowded. In addition, urban construction is conventionally dominated by reinforced concrete with inadequate ecological infrastructure, leading to reduced disaster resilience. 61 8.2 Main objectives This project aims to preserve the city\u2019s landscape pattern, improve its ecological areas and strengthen its resilience. It pays particular attention to methods that can help a waterfront city adapt to climate change, sustain economic and social development, and ensure human health. 8.3 Methods Over a large scale, the project ensures the connectivity of the ecological network; whereas across smaller scales, measures were taken to improve the ecological infrastructure, create blue and green ecological spaces, and explore techniques to realize the value of ecological products through urban micro-regeneration. Fig 36. Natural landscape map of Chongqing central districts (\u00a9 LCRC) 62 Strengthening planning and regulation to conserve and restore important ecological space Greater efforts are needed to limit the role of the \u2018Three Lines\u2019 (namely the Ecological Conservation Red Lines, the Permanent Basic Farmland, and the Urban Growth Boundaries developed by the Territory Development Plan) in preserving and enhancing important nature reserves and urban eco-spaces. The Jinyun Mountain Nature Reserve, located on the banks of the Jialing River, is a natural ecological barrier to the centre of Chongqing; however, villagers liv- ing within the reserve have been engaged in unsustainable resource extraction. In June 2018, several measures were taken to address these issues, including the demolition of illegally constructed infrastructure to restore green spaces, the reclamation of mining areas, and the sustainable management of lakes and reservoirs. As a result, the Jinyun Mountains have been restored to their \u201cgreen lung\u201d and natural barrier status. Fig 37.

In turn, the island\u2019s natural habitat was restored, preserving Chongqing\u2019s unique ecological landscape. Fig 38. (a) Aerial photo of Guangyang Islet 63 Fig 38.

Original ecological areas have been transformed into green urban infrastructures. By transforming and greening such \u2018gray\u2019 infrastructure, the city increases the amount of urban green space within its limited area to the maximum extent possible. Restoring the urban ecology by exploiting its topographical features and water flow Measures have been taken to improve surface infiltration and reduce run-off. Specifically, ecological restoration is coordinated to increase the city\u2019s stormwater capacity according to runoff evolution laws. Building parks as a method of buffering relations between people and nature within cities The original site of the Dafosi Wetland Park in Tongnan consisted mainly of tidal flats carved out by the Fu River, mostly sand and gravel, with severe water infiltration, where the riverbanks were built as hardened flood defences.

New development land for business purposes will not be approved until land quotas have been purchased to create market demand; while idle and abandoned development land in rural areas, nature reserves and other areas with important ecological functions must be reclaimed as qualified farmland, forest or grassland before land quotas are issued and economic value is generated through market transactions. 2) Forest Cover Quota Trading Mechanisms. As forest cover is a compulsory target, areas that do not meet the target are allowed to purchase quotas from compliant areas. 65 3) Horizontal Ecological Compensation Mechanism. Districts or counties from upper and lower reaches signed agreements for a two-way compensation system based on the water quality at the river confluence to improve the ecological environment of the downstream areas and increase the fiscal revenues of the upstream areas. 8.4 Outcomes Improvement of ecological benefits through increasing biodiversity There has been a significant increase in biodiversity thanks to ecological restoration efforts, which have been tailored to each ecosystem and have been implemented accordingly. In total, 22 national wetland parks have been established in Chongqing, and the protected wetlands cover an area of 207,200 ha, recording 563 species of vertebrates and 707 species of higher plants. Generation of social benefits through improved urban ecological landscapes As part of efforts to restore urban ecology, 1,263 urban parks (total area 15,834.55 ha) have been built, 45% of which are located in central districts, covering 7,142 ha. From 2018 to 2020, 92 community sports and cultural parks will be built on the undeveloped urban areas to meet the leisure and exercise needs of nearly 3.5 million residents. From 2019 to 2020, 1,198.9 ha of green spaces were added on slopes and precipices in central districts. Enhanced economic benefits through natural capital gains in urban and rural areas From 2018 to 2021, the city traded 286 ha of reclaimed land through the land quota trading mechanism, with a total trade turnover of CNY 801 million [1]. In March 2019, Jiangbei District and Youyang County signed the country\u2019s first horizontal ecological compensation agreement to improve forest cover, with the former paying the latter CNY 187.5 million for a quota of 5,000 ha of forested land. As of January 2021, the city has traded a total of 12,800 ha of forest cover quo- tas through the trading mechanism, with a total trading volume of CNY 480 mil- lion [2]. By the end of 2019, Chongqing has established the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism for 19 secondary rivers with a watershed area of \u2265 500 km 2 and covering \u2265 2 districts and counties, with a total compensation fund of CNY 96.918 million. 66 8.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. This case is unique among all case studies since it is a city regeneration project, with some ecological restoration, conservation and sustainable management. The project aims to reconstruct the relationship between human and nature, reducing disaster risk and safeguard water security. It has enhanced ecosystem functions and services of climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention, refugia and recreation. According to the Standard, the project has adequately matched Criterion 2 focusing on designing at scale and Criterions 6 focusing on balance trade-offs. However, the project should have more emphasis on engaging stakeholders, especially the residents, to improve inclusive governance (Criterion 5).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a552bfc9-d228-42e2-bc56-899c44f0d8c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a552bfc9-d228-42e2-bc56-899c44f0d8c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "318abf7f744825819bdf76fba5d7ce3698eb50f96b24c2854a104e0dd3a08f51"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b60cde7-a0a4-44a6-9196-35aa81cb3a9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dccc821496a5ae567fd003acc47702509d4aefd2bf9bb38cdad0f5644bd60f2"}}, "hash": "aedcdcc8527c463c3a7306f54b16e892fc1d96186989dbaecf84f665e5f1a3a9", "text": "Moreover, it should consider improving the co-relation and synergy among all the NbS projects in Chongqing and the corresponding ecosystems.

The city is rich in natural resources and has three important marine ecosystems - mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs - with rich biodiversity, ecosystem services and high research value. Beihai Binhai National Wetland Park is a typical example of a \u2018freshwater- estuary-coastal\u2019 complex wetland ecosystem, and serve as the central \u2018green lungs\u2019 and core green corridor of the city. The wetland park contains nine spe- cies of mangrove resources under national protection, 17 species of endangered flora and fauna, and 86 species and 38 species of migratory birds jointly protect- ed by Sino-Japan and Sino-Australia [1]. Beihai is characterised by a subtropical marine monsoon climate influenced by monsoon circulation and complex meteorological systems. Various types of meteorological disasters, such as droughts, floods and typhoons, occur simultaneously or in succession, seriously threatening local economic and environmental security, as well as people\u2019s lives and property. 23,24 The rapid development of urbanisation, coastal industrialisation, aquaculture and tourism has created a number of problems in this region. Sewage discharges are a continuous source of pollution and increased siltation in many parts of the waters. 25-27 Coastal wetland ecosystems have been degraded, natural shorelines disconnected, mangrove areas reduced, biodiversity lost, and urban flooding increased. In response, the Beihai Municipal Government has implemented a land-sea coordinated pollution control and ecological restoration programme based on the principle of urban development through ecological approaches. 9.2 Main objectives The project aims to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, while proposing to reduce vulnerability and disaster risk through the restoration of mangrove ecosystems and coastal wetlands. It has also promoted the construction of sponge cities to improve water storage capacity to combat urban waterlogging. 69 9.3 Methods While targeting water pollution control and sponge city development, ecological restoration has been carried out according to the characteristics of coastal ecosystems, local conditions and spatial design. Efforts have also been made to promote eco-tourism and eco-product development. Fig 39.

The ecological restoration of freshwater wetlands in the upper and middle reaches of the Fengjiajiang River included the removal of cement weirs to restore natural ecological exchange, and the increase of vegetation along slopes and aquatic plants to enhance purification function and biodiversity. Similarly, freshwater ponds have been transformed into ecological wetlands with pollution trapping and purification functions. The ecological restoration of the brackish water environment in the lower reach of the Fengjiajiang River was undertaken based on a method of self-renewal. Hard weirs were replaced by local associate mangroves favorable to water quality improvement, such as Barringtonia racemosa, and Heritiera littoralis Dryand. These species also provide habitats for birds. Native palms were planted in areas surrounding the estuary as they are saline\u2013alkali resistant, maintain adaptability to harsh environments, and are resistant to typhoons. Fig 40.

(b) Photo of the fish ponds after rehabilitation (\u00a9 LCRC) 71 Mangrove forest conservation and restoration entailed the closure of beaches for afforestation, tending to young and middle-aged stands, and planting of local mangrove species (primarily Avicennia marina and Kandelia candel) to conserve the native mangrove diversity, while restoring the biodiversity and stability of wetland ecosystems. To date, about 24.7 ha of mangroves have been successfully restored, and 18 ha of new mangroves have been planted [2]. In addition, non-native mangrove species, such as Laguncularia racemose and Sonneratia apetala have been controlled from further expansion. The restoration of Silver Beach included cleaning up the beach environment, removing seawalls, restoring the shoreline, etc. These activities have helped to strengthen the coastal disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, while improving the natural coastal protection functions of Silver Beach and the overall landscape quality. To date, 7.44 ha of beach and approximately 1.43 km of shoreline have been restored [3]. Fig 41. Grey mangrove \u00a9 Dave Aplin Fig 42. Mangrove forest restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 43. Silver Beach shoreline restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 72 Innovative financing and eco-development To attract private investment, the programme adopted a DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Transfer) model. Initially, the Beihai government and private financiers contributed CNY 76 million and CNY 682 million, respectively, to establish a joint venture company to operate the programme, while the remaining financial gap was filled by bank loans. Under the terms of operation, the municipal government pays CNY320 million each year for the services provided by the programme. Finally, assets in good condition will be transferred to the government free of charge. The programme will improve the environment of Beihai City and the quality of Silver Beach, allowing the public to enjoy improved cultural and recreational services. New development and tourism opportunities may also emerge, promoting sustainable urban development, creating additional jobs and attracting further national and international attention. 9.4 Outcomes Improved water quality To date, an annual reduction of 1,366 tonnes of primary pollutants and 16.5 million tonnes of discharged wastewater has been achieved across the Fengjiajia River Basin, while the quality of surface water, long at Grade V, has risen to or exceeded Grade IV [4]. In addition, the water quality of Silver Beach improved by 40% from 2019 to 2020. Biodiversity gains Initial statistics show that 182 species of coastal birds can now be found across the region, an increase of 46 species since 2017, including the critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper. In addition, the recovery of mudflats is leading to a steady increase in benthic organisms (e.g. peanut worms), from 66 species before 2016 to 153 species. The Chinese horseshoe crab, green turtle and other rare marine species have been found in the estuary, where 17 mangrove species have also been identified [5].

In addition, local communities are becoming more environmentally aware and empowered to prioritise environmental protection as a matter of course. 9.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS Under the programme, efforts have been made to conserve and restore the coastal wetland ecosystem and improve the city\u2019s adaptability to climate change, taking into account the integrity and interrelationship of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. In addition, appropriate measures have been taken to address the problems of this densely populated area, where various issues such as urban wastewater, quality of life, ecotourism and recreation, disaster prevention and mitigation, and socio-economic development need to be addressed. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. Box 9. Case 9 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu 74 In this case, the project aims to address the societal challenges of disaster risk reduction, water security, and economic and social development. It focuses on the water issue, including meteorological disasters and pollution in multiple ecosystems, and restores the site by integrating mangroves, converting fish ponds into wetlands and planting various types of plants to improve water quality. Enhanced ecosystem services include climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control, sediment retention, recreation and culture. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project clearly addresses the challenges of natural disasters, water pollution and wetland degeneration (Criterion 1) in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Fengjiajiang River and other multi-ecosystems (Criterion 2). In addition, according to the natural resource data baseline on the website of the Beihai City Natural Resources Bureau, it is obvious that after the restoration project, the number and species of local birds, benthic organisms and even rare marine animals are increasing in an integrated and connected ecosystem (Criterion 3). Referring to the NbS Global Standard, this project can be improved in terms of economic feasibility (Criterion 4), which considers alternative solutions to ensure the effectiveness of the Beihai City NbS design and analysis, while recording cost-effectiveness studies to measure and monitor the economic variables. In addition, the score for inclusive governance (Criterion 5) is slightly lower than the other criterion scores. It could be suggested that more local residents should be involved in all processes of the NbS intervention and that they should be given more opportunities to express their rights and interests in the project. 23 Huijuan, L.

Bordering both Shenzhen and Hongkong, two of China\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, the wetlands of Shenzhen Bay are the wintering habitat and stopover for one of the world\u2019s nine major bird migratory routes - the East Asian-Australasian Flyway - with some 100,000 migratory birds wintering and passing through each year. To effectively conserve this mangrove wetland ecosystem close to the centre of the megacity, the Shenzhen government has launched a series of coastal mangrove restoration policies in Shenzhen Bay, including mangrove conservation, sustainable management, and restoration, which have led to an increase in the total area of mangrove forests and reversed the trend of mangrove wetland ecosystem degradation. The rapid increase in urbanisation in Shenzhen has been accompanied by a decrease in the mangrove areas. In addition, direct industrial and municipal wastewater discharges have increased harmful pollutants and wetland degradation. Along the coastal estuary, watercourses have been channeled, preventing the exchange of matter and energy between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diked fishponds have also been degraded, reducing the ecological function of providing habitats and feeding grounds for migratory birds. In addition, invasive plant species such as Mikania micrantha and Leucaena leucocephala have taken over large areas, while outbreaks of insect infestations have become more frequent, and local species have been replaced across ecological niches, all of which have led to an oversimplified and increasingly fragile structure of wetland communities. 77 10.2 Main objectives This project aims to improve the disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation capacity of the megacity of Shenzhen through the restoration and conservation of mangrove wetlands. Fig 44. Spatial plan of Shenzhen Bay restoration projects(\u00a9 LCRC) 10.3 Methods The local government has insisted on coordinated land-sea management planning to strengthen environmental protection. For example, improved sewage treatment plants are being built with a pipe system that separates rainwater and sewage. Strict controls are also in place for land-based pollutants, and a number of pioneering pollution treatment projects are being implemented. 28 In terms of ecological restoration and the following criteria, which focus on balancing the needs of wildlife with those of urban development and citizens, pond habitats for aquatic birds have been restored through comprehensive water management. In addition, measures have been taken to prevent and control invasive species, plant diseases and pests, and to restore mangrove forests in order to systematically restore the structure and functions of the mangrove ecosystem in Shenzhen Bay. At the same time, rich and enjoyable nature-related educational activities have been carried out and promoted to increase the interest and participation of the public. To this end, CNY 300 million was invested in the project, of which CNY 270 million came from the central government and CNY 30 million from social investment [1]. 78 Fig 45. (a) Photo of the conventional watercourse (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 45. (b) Photo of the ecological watercourse after restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Water management The Fengtang River is the main river flowing through the Futian Mangrove Wetlands in Shenzhen Bay. As it is highly channelized, little vegetation has been able to grow along the river, resulting in a very limited provision of ecosystem services. To address this problem, the first step was to de-channelize the forms and structures of the watercourses, soften the course of the Fengtang River, and re- construct the banks of the river with its branches, removing rigid structures from the surface, lowering the water level, and reforming the side slopes into a gentle gradient.

By recovering herbaceous communities on the embankment, and providing habitats for the pests\u2019 natural enemies, both the species number and individuals of predatory insects have increased, proving an effective measure for pest and disease prevention. Sparse shrubs and low herbs - such as plants from families Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Compositae, Commelina, Verbena, and Acanthaceae - were planted across vast areas along the buffer zone between mangrove forests and diked fish ponds suitable pest predator habitats. Both heights and densities were reduced in the arboreous communities, creating suitable habitats for insects, including spiders, bees, and flies, while assisting with the recovery of predatory insect numbers of species and individuals. Simultaneously, strong integral connectivity is guaranteed among subsystems of mangrove forests and fishponds, while migratory routes from ponds to mangroves were kept open for the predatory insects to migrate into mangrove forests, and play their essential role in preventing the spread of pests and diseases. 31 Regarding invasive species, alien herbaceous hygrophytes were rooted out through desilting projects, while good-quality local hygrophytes were planted, such as Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. Terrestrial invasive plant species were also artificially removed before supplementing local species, and regular clearing work was conducted throughout the subsequent management on an annual basis to prevent the further spread or growth of invasive species. Specifically, in an attempt to eliminate M. micrantha, the dominant harmful plant species throughout Shenzhen Bay, various ecological control measures were taken, ranging from artificial removal, biological control, and the plant photosynthesis time control. Mangroves and mudflats restoration The mangrove forest restoration project consists of forest plantation and mudflat restoration; these activities have been carried out on an area of 220 ha. in the western estuary of shenzhen bay, work has mainly focused on restoring local mangrove forests, in addition to constructing bird mudflat habitats and artificial mudflats to provide resting places for shorebirds. the reforestation efforts have been effective, with a total of 30.2 hectares of mangrove forests planted to date [1]. 81 Nature related education Thanks to the cooperation of the Futian District Education Bureau, the Futian District Science and Technology Association and the Reserve Authority, MCF organised nature-related education courses on a monthly basis and opened them to all schools in Futian.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f31a25a-dc26-4f59-aa84-e15a18026b07": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f31a25a-dc26-4f59-aa84-e15a18026b07", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b841522863eba88df6ed4c0b72d1ecde91fe7429128c5425b50ea6cf00c98cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "46c1108c-a39c-4195-a205-06314d3aeec8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f67e12cd13da4a1322daa38d23effb1771432653c7bcf50389f50208cd0b8508"}}, "hash": "b7773af5359eec2d172963fe12a7d9cecc72589f00f9c930ccfec780e491004f", "text": "More than 200,000 citizens, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school students, participated in these educational events.

In addition, close cooperation between the two megacities can be seen in the annual Shenzhen-Hongkong Coastal Wetlands Conservation Forum and the Shenzhen River Governance Project, jointly launched by the two governments, which has successively completed the desilting of waterways, embankment reinforcement, sewage outfall rehabilitation and water surface sanitation. 82 10.4 Outcomes Increasing biodiversity Within the restoration area, mangrove wetlands have recovered from loss of function, and biodiversity has shown a consistent increase. Namely, the richness of Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Bruguiera gymnorhiza has increased with a vegetation coverage > 95%. There has also been a remarkable increase in both the number and diversity of species, particularly following the restoration of fish ponds into bird habitats. Through a series of successive restoration actions, the project is playing an important role in maintaining the ecological status and value of Shenzhen Bay on migratory bird flyways. In particular, the restoration project has led to a positive and steady increase in the number of endangered Platalea minor, with the global population increasing from 825 in 2000 to 4864 in 2020, and from 135 to 361 in Shenzhen Bay alone. Carbon sequestration and climate regulation The method, as proposed by the Blue Carbon Initiative jointly published by Conservation International (CI), the IUCN, and United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2014, has been localized in and applied to Futian Reserve. Results have shown that in Shenzhen Bay, each hectare of mangrove forests absorbs about 40 tCO2\u00b7yr -1 from the atmosphere, highlighting the crucial role mangroves play in carbon fixation, mitigating climate change, and helping achieve carbon neutrality. 32 Moreover, the wide and open water surface of Shenzhen Bay has had vast areas of mangrove forests restored. Accordingly, the cooling effect and direct regulation of climate contributed by water vaporization and plant transpiration greatly mitigate the urban heat from nearby Shenzhen. Achieving human-nature harmony The mangrove forest ecosystem restoration project has succeeded in maintaining the harmony and connectivity between the restoration zone and the surrounding areas, while establishing a natural link between the sea and the city, and between birds and people, thus promoting the synthetic functions of coastal wetland ecosystems. In addition, the project will highlight the characteristics of coastal wetlands and mangroves throughout Shenzhen Bay, enhancing the value of both the environment and human settlements, while contributing to the development of surrounding areas. 83 At present, the coastal mangrove wetlands in Shenzhen Bay serve as a demonstration of how to build an environmentally friendly city, as well as a famous scenic spot for citizens and visitors at home and abroad, providing services such as sightseeing, leisure and science popularisation to more than 10 million visitors every year. 10.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project focuses on addressing the societal challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss. Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves are successfully restored, enhancing the provision of ecosystem functions and services related to climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention, recreation, and culture.

An important aspect of the project is the implementation of local and national mangrove conservation and restoration policies. Together with other similar activities, this project contributes to the establishment of the International Mangrove Centre in Shenzhen, facilitating global action and research on mangrove conservation.

[In Chinese] Data sources: [1] Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Natural Resources 85 General reflections It is important to reiterate that all these case studies were designed and implemented before NbS achieved its current global recognition. This means that although these were established with the intent of incorporating the use and management of ecosystems, they were not designed as NbS per se! However, this still provides an excellent opportunity to consider how close these interventions are to NbS best practice and thereby raise awareness and build capacity by reflecting on the project planning according to the NbS criteria. The overall results are encouraging while noting there is still scope for improvement. We consulted with Yan Zhou, Yan Chen and Chongyao Yang, the authors of most of the case studies (i.e. Case 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10) from the MNR\u2019s Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Centre (LCRC), about the significance of the standard for ecological projects. They praised the NbS Standard for its reference value, particularly in terms of its focus on social benefits, design at scale, stakeholder involvement, trade-offs and adaptive management. They also felt that the localisation process of NbS in China should create more specific and locally adapted guidance for the use of the NbS Global Standard, to make it easier to implement in practice. It is noted that an International Standard Committee exists to provide guidance on how the Standard can be used consistently across a range of different national and local conditions. In 2021, LCRC experts organised NbS self-assessment meetings for several ecological projects, including the case of Fuxian Lake, and drafted a preliminary Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for self-assessment. The experts suggest that NbS self-assessment should be embedded in the project cycle and carried out at least three times for the planning, mid-implementation and post-implementation phases. In general, if self-assessment is carried out during the planning phase, project documentation can be strengthened and used for decision making. Meanwhile, it can also enhance stakeholder empowerment through better awareness and approaches to stakeholder identification and engagement. In addition, current ecological conservation and restoration projects in China often focus on efforts on ecosystems and species rather than treating societal challenges as a primary goal, while the self-assessment leads to more consideration of social benefits. 86 Although the principles of ecological projects in China are not entirely consistent with the NbS Global Standard, the basic concepts are consistent from a theoretical perspective, even if the application of the principles in practice is a weakness and a difficulty. For example, the latest official guideline for ecological conservation and restoration projects issued in 2020 requires projects to be planned and designed at the landscape scale. However, the general situation for large projects in China is that although the provincial government usually coordinates the main project, the sub-projects are submitted by different departments, resulting in fragmentation with different objectives, which can distract from the overall objective. In some projects, local governments have established joint meeting mechanisms or joint working groups to try to improve coordination between different departments, but the process is still arduous and lengthy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63027920-4f3c-4b1e-bd18-4cd9ac261817": {"__data__": {"id_": "63027920-4f3c-4b1e-bd18-4cd9ac261817", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Quadros legal, pol\u00edticos e institucional para a gest\u00e3o dos pl\u00e1sticos marinhos em Mo\u00e7ambique", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac47229fa3359812441a4ffd592f7648513d63d99ea216dd0b7fde52ff272bab"}, "2": {"node_id": "e36a9cc0-d656-45b0-b028-4629d76e3831", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/pt/resources/grey-literature/quadros-legal-politicos-e-institucional-para-gestao-dos-plasticos", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96f7972958d8f38c03243ba09ac0ed479f610d8aeef06b185f043022f17a847e"}}, "hash": "381f3b2c926929281bbadab5f1e945d9be3ed2f246b3c90ba7c4ccbd9b343894", "text": "In general, the majority of ecological projects in China are led by the central government from a top-down approach and implemented by all levels of government, which has the unique characteristic of being designed on a large scale compared to those promoted from the bottom up.

In addition, adaptive management is an emerging concept for the management system of large-scale ecological projects, and ecological conservation and restoration projects in China still apply the management mechanism of engineering projects. The significance of the NbS concept and the Global Standard is to raise the awareness of adaptive management to deal with the dynamics of ecosystems by decision makers and practitioners to leverage transformative change. 87 The authors suggest that the NbS Global Standard provides strong supportive framework for ecological projects from both a conceptual and operational perspective. Applying the standard during both design and implementation can highlight where best practice is being achieved and these areas where improvements and corrective actions can help strengthen the ability of the project to address societal challenges. Additional detailed and pragmatic guidance for NbS interventions in China, such as technical guidelines, monitoring standards, effectiveness assessment guidelines and adaptive management standards, are now needed for practical application of the Standard. In addition to the cases themselves, the publication of this report also represents knowledge management of these projects through a collaboration between IUCN and Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC. In this way, we promote a deeper understanding of the NbS Global Standard among all interested parties, and share Chinese practices and experiences on a global scale. 33 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2023).

They are presented here under one of three broad categories: natural, agricultural or urban types of ecosystems. Based on the case studies results, it can be concluded that the several key elements required for successful \u201cNature-based Solutions\u201d interventions are already commonly represented in project design, notably clarity of purpose, design at scale and biodiversity net gain. Areas that appear to be more likely to be overlooked and therefore required attention at the design stage are inclusion of stakeholders, adaptive management, recognition, balancing of trade-offs. Overall, we can conclude that a solid foundation already exists in the country Case study 2: Landscape restoration and sustainable management in the Helan Mountains This case study focuses on restoring the natural ecosystem functions of the mountains to improve safety, ecology and landscape. The overall functionality of these ecosystems has been gradually improved by reducing anthropogenic threats (e.g. mining and overgrazing), restoring ecological corridors and improving landscape connectivity. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has an adequate fit with identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and attaining net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). However, it should seek to improve the trade-offs balancing (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). In further, it is critical to develop an inter-provincial cooperation mechanism or strategy, as the landscape is cross-jurisdictional. Case study 3: Building a community of life in the Fuxian Lake Watershed This case study focuses on the protection of the hydro-ecological environment of the Fuxian Lake Watershed in an effort to safeguard the ecological environment and water security of the Pearl River Basin and to support coordinated rural and urban development in central Yunnan. Through overall spatial planning and site-specific interventions, including reforestation, structural adjustment of agriculture, riparian restoration and conservation and management of the lake, a socio-economic-natural complex system has been developed that provides improved ecosystem functions and services. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case can strongly meet the indicators especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and attaining net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). Additionally, it also adequately fit to Criterion 7 & 8. However, the project can improve its consideration of trade-offs regard to ecological and social aspects. viii After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has an adequate fit with identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and achieving net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3). However, it should seek to improve the stakeholder communication and engagement (Criterion 5), trade-offs balancing (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7) of the project. Case study 4: Conservation and restoration for food, water, and people in the Ulansuhai Nur Watershed This case study focuses on improving water security and preventing wind erosion and desertification. It has been implemented to conserve and restore various desert, farmland, mountain, grassland and river ecosystems. In addition, a special financial mechanism has been set up to facilitate private investment. After years of management and restoration, the eco-environmental quality, as well as biodiversity of Ulansuhai Nur Watershed were significantly improved. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has partly fit to the indicators, such as identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1) and designing at scale (Criterion 2). However, the project should improve the long-term stability of funding, so as to ensure stakeholder interests (Criterion 4), developing strategies for stakeholder engagement (Criterion 5) and adaptive management (Criterion 7).

Case study 6: Nature-based revitalization of Xunjiansi Village in Wuyuan County, Jiangxi This case study focuses on the establishment of a community socio-economic development model based on ecosystem services and goods (e.g. tourism), research and practice through the protection and restoration of ancient water harvesting facilities and farmland ecosystems. The outcomes include village revitalisation, enhanced conservation and efficient use of natural resources, effectively contributing to addressing societal challenges (socio-economic development and disaster risk reduction), while enriching the knowledge base of NbS with traditional knowledge and local expertise from China. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has a strong fit with the indicators, particularly in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2), involving local communities (Criterion 5) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). It also performs well in ensuring sustainability and mainstreaming (Criterion 8). The project could improve in terms of analysing trade-offs (Criterion 6) at the planning stage. Case study 7: Ensuring food security through conservation and the sus- tainable use of black soils in Jilin This case study focuses on the development of a nature-based farming model in line with the concept of conservation agriculture by incorporating correlated, locally specific measures. These efforts have effectively protected black soils, increased the organic matter and carbon storage capacity of arable land, while facilitating an integrated response to food security and climate change mitigation. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that it can strongly adapt to the indicators, especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6) and adaptive management (Criterion 7). The project could add more considerations regarding the early involvement of the local community (Criterion 5). x Part 3: NbS in urban ecosystems Three case studies are presented, focusing on urban areas and emphasising the introduction of NbS in cities. These aim to build an integrated and coherent ecological system within cities, improve ecosystem services in urban areas and enhance the resulting adaptive capacity of cities to climate change. Case study 8: Integrating nature-based approaches for urban regeneration and development in Chongqing This case study focuses on local ecological space conservation and urban regeneration. Through the sustainable use and management of natural resources, the societal challenges effectively addressed by this project include disaster risk reduction, socio-economic development and water security. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case has some strengths in terms of designing at city scale (Criterion 2), achieving biodiversity net-gain (Criterion 3) and balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6). The project could consider about alternative approaches (Criterion 4) and improve its strategy for adaptive management (Criterion 7) to maintain the ecosystem function and services.change. Case study 9: Coordinated coastal restoration and management for sus- tainable development of Beihai City, Guangxi This case study focuses on ecological restoration, systematic water pollution control and sponge city development to create a coastal wetland-urban complex system. Restoration is proposed according to zoning and specific measures for reservoirs, rivers, beaches and the sea. The project has improved water quality, biodiversity, disaster risk reduction capacity and the well-being of local communities. security. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard, we believe that this case can strongly meet the indicators especially in terms of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1), designing at scale (Criterion 2) and achieving net biodiversity gain (Criterion 3).

Sponge cities: An answer to flood. http://chinawaterrisk.org/resources/analysis- reviews/sponge-cities-an-answer-to-floods/ Introduction In recent years, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have gained increasing attention at a global scale, given their potential to address some of the most pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, water security, disaster risk reduction and human health. Countries, organisations, experts, and decision-makers around the world have interpreted and discussed the concept from different perspectives. According to IUCN, NbS are \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d. NbS differ from traditional approaches and perceptions that rely upon engineering or technological solutions to solve environmental problems.

Recently, large-scale ecological conservation and restoration programmes have been planned and implemented in China, leading to the emergence of various worthwhile practices in line with NbS. The aim of this publication is to present ten case studies and share Chinese practical experience and knowledge in planning and implementing interventions to address various societal challenges, protect the planet and help reverse trends of ecological degradation and biodiversity loss. While these interventions aimed to be NbS, the Global Standard for NbS had not yet been developed when they were planned and implemented. Therefore, this publication provides a detailed description of these ten case studies and a list of lessons learned from the case study managers and authors on how the Global Standard for NbS would have retrospectively helped to improve or ensure a more successful NbS intervention. Nature-based Solutions are an emerging framework recognised by many stakeholders as essential to achieving sustainable development. Launched in 2020, the Global Standard for NbS will be reviewed by the next World Conservation Congress. This publication will help to better understand how NbS is being implemented in China, and the findings and examples will provide insights that will contribute to the upcoming revision of the Global Standard. Given the limited time and knowledge available, this report will inevitably include factors that require further elaboration, and we welcome all comments and suggestions from readers. 2 3 Case study 1: Holistic management and restoration of the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, to safeguard Beijing's water security Authors: Ming Luo, Xu Zhou, Yan Zhou, Chongyao Yang Societal challenges addressed: Ecosystems: F1 Rivers and streams F3 Artificial fresh waters F3.1 Large reservoirs F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands T7.1 Annual croplands T7.3 Plantations Ecosystem services enhanced: Water supply Erosion control and sediment retention Refugia Water security Economic and social development Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss Sustainable Development Goals addressed: Total financing: CNY 2.213 billion Implementation period: 2016-present NbS type approaches implemented: Ecosystem restoration Ecological engineering Ecosystem-based management \u00a9Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC Map data \u00a92022 Tianditu, MNR of the PRC & NavInfo 4 1.1 General background and challenges to address The Sanggan River and the Yang River converge to form the Yongding River in Huailai County of Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, where it flows into the Guanting Reservoir, an important source of water for Beijing. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed covers an area of 280 km 2 and plays a significant role in runoff regulation and storage for flood control and disaster risk reduction. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed is also of high value for biodiversity. Based on the data collected by the Shan Shui Conservation Center and Peking University, various wildlife species have been identified and classified according to the IUCN Red List, including one critically endangered, one endangered, and seven vulnerable species. In addition, 5 first-class and 26 second-class Chinese state protected animals were identified. The Guanting Reservoir Watershed also serves as a stopover for migratory birds along the East Asian-Australasian flyway. In recent decades, the watershed has faced several environmental challenges: Firstly, in the mountainous areas of the headwaters, quarrying for mining has damaged the massif and contributed to soil erosion; secondly, agricultural and domestic wastes from villages upstream of the Yongding River has caused water pollution; furthermore, in the floodplains, large areas of land have been haphazardly reclaimed for maize cultivation, resulting in severe non-point source pollution from the application of chemical fertilisers; finally, on the banks of the reservoir, riparian ecosystems have been degraded and suffer from poor integrity, connectivity, and habitat fragmentation. 1.2 Main objectives This project aims to safeguard the water security of Beijing through the holistic management of ecosystems such as rivers, streams, and wetlands in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, thereby enhancing the ecosystem services of water regulation, supply, and filtration. Moreover, the planned restoration of the riparian buffer zone can effectively reduce the risk of flooding and the damage it causes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f32b18d-bed3-47f6-a568-8ac0e8307e56": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f32b18d-bed3-47f6-a568-8ac0e8307e56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d829947101b29155b1636043ec0e9f18bb7c1d14834044c115d352a0b960ad04"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7dde2ff-23df-4113-8b93-c67a46b196c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d20122482f8d822aad54a80ae5baad0deb4571abedf88b5f471586ea8851adc1"}}, "hash": "067b93d9c0619730f659c76d65097f0ef7b83cb02145a4e3eba20065793a4d39", "text": "5 1.3 Methods Preparatory activities To reduce the threat to the ecosystems in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, pollution from 300 illegal polluters was banned at over 400 sites, including racecourses, restaurants, and farmyards.

Fig 2. Illustration of the ecological restoration project in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed (\u00a9 LCRC) Ecological restoration Rehabilitation of mining sites 30 quarries in the northern and southern mountains were closed. Vegetation restoration took place at 128 mining sites. The seven mines that remained in operation were required to fully comply with \u201cGreen Mining Standards\u201d during production [1]. Special bonds worth CNY 375 million were acquired from the local government for the management of the high-steep slope. In addition, various companies had joined forces to restore the high-steep slope. Restoring vegetation and connecting ponds Along the north bank of the reservoir and the entrance, 667 ha of grass and over 60 ha of arbors and shrubs have been planted. Over 33.3 ha of wetland ponds have been constructed to create a tree-grass-water ecosystem and improve water conservation. 6 Restoring river habitat connectivity and natural patterns The restoration of the Yang, Sanggan and Yongding Rivers led to the simultaneous restoration of the river flow. At the same time, the natural patterns of the rivers were restored using ecological engineering, vertical design and micro-topography reconstruction tools. Emphasis was placed on the spatial diversity and structural heterogeneity of the watercourses, and the original meanders, pools and shallows were identified. Fig 3. Original appearance of the mine (\u00a9 LCRC) Agricultural adaptation Some 6,667 ha of maize and other crops were converted to vineyards. This has increased financial income and reduced the use of chemicals by 2,800 tonnes [1]. Fig 4. (a) Photo of the area before restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 4. (b) Photo of the area after vegetation restoration and puddles connection engineering (\u00a9 LCRC) 7 Creation of an ecological buffer zone around the reservoir An ecological buffer zone 30-100m wide has been created around the Guanting Reservoir, consisting of wetlands reclaimed from farmland and aquaculture farms, and vegetation belts of arbors, shrubs and herbs. 7 With a total area of 20 km 2, the buffer zone effectively purifies surface runoff flowing into the reservoir. To avoid single-species selection and the introduction of alien species, moisture-resistant shrub and local arbor species were planted. Biodiversity conservation In the riparian area of the reservoir, the project makes full use of the gently sloping banks and shallow water to artificially adjusts the micro-topography thereby creating create more habitats suitable for a variety of waterfowl. Aquatic vegetation has been restored over large areas, in places where the water flow is smooth and the water level stable. Conversely, in ecologically degraded areas of tidal wetlands, different types of habitat have been created for different water birds to live, feed and breed. When creating the vegetation belts, bulbs and berries were deliberately restored to provide food sources for the birds. In addition, at the confluence of the Yang and Sanggan Rivers, the topography of the wide estuary was adjusted to increase the water area, providing habitats for various waterfowl. Artificial floating islands have been constructed in key water quality control areas to provide additional footholds for birds. Twelve wind turbines that had a negative impact on birds were phased out [1]. Fig 5. (a) Aerial photo of the riparian area before ecological buffer zone construction (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 5. (b) Aerial photo of the riparian area after ecological buffer zone construction (\u00a9 LCRC) 8 1.4 Outcomes Water security has improved since the implementation of the holistic management intervention. In addition to the reduction of non-point source pollution, the purification capacity of ecosystems has been strengthened, and the water quality of the Guanting Reservoir Watershed has steadily improved. Since 2019, water monitoring has shown that water quality has reached Class III, according to the national standard. Fertiliser use has been reduced by 2892.4 t/a, pesticide use by 16.45 t/a, COD by 347.46 t/a and NH3-N emission by 69.49 t/a. 8 In addition, ecological integrity and biodiversity have been enhanced. The connectivity of different reservoir ecosystems has been greatly enhanced. The ecological buffer zone functioned well to purify surface runoff. After the restoration intervention, the number of plant species increased from 106 to 318.

The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project managed to safeguard water security and reduce disaster risk by improving relevant ecosystems functions and services in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, seeking to simultaneously reverse environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, and facilitate social and economic development. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project meets the indicators in Criterion 1 focusing on the societal challenges, and effective interventions were planned and implemented. It has made an effort to increase ecosystems integrity, connectivity and resilience by restoration, addressing environmental problems by reducing pollution and removing the real estate projects and wind turbine generators that have negative impacts on birds and their habitats. Hence, the project manages to restore the vegetation, and enhance the provision off ecosystem functions and services - water supply, erosion control, sediment retention and refugia. 5b Box 1. Case 1 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu 10 The project\u2019s strength are underlined with Criterion 1 focusing on identifying and responding to societal challenges, Criterion 3 on seeking opportunities to conserve biodiversity. In addition, several aspects can be improved in accordance with NbS Global Standard, such as Criterion 5 that focuses on stakeholders\u2019 participation and engagement in the project, at the design, planning and implementation stages, to ensure that their benefits can be taken into account. In addition, to meet Criterion 4, the project team should conduct cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis to alternative approaches, and attach importance to documentation about relevant processes and activities, and develop an active publicity strategy. 7 Construction Plan for Demonstration County of Huailai County Ecological Civilization Construction (2020 - 2022).

In fact, the project is included in the third batch of national pilot projects for ecological protection and restoration of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes and grasslands, with a budgeted investment of CNY 5.366 billion and an additional CNY 2 billion in awards and subsidies from the central government [1]. The relatively fragile ecosystem of the Helan Mountains is located in a transitional zone between arid and semi-arid regions. This natural ecological fragility has been exac- erbated by extensive human disturbance, such as high intensity grazing and long- term continuous open-cut and underground mining. Following the establishment of the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, rapidly expanding populations of blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) have led to overgrazing of the local vegetation.

As one of China\u2019s biodiversity hotspots and an important industrial base for energy and raw materials in northwestern China, the Helan Mountains are home to rich species of flora, fauna and underground mineral resources, including 1,900 species of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4422b75-e386-413b-b0b7-61705dc7890a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4422b75-e386-413b-b0b7-61705dc7890a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fe72ce157de1c20fbc48068045be3583532eaf54bb79d3044018ba94600fcfa"}, "3": {"node_id": "c158b3c0-ff98-44fd-bc3f-3c62c95a80d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60dd17a4bd2dfccdc7b76eb03eeb897e9949571bff0a02a788a96d117ecff69e"}}, "hash": "7928eb01ddb55040aa53d86a9f29fba8b92dbdd562e4f0ae11f8f3856a559950", "text": "insects and 352 species of terrestrial vertebrates, 58 of which are on China\u2019s List of Wild Animals under State Priority Conservation (7 and 51 first and second class state protected animals, respectively). 13 5a 2.2 Main objectives The project aims to safeguard water security and combat desertification through the ecological restoration of abandoned mines. As a result, local mining industries and communities are shifting their livelihoods towards agroforestry and ecotourism. In addition, an increase in local species has been observed due to the restoration of grasslands from grazing and afforestation of hillsides. 2.3 Methods The project proposes to restore degraded landscapes and reduce human threats for the benefit of safety, ecology and landscape, to restore degraded ecosystems, increase the degree of wilderness, reconnect landscape patches and improve environmental connectivity to restore the overall functionality of the natural ecosystems of the Helan Mountains. Closure of mining sites In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, such remediation has been carried out on more than 150 km 2, with 122 mining sites closed and 169 human activity sites remediated inside the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, as well as 45 sites on the reserve\u2019s periphery that seriously affect the local ecology, and two concentrated coal processing plants. In addition, the policy of \u2018returning pastureland to grassland\u2019 has resulted in the restoration of natural vegetation within the protected area. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone, a total of seven mines in the Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve, covering 176 ha, have been withdrawn. 9,10 Fig 8.

(b) Eurasian sparrowhawk \u00a9 Petr Saj Large-scale restoration of damaged ecosystems To reduce the disaster potential of landslides and floods, measures such as geological disaster elimination, management of abandoned mines, and improvement of flood control channels have been implemented, with priority given to not blocking ecological corridors or migration channels for plants and animals. Measures such as collection of germplasm resources, expansion of rare plant species and protection of water sources have been carried out in headwater and natural areas in the local typical landscapes and mountains to achieve vertical distribution of forest vegetation. Both transplanting and domestication techniques have been carried out to maintain propagating populations of valuable and rare plant communities, including Tetraena mongolica, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, Prunus mongolica, and Glycine soja. In addition, vegetation rehabilitation has been carried out according to rainfall patterns. In montane areas with more than 400 mm/yr rainfall, suitable native tree seeds were sown. In areas with 200-400 mm/yr rainfall, grasses, shrubs and trees were sown, while in areas with less than 200 mm/yr rainfall, rehabilitation focused on grasses and meadows. Enhancement of landscape connectivity and restoration of ecological corridors Restoration activities have been carried out on 5,900 ha of former mining sites. Through geomorphological reshaping, soil reconstruction and the restoration of original vegetation, natural ecosystems and habitats have been regenerated, enlarged and corridors widened with the aim of restoring a systematic and complete food web, while providing a suitable habitat for valuable and rare wildlife, such as the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Great Bustard (Otis tarda), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and other top predators that may be reintroduced in the future, including the Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia). 15 2.4 Outcomes Gradual restoration of degraded ecosystems in the Helan Mountains The regional vegetation has shown an overall growth trend, with the forest cover of the reserve increasing by 1% and the total vegetation cover increasing by 20%, while the forest communities within the reserve are in positive succession. In addition, as a result of the restoration work, the area of scrub now exceeds that of 1964, with the majority of species being nationally protected plants. Amygdalus mongolica, a second class state protected plant, has also reappeared following the restoration of the pastures. 11 Increased biodiversity and carbon sequestration Monitoring data has shown that the restoration measures, including mountain closure and grazing management, have stimulated plant growth and renewal, resulting in a significant increase in plant and animal populations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c158b3c0-ff98-44fd-bc3f-3c62c95a80d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c158b3c0-ff98-44fd-bc3f-3c62c95a80d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fe72ce157de1c20fbc48068045be3583532eaf54bb79d3044018ba94600fcfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4422b75-e386-413b-b0b7-61705dc7890a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7928eb01ddb55040aa53d86a9f29fba8b92dbdd562e4f0ae11f8f3856a559950"}}, "hash": "60dd17a4bd2dfccdc7b76eb03eeb897e9949571bff0a02a788a96d117ecff69e", "text": "In a sample plot in the southern Helan Mountains, 12 new representative shrubs of Zygophyllum xanthoxylon were found following restoration.

Aerial view of Helan Mountains after restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 16 Green transformation for sustainable development Green transformation has taken place in the Helan Mountains, where miners have become vineyard owners. This has created a multifunctional agricultural landscape with an annual gross production value of CNY 23 billion, attracting 500,000 visitors a year and generating nearly CNY 1 billion in tourism-based income. The wine industry also provides 120,000 jobs and an annual income of nearly CNY 900 million. The eastern foothills of the Helan Mountains have also been recognised as a National Geographic Indication Product Protection Demonstration Zone. Fig 11.

Case 2 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, since the Helan Mountains are located in the Yellow River Basin, and the dividing line between the three deserts of Tengger, Mu Us and Ulan Buh at the same time, the project therefore focuses on reducing disaster risk especially to prevent desertification, and safeguard water security. In addition, the relevant restoration interventions can contribute to reverse environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project has adequate matches to the indicators in Criterion 1 in terms of clearly understanding the societal challenges, effective interventions were planned and implemented, and seek to conserve biodiversity (Criterion 3). The project also made an effort to safeguard stakeholder interests through livelihood transformation (Criterion 6) and promote the experience of rewilding (Criterion 8). Hence, the project manages to restore the vegetation, thus enhance the ecosystem functions and services of disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention and refugia. 18 The project has advantages in terms of identifying and responding to societal challenges, managing to safeguard stakeholder benefits, but some aspects can be improved in accordance with NbS Standard. The Helan Mountains locate across two provinces, thus, a provincial trans-boundary mechanism should be established between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia to strength the cooperation with regard to the project in the area of Helan Mountains, in order to improve the synergy and monitoring of the interventions (Criterion 5). Moreover, the project should develop an effective adaptation strategy and a strategy for long-term management (Criterion 7). 9 Helan Mountain National Nature Reserve Management Burea (2017).

A total of 464 tracheophyte species were identified in Fuxian Lake National Wetland Park and surrounding areas. During monitoring between 2017 and 2019, 32 fish species were recorded [1]. Located on a unique low-latitude plateau, Fuxian Lake has a less dynamic water flow, with a modelled water exchange cycle of more than 200 years, which inherently increases the fragility of the ecosystem; once polluted, the lake is extremely difficult to recover. In 2002, a large area of cyanobacteria bloomed in Fuxian Lake, causing the water quality to drop from Grade I to II. Xingyun Lake, which is part of the Fuxian Lake Watershed, has also experienced frequent cyanobacteria blooms, resulting in severely polluted water quality as high as Grade V. The Yunnan provincial government has long attached great importance to protecting the ecology of Fuxian Lake and has made unremitting efforts to do so. In 2017, the Fuxian Lake Watershed Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project was included in the second batch of the Shan-shui Initiative, with a total investment of CNY 9.728 billion, of which CNY 2 billion was provided by the central financial authorities. 21 Human activities such as mining and upland farming have led to a decline in vegetation cover in the local mountain areas, as well as phosphate pollution and soil erosion. In addition, high water and fertiliser consumption has led to serious agricultural non-point source pollution. In particular, fish ponds, farmland and other land uses occupy the lakeshore buffer zone, weakening the filtering function of the wetlands. In addition, invasive species and the negative impact of human activities on natural spawning grounds have led to the depletion of native fish stocks in Fuxian Lake, threatening its biodiversity. Fig 12. Diagram of lake ecosystem cycle \u00a9 Wetland Planning Project Team 3.2 Main objectives The project aims to ensure water security through the structural adjustment of agriculture, the preservation of trees and shrubs in riparian buffer zones, and the construction of an ecological purification zone. These approaches can enhance the ecosystem services of water regulation, supply and purification, while reducing disaster risk. 3.3 Methods The Fuxian Lake Watershed Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project focuses its efforts on the entire basin. Some projects have been carried out to optimise the ecological and agricultural landscape and the spatial layout of the basin, including the relocation of industrial and mining enterprises, the closure of livestock and poultry farms, the construction of sewage networks and treatment plants, and the control of pollution in the rivers. 22 Forest restoration and expansion To strengthen soil and water conservation in montane areas, action has been taken on three fronts: 1. Returning farmland to forest: By matching sites with native tree species 2,700 ha of farmland has been returned to forest. 2. Combating desertification: Efforts have been made to restore and manage the 4,202.1 ha of stone desertification areas, including the planting of environmentally resilient crops with economic value, such as honeysuckle. 3. Ecological rehabilitation of mines: The main types of mines in the basin are phosphorite, clay brick quarry, limestone quarry, etc. The ecology of 400 ha of abandoned mines has been restored. Recognising that the main source of pollution is surface runoff in particular soil pollutants containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and non-point source pollution from agriculture - measures and actions are being taken across mountains, dams, lake shores and water bodies. These include forest restoration and expansion, water pollution prevention and control, and pollution filtration, protection and treatment. 12 Fig 13. Distribution of the four conservation and restoration management units, and 41 sub-projects (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 14. Process of forest restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 23 Structural adjustment of agriculture To effectively reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution, adjustments in agricultural practices have been made in the Fuxian Lake catchment area, such as fallow crop rotation and planting of blueberry, pyrethrum, vetiver or other crops requiring less chemical treatment, as well as rice, lotus root and other aquatic crops with wetland purification effects. As a result, it is estimated that 4,500 and 700 tonnes of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively have been reduced each year (reductions of 78.9% and 63.6% respectively).

At the same time, other projects have been carried out, including the construction of fish ponds, bird habitats, ecological demonstration areas, publicity events, education centres, lakeshore cleaning and beach protection. Fig 15. Ecological buffer zone (\u00a9 LCRC) 24 Water purification project around the lake Three sub-projects were implemented: the construction of ecological, water-permeable purification zones around the lake (consisting of green belts and gravel beds), water purification of ditches flowing into the lake, and water purification of estuaries flowing into rivers. Estuary wetland and riparian zone enhancement project Trees, shrubs and other plants in the buffer zone are maintained and replanted on a daily basis. Aquatic plants are also harvested. Conservation and management of the lake Research shows that from 1983 to 2015, the number of native fish species decreased by 44%, while the number of exotic fish species increased by 167% [2]. Therefore, the conservation and management of Fuxian Lake mainly focuses on habitat protection and artificial release of native fish species. Specifically: 1. Protecting submerged aquatic vegetation and restoring degraded habitats with native submerged aquatic vegetation. 2. Adding rubble and gravel to the lake to simulate fish habitats and restore sediment. 3. Protection of fish spawning outlets in karst caves and restoration of damaged sediment. 4. Release ~1 million white fish per year into a 5 km 2 small water area delineated by purse seines and buoys within the National Aquatic Germplasm Resource Conservation Area for Endemic Fish in Fuxian Lake. 3.4 Outcomes Reducing ecological risks and reversing ecosystem degradation From 2016 to the first half of 2020, the water quality of Fuxian Lake remained stable at the Grade I level. The total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, permanganate, chlorophyll A and eutrophication indices of Fuxian Lake decreased by 19%, 41%, 13%, 60% and 4% respectively, while transparency and dissolved oxygen increased by 19% and 7% respectively. In addition, the water quality compliance rate remained at 100% at both national and provincial monitoring stations. In total, 74 km 2 of forest were restored and soil erosion was controlled on 6.73 km 2. Overall, the forest cover in the Fuxian Lake Watershed increased from 34.95% to 39.25%, and the corresponding for- est stock increased by 39% [3]. 25 Biodiversity restoration Surveys and statistics have shown that the number of emergent plant species in Fuxian Lake has increased to 12, while the seasonal white fish fishery has resumed for the first time in more than 20 years [3]. The basin has also become a permanent habitat and wintering ground for a wide range of birds and other wildlife. In particular, in March 2019, 25 endangered Plegadis falcinellus, which is listed as a second class state protected animal, were observed there. Fig 16. Glossy Ibis \u00a9 Jan Veber Balanced, greener, and higher quality development Strictly following the agricultural planning development and planting standards, green, ecological and circular agriculture with plateau characteristics has been developed, using fertiliser-, pesticide- and water-saving crops such as lotus root, blueberry, rice, wheat, rapeseed and so on. In addition, industrial and mining enterprises have all moved out of the Fuxian Lake outflow areas, and eco-cultural tourism has been developed in their place. 13 3.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS Box 3.

Ulansuhai is the eighth largest freshwater lake in China and the largest functional wetland in the Yellow River Basin - a rare formation for desert or semi-desert areas. It is located at the intersection of two of the world\u2019s eight major bird migration routes, one from South and Southwest Asia to Central Asia and the other from Southeast Asia to Australia. As a key part of the \u201cNorthern Sand Prevention Belt\u201d in China\u2019s \u201cTwo Barriers and Three Belts\u201d strategic ecological security system, the basin has the important functions of ensuring water security along the Yellow River, conserving biodiversity and regulating regional climate. In addition, as one of China\u2019s three major agricultural areas, the Hetao Plain is an important production base for crops and oils, and plays a critical role in en- suring the country\u2019s food security. Accordingly, the Ulansuhai Lake Watershed comprises the largest area for both agricultural water use and natural purification along the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River. Irrigation water ultimate- ly flows into Ulansuhai, which acts as a natural purifier before being discharged into the Yellow River. Regional water quality and ecosystem functions have been gradually deteriorating since the 1980s, posing a serious threat to the Yellow River\u2019s water security. From 2005 to 2014, the water quality of the lake area remained at the lower Grade V. Specifically, water pollution peaked in 2008, and there was once a widespread outbreak of xanthophyceae in the region. More recently, both the provincial and municipal governments have promoted the transformation of agriculture and livestock farming in the basin into landscapes of conservation and restoration through a national approach known as \u2018Integrated Management of Mountains, Rivers, Forests, Farmlands, Lakes, Grasslands and Deserts\u2019. In 2018, the Ulansuhai Ecological Conservation and Restoration Project was included in the third batch of National Pilot Projects of the Shan-shui Initiative, with a total investment of CNY 5.746 billion, of which CNY 2 billion was invested by the central government.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "936d8c69-6950-47cf-96d2-aa35446c68a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "936d8c69-6950-47cf-96d2-aa35446c68a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9a1e97a6dfd323adc167c008ad0a26a5e3a9f6ebf7cbf0a44f7217855cd53bf"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ea3dbef-c370-4357-a65d-fd59345def9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa66945d98215a543afacd4c68e85b194bcf7c73398dd304a0cdfc3dd7d7568d"}}, "hash": "4ac6b0b28a38b0e8dfd6f2862ba17d2f2658146f179a61b98e56bf6459901e9d", "text": "14 29 Human activities, including over-farming, overgrazing, wetland reclamation, mining, and discharge of industrial, municipal and agricultural effluents, have caused serious ecological and environmental problems in the basin, such as desertification, grassland degradation, soil erosion, soil salinisation, water quality degradation, biodiversity loss, and fundamental damage to the basin\u2019s structures and functions.

(b) Photo of the area after desertification control (\u00a9 LCRC) Comprehensive farmland management in Hetao Plain A multi-faceted approach was taken to address several issues, including non-point source pollution and farmland salinisation. From one perspective, sludge dredging, the establishment of a multi-pond purification system, ecological revetment, the construction of ecological floating islands and ecological water replenishment were used to improve water quality and reduce pollutant inputs. From another perspective, the use of chemicals, water and film on agricultural land was controlled as part of a comprehensive saline soil management programme. Wulashan ecological conservation and restoration In order to address the outstanding environmental problems at the Wulashan mine, such as soil erosion and degradation of forest and grassland vegetation, various geological environment, disaster recovery and vegetation restoration measures have been taken to improve the geological and geomorphological conditions of the damaged massif and the water retention capacity. 31 Fig 19. Process of Alaben grassland reastoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Conservation and restoration of the Alaben grassland In order to combat the accelerated degradation of grasslands, desertification, soil erosion, etc., measures have been taken such as grass sowing, in addition to closure and grazing bans, with a combination of natural and artificial approaches for water conservation, vegetation restoration, reduction of pollutant and sediment inflow, windbreak and sand prevention. Management of the Ulansuhai ecological protection belt To address the degradation of Ulansuhai, a water conservation forest has been planted by the lake, grass seeds have been sown in the ecologically fragile areas of fixed and semi-fixed dunes, bird breeding areas have been created, wetland restoration and construction has been carried out in the estuary, and water conveyance channels have been opened to restore connectivity in areas where reeds are dense. Conservation and restoration of the Ulansuhai aquatic ecosystem To address the problems of severe pollution and water surface shrinkage, ventilation and water flow were facilitated in Ulansuhai to improve storage and self-purification capacity. Other measures included the harvesting and utilisation of reeds and underwater plants, the establishment of three-dimensional aquaculture in the lake area, the removal of nutrients from the lake body through a nature-based aquaculture food chain, the establishment of no-fishing areas, etc. 32 Fig 20.

Mobilising private sector to develop new financing mechanisms The project followed the DBFOT (design, build, finance, operate and transfer) approach to facilitate market-based financing, project management and operation. Specifically, a company was empowered to act as a financing platform on behalf of the Bayannur Municipality, with open bidding for project investment, development, operation and financial management. A dedicated development fund was established with joint contributions from both the municipal state-owned company and the winning bidder, as initiated by the latter.

The implementation of the pilot project has promoted the development of primary industries, such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries, and tertiary industries, including eco-tourism and agritainment, forming a pattern of green routes to industrial growth in which socio-economic development and environmental protection are mutually coordinated and promoted. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. Fig 21.

Case 4 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu This case shares some characteristics with the cases of Helan Mountains and Fuxian Lake. The Ulansuhai Nur Watershed plays an important role in both desertification prevention and water retention. Therefore, the project mainly aims to safeguard water, reducing disaster risk and facilitate sustainable economic and social development. The project manages to restore the various ecosystems to enhance the provision of their functions and services such as disturbance regulation, water regulation, water supply, erosion control and sediment retention, waste treatment, refugia and food production. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project has adequate matches to Criterion 1 & 2, in which indicate explicit identification of societal challenges, and project design was conducted at different levels of scale. Moreover, the project established an innovative financing mechanism to ensure economic feasibility (Criterion 4). After assessing the case study against the Global Standard\u2019s criteria and indicators, some aspects can be improved accordingly, such as better involvement of local communities in project implementation and maintenance (Criterion 5), including trade-offs on aspects like biophysics, time and interests (Criterion 6), and specific strategy of adaptive management (Criterion 7). 35 Case study 5: Integrated protection and restoration for the Qiantang River source water area Authors: Yong Jin, Tong Jin, Hua Cheng, Quan Mu Societal challenges addressed: Total financing: CNY 5.208 billion Implementation period: 2019-2022 Ecosystems: F3.1 Large reservoirs F3.2 Constructed lacustrine wetlands T2.4 Warm temperate laurophyll forests Sustainable Development Goals addressed: NbS type approaches implemented: Ecosystem restoration Ecological engineering Ecosystem-based management Ecosystem services enhanced: Water regulation Water supply Erosion control and sediment retention Food production Culture Water security Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss Economic and social development Map data \u00a92022 Tianditu, MNR of the PRC & NavInfo \u00a9Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC 36 5.1 General background and challenges to address Qiandao Lake, which literally means \u201cThousand Island Lake\u201d, is an ultra-large reservoir located in Chun\u2019an, Zhejiang Province, and is the largest artificial freshwater lake in the Yangtze River Delta with large number of islands.

To date, a total of CNY 3.969 billion has been invested in this project, including CNY 500 million from the central government, CNY 2.403 billion from all levels of provincial and local public budgets, and CNY 1.066 billion from other sources. To explore new opportunities in the private sector, several representatives of the financial sector formed a partnership, the Qiandao Lake Water Fund, which includes the Alibaba Foundation, Minsheng Tonghui Foundation, Wanxiang Trust and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), as the county sought to synergize public funding, private investment and World Bank loans. The lake faces several challenges. In particular, non-point source (NPS) pollution caused by inappropriate agricultural practices and the overuse of pesticides and fertilisers are the main threats to the water quality of Qiandao Lake. The invasion of pests such as Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is also affecting the biodiversity of the local forests. Housing, resorts and other tourist developments near the lake have also led to habitat loss and threatened the ecological safety of the lake. 37 5.2 Main objectives The project aims to ensure water security and maintain ecosystem stability through ecological restoration of wetlands, riparian areas and forests, while rehabilitating abandoned mines. These efforts have improved the provision of ecosystem services such as water regulation, supply and filtration. In addition, the local industrial and mineral industry is being restructured towards agroforestry and ecotourism, reducing pollution and the risk of geological disasters. 5.3 Methods The project has been implemented throughout the Qiandao Lake Watershed (landscape scale), targeting the control of inflow pollution, restoration of forest ecosystems and ecological management in mining areas, as well as ecological improvement, green agriculture and spatial optimisation of the basin. 15 Fig 22. Site location map (\u00a9 LCRC) 38 Fig 23. Riparian restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Spatial planning and management Measures were implemented to strictly follow a zoning-based approach to ecosystem functions, including the establishment of a dedicated natural landscape planning in and around the lakeshore, and the introduction of regulations on lakeshore development and construction. Specifically, a 20m radius from the shore was designated as a no-development zone, while a 20-100m radius was designated as a strict management zone. The project also aimed to improve local water quality by assessing the source and distribution pattern of NPS pollutants in the basin, and identifying the extent of priority management areas and ecological measures for water quality control. Pollution control The water quality of Qiandao Lake has deteriorated over the past three years, with total nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the surface water exceeding standards and maintaining an average mesotrophic water quality. Following an ecological approach to river management, some of the traditional, impermeable, hardened watercourses were replaced with natural, appropriate riparian and lakeshore vegetation. In addition, activities such as revetment construction and dredging were carried out to create ecological corridors and restore river biodiversity. 39 Forest ecosystem restoration Conservation and enhancement work was carried out by implementing activities such as logging bans, afforestation and reforestation, forest maintenance, closing access to hillsides to facilitate regeneration, improving deciduous forest stand structure and diversity to maintain a healthy ecosystem status. For the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases, efforts were made to control Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, remove dead or infected wood and pine, and other tasks to ensure healthier forests. With regard to vegetation restoration and reforestation, measures have been taken to improve stand structure and to establish stands of aesthetic value (e.g. with colourful foliage or valuable species) through afforestation, direct replanting, etc. on barren hills and wasteland. Environmental management of mining sites Control of geological hazards: Investigations of potential hazards and other erosion control measures have been carried out, such as restoring vegetation on barren mountains and mitigating geological hazards and flooding along road sections. Ecological environment management: Efforts were made to rehabilitate and manage 33 abandoned mines and tailings ponds by planting resilient plant species with well-developed root systems capable of surviving extensive management, such as Rosa rugosa, Cynodon dactylon, Lespedeza formosa and Halocnemum strobilaceum.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aaacc94-0c3d-4cd9-94b0-406fb606b775": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aaacc94-0c3d-4cd9-94b0-406fb606b775", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34f947b0ebe7e443bd408b2a8c8a82a8640428fa3b5e1d0851a7b4b95d203c21"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9dd60cf-276b-4bf9-9cd2-10d2622030d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf5751c1563b828b0c3e349d12c0f84845411d962af3c2671c403cf6a028c521"}}, "hash": "e757075455337c937ea73651a2194be371f9b178b1ce89ab38066643d4bea133", "text": "New financing and co-management mechanisms For NPS pollution control, the innovative management and financing Qiandao Lake Water Fund was established with a intial fund of CNY 10 million from Alibaba and Minsheng Tonghui Foundations, and technical support from TNC.

Development of green agriculture (\u00a9 LCRC) 5.4 Outcomes Significantly reduced risks and improved catchment ecology Significant progress has been made in the control of NPS pollution. The use of physical and biological techniques has progressed, while the development of green agriculture and the establishment of circular farming has led to a reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Soil conservation measures have been applied to 3,527 ha of the target area, reducing the area of soil and water loss by 7.54% and further improving the status of local soil and water [1]. Approximately 7,753 ha of forest has been restored, and biodiversity has been enhanced. Currently, Chun\u2019an maintains a forest cover of 78.63%. The drainage of wastewater from tailings has been effectively prevented, and 50 ha of mining area have been rehabilitated. Fig 25. (a) Photo of the area before river management (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 25.

Recently, as industrialisation and urbanisation have intensified, there has been a significant out-migration of local populations and a gradual decline in traditional rural communities across China. Xunjiansi\u2019s long-established model of self-sufficiency and traditional agricultural landscape has also faded. In light of this phenomenon, Professor Yu Kongjian from Peking University has been leading a team experimenting with a nature-based lifestyle in Xunjiansi since 2015, called the \u201cWangshan Lifestyle\u201d. The Wangshan lifestyle, which means \u201cmountain view\u201d in Chinese, is one in which can \u201ctruly enjoy the moments of being close to mountains, water and home\u201d. It is an attempt to explore ways to achieve sustainable rural development, a high quality of life and a path towards a vision where \u201cclear waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets\u201d. The primary objective is to further promote revitalising practices in rural areas through the development of green livelihoods and lifestyles. 45 To date, the implementation of the Wangshan Lifestyle in Xunjiansi has been successful through the combined establishment of housing, eco-farming, tourism, research, and cultural practices. Local natural resources are being better protected and used more efficiently, while once desolate and abandoned rural communities are becoming prosperous, supporting the application of NbS to China\u2019s rural revitalisation strategy. As is typical throughout China, the village of Xunjiansi was facing several challenges, such as the channeling and hardening of rivers, the excessive use of chemicals, stagnant development, and low local incomes. In addition, a large number of young and middle-aged residents had emigrated, resulting in an abundance of abandoned land, dilapidated housing, weakened community infrastructure and facilities, and a decline in cultural education. Local landscapes and heritage were ineffectively protected, resulting in the gradual disappearance of the villagers' sense of identity and belonging. 6.2 Main objectives This project aims to reduce regional disaster risk while ensuring food and water security by revitalising the village through smart hydraulic systems and more sustainable agricultural practices. The project strengthens ecosystem services related to water supply through improved filtration and reuse on the field. Such healthy and environmentally friendly recirculation systems will allow local villagers to live and farm in a more ecologically sustainable way, while preserving the village\u2019s indigenous characteristics. Fig 26. Villagers' vision to the futural community (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 27. Rural art in the village (\u00a9 LCRC) 46 6.3 Methods Based on a systematic assessment of the natural and cultural baseline, a comprehensive project design was developed in terms of spatial planning for agriculture, housing and conservation, proposing measures for eco-farming, research and education. A novel strategy has been designed to address urban-rural interactions, as well as the production and provision of ecosystem services, to ensure their security, integrity and abundance for human well-being, to lead people to rethink the value of ecosystems, and to achieve a harmonious coexistence with nature alongside the co-prosperity of urban and rural areas. Fig 28. Spatial plan of Xunjiansi Village (\u00a9 LCRC) Creating a sponge landscape and improving ecological infrastructure As a first step, measures have been taken to protect and restore the old water conservation systems (Fig. 28). These small-scale systems can conserve water resources and natural run-off patterns, assist with groundwater recharge, rainwater and wastewater purification, flood regulation and storage, as well as meeting daily water production needs. Fig 29. (a) Photo of the area before river management (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 29. (b) Photo of the area after water conservancy (\u00a9 LCRC) 47 Secondly, efforts have been made to reduce the channelling and hardening of rivers, preserve natural watercourses, maintain aquatic habitats, reduce NPS pollution and recharge groundwater supplies. Thirdly, the project included conservation and restoration efforts of the inlet and its respective forests at the intersection of the village\u2019s water systems. Preserving the inlet and its surrounding forests could help regulate the local microclimate, while contributing to the capacity for soil and water conservation, wind protection and sand fixation.

Site research and study event (\u00a9 LCRC) 48 6.4 Outcomes Enhanced ecosystem services The Wangshan Lifestyle explored conservation options, improved local ecosystems and promoted the construction of a sponge city. These activities played an important role in improving the structures and functions of hydrological ecosystems to enhance the ecosystem service of water regulation, thereby addressing the water issue in a comprehensive, systematic and sustainable manner. Significant increase in community development and income A mechanism for the rural revitalization of local communities has been sought through a sustainable model, without absolute reliance on public finance. Firstly, local per capita income in Xunjiansi village has increased by 71% from 2015 to 2021. Second, high-quality agricultural products with higher prices have been developed. For example, black tea was originally produced with chemical fertilizers and pesticides and sold for ~ CNY 100 kg -1. After upgrading to organic, safe and traceable tea with local branding, the price has risen to CNY 4,000 kg -1. Third, eco-cultural tourism is booming. In 2015, few artists came to the village for inspiration, but recently the village has seen a growing number of local homestays and visitors. Cultural heritage protection Tangible and intangible cultural heritage has been systematically protected. Residents have gradually realised the value of local ecosystems, culture and landscapes, and have developed a stronger sense of belonging and identity with their homeland. Villagers are more aware of how \u201cclear waters and lush mountains\u201d can become \u201cinvaluable assets\u201d, while understanding and adopting a sustainable lifestyle that depends on healthy natural ecosystems.

The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project succeeded in ensuring water security and reducing disaster risk by improving relevant ecosystem functions and services in the Guanting Reservoir Watershed, while reversing environmental degradation and biodiversity loss and facilitating social and economic development. Box 6. Case 6 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9 Juntao Hu 50 This project and approach has promoted the localisation of NbS in China, while providing experience and references for rural development and revitalisation. It provides a successful example of promoting green livelihoods and lifestyles in rural communities, establishing healthy relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being by creating a sustainable and replicable model. After comparing with the criteria of the NbS Global Standard through self-assessment, we summarise the areas that are strongly related to the Standard and the areas for improvement of the case, which may be considered for referral to practitioners. In this case, the project has a clear objective to address the societal challenges of disaster risk reduction and economic and social development. During the planning and design phase, the design team conducted in-depth interviews in Xunjiansi village and identified the villagers\u2019 suffering from flooding, low incomes, labour shortages and a weak sense of belonging. To improve the living environment and revitalise the village, the team ensured that the provision of ecosystem services such as water regulation, erosion control, sediment retention, food production, recreation and culture were enhanced to achieve the design objectives. According to the Standard, the project adequately addresses the indicators in Criterion 1 in terms of understanding the societal challenges facing the village and the rights holders and beneficiaries. The design team fully respected the local lifestyle and culture and clarified the villagers\u2019 needs. The designers listened to the communities and promoted their restoration activities to the local villagers (Criterion 6). It is also noteworthy that the project included the development of both economic feasibility and adaptive management mechanisms. The village of Xunjiansi created a multi-county tour, research study and cultural innovation activities to monitor and evaluate the long-term NbS effect, to keep learning and improving, and most importantly, the mechanisms provided strong assurance of sustainable income to support the village (this is reflected in the assessment of Criterion 4 & 7).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13d35fed-586e-4f49-b134-f1c21e22b6ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "13d35fed-586e-4f49-b134-f1c21e22b6ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35b95d4dd855d5f84f1c4a73593962369cf879c40d517b23b9ec2d7399c20b22"}, "2": {"node_id": "023b9ac0-c7bf-4a0f-92f6-c98c2ecd3a8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f016bdae6a323e1ec35e4313ca12ab2490f708e0b0e059c615671cf2e9af87a1"}}, "hash": "fe729456e839fa27424e9ad50c63f2d29356cc87bdfb0296038cae027a9da606", "text": "51 Although case 6, as a rural regeneration project, meets most of the criteria of the NbS standard, it still needs to pay more attention to biodiversity aspects (Criterion 3).

For example, NbS have been adopted in the EU and the US and have been effectively researched in areas such as sustainable agriculture, which focuses on holistic planning and design; climate-smart agriculture, which supports adaptation to climate change; carbon farming, which aims to sequester carbon in the atmosphere; and regenerative agriculture, which responds to the problems of modern agriculture. One of the world\u2019s three major black soil belts - the black soil of Northeast China - is mainly found in the Liaohe, Songnen, and Sanjiang plains. Natural black soils develop organically on the gravel and clay layers of the Tertiary-Quaternary-Pleistocene or Holocene, while the region\u2019s unique climate, hydrological conditions, and vegetation types have laid the foundation for the ac- cumulation of organic matter, forming a deep and fertile black soil layer. 17 The formation and development of black soils are extremely slow, taking on av- erage ~200-600 years for each 1cm of black soil to form, and is therefore con- sidered an extremely scarce resource. 18 The black soils in this particular region are some of the most fertile in the world, characterized by high carbon content, porosity, and ploughability. They are used as a major base for commodity grain production in China, covering 36 million hectares, or a quarter of the country\u2019s total arable land, making the black soil region a critical and central part of ensuring national food security. 19 However, traditional plowing techniques destroy the protective layer of straw on the surface and alter soil microorganisms and animal communities, in addition to deteriorating the ecological and productive functions of the soil. Therefore, to protect soil ecology and productivity, China has widely adopted a sustainable agricultural NbS method developed, practiced, and promoted by the China Agricultural University (CAU) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), known as the \u201cLishu model\u201d. 54 Due to years of intensive farming and excessive nutrient inputs, the black soils are now subject to severe wind and water erosion, significant amounts of dust are released into the air during spring ploughing and a significant amount of topsoil, which is essential for agriculture, is lost. In areas of high gully erosion, gullies are cut and torn into the land, causing a range of problems including thinning of the topsoil layer, significant reduction in topsoil organic matter and deterioration of soil structure and function. The result is a serious threat to the sustainable health of black soils and thus to national food security. 20 7.2 Main objectives This project aims to safeguard food security by implementing conservation tillage to recover and conserve black soil, which has come to be known as the panda of farmland. a b c d Fig 35.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf3bd2dc-488b-429d-a8a4-dbd72eaea40a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf3bd2dc-488b-429d-a8a4-dbd72eaea40a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd202142854fe7f897d559a083d5fc413d3d4853da7082352fd7c58c0e502f03"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf3d399d-a883-4f7d-b810-f72177081f58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d24ae596a988ad193be86cfbbb38679a4f3568a98d145463c7f28c09915204b"}}, "hash": "62863bf04f647ab40335a75633d667b577e4826f2766d29c769157b9a38590c7", "text": "a b c d Fig 35.

In addition, short periods of heavy rainfall in summer can easily generate run-off on hills and gentle slopes, washing away surface soils and creating more gullies that fragment farmland or severely damage the ecosystem, which are the main causes of black soil degradation. Layers of mulched straw, on the other hand, act like a blanket covering the soil, effectively reducing wind and water erosion, limiting run-off and reducing the formation and development of gullies. It is also favourable to the treatment of erosion gullies. Compared to conventional farming practices, conservation tillage can reduce runoff by an average of 60% and soil loss by about 80%. 21 7.3 Methods After more than a decade of research, scientists and researchers from CAU, CAS and other institutions have developed a maize straw mulching cultivation technique (i.e. the \u201cLishu Model\u201d) based on local conditions. With maize straw mulching as the core process, this intervention involves integrated mechanisation of direct seeding, fertilisation, weeding, disease prevention and harvesting processes to effectively protect topsoils and address the key issues of soil degradation caused by maize straw removal on regional black soils. Accordingly, a combination of straw-based mulching methods was used to achieve multiple benefits, including soil protection, water conservation, resistance to erosion, drought and soil hardening. Overall, the system is simple to operate, cost effective and has great potential to increase yields. Stable and high yields Composting straw results in increased organic matter content and organism health, improved soil structure and higher fertiliser utilisation rates. The combination of these favourable factors can lead to stable and high yields, especially in relatively dry years. In fact, the results of a field trial in Gaojia Village of Lishu Town over more than 10 yrs show that the average yield under the Lishu model was 5-10% higher than that of control groups. 21 Biodiversity conservation Known as an \u201cecosystem engineer\u201d, the earthworm is a consumer, decomposer and regulator in the ecosystem, playing an essential role in improving soil structure, water retention and air permeability, while decomposing soil organic matter, allowing more efficient conversion of soil nutrients and generating more nutrients available for plant growth. Earthworms and worm castings provide a desirable substrate amendment for the growth and reproduction of micro-organisms and soil microbes. Additionally, straw mulching has a significant impact on the number and weight of earthworms, reaching 114 individuals\u00b7m -2 and 18.03 g\u00b7m -2 in this project; whereas the quantity of earthworms per square meter, in the conventional ridge tillage and no-tillage, no-mulching practices were 15 and 19, respectively (without any significant difference in weight). 21 Accordingly, the density of earthworms in the straw-covered field was six times higher than in the conventional ridge and furrow field, which is likely to be a major factor in the observed improvement in soil biological properties. Straw mulching also provides shelter and food for wildlife such as game birds and small mammals, thereby increasing biodiversity. Cost-effectiveness and emissions reduction In the Lishu Model, the completion of a single no-tillage seeder operation, rather than \u2265 2 repeated operations as required in conventional practices, means that fewer machines or man hours are required, or that area coverage could be enhanced within the same amount of time or under lower labor intensity, providing cost-effective options on both operation and production sides. In addition to saving CNY 1,000\u20131,400 \u00b7ha -1, it also reduces the power of agricultural machinery by 15\u201320%, energy consumption by 25\u201330%, and it effectively reduces carbon emissions. 21 56 57 7.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. This case is unique among all case studies, given that this research practice it aims at conserving the critical resource of black soil, through regenerative agriculture. The findings provide theoretical basis for the application of no-till practices and understanding how to rebuild soil sustainability in the northeast of China.

This case is unique among all case studies, given that this research practice it aims at conserving the critical resource of black soil, through regenerative agriculture. The findings provide theoretical basis for the application of no-till practices and understanding how to rebuild soil sustainability in the northeast of China. Therefore, the project aims to safeguard food security and promote sustainable management and development, through restoration and natural process, enhancing the provision of ecosystem functions and services (erosion control and sediment retention, soil formation and food production). According to the NbS Global Standard, the project adequately matches the criteria of identifying societal challenges (Criterion 1) and balancing trade-offs (Criterion 6). It does incorporate adaptive management (Criterion 7) as an research based project. However, the project should also increase the participation of local peasants in planning and design stage and afterward monitoring, since they are the major stakeholder (Criterion 5). 58 17 Xiaozeng, H., Na, L.

In the process of rapid urbanisation, conflicts between man and nature are increasing, and the downtown or central areas are becoming overcrowded.

It pays particular attention to methods that can help a waterfront city adapt to climate change, sustain economic and social development, and ensure human health. 8.3 Methods Over a large scale, the project ensures the connectivity of the ecological network; whereas across smaller scales, measures were taken to improve the ecological infrastructure, create blue and green ecological spaces, and explore techniques to realize the value of ecological products through urban micro-regeneration. Fig 36. Natural landscape map of Chongqing central districts (\u00a9 LCRC) 62 Strengthening planning and regulation to conserve and restore important ecological space Greater efforts are needed to limit the role of the \u2018Three Lines\u2019 (namely the Ecological Conservation Red Lines, the Permanent Basic Farmland, and the Urban Growth Boundaries developed by the Territory Development Plan) in preserving and enhancing important nature reserves and urban eco-spaces. The Jinyun Mountain Nature Reserve, located on the banks of the Jialing River, is a natural ecological barrier to the centre of Chongqing; however, villagers liv- ing within the reserve have been engaged in unsustainable resource extraction. In June 2018, several measures were taken to address these issues, including the demolition of illegally constructed infrastructure to restore green spaces, the reclamation of mining areas, and the sustainable management of lakes and reservoirs. As a result, the Jinyun Mountains have been restored to their \u201cgreen lung\u201d and natural barrier status. Fig 37.

In turn, the island\u2019s natural habitat was restored, preserving Chongqing\u2019s unique ecological landscape. Fig 38. (a) Aerial photo of Guangyang Islet 63 Fig 38.

New development land for business purposes will not be approved until land quotas have been purchased to create market demand; while idle and abandoned development land in rural areas, nature reserves and other areas with important ecological functions must be reclaimed as qualified farmland, forest or grassland before land quotas are issued and economic value is generated through market transactions. 2) Forest Cover Quota Trading Mechanisms. As forest cover is a compulsory target, areas that do not meet the target are allowed to purchase quotas from compliant areas. 65 3) Horizontal Ecological Compensation Mechanism. Districts or counties from upper and lower reaches signed agreements for a two-way compensation system based on the water quality at the river confluence to improve the ecological environment of the downstream areas and increase the fiscal revenues of the upstream areas. 8.4 Outcomes Improvement of ecological benefits through increasing biodiversity There has been a significant increase in biodiversity thanks to ecological restoration efforts, which have been tailored to each ecosystem and have been implemented accordingly. In total, 22 national wetland parks have been established in Chongqing, and the protected wetlands cover an area of 207,200 ha, recording 563 species of vertebrates and 707 species of higher plants. Generation of social benefits through improved urban ecological landscapes As part of efforts to restore urban ecology, 1,263 urban parks (total area 15,834.55 ha) have been built, 45% of which are located in central districts, covering 7,142 ha. From 2018 to 2020, 92 community sports and cultural parks will be built on the undeveloped urban areas to meet the leisure and exercise needs of nearly 3.5 million residents. From 2019 to 2020, 1,198.9 ha of green spaces were added on slopes and precipices in central districts. Enhanced economic benefits through natural capital gains in urban and rural areas From 2018 to 2021, the city traded 286 ha of reclaimed land through the land quota trading mechanism, with a total trade turnover of CNY 801 million [1]. In March 2019, Jiangbei District and Youyang County signed the country\u2019s first horizontal ecological compensation agreement to improve forest cover, with the former paying the latter CNY 187.5 million for a quota of 5,000 ha of forested land. As of January 2021, the city has traded a total of 12,800 ha of forest cover quo- tas through the trading mechanism, with a total trading volume of CNY 480 mil- lion [2]. By the end of 2019, Chongqing has established the horizontal ecological compensation mechanism for 19 secondary rivers with a watershed area of \u2265 500 km 2 and covering \u2265 2 districts and counties, with a total compensation fund of CNY 96.918 million. 66 8.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. This case is unique among all case studies since it is a city regeneration project, with some ecological restoration, conservation and sustainable management. The project aims to reconstruct the relationship between human and nature, reducing disaster risk and safeguard water security. It has enhanced ecosystem functions and services of climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention, refugia and recreation. According to the Standard, the project has adequately matched Criterion 2 focusing on designing at scale and Criterions 6 focusing on balance trade-offs. However, the project should have more emphasis on engaging stakeholders, especially the residents, to improve inclusive governance (Criterion 5).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ef28a6e-d081-4ed2-8af0-fac8e1bd9b9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ef28a6e-d081-4ed2-8af0-fac8e1bd9b9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c0e934b5c089f1c4e83f4466252cd9b67852860b86ea8d34084072c16172187"}, "2": {"node_id": "71f6d1d3-eddc-48a8-837e-fe10ae3b8cd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be3947e77b2d423f1764271132da8f8d46494282f27a91aa128e44f7edbc660d"}}, "hash": "1e63926cdaf9b56c7d4def7e3118f9c10e0b43262bc8c08745755816e83db288", "text": "Moreover, it should consider improving the co-relation and synergy among all the NbS projects in Chongqing and the corresponding ecosystems.

The city is rich in natural resources and has three important marine ecosystems - mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs - with rich biodiversity, ecosystem services and high research value. Beihai Binhai National Wetland Park is a typical example of a \u2018freshwater- estuary-coastal\u2019 complex wetland ecosystem, and serve as the central \u2018green lungs\u2019 and core green corridor of the city. The wetland park contains nine spe- cies of mangrove resources under national protection, 17 species of endangered flora and fauna, and 86 species and 38 species of migratory birds jointly protect- ed by Sino-Japan and Sino-Australia [1]. Beihai is characterised by a subtropical marine monsoon climate influenced by monsoon circulation and complex meteorological systems. Various types of meteorological disasters, such as droughts, floods and typhoons, occur simultaneously or in succession, seriously threatening local economic and environmental security, as well as people\u2019s lives and property. 23,24 The rapid development of urbanisation, coastal industrialisation, aquaculture and tourism has created a number of problems in this region. Sewage discharges are a continuous source of pollution and increased siltation in many parts of the waters. 25-27 Coastal wetland ecosystems have been degraded, natural shorelines disconnected, mangrove areas reduced, biodiversity lost, and urban flooding increased. In response, the Beihai Municipal Government has implemented a land-sea coordinated pollution control and ecological restoration programme based on the principle of urban development through ecological approaches. 9.2 Main objectives The project aims to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation, while proposing to reduce vulnerability and disaster risk through the restoration of mangrove ecosystems and coastal wetlands. It has also promoted the construction of sponge cities to improve water storage capacity to combat urban waterlogging. 69 9.3 Methods While targeting water pollution control and sponge city development, ecological restoration has been carried out according to the characteristics of coastal ecosystems, local conditions and spatial design. Efforts have also been made to promote eco-tourism and eco-product development. Fig 39. Spatial layout of the ecological restoration activities (\u00a9 LCRC) Sponge city construction Effective control, natural storage, infiltration and purification of surface runoff was achieved by exploiting the role of ecosystems in absorbing, storing and releasing rainwater, thereby reducing urban flooding. Firstly, both engineering (construction of infiltration, storage, retention, harvesting, treatment and discharge facilities) and natural measures (such as green belts or stormwater regulation and treatment ponds) were used to increase the city\u2019s flood control, drainage and water supply capacity, improve the urban environment and create a healthier water cycle. Secondly, measures have been taken to protect natural aquatic environments such as rivers and lakes, to link water systems and to maintain the water storage function of the city itself.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c132518b-fb4d-439b-a417-5f926723cabe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c132518b-fb4d-439b-a417-5f926723cabe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daf3e0cf6f30b46f00354f3d00ca4567aab4b648eea72e83254916fa8324fa5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a2147ca-867b-464a-9118-f33f47670440", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a12bb450fff9ed57446f37fd578570d6f29083b9dd5c73c3344ed74152eabd19"}}, "hash": "851a67955bab75007090b3063519fcc95ab9e524ff482b4f3417afdae2d22276", "text": "Systemic ecosystem restoration A comprehensive management approach was adopted to facilitate systemic restoration per planing patterns, zonings, and sites, designed according to different environments (freshwater, brackish, saltwater) and ecosystems (ditches, reservoirs, rivers, mud flats, sea, etc.). 70 The ecological restoration of the upstream reservoir included the rehabilitation of the existing pits and ponds around the Liyudi reservoir, the construction of ecological islands to create new habitats, the extension of the shoreline of the water body and the increase of the self-purification capacity, thereby comprehensively improving the ecological status of the reservoir.

The ecological restoration of freshwater wetlands in the upper and middle reaches of the Fengjiajiang River included the removal of cement weirs to restore natural ecological exchange, and the increase of vegetation along slopes and aquatic plants to enhance purification function and biodiversity. Similarly, freshwater ponds have been transformed into ecological wetlands with pollution trapping and purification functions. The ecological restoration of the brackish water environment in the lower reach of the Fengjiajiang River was undertaken based on a method of self-renewal. Hard weirs were replaced by local associate mangroves favorable to water quality improvement, such as Barringtonia racemosa, and Heritiera littoralis Dryand. These species also provide habitats for birds. Native palms were planted in areas surrounding the estuary as they are saline\u2013alkali resistant, maintain adaptability to harsh environments, and are resistant to typhoons. Fig 40. (a) Photo of the fish ponds (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 40. (b) Photo of the fish ponds after rehabilitation (\u00a9 LCRC) 71 Mangrove forest conservation and restoration entailed the closure of beaches for afforestation, tending to young and middle-aged stands, and planting of local mangrove species (primarily Avicennia marina and Kandelia candel) to conserve the native mangrove diversity, while restoring the biodiversity and stability of wetland ecosystems. To date, about 24.7 ha of mangroves have been successfully restored, and 18 ha of new mangroves have been planted [2]. In addition, non-native mangrove species, such as Laguncularia racemose and Sonneratia apetala have been controlled from further expansion. The restoration of Silver Beach included cleaning up the beach environment, removing seawalls, restoring the shoreline, etc. These activities have helped to strengthen the coastal disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, while improving the natural coastal protection functions of Silver Beach and the overall landscape quality. To date, 7.44 ha of beach and approximately 1.43 km of shoreline have been restored [3]. Fig 41. Grey mangrove \u00a9 Dave Aplin Fig 42. Mangrove forest restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 43. Silver Beach shoreline restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) 72 Innovative financing and eco-development To attract private investment, the programme adopted a DBFOT (Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Transfer) model. Initially, the Beihai government and private financiers contributed CNY 76 million and CNY 682 million, respectively, to establish a joint venture company to operate the programme, while the remaining financial gap was filled by bank loans. Under the terms of operation, the municipal government pays CNY320 million each year for the services provided by the programme. Finally, assets in good condition will be transferred to the government free of charge. The programme will improve the environment of Beihai City and the quality of Silver Beach, allowing the public to enjoy improved cultural and recreational services. New development and tourism opportunities may also emerge, promoting sustainable urban development, creating additional jobs and attracting further national and international attention. 9.4 Outcomes Improved water quality To date, an annual reduction of 1,366 tonnes of primary pollutants and 16.5 million tonnes of discharged wastewater has been achieved across the Fengjiajia River Basin, while the quality of surface water, long at Grade V, has risen to or exceeded Grade IV [4]. In addition, the water quality of Silver Beach improved by 40% from 2019 to 2020. Biodiversity gains Initial statistics show that 182 species of coastal birds can now be found across the region, an increase of 46 species since 2017, including the critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper. In addition, the recovery of mudflats is leading to a steady increase in benthic organisms (e.g. peanut worms), from 66 species before 2016 to 153 species. The Chinese horseshoe crab, green turtle and other rare marine species have been found in the estuary, where 17 mangrove species have also been identified [5].

In addition, appropriate measures have been taken to address the problems of this densely populated area, where various issues such as urban wastewater, quality of life, ecotourism and recreation, disaster prevention and mitigation, and socio-economic development need to be addressed. After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. Box 9. Case 9 NbS criterion percentage \u00a9Juntao Hu 74 In this case, the project aims to address the societal challenges of disaster risk reduction, water security, and economic and social development. It focuses on the water issue, including meteorological disasters and pollution in multiple ecosystems, and restores the site by integrating mangroves, converting fish ponds into wetlands and planting various types of plants to improve water quality. Enhanced ecosystem services include climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control, sediment retention, recreation and culture. According to the NbS Global Standard, the project clearly addresses the challenges of natural disasters, water pollution and wetland degeneration (Criterion 1) in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Fengjiajiang River and other multi-ecosystems (Criterion 2). In addition, according to the natural resource data baseline on the website of the Beihai City Natural Resources Bureau, it is obvious that after the restoration project, the number and species of local birds, benthic organisms and even rare marine animals are increasing in an integrated and connected ecosystem (Criterion 3). Referring to the NbS Global Standard, this project can be improved in terms of economic feasibility (Criterion 4), which considers alternative solutions to ensure the effectiveness of the Beihai City NbS design and analysis, while recording cost-effectiveness studies to measure and monitor the economic variables. In addition, the score for inclusive governance (Criterion 5) is slightly lower than the other criterion scores. It could be suggested that more local residents should be involved in all processes of the NbS intervention and that they should be given more opportunities to express their rights and interests in the project. 23 Huijuan, L.

Bordering both Shenzhen and Hongkong, two of China\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, the wetlands of Shenzhen Bay are the wintering habitat and stopover for one of the world\u2019s nine major bird migratory routes - the East Asian-Australasian Flyway - with some 100,000 migratory birds wintering and passing through each year. To effectively conserve this mangrove wetland ecosystem close to the centre of the megacity, the Shenzhen government has launched a series of coastal mangrove restoration policies in Shenzhen Bay, including mangrove conservation, sustainable management, and restoration, which have led to an increase in the total area of mangrove forests and reversed the trend of mangrove wetland ecosystem degradation. The rapid increase in urbanisation in Shenzhen has been accompanied by a decrease in the mangrove areas. In addition, direct industrial and municipal wastewater discharges have increased harmful pollutants and wetland degradation. Along the coastal estuary, watercourses have been channeled, preventing the exchange of matter and energy between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Diked fishponds have also been degraded, reducing the ecological function of providing habitats and feeding grounds for migratory birds. In addition, invasive plant species such as Mikania micrantha and Leucaena leucocephala have taken over large areas, while outbreaks of insect infestations have become more frequent, and local species have been replaced across ecological niches, all of which have led to an oversimplified and increasingly fragile structure of wetland communities. 77 10.2 Main objectives This project aims to improve the disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation capacity of the megacity of Shenzhen through the restoration and conservation of mangrove wetlands. Fig 44. Spatial plan of Shenzhen Bay restoration projects(\u00a9 LCRC) 10.3 Methods The local government has insisted on coordinated land-sea management planning to strengthen environmental protection. For example, improved sewage treatment plants are being built with a pipe system that separates rainwater and sewage. Strict controls are also in place for land-based pollutants, and a number of pioneering pollution treatment projects are being implemented. 28 In terms of ecological restoration and the following criteria, which focus on balancing the needs of wildlife with those of urban development and citizens, pond habitats for aquatic birds have been restored through comprehensive water management. In addition, measures have been taken to prevent and control invasive species, plant diseases and pests, and to restore mangrove forests in order to systematically restore the structure and functions of the mangrove ecosystem in Shenzhen Bay. At the same time, rich and enjoyable nature-related educational activities have been carried out and promoted to increase the interest and participation of the public. To this end, CNY 300 million was invested in the project, of which CNY 270 million came from the central government and CNY 30 million from social investment [1]. 78 Fig 45. (a) Photo of the conventional watercourse (\u00a9 LCRC) Fig 45. (b) Photo of the ecological watercourse after restoration (\u00a9 LCRC) Water management The Fengtang River is the main river flowing through the Futian Mangrove Wetlands in Shenzhen Bay. As it is highly channelized, little vegetation has been able to grow along the river, resulting in a very limited provision of ecosystem services. To address this problem, the first step was to de-channelize the forms and structures of the watercourses, soften the course of the Fengtang River, and re- construct the banks of the river with its branches, removing rigid structures from the surface, lowering the water level, and reforming the side slopes into a gentle gradient. A certain thickness of humus was applied to the side slopes to restore the soil environment for better plant growth. Secondly, according to the ecological characteristics of the environment from the outer tidal flats to the inner banks, various plant communities were restored to rehabilitate the bank vegetation, and a comprehensive ecosystem of man- groves, associate mangroves and riverine plants was developed, contributing to the restoration of both the main mangrove wetland functions and the estuarine ecosystem of the Fengtang River.

Reed communities have been established along the banks to meet the habitat needs of various waterbird species. In addition, to further restore suitable bird habitat, the water levels of the central mudflats are controlled so that the island is completely submerged (> 0.3 m) in summer, preventing plant growth along the slopes. During the winter, water levels are maintained between 0.0-0.1m on the uncovered and shallow mudflats to support waterbird habitats. 30 Fig 46.

By recovering herbaceous communities on the embankment, and providing habitats for the pests\u2019 natural enemies, both the species number and individuals of predatory insects have increased, proving an effective measure for pest and disease prevention. Sparse shrubs and low herbs - such as plants from families Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Compositae, Commelina, Verbena, and Acanthaceae - were planted across vast areas along the buffer zone between mangrove forests and diked fish ponds suitable pest predator habitats. Both heights and densities were reduced in the arboreous communities, creating suitable habitats for insects, including spiders, bees, and flies, while assisting with the recovery of predatory insect numbers of species and individuals. Simultaneously, strong integral connectivity is guaranteed among subsystems of mangrove forests and fishponds, while migratory routes from ponds to mangroves were kept open for the predatory insects to migrate into mangrove forests, and play their essential role in preventing the spread of pests and diseases. 31 Regarding invasive species, alien herbaceous hygrophytes were rooted out through desilting projects, while good-quality local hygrophytes were planted, such as Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. Terrestrial invasive plant species were also artificially removed before supplementing local species, and regular clearing work was conducted throughout the subsequent management on an annual basis to prevent the further spread or growth of invasive species. Specifically, in an attempt to eliminate M. micrantha, the dominant harmful plant species throughout Shenzhen Bay, various ecological control measures were taken, ranging from artificial removal, biological control, and the plant photosynthesis time control. Mangroves and mudflats restoration The mangrove forest restoration project consists of forest plantation and mudflat restoration; these activities have been carried out on an area of 220 ha. in the western estuary of shenzhen bay, work has mainly focused on restoring local mangrove forests, in addition to constructing bird mudflat habitats and artificial mudflats to provide resting places for shorebirds. the reforestation efforts have been effective, with a total of 30.2 hectares of mangrove forests planted to date [1]. 81 Nature related education Thanks to the cooperation of the Futian District Education Bureau, the Futian District Science and Technology Association and the Reserve Authority, MCF organised nature-related education courses on a monthly basis and opened them to all schools in Futian. More than 200,000 citizens, including (but not limited to) primary and secondary school students, participated in these educational events.

In addition, close cooperation between the two megacities can be seen in the annual Shenzhen-Hongkong Coastal Wetlands Conservation Forum and the Shenzhen River Governance Project, jointly launched by the two governments, which has successively completed the desilting of waterways, embankment reinforcement, sewage outfall rehabilitation and water surface sanitation. 82 10.4 Outcomes Increasing biodiversity Within the restoration area, mangrove wetlands have recovered from loss of function, and biodiversity has shown a consistent increase. Namely, the richness of Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Acanthus ilicifolius, and Bruguiera gymnorhiza has increased with a vegetation coverage > 95%. There has also been a remarkable increase in both the number and diversity of species, particularly following the restoration of fish ponds into bird habitats. Through a series of successive restoration actions, the project is playing an important role in maintaining the ecological status and value of Shenzhen Bay on migratory bird flyways. In particular, the restoration project has led to a positive and steady increase in the number of endangered Platalea minor, with the global population increasing from 825 in 2000 to 4864 in 2020, and from 135 to 361 in Shenzhen Bay alone. Carbon sequestration and climate regulation The method, as proposed by the Blue Carbon Initiative jointly published by Conservation International (CI), the IUCN, and United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2014, has been localized in and applied to Futian Reserve. Results have shown that in Shenzhen Bay, each hectare of mangrove forests absorbs about 40 tCO2\u00b7yr -1 from the atmosphere, highlighting the crucial role mangroves play in carbon fixation, mitigating climate change, and helping achieve carbon neutrality. 32 Moreover, the wide and open water surface of Shenzhen Bay has had vast areas of mangrove forests restored. Accordingly, the cooling effect and direct regulation of climate contributed by water vaporization and plant transpiration greatly mitigate the urban heat from nearby Shenzhen. Achieving human-nature harmony The mangrove forest ecosystem restoration project has succeeded in maintaining the harmony and connectivity between the restoration zone and the surrounding areas, while establishing a natural link between the sea and the city, and between birds and people, thus promoting the synthetic functions of coastal wetland ecosystems. In addition, the project will highlight the characteristics of coastal wetlands and mangroves throughout Shenzhen Bay, enhancing the value of both the environment and human settlements, while contributing to the development of surrounding areas. 83 At present, the coastal mangrove wetlands in Shenzhen Bay serve as a demonstration of how to build an environmentally friendly city, as well as a famous scenic spot for citizens and visitors at home and abroad, providing services such as sightseeing, leisure and science popularisation to more than 10 million visitors every year. 10.5 Link to Global Standard for NbS After having assessed the case study with the NbS Global Standard\u2019s 8 criteria, we sum up the areas in which the case study strongly meets the Standard\u2019s criteria and those in which it met them partially or weakly. The latter helps identify what aspects are to be improved, which may be of considerable importance for practitioners. In this case, the project focuses on addressing the societal challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss. Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves are successfully restored, enhancing the provision of ecosystem functions and services related to climate regulation, disturbance regulation, water regulation, erosion control and sediment retention, recreation, and culture.

An important aspect of the project is the implementation of local and national mangrove conservation and restoration policies. Together with other similar activities, this project contributes to the establishment of the International Mangrove Centre in Shenzhen, facilitating global action and research on mangrove conservation.

This means that although these were established with the intent of incorporating the use and management of ecosystems, they were not designed as NbS per se! However, this still provides an excellent opportunity to consider how close these interventions are to NbS best practice and thereby raise awareness and build capacity by reflecting on the project planning according to the NbS criteria. The overall results are encouraging while noting there is still scope for improvement. We consulted with Yan Zhou, Yan Chen and Chongyao Yang, the authors of most of the case studies (i.e. Case 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10) from the MNR\u2019s Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Centre (LCRC), about the significance of the standard for ecological projects. They praised the NbS Standard for its reference value, particularly in terms of its focus on social benefits, design at scale, stakeholder involvement, trade-offs and adaptive management. They also felt that the localisation process of NbS in China should create more specific and locally adapted guidance for the use of the NbS Global Standard, to make it easier to implement in practice. It is noted that an International Standard Committee exists to provide guidance on how the Standard can be used consistently across a range of different national and local conditions. In 2021, LCRC experts organised NbS self-assessment meetings for several ecological projects, including the case of Fuxian Lake, and drafted a preliminary Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for self-assessment. The experts suggest that NbS self-assessment should be embedded in the project cycle and carried out at least three times for the planning, mid-implementation and post-implementation phases. In general, if self-assessment is carried out during the planning phase, project documentation can be strengthened and used for decision making. Meanwhile, it can also enhance stakeholder empowerment through better awareness and approaches to stakeholder identification and engagement. In addition, current ecological conservation and restoration projects in China often focus on efforts on ecosystems and species rather than treating societal challenges as a primary goal, while the self-assessment leads to more consideration of social benefits. 86 Although the principles of ecological projects in China are not entirely consistent with the NbS Global Standard, the basic concepts are consistent from a theoretical perspective, even if the application of the principles in practice is a weakness and a difficulty. For example, the latest official guideline for ecological conservation and restoration projects issued in 2020 requires projects to be planned and designed at the landscape scale. However, the general situation for large projects in China is that although the provincial government usually coordinates the main project, the sub-projects are submitted by different departments, resulting in fragmentation with different objectives, which can distract from the overall objective. In some projects, local governments have established joint meeting mechanisms or joint working groups to try to improve coordination between different departments, but the process is still arduous and lengthy. In general, the majority of ecological projects in China are led by the central government from a top-down approach and implemented by all levels of government, which has the unique characteristic of being designed on a large scale compared to those promoted from the bottom up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "003f2bb6-11c5-460b-b517-8e87a6644e9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "003f2bb6-11c5-460b-b517-8e87a6644e9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the social impacts of conservation: A review of methods", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6ce7a7fd604ecc72d2c063e69bdad3c9d67b1d42f94612ff2ff047a858c2091"}, "2": {"node_id": "5185254b-b955-4abc-9675-0b531df601a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/assessing-social-impacts-conservation-review-methods", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8264121683660fdda10bfc87bce8e087d1cb70cda884fd108ac7dfd359fabed1"}}, "hash": "459c21d71a2763a905d47a78702043e1b138aa7fd26fbfbf2d223a7b78c2f81b", "text": "These projects therefore have advantages from the outset in terms of scale-up, government recognition and economic viability.

In addition, adaptive management is an emerging concept for the management system of large-scale ecological projects, and ecological conservation and restoration projects in China still apply the management mechanism of engineering projects. The significance of the NbS concept and the Global Standard is to raise the awareness of adaptive management to deal with the dynamics of ecosystems by decision makers and practitioners to leverage transformative change. 87 The authors suggest that the NbS Global Standard provides strong supportive framework for ecological projects from both a conceptual and operational perspective. Applying the standard during both design and implementation can highlight where best practice is being achieved and these areas where improvements and corrective actions can help strengthen the ability of the project to address societal challenges. Additional detailed and pragmatic guidance for NbS interventions in China, such as technical guidelines, monitoring standards, effectiveness assessment guidelines and adaptive management standards, are now needed for practical application of the Standard. In addition to the cases themselves, the publication of this report also represents knowledge management of these projects through a collaboration between IUCN and Ministry of Natural Resources of the PRC.

However, it can be difficult for practitioners to select and design the most appropriate approach to suit their needs and to contribute to existing governance arrangements. This report first reviews the available methods, tools and approaches that have been designed to assess and document the social impacts of conservation interventions, and second, offers guidance for practitioners on good practice for designing studies and facilitating processes for such assessments. The focus of this report is on tools that can be used for assessing ex post impacts \u2013 i.e. after commencement of intervention \u2013 whilst recognising that good project design incorporates social impact assessment activities from the outset. In this report, social impacts refers to the full range of economic, social, cultural, political, environmental and psychological impacts on people whose lives are connected in some way to the ecosystem, biodiversity or place in question, including but not confined to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. In order to find the widest range of material possible to review, the literature search included four steps: (i) a search of the scholarly literature; (ii) a search of the grey literature; (iii) a snowball sample; and (iv) a request for information from the CEESP membership via the listserv (see Section 2). The reviewed papers were assessed across a number of categories including, but not limited to, the impact domains covered, whether assessed impacts were positive and/or negative, whether intended and/or unintended consequences were assessed, the distribution of impacts, whether the approach enabled disaggregated data analysis and the required resourcing (see Section 3). A review of empirical papers assessing the social impacts of conservation initiatives was also conducted, and highlights the very partial nature of a majority of published social impact assessments (see Section 3.1). Few of the reviewed papers considered more than two or three different domains of impact, with a strong emphasis on economic and psychological domains, the latter associated with the increase in measurement of perceptions. In exceptional cases, studies justified their selection of domains explicitly and well, though rarely were these choices made with the involvement of local people/people impacted by the initiative, and few studies explicitly discussed ethical conduct. This report reviews seven approaches to social impact assessment (Section 4), and in order not to duplicate other papers, summarises and links to papers and reports that review other appropriate approaches. In the analysis and guidance presented, it is important to distinguish between Social Impact Assessment (SIA) the initiative, for which principles and methodological guidance have been developed, and the phrase \u2018social impact assessments\u2019 commonly used to describe approaches and efforts to assess social impacts. Section 5 provides guidance on key issues that are critical to the design of good practice social impact assessments, with aspects selected for emphasis because of their significant impact on the quality and content of an assessment, and because they are often afforded insufficient attention in methods documentation, and are poorly integrated (or not integrated at all) in empirical studies. Three good practices are emphasised (Section 5.1), because while papers describing assessment methods note their importance in enabling an informative, inclusive and accountable social impact assessment, they appear to be infrequently implemented in published assessments. These are the practices of ensuring meaningful community participation and ethical conduct, ensuring an appropriate and informed design, and giving attention to the three aspects of equity: recognition, procedure and distribution. This report also provides guidance on designing a social impact assessment (Section 5.2), selecting appropriate methods and good practice principles to be followed throughout the assessment process. Good design requires ample consideration be given to specifying", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "576b35b4-493a-4df1-8f1c-a5cc69abc1b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "576b35b4-493a-4df1-8f1c-a5cc69abc1b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e3d0ec92124f544ddbe0c9375c8e8244059c3c7a98093ba3de7119b65c73aac"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ad3ea51-bcdc-47a9-83a4-021646236ff0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa8ce8e7c5cff0d0b7cf2153af8ee3d87be8b547907ba0fdb648e505dcf20ee8"}}, "hash": "2ff3731ee4eb6063bf0a6eb33f065dda6b313d19dfdf731b2b52b9e771c2ac6f", "text": "the questions that are to be answered by the assessment, to identifying an appropriate assessment framework and approach to explore those questions, and instigating effective assessment procedures and interactions, including integrating with site-level governance and involving stakeholders. The empirical review suggests these design questions have often been treated superficially, and often implicitly, in assessments to date. Rather than relying on standardised toolkits to prescribe the scope and methods for any conservation social impact assessment, the framework, the domains to be assessed and appropriate data collection tools should be determined through deliberative discussions. Notably, empirical studies and assessment reports seldom provide adequate justification for the choices made, including why certain issues and potential impacts have been excluded (for example, cultural practices, customary governance systems and rights are often overlooked), and why those selected were prioritised. Adherence to good practices and mainstreaming of robust and informative social impact assessments within conservation decision making are important to support progress towards better and more equitable governance. High quality, integrated social impact assessments are also a potentially crucial pathway to enhance accountability for social standards in conservation, particularly in the context of the rapid expansion of conservation initiatives that has been enshrined in the Global Biodiversity Framework targets for 2030.

Although the same methodology is unlikely to be appropriate or practical for all impact assessments \u2013 different approaches are needed to suit different objectives, scales and circumstances \u2013 there are certain criteria and principles which are common to all forms of social impact assessment, and some to conservation efforts more specifically. Previous reviews of social impact assessment practices in conservation have revealed both methods and their application to be disparate, with many constructed from scratch at a site, for a programme or organisation. Studies reviewing multiple assessments have also noted that conservation social impact assessments still have much to learn from standards and methodologies applied outside conservation (see Roe et al., 2013), and for this reason, some key references from outside conservation are utilised in this review.

The form and characteristics of the social objectives of conservation policies and programmes has further advanced since the early 2000s, going far beyond the simple identification of material costs and compensating with benefits, and viewing social impacts as outcomes that could be directly managed. Social aspects of conservation now centre on rights, equity and associated principles of good governance, being inclusive and respectful of diverse stakeholders and rightsholders (Franks et al., 2016; Gill et al., 2019). Those standards now relate to transparency, accountability, free prior and informed consent, full and effective participation, recognition of and respect for cultural identities, knowledge systems and customary institutions of Indigenous Peoples and local communities (Schreckenberg et al., 2016). Indeed the principles identified as specific to Social Impact Assessment (SIA) incorporate these more recent changes, as can be seen in Box 1. It is important to note the distinction between SIA as a specific approach described in detail in 1. Introduction Section 4.1, and the use of the phrase \u2018social impact assessment\u2019 which refers generally to the range of approaches designed to assess social impacts. Furthermore, contemporary site-level conservation initiatives are often complex, involving multiple public, private, civil society and local community actors. Rarely do they comprise a single initiative for protection, restoration or sustainable use, with distinct and specific social objectives. Conservation interventions more often involve conservation- and biodiversity-oriented actions and a mix of \u2018development\u2019 activities with overlapping aims and responsibilities, and interrelated decision-making processes and subsequent impacts (Game et al., 2014). Approaches to the assessment of social impacts must therefore build from frameworks that are capable of addressing these interrelations. As policy commitments have been made to an unprecedented expansion of conservation efforts globally (Geldmann et al., 2021), approaches to the assessment of social impacts must be afforded appropriate standing. Contemporary social standards and objectives have frequently been committed to in conservation policy and programme designs, but are more rarely actively adopted on the ground, creating a conspicuous and contentious gap (Tan, 2021). Given the acknowledged role of conservation interventions in displacing Indigenous Peoples and local communities over centuries as part of colonial, postcolonial and neoliberal political structures (Suich et al., 2009; Holmes and Cavanagh, 2016). It is imperative that future initiatives to address biodiversity loss do not impose further burdens on Indigenous Peoples and local communities and reproduce such injustices. Well designed social impact assessments, that are integrated in to programme design, implementation and governance processes, have a key role to play in identifying potential social impacts, and in avoiding or minimising negative impacts and maximising positive ones. Assessments also have the potential to shine a light on the importance of \u2013 and encourage action towards \u2013 more equitable approaches that recognise and respect rights. This report therefore reviews methodologies, methods and tools designed to assess and document the social impacts of conservation activities, and consolidates information from earlier reviews. Section 2 describes in detail the search methods used to find approaches to the assessment of social impacts for inclusion in the review, and describes the basic categories of analysis. Section 3 provides a summary of review papers and a rapid review of empirical studies. Section 4 provides a synthesis of each of the identified approaches for assessing social impacts (excepting those approaches that are well documented elsewhere). 1 Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation 1. Introduction However, ultimately, an understanding of social impacts is important to improve the design and adaptive management of conservation initiatives (see Kaplan-Hallam and Bennett, 2018), to respond to local people\u2019s needs (Indigenous Circle of Experts, 2018), and to meet conservation objectives. Thus, guidance is also provided in Section 5 on good practices and design decisions for impact assessments, in order to ensure practitioners are able to select the most appropriate method(s) to assess the social impacts of conservation interventions, taking into account site-level context. Drawing on both the review of these approaches and the empirical studies, three key good practices (Section 5.1) and six key steps to design a quality assessment (Section 5.2) are emphasised. The selection of these aspects was centred on ensuring assessments produce high quality output, rather than focusing on process-related steps. Section 6 summarises and concludes. Box 1\u2014 Social Impact Assessment-specific principles Source: Vanclay (2003) Twelve principles have been identified that are specific to Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and highlight the importance of the consideration of social impacts from the design stage, all the way through project implementation, and the respect for, and active involvement of, affected populations.

Introduction Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation 2 In order to find the widest range of material possible, a literature search was undertaken involving four steps. The first was a search of scholarly literature, followed by a search of the grey literature, both of which were supplemented by the use of \u2018snowball sampling\u2019 and a request for information that was circulated to the CEESP membership via its listserv in October 2021. A comprehensive search of journal articles, books and book chapters was undertaken using the search terms described in Table 1. These terms were used to search the Web of Science and Scopus academic journal databases, based on title, abstracts and keywords. A more purposive search of the grey literature was then undertaken, using a \u2018generic\u2019 Google search, in addition to searching the websites of 19 key international conservation organisations, research organisations, think tanks and other relevant organisations (see Appendix 1 for the list). Once these two searches were complete and the documents found added to a library, the third step was snowball sampling \u2013 identifying and adding key sources from the reviewed publications. Once the searches were complete, the documents added to the library, and duplicates removed, the remaining papers were subject to a two-stage screening process. The search identified a total of i.e.1,730 and 145 papers from the scholarly and grey literature, respectively, with approximately 154 duplicates removed. The first stage of screening involved excluding papers that were not considered to be relevant based on a reading of their title and abstract, after which, 177 and 127 papers from the scholarly and grey literature, respectively, remained. The second stage involved reading through the whole of the paper and determining (finally) its relevance and therefore inclusion. At the end of this process, 83 papers were reviewed (61 and 22 papers from the scholarly and grey literature, respectively), 47 were included in the assessment of methods, and 36 were included in the empirical review. The seven assessment approaches identified during the review process are described in Section 4 (excluding those already included in other reviews of social impact assessment approaches, for example, Schreckenberg et al., (2010)). 2.

Methods used in this study 3 Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation \u2018Toolkits\u2019 developed by conservation organisations were included because they provide a package that delivers some combination of a framework, methods and data collection tools. These toolkits are often freely available online, not hidden behind a paywall, as can be the case for approaches described in scholarly journals. Toolkits are often viewed as \u2018cheaper\u2019 (and simpler) because they include data collection tools, reducing the time investment and skills required to develop good quality tools. However, they can neglect to describe the conceptual or analytical framework used in the development of the toolkit, limiting users\u2019 full understanding of how and why choices have been made in the design stage. In the literature reviewed, there is frequent confusion in the terminology of methodology, methods and tools. A methodology is the \u2018complete package\u2019 of the conceptual or analytical framework, the research design, the selection of methods to be used and an assessment process that links those methods. A method typically refers to the form of the data gathering or analysis activity, for example, focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, surveys or participatory rapid appraisal methods. Finally tools are the specific instruments used to collect data appropriate to the method selected, for example a household survey instrument, a semi-structured interview protocol, etc. (Schreckenberg et al., 2010; Franks et al., 2018). The term \u2018approach\u2019 is used in this paper because of the mix of methodologies and methods reviewed. Social impacts in the context of this report refers to the full range of economic, social, cultural, political, environmental and psychological impacts on people whose lives are connected in some way to the ecosystem, biodiversity or place in question, including but not confined to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. There are several broad approaches to the design of impact assessments, such as those that are experimental (including \u2018counterfactually-based\u2019 designs that require some kind of comparison between exposure and non-exposure to the intervention) and those that are theory-based (which can be further distinguished in to pre-existing theory, explicit programme theory and grounded theory) (Stern, 2015). Experimental (randomised) and non- or quasi-experimental approaches are largely quantitative approaches based on statistical comparisons or using statistical methods to simulate the counterfactual. These approaches are less well suited to answering questions that first require the identification of the social impact domains affected by an initiative, and are more appropriate for generating quantitative answers regarding whether impacts identified can be attributed to the intervention and/or whether it made a \u2018difference\u2019. Ferraro and Hanauer (2014) provide an overview of experimental designs (including randomisation), conditioning designs (including matching and regression methods) and the use of instrumental variables and discontinuity designs. Most approaches discussed here fall within the scope of a theory-based design, though typically focus less on pre-existing theory and more on explicit programme theory or grounded theory. These approaches typically answer questions related to how the intervention has made a difference and whether it is likely to work elsewhere, and often, though not always, take a mixed methods approach1.

Methods used in this study Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation 4 Box 2 \u2014 Social impact domains used and defined in the SIA approach Source: Vanclay et al. (2015) The SIA approach identifies social impacts as changes to any of the following \u2018impact domains\u2019: Environment \u2013 including air and water quality; availability and quality of food; dust and noise hazards or risks; adequacy of sanitation, physical safety, and access to and control over resources (though the latter is categorised as political in this study). Economic \u2013 including personal and property rights, particularly whether people are economically affected, or experience personal disadvantage which may include a violation of their civil liberties. Social \u2013 including community cohesion, stability, character, services and facilities. Cultural \u2013 including shared beliefs, customs, values and language or dialect. Political \u2013 including the extent to which people are able to participate in decisions that affect their lives, the level of democratisation that is taking place, and the resources provided for this purpose. Psychological \u2013 including people\u2019s fears and aspirations, their perceptions about their safety, their fears about the future of their community, and their aspirations for their future and the future of their children. Wellbeing \u2013 including people\u2019s health and wellbeing \u2013 health is a state of complete physical, mental, social and spiritual wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Livelihoods \u2013 including how people live, work, play and interact with one another. 2. Methods used in this study 5 Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation Several studies are referenced heavily throughout this paper, in particular Schreckenberg et al.\u2019s review of rapid methodologies for the social assessment of conservation initiatives (2010), Woodhouse et al. (2016), which provides guidance about the process of designing social impact evaluations and Vanclay et al. (2015) which provides guidance specifically on the SIA approach. A number of additional key review papers were identified during the literature search and are summarised below. As part of a protocol for systematic mapping, Bottrill et al. (2014) synthesised the state and distribution of evidence linking conservation and human wellbeing, and used a theory of change approach to identify the causal linkages between conservation and human wellbeing. Roe et al. (2013) focuses on providing an overview of the trade-offs between rigor and practicality in different approaches to social impact assessment. As part of a series of lessons learned from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) projects implemented by Fauna and Flora International, (2014) discusses the implementation of the SIA approach in that context. Jones et al. (2017) identify directions to assist in designing effective tools to understand and measure social impacts, and address issues of displacement, power and human rights explicitly. One paper focused solely on quantitative approaches, and Ferraro and Hanauer (2014) provides a detailed review of experimental and quasi-experimental designs and discusses these in the context of improving environmental programmes. Data collection methods for assessments capturing wellbeing impacts are a focus of de Lange et al.(2016), which also discusses study design and attribution. Several review papers focused on indicators \u2013 even if that was only part of the objective \u2013 including an unpublished study that reviewed existing indicators and methodologies that could be used to assess the human impact of protected areas, largely reflecting poverty\u2013environment linkages (Giuliani, 2007). Turrall and Studd (2009) synthesised good practice, frameworks and methodologies that aimed to identify and understand changes in people\u2019s lives and livelihoods (specifically", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee00c232-4fc0-432a-b1b2-cbc6e2e0732e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee00c232-4fc0-432a-b1b2-cbc6e2e0732e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48b9ce41ed4882cca9f45adf67abf6a37357ec1ddd1754372f8ae4f05ea9f453"}}, "hash": "48b9ce41ed4882cca9f45adf67abf6a37357ec1ddd1754372f8ae4f05ea9f453", "text": "by identifying frameworks used and developed by agencies focused on international development), which was particularly relevant to the design of monitoring and evaluation systems. Homewood (2013) focused more specifically on socio-economic monitoring of conservation, and includes discussion of the main challenges of monitoring such impacts. More recently, Corrigan et al. (2018) analysed indicators relating to social impact and wellbeing (with specific attention to local communities and Indigenous Peoples\u2019 contexts), specifically those that have been used in protected area effectiveness tools, while Bennett (2016) presents evidence on the use of perceptions to improve conservation, as an alternative to quantitative studies that can be expensive and complicated. 3. Reviews of assessments of social impacts and empirical studies 3.1. Empirical studies included in the review Finally, several reviews of the empirical literature have also been conducted, each with their own angle of interest. Holmes and Cavanagh (2016) reviewed case studies of neoliberal conservation projects to identify patterns and trends in social impacts, and which deals more explicitly with issues of power, conflict and contestation than most other reviews. The empirical literature on the social and environmental impacts of government-controlled protected areas and conservation concessions in South America was reviewed by Schleicher (2018), while the literature about social impacts of European protected areas was reviewed by Jones et al. (2020), which also highlights new directions for current policy frameworks in the region. Smallhorn-West et al. (2020) reviewed and synthesised evaluation studies from the South Pacific relating to marine protected areas, and Ma et al. (2020) reviewed cases from Asia, Africa and South America assessing the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks, thought examining only positive impacts. Within the papers identified for inclusion as part of the methods review, a total of 36 papers were identified as conducting some kind of assessment of social impacts of conservation initiatives in low and/or middle income countries, and an overview of these is provided. All of the reviewed papers were published since 2006, the bulk of them since 2014, and all but one were scholarly publications (i.e. published in academic journals). As noted above, these empirical papers were coded using the same categories as the review of methods and approaches. Figure 1 illustrates the domains that were explicitly stated as being considered in the empirical social impact assessments reviewed, including environmental impacts. 3. Reviews of assessments of social impacts and empirical studies Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation 6 It can be seen that around two-thirds (64%) of the papers assessed impacts on three or fewer domains, and that the 8% of papers (three) that appear to have covered all domains, in fact describe the potential of the methods to identify impacts on any or all of the eight domains, depending on context. Just over half (56%) of the studies stated that they were examining both positive and negative impacts; the remainder did not state explicitly the direction of the impacts being considered. Table 2 shows the number of domains covered by each of the reviewed papers. In approximately 71% of the empirical studies, the variables measured were selected by the researchers or authors.2 Local people were involved in approximately 10% of cases, with local institutions/ organisations involved in a further 7%, a mix of stakeholders in 7% of cases and other combinations in 5% of cases. Given the importance of understanding issues around equity, and the distribution of positive and negative impacts, it is perhaps surprising that so few studies utilised disaggregated data, with almost three quarters of the papers (72%, or 26) not doing so. Five papers disaggregated by wealth or income, while only three disaggregated by gender and three by age. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 No. of papers Social impact domain Economic Psychological * Environmental Social Health and wellbeing Political Cultural Livelihood Other * Psychological domain includes perceptions.

The selection and justification of data collection methods was perhaps the most comprehensively discussed. 33% of studies used surveys, 28% used interviews (semi-structured or structured), and 11% used focus group discussions. Other participatory methods were used by 7% and participant observation was used by 6%. Two studies (3%) used participatory rural appraisal/rapid rural appraisal, while one did not specify, and 11% used \u2018other methods\u2019. 91% of papers used data collection tools that were designed specifically for the study being described, with only approximately 6% using \u2018standardised\u2019 tools (such as the basic necessities survey) or standardised tools with modifications. Seven in 10 studies used primary data only, and almost three in 10 utilised both primary and secondary data (and for one paper, the data source was not specified). Studies used exclusively qualitative data in just 14% of the papers, and exclusively quantitative data in one third (33%), as can be seen in Figure 2. Half of the papers (50%) used mixed methods, reflecting a growing trend for combining methods for more informative assessment of impacts. One paper did not specify their use of qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods approaches in the methods section of the paper \u2013 a significant oversight. As studies of poverty have revealed, different methodological choices can lead to potentially divergent understandings of social impacts and their drivers being generated from the same communities (Dawson, 2015), so it is surprising that 15 out of the 18 mixed method studies did not specify the type of mixed methods utilised (i.e. whether a triangulation, embedded, exploratory or explanatory approach). The three that did, all used a triangulation approach, employing qualitative and quantitative methods concurrently (to provide potentially complementary insights). However, triangulation does not integrate them strategically to adapt to, and build on, one another. The importance of the way in which methods are selected and combined cannot be overstated and is discussed further in Section 5.2.3. From this overview, it can be seen that the bulk of empirical papers are not comprehensive in their coverage, with their approaches and methods often relatively poorly explained and justified. However, four papers in particular were more clear about their approach, and are summarised below to highlight good practices in their design, in their application, and/or in the use of the information derived from the assessment.

In several cases, those responsible for measure selection were not explicitly identified, and it is assumed in these cases that the researchers/paper authors were responsible. 3. Reviews of assessments of social impacts and empirical studies 7 Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation managed waters between them, using the \u2018most significant change\u2019 method. The assessment looked at the breadth of changes across any wellbeing dimension when answering the question of \u2018what are the most significant [positive or negative] changes you have experienced through the seascape project in the past 2\u20135 years?\u2019. The questions focus on the most significant change, meaning the most material and visible impacts are emphasised, whereas non-material resources and intangible aspects of wellbeing such as cultural values and trust are likely to be understated. The analysis considers causal mechanisms, based on exploring people\u2019s perceptions of causes, and is strong in analysing relationships among variables and including environmental links either causing or caused by social change. Participatory evaluation methods have the dual benefit of encouraging iterative, collaborative and adaptive project management (i.e. through shared lesson learning) and being driven by \u2018perceptions of intervention beneficiaries\u2019, thereby requiring minimal baselines or counterfactuals (Woodhouse et al., 2016). However, a weakness of this analysis is that it is not disaggregated and does not explore social differentiation. Allgood et al. (2019) assessed nine community based wildlife conservation projects, using the framework of the Government of Bhutan\u2019s Gross National Happiness index, to systematically identify wellbeing factors through a community-driven method. By using this framework with an holistic approach to the impact dimensions incorporated, cultural impacts, governance and customary institutions were included, and did not rely on local participants identifying these, reducing the chance they would be overlooked in favour of more tangible, material impacts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea72362e-23fe-461f-8894-0cea99ccced3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea72362e-23fe-461f-8894-0cea99ccced3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Review of methods for assessing the social impacts of conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e2297afb93e0c2b746c82391db4e0292ff12092f1a8aec9bcb0d57f8e2dfdbd"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d71cc40-04ce-4437-a780-d80d0b3c2085", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-methods-assessing-social-impacts-conservation", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a73f312903930f3e7c2dd181d470046e58904160f2a14be872610360efe349c"}}, "hash": "4bf4caae8779204bff429ff1158072fadc73802bfb2176fd480e481ab04a1f87", "text": "However, while the approach was useful in obtaining an overview and assessment of the planning processes for the projects, it was only able to generate a superficial level of understanding.

Larson et al. (2020) is highlighted because of its focus on Indigenous Peoples, and on allowing local communities to identify impacts of importance (though the study is from Australia, a wealthy nation compared to the other empirical studies reviewed). This assessment used a wellbeing impact evaluation approach, and was a broad exploratory study, open to impacts on multiple dimensions being identified. \u2018Yarn-ups\u2019 (interviews) were undertaken with Indigenous participants from communities involved in Indigenous land and sea management programmes (ILSMPs). These prioritised wellbeing aspects that were perceived to be important to individuals\u2019 personal wellbeing, identified whether these aspects were impacted on by ILSMPs (or not), and determined changes in satisfaction with these aspects over time. This self-definition has implications for the potential of ILSMPs to improve local communities\u2019 wellbeing, by highlighting which aspects are of most importance and adapting the design and implementation to improve the benefits associated with them. Gurney et al. (2015) employed a quasi-experimental methodology to assess socioeconomic impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Sulawesi (Indonesia), specifically seeking to disentangle different drivers of change and ascertain, in the face of considerable complexity, whether the MPAs had contributed to poverty alleviation. The authors utilised the \u2018difference-in-difference method\u2019 to analyse changes and patterns over 15 years (spanning pre-, mid- and post-MPA implementation). The analysis compared four project villages with four control villages, and disaggregated results by age, religion and gender within the villages. The indicators of wellbeing and poverty were not determined by communities, but were based loosely on a World Bank framework for multidimensional poverty, and comprised dimensions of security, opportunity and empowerment. The analysis was able to detect short-term poverty alleviation impacts i
