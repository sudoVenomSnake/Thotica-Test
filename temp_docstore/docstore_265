To verify this, a deeper analysis of the data on energy access, poverty, energy consumption and GHG emissions is performed for the selected countries as well as for the Asia-Pacific region as a whole (Table 15). For convenience, the population is classified into rich (share of population living with an income of above $2.0 (2005 PPP) a day), poor (share of population living with an income between $2.0 and $1.25 (2005 PPP) a day) and extremely poor (share of population living with an income of below $1.25 (2005 PPP) a day). These three income groups are matched with the share of population classified into three groups formed based on different levels of energy access, namely, shares of population with access to both modern cooking fuels and electricity, with only electricity access and without access to modern fuels, and with no access to electricity as well as modern fuels (Table 7). Further, for these groups of population, the per capita household energy consumption and per capita GHG emissions are compared. The results show that only in India and Indonesia, all the rich have access to both electricity and modern fuels. In the case of all other countries, significant share of rich population (as defined in the present study) do not have the access to both electricity and modern fuels. This is true even for Asia-Pacific region as a whole. Except for Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, the rich population of all the countries including the Asia-Pacific region as a whole, have access to electricity. Thus, the lack of access is mostly confined to modern fuels for cooking. Countries such as China, India, Philippines and Viet Nam have done well by extending the electricity access to all the poor and to the significant share of extremely poor people (Table 15). China has done exceedingly well on this aspect with only 0.6% of the population requiring to be electrified. This possibly indicates the effectiveness of electricity access programmes and affordable electricity prices achieved through subsidies. It may be observed from the table that even the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has the electricity coverage reaching all the poor population indicating few other countries achieving equally significant success in expanding electricity access. However, countries like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal and Papua New Guinea with relatively low electricity access levels have failed to cover all the poor population. Expect in the case of India and to a certain extent Indonesia; in all the countries only the rich enjoy the privilege of using modern fuels for cooking. The highly subsidized prices associated with LPG and kerosene must have been the reason for the larger section of the poor in India having access to modern fuels for cooking. In summary, it may be stated that on an average, the rich in the developing countries of Asia-Pacific have access to electricity and modern fuels, the poor have access to only electricity and the extremely poor do not have access to both. Extending this logic of relationship between access levels and income levels, the comparisons with per capita energy consumption and GHG emissions provide some interesting observations (Table 15). Comparing the average values for the Asia-Pacific, the section of the population with access to both electricity and modern fuels or the rich population has the lowest per capita energy consumption levels with highest per capita GHG emissions. This indicates the fossil fuel dominance of energy use and the high energy efficiency associated with its use. The poor people having access only to electricity and not to modern fuels has the highest per capita energy consumption levels suggesting the use of inefficient solid fuels for 31 cooking along with electricity and their per capita emission levels are significantly high being very close to the levels of rich people. The extremely poor people with no access to electricity and modern fuels entirely rely on solid fuels for cooking and mainly kerosene for inadequate lighting. Though their per capita energy consumption levels are high due to inefficiency associated with the use of solid fuels and the per capita GHG emission levels are low due to dominant use of renewable biomass energy. Even the country specific results suggest the same. The GHG emissions on a per capita basis in the case of extremely poor people are very small even though their per capita energy consumption levels are high. The small island countries like Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu show a contradicting picture (Table 15). In their case both per capita energy consumption as well as emission levels are low indicating a greater divide between the rich and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "527b4907-f973-4f9d-95e1-a29c332ed55c": {"__data__": {"id_": "527b4907-f973-4f9d-95e1-a29c332ed55c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22851a8797d05ebf9a43b769229da889d3253a88e8377d4d651a5e1fdc0d7d1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "06659b2b-51ba-4a60-9a8c-40a72ceaca87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "726f73eab470678471631a36656123373628308d90cf0b4f1ea13855046628c5"}}, "hash": "b3543a322072b0120cdbd4718fd38236818cc4db54b9abeb624675cf6a642705", "text": "poor in quality and quantity of energy use. Even Bangladesh has similar conditions prevailing. 4. Sources of Energy in the Industrial sector The industrial sector is the dominant consumer of final energy in Asia and the Pacific region including Central and West Asia, East Asia, Pacific region, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the developed group of countries in the region. As per the estimates of Asian Development Bank (ADB 2009c), the industrial sector accounted for nearly 42% of the total final energy consumption in 2006. Unlike the household sector, the industrial sector contributes directly to economic development through the production of goods and services. Table 16 contains the details of the quantity of various energy carriers consumed by the industrial sector in 2007 for the Asia-Pacific region as a whole as well as for the selected developing countries of the region. Further, the regional data is compared with the world totals. Electricity and fuel oil are consumed by all the countries of the region. The analysis of the data shows that about 83% of the coal, 37% of the firewood, 52% of the bagasse, and 38% of the electricity consumed by the industries of the world are accounted by the industries of the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific. This domination is mainly because of China, where the industries consume 67% of the coal and 79% of the electricity consumed by the industrial sector of the Asia-Pacific. The higher firewood share is because of high industrial consumption in Indonesia (45%) and India (43%) in the region. India is the major consumer of bagasse with a share of 49%. To assess the significance of various types of energy carriers consumed by the industrial sector of the region, the quantum of consumption given in individual units (Table 15) have been converted into common unit (TJ) and shown in Table 17. In total, the industries of the Asia-Pacific region consumed about 31,700 PJ of energy in 2007 compared to the total world industrial energy consumption of 79,111 PJ. This works out to a share of about 40%. Among the countries of the region, China accounts for nearly 61% and India for 16% of the total industrial energy consumption in the Asia-Pacific. China\u2019s very high energy share is mainly because of the high concentration of the energy intensive manufacturing industries in the country. The two most dominant industrial energy carriers in the Asia-Pacific are coal with nearly 40% and electricity with 31% shares where as the dominant energy carriers in the world are electricity with a share of about 32% and natural gas with a share of about 27%. Solid fuels with about 48% share dominate the industrial energy scene in the Asia-Pacific whereas they account for only 26.6% in the world industrial energy consumption. Coal is a dominant industrial fuel in China, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Viet Nam. India and Mongolia are the two main lignite using countries. The dominant industrial fuel in Bangladesh and Malaysia is natural gas. The small island developing countries of the Pacific region rely mostly on diesel and electricity for their industrial energy needs (Table 17).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

The total GHG emission from the industrial energy use in the Asia-Pacific region is estimated at 3,910 million tonne of CO2e in 2007, which is about 41% of the world industrial emissions of 9,535 million tonne of CO2e. In the Asia-Pacific region, GHG emissions from electricity consumption with 57% and coal with 29% shares account for the largest contribution to the total emissions. In the region, major share of the electricity is generated using coal. The estimates for the world show that electricity with 62%, coal with 14% and natural gas with 13% are the major contributors to the total emissions. It is obvious that with highest share in industrial energy consumption, China accounts for nearly 70% of the GHG emissions contributed by the Asia-Pacific region. This is significantly higher than its 61% share in energy consumption indicating carbon intensiveness of China\u2019s industrial energy use. India is a distant second with a share of about 13% in total GHG emissions which is less than its share of energy consumption of 16%. Table 20 contains the estimates of black carbon emissions from the industrial energy use. The total emission of black carbon is nearly 285,000 tonne in the Asia-Pacific region, which is substantially less than the household emission of BC. Higher energy efficiency levels of industrial energy devices, better control measures and lesser dependence on solid fuels are the possible reasons for low emission of BC. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for nearly 38% of the world BC emissions due to industrial energy use. Diesel with 43% and bagasse with 38% shares are the major contributors to BC emissions in the region. Similar trend is observed even with respect to world emissions of BC with diesel having a share of 59% and bagasse having 28% share. China, because of its extensive dependency on coal, accounts for nearly 38% of the BC emissions in the Asia-Pacific region. India with a share of about 27% is the second big emitter of BC with Indonesia occupying the third position with a share of 11%.

Energy Access, Poverty, Sustainable Development and Climate Change United Nation\u2019s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) represent the economic, social and environmental aspirations of humanity for a dignified and sustainable living. The development process towards achieving the MDGs is expected to follow a sustainable development path taking into account the needs of the large number of poor and adverse impact on the environment. The MDGs formulated at the 2002 Johannesburg Summit explicitly acknowledged that access to modern energy services is an essential element of sustainable development. In this respect, in April 2001, the ninth session of the Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD) concluded that to implement the goal accepted by the international community to halve the proportion of people living on less than US $1 per day by 2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite (CSD9 2002). Therefore, even though access to modern energy carriers for basic as well as productive livelihoods is not one of the eight MDGs, it has been considered as the most critical input to achieve each of the MDGs (UNDP 2005, Modi et al 2005). In this context, household energy access for cooking, lighting and many other important end-uses forms an important linkage in achieving the MDGs and thereby sustainable economic development. Strong action supported by political commitment is critical for tackling the challenge of energy poverty resulting from lack of energy access. Therefore effective policies and programmes are needed to encourage the integration of energy into development programmes and processes at the sub-national level (UNDP, 2009b). One of the outcomes of lack of energy access is the continued dependence on traditional fuels like fuel wood and cattle dung. The inefficient production and use of traditional biomass based energy sources are posing serious economic, environmental, and health threats (Barnes and Floor 1996, Sagar 2005). The energy problems of the developing countries are both serious and widespread. Developing countries are far behind in expanding access to modern energy, whether to meet nationally set energy access targets or to facilitate achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (UNDP-WHO 2009). The use of traditional biomass as a survival fuel by poor in the developing countries have largely contributed to unsustainable development with outcomes like gender discrimination, health hazards, sub-standard living conditions and emission of products of incomplete combustion (PICs) contributing to climate change (Sagar and Kartha 2007). Affordable and reliable access to electricity end-use services results in increased productivity in agriculture and labor, improvement in the delivery of health and education, access to communications (radio, telephone, television, mobile telephone), improved lighting, enabling the use of drudgery reducing mills, motors, and pumps, and increasing public safety through outdoor lighting (UNDP 2005). Rural electrification at a household level provides at the very minimum basic services such as lighting and communications (e.g. radio/television) and can increasingly meet the aspirations of the rural populations to own other household appliances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3c83524-3139-428c-8a41-78b2b07ffa8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3c83524-3139-428c-8a41-78b2b07ffa8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a3d93123a9da57d2a3f2c81fe6ffb773d840f80c8c53d43f6fbe3f8acac156f"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc95d137-a204-46a4-812e-e69e723b43fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c765902e94d5ce286e5714eec3db1e19c9fd2375aca0f97e7b082e01211f6aef"}}, "hash": "48cb0bacd057534f4da187484fc3815c473a97729d760480cbe88a4d8e62bf68", "text": "Lighting is an important household energy service as it is directly related to quality and productivity of life. Unlike heating or cooking, lighting is the energy end-use that is associated more exclusively with electricity as it can provide high levels of light at high efficiency compared to a kerosene-based light source (Dutt 1994). Household electrification also increases the likelihood that women will read and earn income. Thus, lack of access to modern energy carriers has implications for economic, social and environmental well being of humanity.

Expanding Energy Access for Building Empowerment and Resilience As explained above expanding access to modern energy carriers provides direct and indirect as well as tangible and intangible benefits to the population, especially, to the poor population in the developing countries.

Further, with the adoption of low-carbon pathway to expand energy access has significant environmental and ecological benefits. All these contribute to empowering the poor and build resilience to adversities. Resilience could be built through economic, knowledge, human and social empowerments. Figure 6: Linking energy access to sustainable development, empowerment and resilience In the next few sections, we have discussed how the chosen countries have performed with respect to economic, human and environmental development indicators. Since there was no quantitative data with respect to social development, it was excluded from the analysis. The indicators of environmental development include two sets of indicators, namely, indicators measuring the extent of contributions to climate change and climate change vulnerability. 5-2. Implications for Economic Development Benefits Reaching the Poor As discussed earlier, energy development through expanded access to modern energy carriers has implications for economic development. This could happen through employment generation, skill development through education and information dissemination, establishment of small and micro-enterprises, access to markets, expansion of economic activities, etc. Similarly, a country with higher economic development is expected to have Energy Access Economic Development Human Development Social Development Environmental Development Empower- ment Resilience 42 better energy infrastructure and thereby more people with access to modern energy. Thus, GDP per capita measures the level of economic development of a country and the poverty counts indicates the extent of reach of the economic development to the larger section of the population (Table 22). The percentage population living below $1.25 a day could be categorized as extremely poor and that below $2 a day as poor. Even though the average GDP per capita of Asia-Pacific region is just one-third of that of the world its share of extremely poor population of 23.5% is less than the average for the world at 26.2%. This is indicates the benefits of economic development, though low, is better distributed in the Asia- Pacific. However, the share of poor population in the Asia-Pacific is high at 51.8% compared to the world average of 40%, which is an indicator of lower economic development in the region. Among the chosen countries, India though enjoys a higher GDP per capita compared to Viet Nam, the share of extremely poor people in India is almost double (41.6%) that of Viet Nam (21.5%). Even the share of poor people in India is significantly higher than that in Vietnam. This indicates poor distribution of wealth and suggests that mere increase in GDP will not help in eradication of poverty. Nepal and Bangladesh have the highest share of extreme poor as well as poor. India follows them at the third position. As per the earlier discussion, we found that the energy access situation in the south-Asia region is precarious and it is equally true with the extent of poverty prevailing in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96aa1ed4-9964-4f89-8d5a-c57781d2a0f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "96aa1ed4-9964-4f89-8d5a-c57781d2a0f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a7c8cd8e489d022c907375da28a18f81acdc7a6de9d8f2e8c2448c71f2b3e49"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7f2de2b-d67c-414c-8840-63e736561243", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7115d29f8e359cae973a34af1f12605ba8e63662077290a7c1a13837ae178da"}}, "hash": "8d714a992eab589abaab52a4e227d343dc823f25c4fba0a389bca9cc002ba8f9", "text": "Table 22: Indicators of economic development \u2013 Access to economic benefits Country GDP Per capita in 2008 (2005 PPP)* % Population living below $1.25/day (2005 PPP) in 2005* % Population living below the national poverty line in 2005* % Population living below $2.0 (2005 PPP) a day (2000-2007)# Share of poorest quintile in income or consumption (%) in 2005* Bangladesh 1,233 49.6 40.0 81.3 9.4 Cambodia 1,760 40.2 35.0 68.2 7.1 China 5,511 15.9 2.8 36.3 5.7 India 2,747 41.6 28.6 75.6 8.1 Indonesia 3,674 29.4 16.7 60.0 7.1 Malaysia 13,139 2.0 7.8 6.4 Mongolia 3,297 22.4 36.1 49.0 7.2 Nepal 1,028 55.1 30.9 77.6 6.1 Palau 7,600 22.6 32.6 \u2014 \u2014 Philippines 3,244 22.6 45.0 5.6 Solomon Islands 2,413 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Sri Lanka 4,215 14.0 22.7 39.7 6.8 Thailand 7,120 2.0 13.6 11.5 6.1 Tonga 3,535 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Vanuatu 3,677 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Viet Nam 2,574 21.5 28.9 48.4 7.1 Asia-Pacific 3,172 23.5 14.8 51.8 7.0 World 9,634 26.2 20.9 40.0 \u2014 Source: *UNESCAP 2010a, #World Bank 2009, CIA 2010 Note: \u201c\u2014\u201d indicates data is not available 43 5-3.

This would also enhance the capacity of the people to access improved services related to water and sanitation. To make a comparison at the macro level, indicators related to poverty, gender, human development, health, education and access to improved services are used and the indicator values have been obtained from various secondary sources (Tables 23 and 24). Poverty gap is the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall), expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence (UN 2010). The indicator is often described as measuring the per capita amount of resources needed to eliminate poverty. Poverty gap ratio expresses the total amount of money which would be needed to raise the poor from their present incomes to the poverty line, as a proportion of the poverty line, and averaged over the total population, which measures the depth of poverty (Harvey 2009). Multidimensional poverty index (MPI) is obtained from Alkire and Santos (2010). According to the authors, it is an index of acute multidimensional poverty and it is a combination of head count of poor and deprivations in very rudimentary services and core human functioning. The deprivations are measured as a composite indicator developed using individual indicators of health (child mortality, nutrition or malnourishment), education (years of schooling, child enrolment) and standard of living (lack of access to electricity, drinking water and sanitation, quality of flooring, type of cooking fuel, assets owned). Thus, the MPI is the product of two numbers: the headcount or percentage of people who are poor, and the average intensity of deprivation (Alkire and Santos 2010). Gini index is the measure of inequality in income distribution. Human development index (HDI) is the composite measure of human development, which is composed by using country level data on life expectancy, education and gross national income (GNI) per capita. The values for these indicators for the selected countries as well as for the whole of Asia- Pacific region are given in Table 23. We have used these indicators as the measure of the extent of the reach of the benefits of economic and energy development to the poor. Asia- Pacific has a smaller poverty gap ratio compared to the world average indicating lesser depth in poverty. However, for countries like Nepal, Bangladesh, Cambodia and India there is a need for substantial efforts to bridge this gap. The high values associated with the multi- dimensional poverty index too points out to the deficiencies in these countries with respect to eradication of poverty and providing access to basic services required for dignified human living. Bangladesh has exhibited a lower inequality in income distribution even in poverty. This is not the case with Nepal where inequalities are very high, indicated by high value of Gini index. The estimates of HDI do not present a rosy picture for the countries of the Asia- Pacific. On an average, the human development is lower in Asia-Pacific compared to the world but far better than sub-Saharan Africa.

These indicators are related to gender empowerment, non-income HDI value, life expectancy at birth, mean and expected years of schooling, access to improved services and impact of indoor air pollution. Though both life expectancy and education are part of non-income HDI value, we have retained them in the list of indicators for better comparison and to learn about the relative deficiencies. The gender inequalities are highest among poor countries and those are having low energy access levels (Table 24). China has the least gender inequality index (GII) value indicating higher levels of gender empowerment. The non-income HDI scores indicating the level of achievements with respect to life expectancy and education are relatively high for Tonga, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. These high scores could be further validated by observing the higher achievements of these countries with respect life expectancy of above 74 years and mean schooling years of 8 and above. Sri Lanka though a poor country in terms of per capita GDP has done well with respect to other development indicators. This is true even with respect to providing access to better sanitation and potable water with more than 90% of the people having access. Cambodia, India and Nepal are the worst performers with respect to providing access to good sanitation facilities (Table 24). Their performance is same as that of sub-Saharan Africa. Except for Papua New Guinea and Cambodia, all other countries in Asia-Pacific have done 45 well with providing access to clean drinking water to the majority of the population. Most direct impact of using solid fuels for cooking is the indoor air pollution. The indoor air pollution is considered as one of the most important causes of deaths in the world. Cambodia with 1,304 deaths per million people in 2004 and India with 954 deaths occupy the top two positions. This indicates their over reliance on traditional fuels for cooking in the closed environment. Next two countries with highest deaths are the neighbouring countries of India, namely, Nepal and Bangladesh. This should be the single most important reason for these countries to prevent the use of solid fuels and promote the climbing of the energy ladder.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d87ad0e-57be-47ae-923e-853b4d21fa40": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d87ad0e-57be-47ae-923e-853b4d21fa40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43e645d07401fe15a6060caff171db17bbbec2500d2124f8e725b3a2c9912f96"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5eb2fdd-0add-4d76-a473-81df5f8d6c0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4ea0575f0a499b70511c04eda8b6f0979a482fbc079f13d511aca35c0598f22"}}, "hash": "4d95e794b9d1d88d1d4d3d46a7bb6d9c8558390423b4b654be836291dad9fe71", "text": "Table 24: Indicators of human development - Outcome of development Country Gender Inequali ty Index (GII) Value 2008 Non- incom e HDI value in 2010 Life expectanc y at birth in 2010 (years) Mean years of schoolin g in 2010 (years) Expecte d years of schoolin g in 2010 (years) Population with access to improved services (%) in 2008 Deaths due to indoor & outdoor air/ water pollution in 2004 (per million people)# Wate r Sanitatio n Bangladesh 0.734 0.543 66.9 4.8 8.1 80 53 821 Cambodia 0.672 0.566 62.2 5.8 9.8 61 29 1,304 China 0.405 0.707 73.5 7.5 11.4 89 55 693 India 0.748 0.549 64.4 4.4 10.3 88 31 954 Indonesia 0.680 0.663 71.5 5.7 12.7 80 52 505 Malaysia 0.493 0.775 74.7 9.5 12.5 100 96 60 Mongolia 0.523 0.710 67.3 8.3 13.5 76 50 318 Nepal 0.716 0.506 67.5 3.2 8.8 88 31 877 Papua New Guinea 0.784 0.447 61.6 4.3 5.2 40 45 737 Philippines 0.623 0.726 72.3 8.7 11.5 91 76 322 Solomon Islands \u2014 0.550 67.0 4.5 9.1 \u2014 \u2014 433 Sri Lanka 0.599 0.738 74.4 8.2 12.0 90 91 315 Thailand 0.586 0.683 69.3 6.6 13.5 98 96 345 Tonga \u2014 0.792 72.1 10.4 13.7 100 96 0 Vanuatu \u2014 \u2014 70.8 \u2014 10.4 83 52 0 Viet Nam 0.530 0.646 74.9 5.5 10.4 94 75 438 Asia-Pacific 0.637 0.633 67.9 6.6 11.0 83 65 532 Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 0.436 52.7 4.5 9.0 58 31 \u2014 World 0.560 0.663 69.3 7.4 12.3 87 62 \u2014 Source: UNDP 2010b, #Gumartini 2009 Note: \u201c\u2014\u201d indicates data is not available The above assessment suggest that there are significant benefits in terms of both economic and social gains due to interventions like switching from biomass to modern fuels, reducing exposure to indoor pollution, using efficient cookstoves and the benefits clearly outweigh the costs of such interventions.

The bundling of services like water, sanitation and education with electricity has disproportionately larger benefits; the whole is substantially larger than the sum of the parts (UNDP 2007a). Another serious implication of solid fuel use for cooking is health impacts due to indoor air pollution. At present about 37% of the world\u2019s population rely on biomass as their primary fuel for cooking. Over half of those people live either in India or Sub-Saharan Africa. Reliance on solid fuels often results in regular exposure to harmful emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter. Exposure to these is an important cause of disease and mortality in developing countries. The indoor pollution caused by burning these fuels in conventional stoves has significant affect on the health of women and children. Conservative estimates of global mortality show that in 2000 between 1.5 and 2 million deaths were attributed to this risk factor. This accounts for approximately 3% to 4% of total mortality worldwide. Approximately one million of the deaths were due to childhood acute (lower) respiratory infections (ALRI), with the remainder due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) followed by lung cancer among adult women (Ezzati and Kammen 2002). According to the estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO) about 1.5 million premature deaths occur each year due to indoor air pollution. In addition, it is estimated that indoor air pollution causes about 36% of lower respiratory infections and 22% of chronic respiratory disease (WHO, 2006a). The recent estimates confirm these findings. According to a study by UNDP and WHO, globally almost two million deaths occur annually from pneumonia, chronic lung disease, and lung cancer are associated with exposure to indoor air pollution resulting from cooking with biomass and coal, and 99% of them occur in developing countries (UNDP-WHO 2009, Ezzati and Kammen 2002). Exposure to respirable particles is strongly associated with acute respiratory infections (ARI) among children accounting for the largest number of child deaths (World Bank 2004). Combination of disease and biomass collection burden decreases productivity and quality of livelihoods of the poor and reduces the time children spend in school, thus contributing to the vicious cycle of poverty and ill health (World Bank 2004). Women and children, especially the girl children, suffer most from indoor air pollution, because traditionally they are responsible for household chores. Also women and children are typically responsible for biomass collection, an exhausting task that can result in long-term physical damage (IEA 2009). 5-4. Implications for Environmental Development The implications for environmental development are analysed keeping in mind the possibilities of mitigating the negative effects of climate change and building climate change resilience. In this regard, lack of modern energy access and over dependency on solid fuels has significant negative implications for climate change. It has significant global warming effects, due to incomplete combustion of carbon present in the fuel (UNDP-WHO 2009, Smith et al. 2000) as well as due emission GHGs. These aspects have already been discussed in the earlier section (Section 3.3). In this section, we have limited our focus to study the implications of inadequate energy and economic developments, which result in lack of access to modern energy carriers and income poverty, on the climate change by analyzing various indicators related to CO2 emissions (Table 25). In addition, the indicators of environmental/ecological development and degradation are used to study how lack of development in economic and energy systems has contributed to such a status as well as how such level of degradation will impact the poor people and countries (Table 26). We have 47 assumed that these indicators are appropriate for representing the extent of vulnerability to climate change adversities. The analysis suggests that all the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific together accounted for about 31% of the global energy related CO2 emissions with China accounting for almost 67% of this amount (Table 25). India is a distant second with a contribution of just 15%. In terms of per capita emissions only Malaysia and China have higher emissions compared to the global average. As a whole, Asia-Pacific appears to be a low carbon intensive region both in terms of per capita emissions as well as carbon intensity of GDP. The countries with highly inadequate energy development such as Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal have very low per capita emission levels. Excepting Tonga, the situation is similar even in Pacific Island countries. These low per capita emissions in these countries are an outcome of poverty and dependency on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fdb1ef1-8bba-4e59-a749-b8b0befb8cd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fdb1ef1-8bba-4e59-a749-b8b0befb8cd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "476cf75fbb9ff6d882f80743e2edee102f6118d42322e0d6a557ae20ef5dde90"}, "3": {"node_id": "88035b9c-8273-4a6f-832e-751e6eece788", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f23477a7f045594fedf164612b9f2591b00c2841545f471344904c456b4862a9"}}, "hash": "8fbcbdab6e95ca6a36a7a3130d91888d41c5ccc9e04a2606e679ad20d09f10a1", "text": "traditional biomass fuels.

It appears to be a fact that all these countries are adopting a low-carbon path to economic development, albeit at a very slow rate. However, this is an undesirable low-carbon pathway, which promotes poverty, both income and energy. The carbon intensities in these countries are bound to increase with the climbing of the energy ladder and modernization of the economy. This may be noted from the higher carbon intensities observed in the case of emerging economies like China, Thailand, Indonesia and India.

The data for the Asia-Pacific suggest that on an average it has a better ecological footprint at 1.5 hectares per capita compared to the global average of 1.8 hectares per capita (Table 26). The smaller Pacific Island countries exert higher pressure on the earth\u2019s resources with ecological footprint ranging from a high of 3.7 hectares per capita in the case of Fiji to 1.7 hectares per capita for Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. China is another country with a relatively high ecological footprint. Countries like Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Thailand with high share of protected areas could be less vulnerable to natural disasters. People living on the degraded land would be the most vulnerable to climate change related impacts. Cambodia, Mongolia and Sri Lanka with high share of population living on the degraded land expected to suffer more during disasters.

The relationship between energy development and economic development, human development, environmental development, multi-dimensional poverty and gender empowerment are analyzed. The indices related to human development, multi-dimensional poverty and gender empowerment for the selected countries are obtained from the Human Development Report of the UNDP (UNDP 2010a). 6-1. A Composite Development Index As stated above, the composite development index for the 24 developing countries of the Asia-Pacific developed by integrating individual indices of energy, economic, human and environmental developments. Again, these individual indices are built using several related indicators. For example, the energy development index (ENDI) is composed of indicators related to extent of electricity and modern fuel access, energy intensity of GDP measuring efficiency of energy use, energy production-consumption ratio indicating the energy security level and per capita household electricity consumption as a proxy to measure the extent of modern energy use (Table 27). Countries with higher values for electricity and modern fuel access, production-consumption ratio and per capita household electricity consumption obtain higher index scores. A value of more than one for production-consumption ratio indicates that the country is self reliant in energy. On the other hand, smaller value for energy intensity of GDP gives higher index score. Table 28 contains the indicators used for constructing economic development index (EDI). These indicators are expected to measure the macro-economic development of a country. Real GDP growth rate indicates how fast the national economy is growing; GDP per capita represents the economic strength of a country and it determines a country\u2019s affordability levels; Balance of payments on current account represents a country\u2019s capability to pay for the imports; Budget balance represents a country\u2019s capacity to pay from internal sources to support many development programmes. Any budget surplus can act as a cushion at the time of crisis; and Import cover basically suggests that how long a country can manage its monthly 50 imports bills through accumulated foreign exchange reserves (UNDP 2007b). Higher values for all the indicators are considered to be good and give high index scores for a country.

Though the linear relationship is not significant, there appears an increasing trend in EDI with the increase in ENDI. For the countries with low energy development, any gain in ENDI scores is likely to result in similar increase in EDI scores. However, these gains do not appear to happen for countries with high ENDI scores. Overall the relationship appears to be weak. Beyond a certain level, energy development alone cannot influence economic development; other factors will have significant roles to play in achieving higher economic growth. With technological advances and structural changes occurring in the economy, countries at higher levels of economic development would experience decoupling of economic growth from energy demand growth.

In other words, countries with higher ENDI scores are likely to have higher HDI scores. Thus, the present analysis provides a reasonably strong indication that energy development is one of the prerequisites for achieving human development. Figure 8: Energy development versus human development Source: Author\u2019s estimate based on Table 30 Even though we cannot observe a linear relationship between ENDI and environmental development index (EVDI) there appears a relatively strong association between the two (Figure 9). However, the relationship appears to opposite. We could observe a decrease in EVDI scores with the increase in ENDI scores. It conveys that energy development is likely to result in environmental degradation. Basically, it suggests that energy development with current technology mix and fuel choices is likely to result in environmental degradation. Therefore, the need is to adopt low carbon technologies and pathway to achieve the goal of sustainable energy development. We may observe from Figure 10 that there is a significant negative linear relationship between ENDI and multidimensional poverty index (MPI). With higher values of MPI indicating higher incidence of poverty there is a decrease in poverty levels with higher energy development. In other words, we could observe from the figure that with the increase in ENDI there appears a linear decrease in MPI scores. Thus, it may be safe to conclude that energy development has a significant role to play in reduction of poverty. 56 Figure 9: Energy development versus environmental development Source: Author\u2019s estimate based on Table 30 Figure 10: Energy development versus poverty Source: Author\u2019s estimate based on Table 30 The energy development index has a negative relationship with gender inequality index (Figure 11). In other words, energy development may be one of the influencing factors for gender empowerment. We may observe from the figure that with the increase in ENDI scores 57 there is a decrease in gender inequality index (GII) scores. Though not significant, there appears a strong negative linear relationship between ENDI and GII. This is an expected relationship considering that energy development expands access to modern energy carriers, which can result in better living standards for the women with reduced drudgery, more free time for productive activities and clean indoor environment. Thus, it is clear from the above analysis that energy development with the main objective of expanding access to modern energy can bring in many other developmental benefits. However, it is crucial to adopt a low-carbon pathway to achieve this energy development goal to make the overall development sustainable in the long-run. Figure 11: Energy development versus gender empowerment Source: Author\u2019s estimate based on Table 30 7. Energy Access Policies and Programmes The status of modern energy access in the Asia-Pacific as in 2007 suggests that about 77% of the population had access to electricity and about 44% had access to modern fuels for cooking. Relatively high access level in electricity was the outcome many successful programmes implemented across Asia-Pacific. For example, in the early 90s China was electrifying villages at the rate of 30 per day and Viet Nam gave almost 400 people access to electricity per hour for 15 years (AGECC 2010). Though not as successful as in the case of electricity there were programmes targeting expansion of cooking fuel access. The biogas for cooking programmes implemented in China and India were reasonably successful. Many governments enacted enabling policies to strengthen these programmes. Broadly, the policies and programmes for expanding could be classified into the following four categories: \uf0a7 Large-scale government initiated focused programmes \uf0a7 Price controls to enhance affordability through energy subsidies and tax incentives \uf0a7 Promoting technology dissemination \u2013 Biogas for cooking, biomass power, advanced biomass cookstoves, small and micro-hydro for power generation 58 \uf0a7 Small-scale NGO and private sector initiated programmes with donor funding and government support. 7-1. Large-scale Government Initiatives China\u2019s national electrification rate in 2009 was 99.4% as with rural electrification of 99% and 100% in urban areas. Latest statistics suggest that in 2008, still 9-10 million people lacked electricity in China (IEA 2010e). This success is an outcome of government\u2019s focused rural electrification programme providing electricity to over 900 million people during the period 1950-2004. Key factors in China\u2019s success were the government\u2019s ability to mobilize contributions at the local level, creation of local enterprises and the domestic production of low-cost components (AGECC 2010). Electricity generation from small hydropower, with an installed capacity of 31.2 GW in 2003, played a particularly large role in electrifying remote rural regions (Jiahua et al. 2006). Viet Nam achieved extremely rapid electrification, expanding coverage from about 10% in 1986", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "253f855a-fa02-4dac-a9ef-e9c6abea0855": {"__data__": {"id_": "253f855a-fa02-4dac-a9ef-e9c6abea0855", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62227dfeff16e1149ac11b06b213eb0bcee88ed0e25f21c924572590ff333592"}, "3": {"node_id": "47d60404-d6c3-412b-80aa-f9a5d2816d56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32ae3423d8a4d8c470bab223e17352e5ee88a4731b54c85a549d443e46928082"}}, "hash": "8af021f948ddae331b12c3c85c457cc7c8034021754da3dc83a146092ac750ea", "text": "to 96.6% in 2009, that is, in just 23 years (Box 1). Of the electrified households, 96.34% are connected to the grid and 0.26% to the off-grid. Access to low-cost finance, funding from multiple sources and insistence on cost recovery, through tariffs or from government budget, were important in achieving this success rate. (AGECC 2010, Tuan 2010). Box 1: Expanding electricity access: A success story from Vietnam Viet Nam has achieved very high rates of electrification during the past 23 years. Access grew from about 10% in 1986 to 96.6% in 2009, an increase of nearly 87%. Of the electrified households, 96.34% are connected to the grid and 0.26% to the off-grid. The most intensive growth period was during 1995-2008, when an average of 3.4 million people provided with electricity access each year. This was achieved largely through extension of the grid by Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN). Existing infrastructure was severely underdeveloped, requiring a massive programme, which tripled the national installed capacity and involved the construction of a 500kV line stretching the length of the country. As a result, EVN had limited additional capacity to develop the distribution grid, and relied heavily on local distribution utilities (LDUs), community cooperatives and service agents to install, operate and maintain low voltage lines as well as managing invoicing and revenue collection. Recovery of operational costs from end-users was critical to success of the programme. Funding was from multiple sources including government subsidies, provincial government funds, international loans and grants, and cross-subsidies. International development association (IDA) helped the government to prepare a Master Plan for Rural Electrification. Despite the high overall success, there are a number of challenges resulting from the intense pace of implementation \u2013 including limited capacity to ensure quality standards and provide sufficient capability-building to local participants. In certain regions, poor-quality grid infrastructure was installed and subsequent maintenance has been lacking. Grid refurbishment projects are underway and many of the community cooperatives have been incorporated into LDUs in an effort to reduce losses and improve revenue collection. Source: AGECC 2010, Tuan 2010 India is the third country, which is in the midst of implementing a large scale electrification programme to achieve universal rural electricity access (Box 2). Towards this goal, the government of India, designed, planned and implemented an ambitious rural electrification programme titled Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) by involving all the relevant stakeholders within the government system. The programme is entirely funded 59 by the government except for the cost of final connection, which is to be borne by the households who are above the poverty line whereas it is free for the below poverty line (BPL) households. During the last three years, RGGVY programme has provided connections at the rate of about 3.7 million households per year for a total of 11 million households. 7-2. Price Controls: Energy Subsidies and Tax Incentives The market determined prices of energy carriers are mostly out of reach of the poor households. Governments, either through subsidies or through tax controls or using both options moderate the prices for the poor. Subsidies are typically targeted at the consumers whereas tax incentives are provided for the producers of the energy carriers. In addition, the high costs of electricity services for the poor are typically addressed by pricing them at a level that low-income users can afford to pay. These prices would be substantially lower than the cost incurred in producing and delivering the energy carrier. In many cases, governments rather than funding the subsidies targeted at the poor transfer burden to high-income consumers through cross-subsidies. In such instances, the high-income consumers are required to pay prices, which are substantially higher than the cost plus profit based prices. Governments often subsidize commonly used household fuels such as kerosene and LPG. Most commonly, either due to political compulsions or due to difficulties in administration, the subsidized prices are made universally applicable to consumers from all income levels. For example, the prices of public-sector distributed LPG are subsidized for all the consumers in India (Box 3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47d60404-d6c3-412b-80aa-f9a5d2816d56": {"__data__": {"id_": "47d60404-d6c3-412b-80aa-f9a5d2816d56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62227dfeff16e1149ac11b06b213eb0bcee88ed0e25f21c924572590ff333592"}, "2": {"node_id": "253f855a-fa02-4dac-a9ef-e9c6abea0855", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8af021f948ddae331b12c3c85c457cc7c8034021754da3dc83a146092ac750ea"}}, "hash": "32ae3423d8a4d8c470bab223e17352e5ee88a4731b54c85a549d443e46928082", "text": "Box 2: Universal rural electrification in India \u2013 A large-scale government programme Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) a scheme for developing rural electricity infrastructure and expanding household electrification was launched by the government of India on 4th April, 2005 with the objective of providing access to electricity to all households and improving the rural electricity infrastructure.

If India is to achieve the goal of 100% rural household access to electricity by 2015, as targeted, the yearly electrification rates will need to be more than doubled, and reach 10 million households per year. Source: Balachandra 2010, RGGVY 2010 60 Although well intentioned, the majority of energy subsidies have proved to be counterproductive, destroying markets and benefiting people who are already better off (UNESCAP 2005). However, there are no straight-forward methods to tackle this problem. A reduction or removal of pricing subsidies to overcome these problems can have potential adverse impacts on the poor. The partial withdrawal of kerosene price subsidies in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, for example, forced people in some rural areas to return to the use of fuel- wood. Both these countries suffer from deforestation and this could have serious environmental implications for them in the long run (UNESCAP 2005). 7-3. Promoting Technology Dissemination Many of the governments initiated large-scale programmes to support dissemination of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. Most of these programmes had provision of modern energy carriers to the people, especially in rural areas, as one of the objectives in addition to promoting technology dissemination. Biogas plants, advanced biomass cookstoves, micro-hydro power plants, biomass power generation systems, solar water heaters, solar PV and home lighting systems are some prioritized technologies chosen for dissemination. Biogas plants are one of the technologies, which had the maximum dissemination, especially in India and China (Box 4). India has an exclusive ministry, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), entirely focusing on renewable energy technologies. Box 3: Energy subsidies in India: Essentially not targeted at Poor Both LPG and kerosene are subsidized heavily in India. But they are not essentially targeted at the poor. These subsidies are universally applicable to all categories of consumers of these products. In the case of kerosene, in addition to subsidized pricing, it is distributed through a government controlled public distribution system. Further, kerosene supply has a quantity constraint as well, i.e., households are allotted consumption quotas that vary by the state and region (urban and rural) they live in, and whether they have an LPG connection or not. The latest data suggest that the Indian government contributed a total amount of Rs. 26.7 billion in 2008-09 towards subsidizing kerosene and LPG for households. Out of this, about Rs. 17 billion is provided for subsidizing LPG, which is predominantly used by middle and high income urban households. The subsidy component provided by the government does not compensate the losses incurred by the public sector oil companies due to selling of kerosene and LPG below market prices. As per the estimates available, the total under-recovery due to the sale of these fuels is to the tune of Rs. 458 billion in 2008-09. Nearly 62% of the under recovery is accounted by the under-priced sale of kerosene through public distribution system (PDS). The study carried out by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in 2005 revealed that nearly 39% of the PDS kerosene was being illegally diverted (NCAER, 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0966dfd6-bb24-4a44-a27c-8a722658c71d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0966dfd6-bb24-4a44-a27c-8a722658c71d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75c2e3fcf7f5df64b68920c3083e5c5eda33574c9e4e0ac38c24f63f14b3bc94"}, "2": {"node_id": "e02112dd-e55b-496a-95db-c59f8fe0cd8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4690dbba3a6a9177d3e9a86838e3b0dd3f95fdcd97ebc5d21b954813bc838a3c"}}, "hash": "5eace111cb4b52d9fa5d0f0d18efc06e7cafa209bd1e8a3d6dae1f919a37b976", "text": "It is generally believed that the diverted kerosene is used to adulterate diesel and petrol for transport on account of price differential between these fuels.

Very soon most of them went into disuse due to faulty design and construction methods. These were gradually rectified and by 1990s the functional plants remained at around 5.5 million. Over the past 10 years, China has increased the number of biogas installations from 6.8 million household biogas plants at the end of 1997 to 26.5 million in 2007. China\u2019s potential for biogas plants is estimated to be around 75 million. Recently, China has re-stated the objective of the biogas program as a renewable energy source and secondly, as a way to recycle agricultural materials. The government has brought in a large level of capital (RMB 1 billion) and at the same time has made biogas plant more people and location friendly, resulting in higher productivity from farms. Micro-credit and low interest loans are now available to farmers wanting to build these plants. Furthermore, having learned from earlier failures, there are now about 150,000 trained personnel to build and maintain biogas plants. In addition to creating a positive environment for these plants, it has also enacted laws that favor the construction and use of biogas plants in rural areas. By 2030, it is estimated that there would be about 50 million plants, covering nearly two thirds of biogas potential in China and will attempt to reach at least 20% of the rural population. In this way China has put in an appropriate blend of institutional and administrative infrastructure, easy finance access and some degree of user\u2019s stake in continued use of biogas plants and finally overall economic support through CDM methods. The enactment of an enabling law is expected to ensure large scale implementation. Source: Chanakya and Balachandra 2010, Bhattacharya and Salam 2002, Methane to Markets-China 2009, Quichun 2008 7-4. NGO and Private Sector Initiated Programmes with Donor Funding and Government Support Large number of projects focusing on providing access to modern energy carriers has been implemented across the region. Most of these projects are implemented by the local NGOs, government agencies and private sector entities with funding from international donor agencies. Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is one of the most important funding sources, which has supported such initiatives by providing incremental fund support. UN agencies like UNDP, UNEP have also supported energy access projects in many countries. Development finance institutions, multi-lateral and bilateral financial institutions, foreign governments, international foundations, multinational corporate organization and even global large energy companies have funded large number of developmental projects targeted at providing access to modern energy carriers to the poor. Funding has been largely restricted to renewable energy technology-based energy access programmes with twin objectives climate change mitigation and energy access. Small and micro-hydro, solar PV systems, solar home lighting systems, advanced biomass cookstoves, biogas systems, biomass-based power generation systems, biofuel production and wind energy are some of the popular technology-based projects implemented in the regions (Box 5, 6 and 7). 62 Box 5: Biogas programme - Nepal Nepal installed over 170,000 biogas plants, benefiting more than a million people, in a 13- year programme during the 1980s and 1990s.

This intensive programme was supported by the development of a local private sector biogas manufacturing and construction capacity, as well as training and certification facilities to ensure that quality standards were maintained. Between 35 and 50 per cent of the capital costs were subsidized through grants from international donors such as the German development finance institution Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW).

Barriers to Expanding Energy Access to the Poor \uf0b7 Lack of effective policies: Policies provide guidelines and plan of action for achieving the desired objectives. Considering that the large majority of the poor people in the Asia-Pacific region lack access to modern energy carriers it appears that most of the national governments have failed to enact targeted and effective energy access policies. \uf0b7 Lack of effective programmes: Expanding energy access to the poor needs to follow programmatic mode of implementation with multi-stakeholder participation. With poor being incapable of paying adequately for the services market mechanisms alone will not be sufficient to include them in the regular expansion programmes. Therefore, the need is to develop and implement effective energy access programmes exclusively targeted at the poor. \uf0b7 Lack of large scale finance: Obtaining large scale finance to support programmes targeted at the poor is extremely difficult. Low affordability levels, risk of default and low opportunity to make profits force the bankers to treat these projects as risky and unviable projects. Government and donor funding are crucial for the success of such projects. 63 \uf0b7 Lack of institutional framework: Institutions are essential to implement, manage, coordinate and monitor the policies and programmes created by the government. Most countries appear to lack such institutions created exclusively for expanding energy access to the poor. \uf0b7 Inefficient and ineffective governance: Government centric programmes have to endure the governance related ineffectiveness. Bureaucratic inefficiencies typically result in delayed approvals and release of funds, ineffective monitoring, favoritisms, low quality output, etc. Lack of tangible incentives to perform leads to low motivation among the people involved in implementation. Short tenures associated with specific ministries and organizations tend to compromise on the long-term sustainability of the process, especially, post-implementation. Political motivations typically overshadow the social and economic objectives of the programmes. Combination of these factors makes a programme or policy which appears to be very effective on paper to be a massive failure on implementation. \uf0b7 Misdirected focus and targets: Many government implemented programmes on expanding energy access were not successful because of lack of proper focus and inappropriate targets. For example, technology focused programmes like dissemination/deployment of solar PV, biogas plants, improved cookstoves, micro-hydro, etc., have dissemination as their primary objective and thus numbers deployed or capacity installed become the targets for measuring success. Similarly universally applicable subsidies on energy carriers in many countries are not targeted at the poor. Even the high and middle income households enjoy the benefits of subsidy putting unnecessary burden on the governments\u2019 finances. \uf0b7 Ineffective delivery mechanisms: The quality and reliability of energy access as well as its sustainability depends largely on the effectiveness and robustness of the mechanisms established in the villages or local locations. Any energy access expansion programme involve creation of local infrastructure and make provisions for energy production and distribution, repair and maintenance, new connections, billing and collection, monitoring and reporting, and few other activities. These linkages are critical and they need to be performed effectively for the sustenance of energy access programmes. However, it appears that such mechanisms are missing in most of the countries. \uf0b7 Lack of private benefits: Energy access programmes tend to be successful provided the individual households accrue perceived and real benefits. Poor rural households do not perceive it to be beneficial shifting from free biomass to priced cooking fuels like kerosene or LPG even if they are subsidized. With low opportunity cost of labor and starved of cash, the saved efforts in biomass collection do not translate into benefits. Health benefit of clean cooking fuels is not perceived as benefit because of lack of knowledge. There are no forces within the villages/towns which influence shift to clean cooking fuels. On the other hand market forces have a played a major role in pushing the fast moving consumer goods, typically classified as luxury items in the rural context, and influencing rural people to adopt them. Such forces are absent with respect to modern energy carriers. In the next section we have discussed a proposal for achieving universal energy access in the Asia-Pacific region. The implementation programme recommended for this is expected to overcome most of the barriers listed above. 64 Box 7: Samoa \u2013 Putting excess coconuts to use Samoa, similar to many other Pacific island nations, rates as \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d to oil price pressures", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30f43946-69b6-41d3-b805-eddceea17392": {"__data__": {"id_": "30f43946-69b6-41d3-b805-eddceea17392", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ffb5331695a54ee120f3708b8b86b95bcc673b1bb89c0fa645f1906a880b608"}}, "hash": "9ffb5331695a54ee120f3708b8b86b95bcc673b1bb89c0fa645f1906a880b608", "text": "for its dependence on imported oil for electricity generation. In 2008, as oil prices soared above US$100/barrel, electricity prices rose steeply, which had the highest impact on the poor and most vulnerable households and communities. Now, locally produced coconut oil, which can be fed into existing diesel electric generators, has emerged as part of the solution to energy security and oil price vulnerability in Samoa and other Pacific countries including Vanuatu, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In Samoa, this development has re-ignited interest from local businesses and farmers in the previously defunct industry, with disused coconut plantations being revitalised. Coconut farming creates much needed employment in locally owned and operated plantations, reducing the trend of rural-urban migration and injecting much needed income at the village level. Furthermore, there are no \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d concerns as plantations are pre-existing and the vast majority of nuts fall to the ground as organic waste each year. Local producers are supplying up to 5% of the national electricity utility\u2019s fuel requirements, with a growth target to displace up to a quarter of its needs by 2020. Yet even now, coconut oil has difficulty competing with lower diesel prices in 2009, meaning farmers\u2019 margins are incredibly small, limiting both potential coconut oil production and rural community benefits. Enhanced international efforts, could ensure that carbon-financing mechanisms are more easily available to improve viability of such small-scale projects; while other aid support could help to develop \u201cadded value\u201d coconut export products from wood, husks and shells. This support along with assistance towards developing other emission-free indigenous renewable energy sources is vital to deliver greater social, economic and environmental outcomes through the energy sector in vulnerable Pacific Islands.

Universal Energy Access in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 The Way Forward The earlier discussions established the fact that universalizing access to modern energy carriers for the large majority of the poor in the Asia-Pacific has multiple benefits. Keeping this in mind, we have discussed a proposal to achieve universal energy access in the Asia- Pacific. The proposal targets at 100% access to modern energy carriers for cooking, lighting and other basic electricity-based uses by 2030, i.e., in another 20 years starting from 2010. Providing universal energy access has large implications. To ascertain the implications of 100% access on energy requirements, investments, operating and capital costs, GHGs and black carbon emissions, and the incremental number of people provided with access, two scenarios are developed: a. Baseline Scenario (BS) for all the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region tracking the expansion of modern energy access in 2015 and 2030 with a base year status as on 2009. This scenario is similar to the New Policies Scenario of the World Energy Outlook 2010 (IEA 2010a). The assumptions underlying the New Policies Scenario are used here to arrive at the number of people without access to electricity and modern fuels in 2015 and 2030. The population projections for 2015 and 2030 are obtained from the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) projections (UNPD 2009) and the 2009 population is obtained from the Population Reference Bureau\u2019s World Population 65 datasheet for 2009 (PRB 2010). The modern fuel access in 2009 for each country is an extrapolation from the 2007 data (UN data 2010). The baseline access status in 2015 and 2030 for the world and sub-Saharan Africa are obtained from the World Energy Outlook 2010 (IEA 2010a). b. Universal Energy Access Scenario (UAS) for all the developing countries of the Asia- Pacific tracking the expansion towards universal access. The number of people without access to electricity and modern fuel in 2015 is estimated using the same assumption used in the World Energy Outlook 2010 for universal access (IEA 2010a). According to this scenario there will be no one in 2030 without access to modern energy carriers/technologies. Other inputs and assumptions are similar to that used for baseline scenario. The implications of these scenarios on the resources requirements are analysed based on following: \uf0b7 The energy needs are proposed to be met with a judicious mix of energy supply from both centralized energy systems (electricity grid and LPG) and decentralized energy systems (Mini-grid and Off-grid electricity systems, biogas from distributed biomass energy systems, advanced biomass cookstoves). \uf0b7 As proposed by Bazilian, et al (2010), an electricity supply mix of 50% from centralized grid, 40% from mini-grid and 10% from off-grid is used in the proposed scenario. \uf0b7 For universal cooking energy access, the proposed technology/fuel mixes are 40% share from LPG, 15% from biogas and 45% from advanced biomass cookstoves.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b698e8c1-2d5f-4e8b-a8d1-31fcfe017bf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b698e8c1-2d5f-4e8b-a8d1-31fcfe017bf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49a2aea70f65e0b40a0d08b203fbe8c7f4276c894602268973219ee0791a9284"}, "3": {"node_id": "1561dad6-aca7-4a27-9e95-b705bcc1eb8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d64fa6471beea02d38f2c6d764ce2f16a149fc758c91ff2aa5768bcd2c7a480c"}}, "hash": "95a348cd189c931055ee759b0f32c18069b1c8c2757371c23d346cf43be85613", "text": "These assumptions are a slight modification from that used in IEA (2010b). \uf0b7 An annual electricity consumption norm of 500 kWh per urban household and 250 kWh per rural household and an average annual LPG consumption 22 kg per capita are used to estimate the energy demand for universal energy access (IEA 2010b). \uf0b7 The costs of electricity generation from different technologies are estimated using the estimates from Bazilian, et al (2010). \uf0b7 The investment needed for adding the required installed capacity is estimated based on the assumption made in IEA (2010b). \uf0b7 The capital cost associated with LPG, Biogas and advanced biomass cookstoves are estimated again using the unit cost estimates obtained from IEA reports (IEA 2010b, IEA 2010d). It is proposed that the whole programme of universal energy access is to be implemented with the involvement of national governments, stakeholders from public and private organizations/enterprises, NGOs and international organizations. 8-1. Universal Energy Access Scenarios: Implications for Resources The projected status of access to electricity and modern fuels for cooking in 2015 and 2030 for the selected countries of the Asia-Pacific is given in Tables 31 and 35. The status is given for both the baseline and universal energy access scenarios. Even though the scenarios are developed for all the developing countries of the region, the results have been presented for only the selected countries. The incremental electricity requirement for providing universal electricity access is about 73,930 GWh in the Asia-Pacific and the associated generation requirement is nearly 87,000 GWh (Table 32). This estimate includes the electricity requirement of only those people who 66 have been given access under the universal energy access programme. India accounts for nearly 54% of this requirement. The total incremental annual cost of providing universal electricity access is about US$ 12 billion by 2030 with India accounting for about US$ 6.5 billion (Table 33). The total investment required over the period of 20 years is about US$ 40 billion with India accounting for more than 50% of it. The investment required for providing universal electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa is more than that of Asia-Pacific at about US$ 47 billion. The results indicate that India has a major role to play in providing universal electricity access in the region. The solace is that India has already moved ahead with implementing such a programme to provide electricity access to all (Box 2). The incremental CO2 emissions due to universal electricity access are negligible at about 25 million tonne per year by 2030 (Table 34). With respect to universal access to modern fuels for cooking, about 4 billion people in the world need to be provided with access in the next 20 years (Table 35). This is the incremental number of people who would not have got the access but for the universal access programme. Nearly 2.8 billion of them would be from the Asia-Pacific with India accounting for 1 billion and China for about 750 million of them. Annual LPG requirement for this incremental population with access by 2030 would be about 24 million tonne in the Asia-Pacific and nearly 36 million tonne globally (Table 36). This is not a significant increase in relation to the current world consumption of about 218 million tonne. Most of the incremental energy needed for cooking under universal energy access scenario would be met from the biomass resources through biogas plants and advanced cookstoves. Total investment (only capital cost of the systems) required over a period of 20 years in the Asia-Pacific is about US$ 72 billion with most of the investments happening in India and China in that order (Table 37). Thus the total incremental investment required for providing universal energy access in the Asia-Pacific is estimated to be nearly US$ 112 billion over a period of 20 years.", "start_char_idx": null,

Universal Energy Access \u2013 Implementation Mechanism Universal energy access needs a robust implementation mechanism to achieve the time- bound targets. We have made some specific recommendations for designing of regulatory policies, programmes, institutions, financing and local delivery mechanisms, which may function as useful inputs for developing country-specific universal energy access programmes. These recommendations are based on ADB (2010b) and Balachandra (2011b). Energy access Policy: Policies provide guidelines and plan of action for achieving the desired objectives. Clear political commitment for its promotion should be translated into supportive policies and regulations that work to create incentives and greater certainty for all participants. Energy access policies are targeted at the poor who are vulnerable and have serious issues with affordability. Thus, the proposed policy should encompass following: \uf0b7 Account for universal service obligation \uf0b7 Allow for lifeline energy consumption and affordable tariff design \uf0b7 Flexible and affordable connection, disconnection and reconnection policies \uf0b7 Enable the establishment of institutions for programme implementation and delivery of energy services. \uf0b7 Enable the creation of dedicated energy access funds to support the programme implementation. 74 \uf0b7 Provision for establishing distributed energy generation systems and flexible access to the grid for the local institutions \uf0b7 Provision for tax incentives for establishing off-grid and micro-grid power generation systems. \uf0b7 Support capacity development through education, training and awareness programmes. National and regional institutions for programme implementation: Establishment of dedicated national and regional institutions for implementing programmes related to universal energy access is critical for the success. The role of national level institution is to design implementable programmes, support its actual implementation along with regional/state level institutions and many other stakeholders, and monitor its progress. For doing this, the national level institution is expected to establish the partnership of stakeholders and use its services for performing different activities, supervise and monitor the activities of the regional institutions, design and implement the capacity development programmes, transfer funds to the regional energy access funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f5647b2-3b9a-4d3d-a274-afbd9f84b946": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f5647b2-3b9a-4d3d-a274-afbd9f84b946", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "025015b590c8659f05123266e1925d31ccb14144dd0978b77fa92ab735fd3456"}, "2": {"node_id": "57f2ec47-209e-4c2a-9382-9c49dd9cf91e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b83b2b6465d157d2830384ec21c31981df86b127b6a3518850fc86fc627f5c8"}}, "hash": "826e833b8f73aa41606e0a516fe5a6a4ffe7a5ad7f9cbb6ae0f4b0018243ab3d", "text": "The regional institutions are the ones who would be implementing the programmes, conducting capacity development programmes, interacting with the entrepreneurs and NGOs, and providing incentives.

Government/policy makers, energy organizations/utilities, technical institutions and R&D organizations, industries, entrepreneurs, financial institutions, donor agencies, NGOs and poor households need to join together to achieve the objective of universal rural energy access. The role of the individual stakeholders in the partnership would be based on their competencies and it could be related to financing, advising, expressing needs, information dissemination, technology provision, training and capacity building, management and monitoring, etc. Dedicated energy access funds: Obtaining the required financial support for programme implementation is crucial.

All the financial support dedicated to universal energy access need to be routed through these energy access funds. In addition, low cost bank finance from multilateral, bilateral and local financial institutions to support investment requirements needs to be tapped. Support from carbon markets: The global climate change mitigation imperatives have created many market mechanisms created through international protocols which allow the avoided GHG emissions to be traded in the carbon market. This is the new revenue stream for climate change mitigation projects. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one such mechanism, which is set up under the Kyoto Protocol. The low-carbon pathway adopted for expanding energy access would have large potential for certified emission reductions (CERs) through avoided GHG emissions and these could be traded in the international carbon markets under CDM or similar carbon trading mechanisms. CDM in its present form is not exactly suitable for the universal energy access programme envisaged in this study. In its current form it is too restrictive and preference is always for large scale and easy to implement GHG mitigation projects. Though on paper, sustainable development and conforming to national priorities are listed as critical factors for approval of a CDM project, 75 these are not strictly adhered to in practice. Projects catering to the needs of poor and with a dominant objective of maximizing social wellbeing hardly attract attention of CDM market. These limitations of the CDM programme have been recognized and few remedial measures are being taken to overcome these. One such measure is allowing bundling of small scale CDM projects. Other one is allowing for CDM credits from programmes of activities. Institutions for local delivery of energy services: The success of the programmes related to providing access to the poor depends mainly on the existence, effectiveness and efficiency of the local institutions responsible delivering the energy carriers or services. This institution could be a private small scale enterprise, an NGO, a government agency or a community organization. The local institution needs to be empowered with capacity to create and maintain the local energy infrastructure and make provisions for energy production and distribution, repair and maintenance, new connections, billing and collection, monitoring and reporting, and other related activities. Thus, the final delivery of energy services to rural households can be performed by the micro-enterprises specially established for this purpose and they can function with the objective of earning profits (private benefits). For example, the large scale rural electrification programme being implemented in India (Box 2) uses the services of local entrepreneurs as franchisees to manage the local delivery of electricity in villages. Capacity development: As proposed in the study, multiple stakeholders at different levels are involved in implementation of this universal energy access programme. There are stakeholders at the national, regional/state and local government levels, belonging to public sector organizations, financial institutions, Energy service companies (ESCOs), private sector, small-scale industries, NGOs and the households. The awareness and knowledge levels, educational qualifications, professional experiences and commitment levels are varied across the strata of individuals associated with these entities. Successful implementation of the programme to a large extent depends on empowerment of these individuals through effective capacity development programmes. The capacity development programmes could be in the form of information dissemination, awareness campaigns, sensitization programmes, training programmes and course programmes depending on the type of individuals. 9. Energy Outlook for the Industrial Sector According to the forecast provided in the Energy Outlook for Asia and the Pacific by the Asian Development Bank (ADB, 2009b), the industrial sector in the region is expected to continue to have a dominant share in the final energy demand even in the future. As per the estimates, the industrial sector accounted for about 35% of the total final energy demand in 2006, which is expected remain same in 2015 and marginally reduce to 33% in 2030. In 2030, out of a total final energy demand of 4,635 MTOE, the industrial sector is expected to account for 1,526 MTOE. The energy related CO2 emissions is forecast to grow from 10,749 million tonne to 17,763 million tonne and increase of 65%. With majority of the developing countries in the region striving hard to attain high economic growths and sustain them in the long run these increases are bound to happen. Such high economic growths are essential for these countries considering that still a large section of the population is poor. However, with the climate change threats looming large and need for urgent actions towards mitigating these threats, the developing countries of region cannot escape from the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afe1d86a-9c6a-4349-8d31-058006ced093": {"__data__": {"id_": "afe1d86a-9c6a-4349-8d31-058006ced093", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/17", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d60345cb15054d12d894eff0013b198e2b900213b22eafb5250fbfdf190790f2"}}, "hash": "d60345cb15054d12d894eff0013b198e2b900213b22eafb5250fbfdf190790f2", "text": "responsibilities. The global communities want their participation, mainly of the large developing countries like China, India and Indonesia. Thus, there are pressures internal as well as international to alter the path of development by adopting low-carbon pathways. The industrial sector too required to be part of such initiatives. According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy 76 Outlook 2010, the countries of the non-OECD Asia, consisting of all the developing countries of Asia excluding the Pacific region, required to make significant contributions to climate change mitigation (IEA, 2010a). As per the estimates, according to the reference energy scenario, which assumes the current policies to continue, the industrial sector energy demand is likely to be 1793 MTOE in 2030. However, the 450 ppm climate change stabilization scenario requires this demand to reduce to 1526 MTOE in 2030, a reduction of 267 MTOE. In fact, the reduction in the fossil fuel based energy carriers under 450 ppm scenario by 2030 is estimated at 288 MTOE and the difference of 21 MTOE is expected to be made up through increase in the contribution from biomass and waste energy. Coal with about 158 MTOE contributes mainly to the reduction of 288 MTOE by 2030. Other major contributors are electricity 95 MTOE and oil 20 MTOE. All these reductions are to be achieved mainly through implementation of energy efficiency measures across industries (IEA, 2010a). According to this report, energy efficiency is expected account for about 67% of the total energy related CO2 emissions abated in 2020 in relation to current policies or reference scenario but its share declines to 45% by 2035. These indicate the significance energy efficiency in achieving the goals set for 450 ppm scenario. The expectations are that the large reductions in energy consumptions and associated GHG emission reductions will result partly from a shift to low-carbon economic structure (IEA 2009). These are also linked to the expectation that as the industrial production increases sharply, these countries will take advantage of the much greater potential that exists to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon intensity. To achieve these savings, however, large-scale deployment of efficient and best available energy technologies will be necessary (IEA 2009). According to this report, within the industrial sector, the iron and steel sector is expected to contribute the most in curbing the energy consumption accounting for about 40% of the reductions in industry emissions in the 450 scenario compared to the reference scenario. Most of the critical measures in the industrial sector are expected to be initiated in the region are in China and India (IEA 2010a): \uf0b7 Rebalancing of the economy and efficiency improvements in iron, steel, cement and others in China with an abatement potential of 348 million tonne of CO2 emission by 2020. \uf0b7 Rebalancing of the economy, increasing use of CCS and efficiency improvements in China resulting in CO2 emissions abatement of 2,237 million tonne by 2035. \uf0b7 Efficiency improvements in iron, steel, cement and others due to international offset projects in India contributing to a CO2 emissions reduction of 76 million tonne in 2020. \uf0b7 Efficiency improvements in iron, steel, cement and others increasing use of CCS due to offset projects in India resulting in CO2 emissions abatement of 421 million tonne by 2035. Globally, the incremental investments required to achieve the objectives of 450 ppm scenario is estimated at US$ 18 trillion to be incurred over a period of 2010 to 2035.Out this, the industrial sector needs an investment of US$ 2 trillion during this period, which is relatively less compared its expected contribution to mitigation efforts (IEA 2010a). Some of the policy proposals for the industrial sector to achieve the 450 ppm scenario are \u2013 77 \uf0b7 Cap-and-trade systems in the power and industry sectors. \uf0b7 International sectoral agreements for the iron and steel, and the cement industries. \uf0b7 The complete phase-out of fossil-fuel consumption subsidies. 10. Summary and Conclusion Energy drives development, economic as well as human, with advanced technologies as means to achieve the ultimate goals. The deprivations in energy in terms of quantity as well as quality causes lack of development thereby poverty and human sufferings. Further, indiscriminate exploitation of the nature for energy resources and their use for economic growth has negative implications in the form of environmental degradation including climate change. Thus, energy inadequacy as well as abundance has consequences to the human development. By this, we understand that energy, poverty and climate change are closely interlinked and have implications for each other.

Thus, as stated earlier, the overall objective of this technical paper is to develop an evidence-based research paper analyzing issues, challenges and solutions related to energy- poverty nexus and their linkages with climate change from the human development perspective, focusing on the developing countries of Asia-Pacific. The technical paper begins with emphasizing the issue of securing energy needs of the poor and climate change mitigation emerging as conflicting challenges and significance of these challenges in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region in the global context. These challenges are extremely critical in the region because it has the highest energy deprivation among the poor at present and it is fast moving towards emerging as the biggest emitter of CO2 in the future. Energy deprivations measured in terms of lack of access to electricity and modern fuels/technologies for cooking and heating are found to be critical in the region. In the total world rural population deprived with modern energy access, about 63% without access to modern fuels and 55% lacking electricity access live in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific. The poor in the region mostly rely on solid fuels like wood, coal, cattle dung and agro-waste for most of their energy needs. Solid fuels accounts for about 63% of the total household energy consumption with significant contributions to both CO2e as well as black carbon emissions. Further, the energy consumption patterns in the industrial sector of the region are analysed. The role played by the industrial sector is crucial in terms of contributing to economic growth and eradication of poverty, and thus the extent of industrial energy development determines its success. Coal and electricity are the dominant industrial energy carriers together accounting for about 71% of the total consumption. The region accounts for about 41% of the global energy related CO2e emissions from the industrial sector. Further, the linkages between energy, poverty, sustainable development and climate change are analysed by developing different sets of indicators and the results suggested relatively strong association among these. A composite development index is developed integrating the indicators of economic, energy, environmental and human development and the selected developing countries of the region are compared against this index for empowerment and resilience. Malaysia emerged as the most empowered and resilient country followed by Bhutan in the second place. The lessons learnt is an important input for designing effective policies and towards this an assessment of policies targeting expansion of energy access and the associated good practices across the region is performed. Finally, the possibility of providing universal access to modern energy carriers for the households of the Asia-Pacific is explored by adopting a low-carbon pathway, the implications are analysed and an integrated implementation mechanism is proposed. 78 Overall, the technical paper covers issues related to energy for livelihood as well as productive needs by targeting the household and the industrial sectors of developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Expanding access to modern energy carriers to all in the region is the first step towards eradicating poverty and achieving human development. The analysis showed that it is possible to adopt a low-carbon pathway for universalizing access to modern energy carriers. The proposal entails a total incremental investment of US$ 113 billion over the next 20 years for providing electricity access to about 734 million people and access to modern fuels to about 2,779 million people. This is equal to a per capita investment of US$55 for providing access to electricity and US$ 26 for access to modern fuels. The GHG emissions due to universal energy access is minimal, a total incremental CO2 emission of 101 million tonne per year in 2030. This is equal to a per capita annual emission of 35 kgCO2 for electricity access and 27kgCO2 for modern fuel access. This is negligible comparing with the current (2007) average per capita CO2 emissions of 2.7 tonne in the Asia-Pacific region. Overall, it appears a win-win proposition for all the stakeholders. 79 Bibliography 1.

The International Atomic Energy Agency: is an independent intergovernmental, science and technology-based organization, in the United Nations family, that serves as the global focal point for nuclear cooperation; assists its Member States, in the context of social and economic goals, in planning for and using nuclear science and technology for various peaceful purposes, including the generation of electricity, and facilitates the transfer of such technology and knowledge in a sustainable manner to developing Member States; develops nuclear safety standards and, based on these standards, promotes the achievement and maintenance of high levels of safety in applications of nuclear energy, as well as the protection of human health and the environment against ionizing radiation; verifies through its inspection system that States comply with their commitments, under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and other non-proliferation agreements, to use nuclear material and facilities only for peaceful purposes. 4 Abstract Energy is essential for socioeconomic development. Enormous increases in global energy supply are required to lift 2.4 billion people out of energy poverty worldwide. Without a fundamental change in energy sources and technologies, however, global greenhouse gas emissions will increase further, whereas they would need to decline drastically in order to avoid perilous scales of climate change. Nuclear energy can considerably contribute to mitigating climate change and to resolving other energy challenges globally and in the Asia-Pacific region.

The impacts of the emerging global climate change will be equally diverse in the region, but largely damaging for most and possibly fatal for some countries (for example, sea-level rise inundating low-lying small island states). The region\u2019s shares in the world\u2019s population (56%), GDP (30%), primary energy use (35%) and CO2 emissions (40%) make it a key participant in the global response to climate change, both on the impacts/adaptation side, as well as in the efforts to combat climate change. This background paper explores the possible role of nuclear energy in climate change mitigation (Section 2) and in resolving supply security and environmental issues (Section 3). It concludes with a summary of the main points and recommendations for the way forward. Concerns surrounding nuclear power and possible ways to alleviate them are beyond the scope of this background paper and are discussed in other publications (see IAEA 2009a, 2011a). For information concerning the safety of nuclear power plants after the Fukushima accident, see IAEA (2011b; 2012a). 2. The role of nuclear energy in mitigating climate change Among the many challenges the world is facing in the early 21st century, climate change remains one of the major problems. According to the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the biophysical changes resulting from a global warming of more than 3\u00b0C will trigger increasingly negative impacts in all climate sensitive sectors in the AP region (IPCC 2007a). In mid-latitude and semi-arid low latitude regions, decreasing water availability and increasing drought will expose millions of people to increased water stress. In agriculture, cereal productivity is expected to decrease in low latitude regions (partly compensated for by increased productivity in mid-latitude and high latitude regions). Natural ecosystems will also be affected negatively: up to 30% of species will be at a growing risk of extinction in terrestrial areas, and increased coral bleaching in the oceans is forecast. In coastal areas, damage from floods and storms will increase. Human health will also be affected, especially in less developed countries of the AP region, by the increasing burden from malnutrition and from diarrhoeal, cardiorespiratory and infectious diseases. Increased morbidity and mortality are foreseen from heat waves, floods and droughts. Finally, but most importantly for many AP countries, sea-level rise threatens several small island states (IPCC 2007a). In order to avoid these severe impacts, global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) will need to peak within the next decade or so and then fall substantially below the 2000 emission levels by the middle of the century in order to keep the increase in global mean temperature below 2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels. A rapid reversal of the increasing GHG emissions trends and emissions reductions of 50\u201385% relative to the current levels are required by 2050 to avoid distressing climate change impacts in ecological and socioeconomic systems in the AP region and globally (IPCC 2007b). 7 The latest assessment by the IPCC (2007b) confirmed that, compared with other anthropogenic sources, GHG emissions from the energy supply sector grew at the fastest rate between 1970 and 2004. Currently, energy related CO2 emissions (including feedstocks) account for by far the largest share (about 60%) of total global GHG emissions (IPCC 2007b). In the absence of additional policy interventions (relative to those already in place), annual emissions from energy production and use are projected to reach 34\u201352 Gt CO2 by 2030 (IEA 2011). This is in sharp contradiction to the drastic reduction requirements mentioned above. In order to achieve the necessary deep cuts in GHG emissions, the power sector will need to be practically decarbonized by the middle of this century (IEA 2010a). Nuclear power belongs to the range of energy sources and technologies available today that could help resolve the conflict between increasing energy demand and climate protection. GHG emissions from nuclear power plants are negligible and nuclear power, together with hydropower and wind based electricity, is among the lowest CO2 emitters when emissions through the entire life cycle are considered. Based on the findings by dozens of studies, Figure 1 shows that life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear energy are estimated to be in the range of 2.8 and 24 g CO2- eq./kWh, similar to hydropower (between 1 and 34 g CO2 eq./kWh) and wind (8 to 30 g CO2 eq./kWh for onshore and 9 to 19 g CO2 eq./kWh for off-shore turbines).

The top scale shows from left to right the relative contributions of nuclear, hydro and other renewable (wind, solar, geothermal, etc.) technologies to the total amount of electricity generated in 2007. The bottom scale measures from right to left the average amount of CO2 emitted from generating 1 kWh of electricity in the same year. The chart clearly demonstrates that countries with really low CO2 intensity (less than about 200 g CO2/kWh) generate more than 60% of their electricity from hydropower and other renewable sources (Nepal and New Zealand). Many other countries achieve relatively modest CO2 intensity (below 500 g CO2/kWh) with a combination of low-carbon generation sources: hydropower, other renewables and nuclear. Japan and the Republic of Korea also belong to this group, thanks to the large share of nuclear power (about 23% and 33%, respectively) in their generation mix in the assessed period (IEA 2010b). A group of countries without significant shares of such power sources still generate electricity at medium CO2 intensity levels, thanks to the large contribution of gas which has the lowest carbon intensity among the fossil sources. At the high end of the CO2 intensity range, countries with high intensity (700 g CO2/kWh and more) have none (Australia) or only limited (China and India) shares of renewable and nuclear sources in their power generation mix (IEA 2010b). 9 Figure 2. CO2 intensity and the shares of non-fossil sources in the electricity sector of selected AP countries. Source: IAEA calculations based on IEA (2010b) In the global electricity sector, the IPCC (2007c) estimates that nuclear power has the largest potential (1.88 Gt CO2-eq.) to mitigate GHG emissions at the lowest cost: 50% of the mitigation potential at negative costs due to co-benefits from reduced air pollution, the other 50% at less than US $20/t CO2-eq. According to the assessments of the International Energy Agency (IEA 2010a), nuclear energy could account for about 19% of the CO2 reductions in power generation in 2050 in a scenario that would halve total GHG emissions by that time. In contrast, under IEA\u2019s \u2018Low Nuclear\u2019 scenario in which the total amount of nuclear power capacity falls from 393GW at the end of 2010 to 335GW in 2035, resulting in the share of nuclear power in global electricity generation dropping from 13% in 2010 to just 7% in 2035, GHG emissions would be 0.9 Gt CO2-eq. higher relative to the reference scenario (IEA 2011). Considering the large and fast increasing share of the AP region in global CO2 emissions, negotiators charting the way for climate protection under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) discuss the need for more significant contribution of developing countries that currently do not have any legally binding reduction targets. From the AP region, this particularly concerns large 10 and populous countries responsible for large shares of emissions in the global GHG accounts. For them, nuclear power is certainly an option worth considering in the decision making process. Several IAEA Member States (MSs) in the AP region already utilize nuclear energy and have a strong domestic technology base they can rely on for further expanding their generating capacity: China, India, Japan, Pakistan and the Republic of Korea (IAEA 2011c). A number of other countries are seriously considering adding nuclear to their energy mix or are already at various stages of active preparations for building nuclear power plants: Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam (IAEA 2012b). The IAEA provides support to interested MSs to explore the complex issues involved in finding a robust national energy strategy by considering projected energy demand, supply options and costs, and energy security concerns (IAEA 2009b). The Agency also assists MSs in reviewing the commitments and requirements for establishing and implementing a nuclear energy programme (IAEA 2007). 3. The contribution of nuclear energy to solving other energy-related problems Providing affordable energy for development in general and resolving energy poverty in particular is a fundamental challenge in many countries of the AP region. Energy is generally recognized as a central issue in sustainable development (Toth 2012). Several high level conferences and declarations have emphasized that the provision of adequate energy services at affordable costs, in a secure and environmentally benign manner, and in conformity with social and economic development needs is an essential element of sustainable development.

They also promote gender equity by allowing women to use their time for more productive activities than collecting firewood, and social equity by giving the less well-off the chance to study, thus providing a possible escape from poverty. Energy is therefore vital to alleviating poverty, improving human welfare and raising living standards. Yet, worldwide, 2.4 billion people rely on traditional biomass as their primary source of energy, and about 1.6 billion people do not have access to electricity (UNDP 2005) \u2014 conditions which severely hamper socioeconomic development. In the AP region, the share of population using solid fuels (typically heavily polluting traditional biomass) to cover their energy needs exceeds 50% in many countries, including populous ones, like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Pakistan (UNDP 2005). The number of people without access to electricity in the AP region was about 800 million in 2009 (UNDP and WHO 2009). The relatively high investment costs for nuclear power, especially relative to gas, may be an impediment because capital in many developing countries is scarce. However, as Figure 3 shows, estimated overnight investment costs spread across a broad spectrum for all electricity generation technologies globally. Overnight investment costs for nuclear capacities are at the low end of the range in several AP countries (e.g., India and China). 11 Figure 3. Ranges for overnight cost estimates for the main electricity generation technologies, 2008\u20132010 (in 2008 US dollars). Source: IAEA (2010) At the scale of the power sector, the displacement of fossil based power plants by NPPs can also reduce the emissions of other air pollutants that lead to harmful human health and environmental impacts at local and regional scales. NPPs emit virtually no air pollutants during their operation (Hirschberg 2012). In contrast, fossil based power plants are major contributors to air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that air pollution causes approximately two million premature deaths worldwide each year (WHO 2008). Air pollution also contributes to health disorders from respiratory infections, heart disease and lung cancer. In many cities in the AP region, the level of particulate matter in the air exceeds 70 micrograms per cubic metre (\u03bcg/m3), and by reducing it to 20 \u03bcg/m3 (the air pollution concentration level recommended by WHO), air quality related deaths could be cut significantly (WHO 2008). At the regional scale, air pollutants travelling long distances cause acid rain, harming nature and society at large. Acidification disturbs ecosystems (freshwater fisheries and forests) and causes damages to crops, certain building materials, and to historic and cultural monuments. Acid rain is caused by sulphur and nitrogen compounds, and fossil fuel power plants, particularly coal power plants, are the primary emitters of the precursors of those compounds. Technology solutions exist to reduce these emissions, but the cost of their installation and operation might make nuclear power more attractive (Hirschberg 2012). Many countries in the AP region have repeatedly expressed strong concerns about the security of their energy supply that has various aspects. The first factor is the price of fossil energy sources. The rate of infrastructure development in fossil resource extraction and delivery in key supply regions is lagging behind the fast growing energy needs, and this is exerting a sustained upward pressure on international oil and gas prices, even taking into account the speculative bubble that affected commodity 12 prices and culminated in mid-2008. This in itself is a strong motivation for countries with high shares of imported fuels in their electricity generation to look for substitutes. The second factor is that political conflicts in key supply regions exacerbate the price pressure and raise serious concerns regarding the security of supply per se, even at high prices. This is yet another reason for considering alternative electricity sources, like nuclear. Supply security concerns affect countries in the AP region differently. Energy importing developing countries tend to be more anxious about the sustained high price level because of the prospect of its severely increasing their energy import bills, affecting their current account balances and undermining the competitiveness of their export industries. In most developed AP countries (except those with very small energy resource endowments, like Japan and the Republic of Korea), energy is a relatively small fraction of the total import bills and the energy content of their exports is lower. These countries are more concerned about direct losses due to supply disruptions, especially if these might render expensive capital and labour capacities idle for some time. Another closely related factor is price volatility. All elements of the energy supply infrastructure are long lived. Energy intensive industries base their investment decisions on cautious expectations about future energy and electricity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29ac5aa7-032a-49fc-9bd9-0c56c4261f6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "29ac5aa7-032a-49fc-9bd9-0c56c4261f6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/18", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2012/18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/18", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc71dcb1d7d15810649ccd4dfe4eb5812d7a2b2e0b103d24152814e85dcbe2a3"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f160306-3cc2-4ecd-923e-4cf78822c30e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2012/18", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f89dc8558248a2774e58310a0974338f0fbef3958304e04448d33451462c171e"}}, "hash": "92cb16536fffa7461647d6140f35e2e03bb5a029aab714250f8762eaacf080cb", "text": "prices. A reasonable degree of stability and predictability of resource prices is crucial for such decisions because hedging against large price fluctuations might be vastly expensive. Nuclear power can help mitigate these concerns. The price of uranium has a small influence on the cost of nuclear based electricity, as opposed to fuel prices in the case of coal and especially gas based generation. Figure 4 shows that doubling the price of uranium would increase the cost of nuclear electricity by about 4 to 6%, whereas doubling the price of coal would lead to an increase of about 40% and a doubled gas price to an increase of almost 70% in the corresponding electricity costs. 13 Figure 4. Impact of doubling resource prices on the cost of electricity from selected sources. Source: IAEA calculations. The best way to strengthen a country\u2019s energy supply security is diversification: increasing the number and resilience of energy supply options. For many countries in the AP region, introducing or expanding nuclear power would increase the diversity of energy and electricity supplies. Nuclear power has one additional feature that generally further increases resilience. Figure 5 shows that resources and reserves of the basic fuel, uranium, are spread throughout politically stable regions over five continents that would impede any cartelization attempts. Regarding possible short- term supply disruptions, the small volume of nuclear fuel required for one load to run a reactor for one year or so makes it easier to establish strategic inventories on or close to the reactor site. In practice, the trend over the years has been away from strategic stocks towards supply security based on diverse and well-functioning markets for uranium and fuel supply services (NEA and IAEA 2010). However, the option of relatively low cost strategic inventories remains available for countries that find it important. Figure 5. Distribution of reported uranium resources and production. Source: NEA and IAEA (2010) (a) Distribution of reported uranium resources in 2009. 15 4. Conclusion The economics of nuclear power is improving and will be further enhanced by the increasing CO2 costs of fossil based electricity generation. Recent assessments compiled by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and International Energy Agency (IEA) (NEA and IEA 2010) indicate that the ranges of levelized costs of electricity from natural gas, coal and nuclear sources largely overlap between 5 and 10 US cents/kWh, hence the choice among them depends on local circumstances, such as the lack or availability of cheap domestic fossil resources. The costs of CO2 emissions reduction by CO2 capture and geological disposal and the charges for the emitted CO2 from fossil based electricity give a competitive advantage to nuclear power. Despite increasing construction costs, financing nuclear power investments will be feasible under stable government policies, proper regulatory regimes and adequate risk allocation schemes. Once the business case for increasing nuclear investments is established, manufacturing and construction capacities will expand as required. Climate change mitigation is one of the salient reasons for increasingly considering nuclear power in national energy portfolios. Other reasons include fears of sustained high fossil fuel prices, price volatility and supply security. Nuclear power is also considered in climate change adaptation measures, such as seawater desalination or hedging against hydropower fluctuations. Where, when, by how much and under what arrangements nuclear power will contribute to solving these problems will depend on local conditions and national priorities, and on international arrangements, such as the flexibility mechanisms under the post-2012 protocol to the UNFCCC currently being negotiated under the Durban Platform (UNFCCC 2011). Yet the decision about introducing or expanding nuclear energy in the national energy portfolio rests with sovereign States. 16 References Hirschberg, S. 2012.

The Asia Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness sought to: \u2022 support partner countries in preparing for the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-3); \u2022 ensure that Asian voices genuinely contrib- ute to the design and outcome of the Accra High Level Forum; and \u2022 provide an opportunity for partner countries to think long term, and to identify further steps towards aid effectiveness beyond Accra, towards HLF-4 in 2011. 2. To achieve these objectives the Consultations brought together diverse participants from twenty-fi ve countries covering the three sub- regions of East & South-East Asia, South Asia and Central & West Asia.1 The Government of Ghana participated at Ministerial level in the fi rst consul- tation and through a video message in the second and third consultations. A. HLF Preparations 3. Awareness of the High Level Forum at country level was low in many cases, and the consultations played a major role in increasing awareness of the opportunities presented by the Accra HLF. Several countries, including Armenia and Samoa, decided after the consultation to begin the process of adhering to the Paris Declaration.2 1 These included senior offi cials from central policy ministries (Finance, Planning and Foreign Affairs) as well as line ministries delivering results at sector level (Education, Health, Agriculture and Forestry), ensuring breadth and depth of government participation. Representatives from civil society organisa- tions from eight countries took part, and donor focal points \u2013 acting as representatives for the in-country donor commu- nity. Co-chairs, or their representatives, of most of the HLF-3 Round Tables were present, along with other international partners with knowledge and infl uence on aid effectiveness. 2 Armenia and Samoa have since written formally to the OECD DAC in this regard. 4. In some cases country participants found it diffi cult to relate to the global commitments and framework of the HLF. This gap was bridged by starting with country experience of obstacles and related actions and building up to global level commitments that their ministers might endorse. 5. There was evidence of high level political interest with participation from ministers, dep- uty ministers and secretaries, though this was not uniform across countries. Senior offi cials saw the regional consultations as paving the way for in-country consultations at minister level (eg in Indonesia and Viet Nam), which would allow coun- tries to provide offi cial comments on the draft AAA. Delegates emphasised the importance of convey- ing the workshop outcomes to their colleagues in government, civil society and in the donor com- munity at country level. 6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a43e6b6-101e-4814-a302-4fc7007808cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a43e6b6-101e-4814-a302-4fc7007808cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-region-outcomes-executive-summary-consultation-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Region Outcomes Executive Summary: Consultation on the High level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-region-outcomes-executive-summary-consultation-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58d52b61e8c708f2b71fe61fe7711d432b5435c09b9f31f0ce679d4fcf65a6af"}, "2": {"node_id": "19ad7d8d-92bb-4bc7-b004-328338a1bcdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-region-outcomes-executive-summary-consultation-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03d66cba875c3e094e8bb8e5c48f5d16811af232da32f3552fec7904b26c040e"}}, "hash": "5bae688ac1aff5b9413612798e5ca84ad0e8665bb5b39c4794654fd5d5833a78", "text": "6.

Executive Summary 4 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, April\u2013May 2008 9. Participants from Asia valued the exchange with Ghana and the Africa region in building up a com- mon agenda on aid effectiveness actions. 10. The Partner Country Contact Group led by Dr K Y Amaoko of Ghana was recognised as a key vehicle for partner country infl uence, and the consultations resulted in a meeting of the Asia- Pacifi c Contact Group in Bangkok on 26 May. Regional benefi ts from consultations 11. Country participants highlighted peer net- working as an important benefit from the consultations, and a key outcome included part- ner countries getting together in small groups to work jointly on specifi c issues. Examples include Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and Cambodia (initiated dis- cussion for developing a joint position paper on Mutual Accountability) and Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (proposed a joint best practice paper on Management for Development Results for the HLF-3 Marketplace). Participants agreed that these were genuinely country-led initiatives which would represent a unique contribution to the HLF-3 given the emphasis on donor-led stud- ies to-date. B. Accra Agenda for Action 12. Participants argued that the current AAA text was unclear, and that the fi nal AAA should use clear and simple language which is not donor-centric and that partner countries can easily understand. The current AAA is so short and concise it leaves much unsaid \u201cbehind the words\u201d. This makes it dif- fi cult to use as a basis for consultation as different participants have different understandings of what is meant. This challenge was increased by the lack of translation of any HLF-related documents (into Russian for example) prior to the regional consulta- tions.3 Further explanations of the materials will be important to increase common understandings. 13. Delegates wanted the AAA to be a politically appealing and ambitious document, rather than a 3 The draft AAA and Menu of Options were translated in Bangkok for the Central & West Asia Consultation and are avail- able at www.AidEffectiveness.org. document for technocrats. Some requested that the AAA focus more explicitly on the six partner country priorities identifi ed during previous consultations (untying, conditionality, predict- ability, division of labour, incentives, and capacity development). At the fi rst consultation (East and South-East Asia), participants discussed the draft AAA document while the South Asia and Central & West Asia participants also considered the Menu of Options, which was welcomed as a useful way focusing discussion on specifi c issues. Participants also felt that the balance between recipient and donor government commitments was not yet right (too many recipient commitments). 14. Participants provided rich and detailed feed- back on the AAA and Menu of Options and this is summarised in Annex 1 of the three sub-regional Outcomes Documents (available at www.accrahlf. net). Key extracts are given below. Ownership 15. Ownership requires country leadership, good governance, transparency and accountability, both on the part of donors and partner countries. India\u2019s strong ownership of externally-aided projects was based on (a) building strong systems and institu- tions, (b) rational and transparent processes, and (c) developing strong capacity. 16. The AAA should explicitly commit donors to reduce the number of conditions and not just to reduce overlapping conditions. Some participants advocated for the elimination of policy condition- ality by 2010, while others called for conditionality to be based on mutually agreed actions, stemming from a country\u2019s own strategies and programmes, and which are transparently set, monitored and reported on. 17. Tied aid was seen as undermining ownership , and participants called for its reduction. The need to improve country procurement systems and the capacity of local markets was also recognised. 18. All agreed that aid and the use of aid should be country driven. Some participants argued that if non-DAC donors adhere to the Paris Declaration as recipient countries, they should adhere to the same principles in their donor capacity, while a 5 Executive Summary counter-view was that a single framework was not appropriate for such a diverse group as the non- DAC donors. 19.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65646eba-6892-4b35-959d-4831786b7173": {"__data__": {"id_": "65646eba-6892-4b35-959d-4831786b7173", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-region-outcomes-executive-summary-consultation-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia Region Outcomes Executive Summary: Consultation on the High level Forum on Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-region-outcomes-executive-summary-consultation-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdae77432b759f95742b24db2ed9dd0fc57f84089d0d939d607f70f34b413058"}, "2": {"node_id": "70ae03c6-bd0d-48de-932f-5cd382c1198c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-region-outcomes-executive-summary-consultation-high-level-forum-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b24454e2155b23cec02db5d79628c9d7403a1e853209d9662d9c94d1708d4928"}}, "hash": "94002ce7f752fafb5c1590d488828727a988e77b32e570934a201dabdbec7dd0", "text": "19.

Capacity development was emphasized by par- ticipants time and time again and highlighted as a key constraint to delivering results. International technical cooperation and donor support for capacity development should be demand-driven and provided across all levels of Government, based on coherent capacity development plans prepared by partner countries. 21. Some participants underscored the importance of involving parliamentarians in deepening coun- try ownership, and others also highlighted the value that civil society organisations could play in this regard. Alignment 22. Donors are reluctant to use country systems even when they have been strengthened to inter- national standards. Increased use of country systems by donors is the best route to improving systems. Donors should be obliged to give reasons for not using country systems, indicate the specifi c improvements required and, it was hoped, contrib- ute to capacity development measures. 23. Insuffi cient predictability was fl agged as a serious concern. Countries called for donors to provide indicative three-year commitments for a growing share of their aid \u2013 without which it is diffi - cult for countries to deliver on their Paris Declaration commitment of effective national planning and budgeting. Countries also requested that the gap between pledges or commitments and actual dis- bursement be closed as soon as possible. 24. To improve the alignment of ODA with national priorities, participants recommended that part- ner countries and donors commit to develop and make use of national ODA Aid Management Systems to record and manage all funds. Cambodia, Indonesia (Aceh), Maldives, Sri Lanka and Vietnam (among others) offer examples of country-owned systems to track and manage ODA. Many countries expressed concern that some donors have diffi culty in periodically reporting their totality of aid (across their ministries and departments) in a format consistent with country systems, and called for some donors to invest in strengthening their internal systems. 25. There has to be real commitment from donors to harmonise, align and adapt to partner coun- try requirements at the sector level, otherwise the partner country capacity and ownership can be undermined. Programme-based Approaches at the sector level were seen as an important mech- anism to improve harmonisation and alignment, and if combined with support for related fi nan- cial and administrative reforms, can also reinforce mutual trust. 26. Division of labour can help tackle fragmenta- tion and misallocation of resources, but must be done under country leadership. Harmonisation 27. Donors should not be focused on \u2018attribution\u2019 or visibility and learn to take joint credit for pooled efforts. This would enable better division of labour. Harmonization should not undermine the diversity of aid available for partner countries. 28. Joint assistance strategies amongst donors can help with big donor players, but including too many donors can actually increase transaction costs. Joint strategies must be based on aligning behind national plans and priorities (eg Harmonisation Action Plan in Bangladesh and the Partnership Forum in Maldives). Managing for Development Results 29. Political leadership, good governance, and capacity for managing results are essential, 6 Consultations on the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness | Bangkok, April\u2013May 2008 particularly for effective delivery of services to people. The AAA must address poverty, gender and the delivery of services \u2013 as the goal of improving the lives must not be lost sight of. The aid effec- tiveness agenda has become too technocratic and donors (and partner governments) should remain focused on its purpose \u2013 promoting better actual development outcomes. 30. There was consensus on the need for \u2018managing for results\u2019 not only for foreign assistance but for all development activities. There was, however, a need to have a small number of clear and simple indica- tors that are defi ned at the project design stage. The region is home to many MfDR good practices (eg Cambodia, Philippines, and Viet Nam). 31. Capacity is a core issues that is crucial to the achievement of results and the MfDR agenda. In this context peer-to-peer learning and south- south cooperation and joint evaluations were emphasized. Participants were invited to join the Community of Practice in Managing for Results which has capacity development as its thrust (http://cop-mfdr.adb.org).

This will help clarify mechanisms for monitoring the reciprocal performance of gov- ernments and donors against aid effectiveness commitments. Good examples of such mechanisms were provided by South-East Asian participants (eg the independent monitoring mechanism in Vietnam, Philippines joint portfolio reviews, and Country Action Plans in Cambodia and Lao PDR). 33. CSOs were seen as having important perspec- tives to share in promoting mutual accountability, and their involvement was also seen as bringing responsibilities, including improving mechanisms by which CSOs demonstrate their accountability. C. Round Tables 34. The recommendations and country experi- ences from the discussions of each of the nine Round Table topics are summarised in Annex 2 of the three Outcomes Documents. Themes that recurred across the various Round Tables included: (i) there is a lack of trust between donors and part- ner countries; (ii) donors do not easily share data on aid fl ows with the partner countries, making it diffi cult for partner countries to plan and budget; (iii) emerging or non-traditional donors should commit to Paris Declaration principles; (iv) coun- try-led joint work and initiatives are important; (v) defi nitions and terms used in the Paris Declaration and AAA need clarifying; and (v) insuffi cient capac- ity is a key constraint. In 35. fragile states and confl ict situations, it is important that the donors establish the correct authorities to deal with. Donors should respond quickly and, in the short term, focus on a few criti- cal issues necessary for stability and state building. A \u201cnational programme approach\u201d (eg Afghanistan) can provide an effective framework since they pro- grammes be delivered with government support, in the government\u2019s name, reinforcing credibility and legitimacy, while drawing heavily on donor, UN and CSO resources and expertise. Donors should have, from the outset, plans for meeting medium- and long-term needs. The Central & West Asia consultation emphasized the role donors can play in confl ict prevention and in targeting com- munities that are beyond the reach of government systems. 36. Countries recognised the important contribu- tion being made by non-DAC donors, and that their performance in terms of speed, fl exibility and fewer conditions presents a real challenge to traditional DAC donors. Some participants noted that agreements sometimes bypassed regular technical appraisal processes, the degree of con- cessionality of loans was not always clear, and that assistance was tied. Engaging non-DAC donors in the Accra consultation processes and recognising a diversity of approaches to aid effectiveness were 7 Executive Summary emphasised. Countries agreed that south-south cooperation was very valuable, and that tri-lateral arrangements were useful when additional techni- cal inputs from DAC donors were sought. D. Evaluation of HLF Consultations: feedback from country participants 37. Feedback from the country participants enabled the organisers to learn lessons and adjust each workshop to better meet country needs. The evaluation ratings indicated high and increasing satisfaction with the HLF sub-regional consultations (see Figure). Country participants highlighted that knowledge gained would help \u201csupport our goal to prepare for Accra\u201d and brief \u201cdelegations going to Accra\u201d (South Asia).

It serves as a bridge between country efforts and evidence in implementing the Busan commitments in the Asia- Pacific region and the First High-Level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) in Mexico on 15-16 April 2014. Bangladesh, as a member of the GPEDC Steering Committee and Chair of the AP-DEF Steering Committee, has had the privilege of hosting the first regional consultation in Dhaka: Asia Regional Workshop on Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation: Links to the Post-2015 Development Agenda, 25-27 August 2013. In Dhaka, the AP-DEF, a regional platform for south-south learning was launched and the Steering Committee with country, CSO, and development partner representation was also announced. The meeting brought together twenty eight Government Development and Economic Cooperation policymakers and practitioners of twelve countries from Asia and the Pacific, Civil Society and business participants, who agreed to a set of recommendations for \u2018Building Evidence for the First Ministerial\u2019. They urged countries of the region to implement the recommendations by adopting ten specific actions including this draft report and proposed the AP-DEF support stock-taking measures to track implementation. The report presents evidence-based analysis drawing on countries\u2019 data and experiences compiled from existing country and regional studies and analytical work. It provides a snapshot of the changing development and financing landscape in the region. It recognises and captures the diversity of roles of different development actors \u2013 from government, international institutions, civil society and the business community. It includes a synthesis of the findings from the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) global survey for fifteen countries from Asia-Pacific; key findings, conclusions and recommendations from Development Finance and Aid Assessments in Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam, as well as Policy, Expenditure and Institutional Reviews in Indonesia and Thailand; and the outcomes of regional consultations held in advance of the first High-Level Meeting (HLM) of the GPEDC. The Asia-Pacific country and regional perspectives and practical measures highlighted in this report are expected to ensure an evidence-based global discussion on \u2018how\u2019 countries can achieve the \u2018what\u2019 which will be expressed in the post-2015 sustainable development agenda \u2013 ending poverty and leaving no one behind. As discussions on the GPEDC and about how to implement the post-2015 agenda develop, the AP-DEF Steering Committee members and I hope many will read this report and reflect on the evidence and

about how to achieve the post-2015 vision, through the GPEDC, the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing (ICESDF) and wider post-2015 financing and implementation debates. The report builds on extensive consultations with a wide range of development actors in the Asia-Pacific region. It pulls together data from the region and draws evidence from a range of country and regional perspectives about development successes and challenges faced, and the mechanisms and partnerships that have been developed within the region to realise effective development. The structure of the report builds on the agenda of the first HLM of the GPEDC, held in Mexico in April 2014, and follows the themes of the five plenaries: progress since Busan; partnering for taxation and domestic resource mobilisation for development; south-south, triangular cooperation and knowledge sharing; development cooperation with middle income countries; and business as a partner in development. The intent of the report is to enrich the debate with evidence. The vision emerging from discussions on the post- 2015 agenda \u2013 of a world with zero poverty and of progress across the three dimensions of development; social, environmental and economic \u2013 is ambitious. Realising it will require partnerships that mobilise the contributions of all actors: public and private, national and international. The results of the GPEDC global survey in 2013 offer some insights into what will be required from the international community to support development cooperation, globally and in the region. As discussions develop it is vital that the perspectives and experiences from Asia-Pacific, as the world\u2019s most populous and diverse region, are taken into account. Countries from across the Asia-Pacific region have diverse experiences to bring to the table. Major successes in the MDGs such as rapid poverty reduction, have been achieved alongside much slower progress in areas such as gender equality. The experiences of how these changes have occurred and how further progress can be achieved that are captured in this report can add weight and depth to discussions at the national and international level as the post-2015 and GPEDC debates continue. Progress since Busan Countries across the Asia-Pacific region have demonstrated their commitment to the development effectiveness principles agreed in Busan. The first GPEDC Monitoring Survey shows that, from fifteen Asia-Pacific countries who participated: 10 have already met mutual accountability targets; 6 have already met or are on track to achieve annual aid predictability targets (and 9 are above average on medium-term aid predictability); and 4 have achieved or are on track on the use of country systems. Progress in other areas has been slower, especially in gender equality, where only 2 countries have met targets to track allocations towards gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment and most others can report no progress. The enabling environment for civil society is deteriorating in some parts of the region \u2013 in the last two years at least 7 Asian countries have taken legal or administrative action to restrict funding to CSOs. Monitoring is essential for identifying challenges to progress and realising the vision of an evidence-based approach to implementation, and there is an urgent need to finalise the monitoring framework for partnerships beyond the public- sector, with civil society and private business. Governments can further prioritise investments in gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, and in the systems that monitor and assess these investments. A changing Asia-Pacific development finance landscape: development Cooperation accounts for a declining proportion of development finance, but remains important in the region Development Cooperation accounts for a declining share of total resources available to countries in the region, falling from 14% of international resource flows to the region in 1990 to 3.4% in 2012. Nevertheless, for many countries \u2013 from Least Developed Countries to Small Island Developing States to many Middle Income Countries (LDCs to SIDS to MICs) \u2013 it remains an important resource. Domestic resources are growing rapidly in much of the region but there are considerable differences across sub- regions and countries. In 15 countries government spending is less than PPP$ 1,000 per person each year, compared to over PPP$ 15,000 in DAC countries. Private fixed capital formation in the region grew from 12% of GDP in 2000 to 23% in 2012, largely driven by China.

FDI and remittances have driven this growth and FDI is the largest resource flow to three sub-regions: East and North-East Asia, South East Asia, and North & Central Asia. Remittances were the largest resource flow to 12 countries in the region in 2011. ODA grew by more than a third from 1990 to 2012; however, rapid growth in other resources means that ODA accounts for a declining proportion of total resources. In 1990 ODA was the largest flow to 27 countries in the region but by 2011 this had fallen to 9 countries, 6 of which are LDCs. The changing landscape presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenge is for governments, development partners and the development community broadly to articulate a clear vision for the role that Cooperation can play in an increasingly complex landscape. The opportunities are for partnership with actors and resources that are growing rapidly. ODA has a unique mandate among international resources that means it can be targeted more directly towards poverty reduction and development. It can open opportunities to leverage other resources. Many countries in region are expressing a desire to continue receiving development cooperation. For some this is about knowledge sharing or support for strengthening institutions and governance. For others financial transfers remain important, and this is the case even for some MICs, such as those in the Pacific. It is important to recognise that there is value in Cooperation beyond the dollar value alone, and that other, faster growing, resources do not necessarily perform the same functions. Providers of Cooperation can work with countries to design tailored Cooperation, while also increasing alignment to country strategies and systems. There is also a need to follow up on the unmet Monterrey targets, particularly those related to LDCs. it is time to rethink the needs and definitions of \u2018middle income\u2019 countries Middle income countries are a diverse group facing varied challenges and with varying capacity to address them. The extent to which they are able to translate rapid economic growth into sustained poverty reduction and broader social and environmental progress could well be pivotal in determining global progress against the post-2015 vision. Many MICs in the region see a continued and important, albeit evolving, role for development Cooperation. Providers should consider developing appropriate models for flexible, targeted Cooperation with growing MICs, including broader policy coherence \u2013 particularly in areas such as trade, migration, the environment and the global financial system, and consideration for the vulnerabilities of MICs that are also fragile states, LDCs or Pacific Islands. In a post-2015 world that emphasises all three dimensions of development (social, environmental and economic) and the imperative to leave no-one behind, a system for classifying and prioritising Cooperation with countries must go beyond simple economic averages. The way in which countries are classified and the way this classification is used to determine engagement with countries are outdated and need urgent revision. Donors, foundations, INGOs and governments can work together to encourage healthy and predictable flows of funding for CSOs active in development processes in MICs, whether as service providers, innovators, citizen representatives or advocates. Both the scale of philanthropic financial flows and the volume of vital services provided by civil society in MICs are often overlooked. mobilising domestic resources and national capacities are vital for achieving the post-2015 agenda Mobilising sufficient resources will be critical to realising the vision of successful country-led implementation of the post-2015 agenda. Domestic resources are growing in the Asia-Pacific region with government spending growing from an average 17% of GDP in 1995 to 26% (over US$45 trillion) in 2012. However there is a way to go: government resources equate to less than PPP$1,000 per person in 15 countries in the region, home to some 2.15 billion people \u2013 compared to over PPP$ 15,000 in DAC countries. Four components of the global debate on domestic resource mobilisation (DRM) are significant to the region: managing natural resources; illicit finance; civil society and DRM; and the role of international actors in supporting DRM. Close to 35 per cent of exports from the region are from natural resource and extractive industries. As a percentage of total exports, natural resource exports are high in LMICs like Mongolia (81%), Timor Leste (99%), and PNG (77%).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46836055-9db7-472c-8619-7808008079eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "46836055-9db7-472c-8619-7808008079eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec9405197adb287bb589041b550485cc5fa79d298664dc9476fed89d54631993"}, "2": {"node_id": "40302c28-dcdb-41bb-9a1b-dd0af91bd949", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ef6538c4371f9eebcdd4eb1199cad67cf91a369c1891f6ecdf638a184b744dd"}}, "hash": "427f35e5560cd8a2b145a212acd6906afd67193f391d39aa804a402c80b3dc9c", "text": "Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are making important steps in growing and managing revenue from natural AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 5 5 resources.

Bottlenecks and threats to continued progress in domestic resource mobilisation exist. Illicit finance is a considerable drain on domestic resources. Some sources suggest that for 22 of the 31 countries in the region for which estimates of illicit finance exist, these outflows are greater than net ODA in 2012. Co-ordinated action at the international level, such as the automatic exchange of tax information and country-by-country reporting by multinationals, is needed, alongside national actions such as strengthening governance of customs and trade taxes. Only a small proportion of ODA goes towards DRM. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region received core DRM ODA totalling US$ 46.8 million, the vast majority to two countries, Afghanistan (US$ 17.8 million) and Pakistan (US$ 16.9 million). International support provided to assist developing countries in mobilising domestic resources is difficult to accurately track. Current reporting systems are weak and it is therefore difficult to understand the landscape, the outcomes achieved, or the strengths and weaknesses of different partnerships. To effectively scale up international assistance for DRM it is important to strengthen transparency about what is going on already. While there are data challenges, the evidence suggests it is likely that domestic philanthropy in developing countries (NGOs, foundations, religious institutions and other CSOs contributing to development) constitute more funds for development than all ODA combined for the region. These resources are likely to be directed to basic service provision and poverty reduction. Where the public and private sectors can work together effectively, great things can be achieved The private sector is growing rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region, with growth in both domestic and international investment. However much is concentrated in a few key economies: China, Hong Kong and Singapore accounted for almost two-thirds of FDI in the region in 2012. The quality and quantity of FDI are critical factors in determining the pace and form of sustainable development for all countries of the region. The role of FDI will depend on the context in relation to its potential for generating employment, catalysing domestic investment and private sector growth. Different countries have different priorities and face different challenges when it comes to engagement with the private sector, depending on the role that private enterprises play in the economy and the types of investments that are being made. The convergence of public and private efforts \u2013 whether on tourism in a small island context like Palau, or using PPPs to scale up infrastructure investment across South-East Asia \u2013 can be transformative, offering scale and innovation that can drive development. It is vital that transparency principles are retained in public-private collaboration, to allow stakeholders to promote a developmental focus, ensure additionality and reinforce accountability. Company reporting on social and environmental audits, and tax and procurement procedures would be a major step forward. Capacity development is also important, for the public sector to manage relationships with private actors but also within the private sector, particularly in fragile states. south-south Cooperation (ssC) is increasingly important in Asia-Pacific Some of the world\u2019s largest SSC providers are from Asia. Chinese SSC was US$ 2.7 billion in 2012, with additional concessional loans totalling around US$ 1.6 \u2013 1.9 billion. SSC and Triangular Cooperation (TrC) are growing complements to traditional development Cooperation within the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. SSC is intended for mutual benefit where the economic or development objectives of both the recipient and the provider underpin the modality. SSC in the region takes many forms, from knowledge sharing and technical Cooperation to grants, loans, guarantees or credits. Trade, overseas employment and other forms of Cooperation between governments, private sector and CSOs are also occurring. The wide variation of SSC implies that it means different things for different actors and in different contexts. Many providers of SSC are dealing with questions of how to formalise a vision and strategy for the Cooperation they offer, and to establish structures to oversee, co-ordinate and improve the effectiveness of this Cooperation. Countries in the region that receive SSC are adapting the way they engage with and manage this Cooperation to AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 6 enhance the contributions that it can make to their development paths. Application of the Busan principles and monitoring framework by SSC providers is voluntary. However, a number of recipient countries from the region are already including SSC providers\u2019 development assistance in their monitoring frameworks at the country level and seven countries have included SSC providers in their monitoring for the 2013 GPEDC survey.

Beyond Mexico, the Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) will continue to support countries from Asia and the Pacific, draw on evidence generated to date in adapting development finance and cooperation policies, institutions, and technical systems and tools to the changing global, regional and national development and finance landscape. Reforms are already being pursued by a number of countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, PNG, the Philippines and Viet Nam. More countries have shown interest in conducting Development Finance and Aid Assessments (DFAA). The AP-DEF has commissioned a review of the DFAA methodology, key findings, conclusions and recommendations from the first five pilot countries. The review will draw out lessons learned and produce an enhanced DFAA Methodological Note which would inform future DFAAs. Country Assessments and Mapping of Information on South-South Cooperation will be undertaken in Bangladesh and Lao PDR. These will allow the AP-DEF to better identify what SSC is working well and could be replicated as well as up-scaled. These studies will help countries from the region make better sense of the increasing complexity the various sources have for development planning, public investment programming, budgeting and in coordinating due to the different characteristics of the various sources, modalities and activities of various actors of development. An Asia-Pacific regional meeting in partnership with the Department for International Development (DFID), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Government of Australia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is being planned for Quarter 1, 2015. It is an opportunity for the region to turn key messages and voluntary initiatives launched in Mexico into concrete actions. These form part of how countries from Asia and the Pacific are proactively addressing a changing development finance and cooperation landscape and their readiness for implementation of a Post-2015 sustainable development agenda.

AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 7 7 Introduction The Asia-Pacific Effective Development Cooperation Report presents experiences of effective development Cooperation from countries across the Asia-Pacific region. The evidence presented here aims to support countries in the region and beyond as they start to consider how to implement and finance the post-2015 agenda at the country- level. The development landscape in Asia-Pacific is changing. Many countries have achieved considerable progress against much of the MDG agenda, notably in poverty reduction. Yet progress has been slow in other areas such as gender equality. Alongside the unfinished agenda from the MDGs, emerging priorities such as climate change will be central to the post-2015 agenda in the region. The financing landscape is also evolving rapidly. Many countries have access to a larger and more diverse portfolio of national and international resources than ever before. Yet the post-2015 vision for the region will be ambitious, and realising it will require effective partnerships across public and actors that mobilise the contributions of different resources towards effective development. This report draws from extensive evidence about the progress, practices and development solutions that countries across the region have developed as well as the challenges they face.

At the start of each chapter a section titled \u2018the how\u2019 summaries the key action-oriented and practical messages from the region. The report also includes fourteen case studies that examine how particular countries are dealing with the challenges they face, and the mechanisms, instruments and partnerships they have deployed to overcome them. As discussions on how to achieve the vision that will be outlined in the post-2015 agenda continue, and countries start to consider how best to implement and finance the post-2015 agenda at the country level, the experiences of countries across the Asia-Pacific region captured here can make a substantial contribution to effective development Cooperation within the region and beyond. AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 8 1.1. Regional progress towards the mDGs Asia-Pacific is the world\u2019s most diverse region. It includes three of the four most populous countries in the world, as well as many of the world\u2019s smallest. Its level of economic development ranges from Least Developed to High Income, and the politics and aid-dependence of its countries similarly range across the whole spectrum. There are also great cultural, linguistic and religious variations. The region\u2019s successes towards achieving the MDGs have made substantial contributions towards global progress, particularly in reducing poverty. Nevertheless progress towards the MDG agenda as a whole has been varied, and there will likely remain a significant \u2018unfinished agenda\u2019 after 2015. Poverty levels have fallen rapidly, and have driven global progress towards the early achievement of MDG1a, to halve the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day. China\u2019s performance has been instrumental in progress for the region as a whole: China was the first country to achieve the target, with $1 a day poverty falling from 46% in 1990 to 10.4% in 2005.1 However, the number of people living in poverty in Asia-Pacific remains high: the region accounts for 62% of people still living on less than $1.25 a day. Despite rapid progress in countries such as China, Indonesia and Viet Nam, progress has been slower in other countries such as India and the Philippines. Food insecurity remains a major problem and Asia-Pacific accounts for 60% of undernourishment globally.2 The region is home to an estimated 543 million people who are undernourished,3 with South Asia and the Pacific the worst affected regions. Despite improvements in gender parity in access to education, considerable progress is needed to achieve gender equality more broadly. Women are disproportionately affected by deprivation in education, health, undernourishment, vulnerable employment, asset ownership, and lack access to power, voice and rights. Gender based violence remains a problem in many countries. Progress on health indicators has lagged behind other MDG areas. Most countries in the region are unlikely to achieve infant mortality or maternal health targets (MDGs 4 and 5)4. 3 million children under the age of five died in 2011 and nearly 20 million births were unattended by skilled health personnel. However progress on communicable diseases has been more successful: most countries have already achieved targets to reduce the incidence and prevalence of TB. HIV progress is mixed: many countries are progressing, though at least ten countries are making no progress or regressing.5 Access to basic education has grown, although an estimated 18 million children of primary school age remain out of school. Despite improvements in enrolment, concerns about quality remain. Much of this progress has occurred within a context of rapid economic growth and growing domestic resources. The MDGs themselves have galvanised efforts \u2013 they achieved wide political buy-in and served as a rallying point for monitoring development.

AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 9 9 In addition to finishing the job in areas addressed by the MDGs, a number of issues have emerged since the Millennium Declaration which threaten continued progress and have been identified as priorities for the region in the post-2015 timeframe. Climate change poses significant threats to progress and countries in the Asia-Pacific region are particularly vulnerable. 10 of the 15 countries most at risk of natural disasters are in the Asia-Pacific region.6 Climate change can undermine progress in food security and livelihoods, amplify the disease burden and impose large economic costs. The brunt of the impact is often borne by the poorest. While economic growth has been rapid, it has driven rising inequality. The population-weighted GINI coefficient rose to 37.5 from 33.5 in the early 1990s and inequality of opportunity in health, education, employment, access to markets, asset ownership, and access to services have grown.7 Economic insecurity remains a threat to progress and 60% of workers in the region, 1.1 billion people, are in vulnerable employment. Many of these people are working poor: in Bangladesh, more than half of those employed live on less than $1.25 a day and 80% on less than $2 a day.8 While GDP for the region grew at an average 8.5% per year, formal employment growth was just 1.6%. Educational enrolment rates have improved, but there are concerns about the quality of education and dropout rates are high. One-third of countries that have already achieved, or are on-track to achieve primary enrolment targets are making slow or no progress on pupils reaching the last grade of primary school. This has been linked to low public expenditure on education.9 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), an area not covered by the MDGs, are increasingly prevalent in the region, particularly in the Pacific. The WHO estimates that Asia-Pacific will account for the world\u2019s greatest number of NCD deaths by 2020. Health in general is the area in which the region has made least progress, and this is also linked to low expenditure from both public and private sources, as well as numbers of trained health personnel.10 1.3. Global financing discussions: the post-2015 agenda, Busan commitments and the Global Part- nership for Effective Development Cooperation Every vision needs a financing and implementation strategy and as the post-2015 framework takes shape the question of how to achieve these goals grows increasingly important. The goals articulated through the post-2015 framework will be ambitious. Political consensus around a headline goal of eradicating poverty is strong, and the focus has broadened from the MDGs to include all three dimensions of development: social, environmental and economic. An ambitious vision needs an implementation plan that is commensurate with that vision. Realising the vision of the post-2015 agenda will require mobilising the contributions, including development financing resources, of all actors \u2013 public and private, national and international. It will require innovation in partnerships and collaboration and alignment of diverse actors.

Two groups that face distinct challenges are the Pacific Islands and fragile states in the region. 1.4.1. Pacific islands Progress towards the MDGs Pacific Island progress towards the MDGs has been varied, and there are some areas in which the experience has been quite different from that in Asia. Poverty reduction remains a considerable challenge for many Pacific countries. Fiji is the only country to have achieved MDG1 early11, and only the Cook Islands and Niue are on track to meet the target of halving poverty by 201512. While progress towards gender parity in education has been achieved, only three Forum Island Countries13 are on track to realise the broader goal of gender equality and empowering women. Post-2015 priorities Building on the MDGs, there are some areas of commonality between the priorities emerging in the post-2015 discussions and those identified by Pacific Islands, but also some areas of divergence. Pacific Islands are calling for a target to keep global average temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a more ambitious target than the 2 degrees Celsius targeted proposed in the report of the High-Level Panel on the post-2015 Development Agenda. The High Level Panel report recognises the detrimental effect of poor ocean management on SIDS and proposed a target on adopting sustainable ocean practices, rebuilding fish stocks and reducing wastewater in coastal areas. Pacific Islands advocate for a greater focus on oceans, and have called for a stand-alone goal. Regarding infrastructure, the characteristics and vulnerabilities of Pacific Islands mean that many Islands, even those classified as UMICs, are unlikely to be able to expand their narrow domestic resource base sufficiently to finance the necessary infrastructure development. Financing The Pacific Islands have argued strongly for the need to maintain access to concessional finance. Many Pacific countries remain dependent on ODA, and levels of ODA per capita are among the highest in the world. Net ODA per capita increased for the Pacific from around US$ 100 in the early 2000s to US$ 226 in 2012. Per capita ODA to the Pacific is almost 10 times that for all developing countries (US$23) and almost 5 times the per capita ODA for Africa.14 Of the ten countries worldwide where ODA is equivalent to more than US$ 1,000 per capita, eight are Pacific Islands.15 Following the Forum Compact16 a regional peer review system has helped drive progress in strengthening country systems for domestic budgeting and aid management (see Annex E). Nevertheless, fragmentation of ODA remains an issue; three recent peer reviews in the region found between 150 and 200 active development cooperation projects in each country, most of which have individual reporting formats, schedules and management requirements.17 There are calls for simpler and less fragmented aid delivery modalities and progress has been made by some countries in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca287425-5bb8-43dd-9b5a-71d2773c3cfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca287425-5bb8-43dd-9b5a-71d2773c3cfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21b00dd01f159e8e381f44d69b83647cfea15b1335bfcca887ac7ef3d9b59c73"}, "2": {"node_id": "34b44a7d-f045-407e-ada8-c9486720c181", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "debd76fb68545f63efed2c4b0ad1db3e62e8b3f8df5aec5da578ce2a8183b852"}}, "hash": "6d1b0af8f756933e4c08c22b9dc441b8e48ab6e26bbf0aa6c50ab02d4d0a144e", "text": "Samoa has reduced the number of active projects from 300 in 2005 to less than 100 in 2010, despite a doubling of total aid.

Progress on the MDGs among fragile states in the region is mixed: 4 countries have already achieved MDG1A to halve extreme poverty, but 1 has made slow progress and 9 have no data to evaluate progress. Six countries have achieved targets on safe drinking water, while another 6 are making slow progress. Mixed contexts Fragility comes in various guises and the underlying factors that determine fragility vary considerably from country to country. The Failed States Index20, which analyses the contributions that different factors make towards overall fragility, highlights this variety. In Sri Lanka, for example, \u2018group grievance\u2019, factionalised elites and human rights are the largest contributing factors, while in Timor-Leste the top three factors are quite different \u2013 demographic pressures, external intervention and the provision of public services. Aid dependency also varies considerably between fragile states. Based on ODA as a proportion of national income, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu are highly aid dependent: ODA was equivalent to 39% and 37% of GNI in 2012. ODA is also equivalent to more than 30% of GNI in the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Afghanistan. However in Timor-Leste ODA is equivalent to less than 5% of GNI, and in Pakistan and Sri Lanka it is less than 1% of GNI. Cooperation that drives transformation The New Deal principles established in Busan on cooperation with fragile states remain relevant to development partners. Development cooperation should look to drive transformation that is aligned to the country\u2019s own definition of progress and vision of the steps needed to achieve it. Fragility assessments, which articulate a country-owned view on the causes, features and drivers of fragility and resilience, and measure progress against the peace and statebuilding goals (PSG) are powerful tools for empowering fragile states to articulate a clear vision and for encouraging donors to align their cooperation to a country-led strategy. Timor-Leste is the only New Deal member country in the region to have undertaken a fragility assessment. The country\u2019s assessment highlighted the significant progress made in the area of security (PSG 2), further progress in legitimate politics and revenue and services (PSGs 1 and 5), and that further attention is needed in the areas of justice and economic foundations (PSGs 3 and 4). Other Asia-Pacific countries in the g7+ grouping may wish to consider conducting fragility assessments. Development partners can also look to support domestic resource mobilisation in fragile states, to support growing public sector capacity to address domestic issues, and for statebuilding.21 Capacity development Enabling institutions is critical to progress in fragile states and effective institutions underpin many of the PSGs in the New Deal: legitimate politics, security, justice, economic foundations and revenue collection and service provision. Human resources are critical for building and maintaining the processes that effective institutions are built on and the situation that fragile states face varies \u2013 some countries, such as Afghanistan, can draw on a larger pool of foreign educated citizens than others. Capacity building is important not only in the public sector but also in the private sector \u2013 in many fragile states private sector capacity for development is low and capacity building should be an important component of effective cooperation. 18As defined in the 2014 Fragile States Report, OECD INCAF.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42d890d4-e5e9-4b82-a861-3fd46db09717": {"__data__": {"id_": "42d890d4-e5e9-4b82-a861-3fd46db09717", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d2ff8e631d6bd376480eb7d50ae3a619067ec724aaf39163dba791f83a5dd3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1d1feb7-2125-4898-bd32-841b8c22bdbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb799f42d8c4d6b2f7826a7fdeb0a3b6a97b47b40acab71199a649cb62163841"}}, "hash": "a22e1c1e092ea6fd797f07cff32ecb5ab6a05f38b0d54ca9ac8bf6bedf5bf7cf", "text": "18As defined in the 2014 Fragile States Report, OECD INCAF.

The changing resource landscape KEy mEssAGEs Traditional development cooperation accounts for a declining proportion of the overall development finance envelope in Asia and the Pacific, falling from 14% of total international resource flows to the region in 1990 to 3.4% in 2012 Despite rapid growth, 2.15 billion people live in 15 countries in which government spending is less than PPP$ 1,000 per person each year \u2013 compared to PPP$ 15,000 in DAC countries International resources to the region have grown more than five-fold since 1990 FDI is the largest flow to three sub-regions: East and North-East Asia, South East Asia, and North & Central Asia. Long-term loans are the largest flow to South and South-West Asia and the Pacific (due to LNG investments in Papua New Guinea). In 1990, ODA was the largest resource flow to 27 countries in the region but by 2011, had fallen to only 9 countries, 6 of which are LDCs. Remittances are the largest flow to 12 countries ODA has a unique mandate among international resources that means it can be targeted more directly towards poverty reduction and development and many countries in region from LDCS, to SIDS, to MICS are expressing a desire to continue receiving development cooperation Many countries maintain that development cooperation is still important and has a continued contribution to make towards their development paths The challenge is to design and clearly articulate the added-value that development cooperation can bring in an increasingly complex and diverse landscape; this will look different in different country contexts Leveraging other resources and unleashing the development potential of partners from across the public and private sectors at the national and international levels is crucial There is a growing potential, especially in MICs, for mobilizing resources domestically \u2013 from taxes, philanthropy and private investment in particular \u2018thE hoW\u2019 Countries to articulate a clear vision for the added-value that development cooperation can bring to their development paths within an increasingly complex landscape Strengthen dialogue between national institutions and development partners about the design and implementation of cooperation Development partners to work with recipient countries to design tailored and appropriate cooperation, and reinvigorate efforts to strengthen ownership and the use of country systems Follow up on commitments: particularly the unmet Monterrey target for donors to provide 0.15% - 0.20% of GNI in ODA to LDCs; and the commitment to provide ODA of 0.7% of GNI There has been dramatic change in the resources available to countries in the Asia-Pacific region over the last two decades. This presents a challenge to traditional development cooperation: to articulate its place among a larger and more diverse development finance envelope. It is also an opportunity: to develop ways of working that leverage, strengthen and unleash the potential of wider resources to contribute towards development in the region. In order to develop and articulate the role that development cooperation can play over the next fifteen years it is important to first understand the trends and context in which it operates. This chapter outlines key trends across the Asia-Pacific region and breaks down data for each sub-region.

International resource flows have grown more than five-fold since 1990, to US$ 1.2 trillion in 2012. Rapid economic growth and closer integration with international finance have given many countries access to a larger and more varied pool of resources. As discussions on how to realise the post-2015 vision continue it is important to recognise the opportunities and challenges that an increasingly complex resource landscape presents in order to find ways to unleash the potential of wider resources and to articulate the added value that development cooperation can bring in different contexts. At the domestic level, both public and private resources have grown since the mid 1990s and early 2000s (Figure 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39af3716-9e25-470f-b7bc-57ae3064c547": {"__data__": {"id_": "39af3716-9e25-470f-b7bc-57ae3064c547", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ccc8f4bd05de9647d6644edb00a5c82ef203fc1192c05a607a5b795207e2386"}, "2": {"node_id": "c01b4601-6bc7-4fff-98dc-013f395a6e6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a4e6927db146c152e6419fdec11ec90d8d99636ac857aef1b828b6d61b76ad7"}}, "hash": "a5e9198a90961afbac99360aeb7c6a1abdd52cb40ea830ca4f3ddc9033be38f2", "text": "Government spending22 has grown from an average 17% of GDP in 1995 to 26%, over US$ 4.5 trillion, in 2012.23 Fixed capital formation by the private sector has also grown rapidly over the same period, from 12% of GDP in 2000 to 23% in 2012, with China has driving much of this growth (excluding China, private fixed capital formation in the region is 19% of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c81c4481-8e83-4c15-8f44-73ef7e85eba1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c81c4481-8e83-4c15-8f44-73ef7e85eba1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd8ecdba513c17bb4a448fd129f90662062bbdc73303a30bef1e91e921556de7"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ec253a8-c62a-430b-a067-fd8776862600", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "856ad37e4ec52837d77aa724d69e93c8e0994581e281d25b291b9be9ebed8189"}}, "hash": "cd47416ca155246f065269d21ab7bf04359d55c9a8fd62c789dd705b6ed6489b", "text": "GDP).

ODA has a unique mandate among international resources that means it can be targeted more directly towards poverty reduction and development and many countries in the region \u2013 from LDCs to SIDS to MICS \u2013 are expressing a desire to continue receiving development cooperation. The challenge for the development community is to design and articulate the added value that cooperation can bring in this increasingly complex resource landscape. This will look different in different contexts, and will involve a range of roles, whether reaching places or sectors that other resources do not, or leveraging other resources to unleash their development potential and increase effectiveness. The Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility (AP-DEF) is a country-led regional facility that supports south- south learning, exchange of country and regional knowledge and experiences and regional dialogue on development effectiveness that is evidence-based. It is supporting countries in the region to reform their development cooperation policies in ways that allow better management of development finance beyond aid in an increasingly complex landscape of domestic and international resources. Since 2013 the AP-DEF has helped Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam conduct Development Finance and Aid Assessments (DFAAs). It has also supported Thailand and Indonesia in conducting Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews of South-South Cooperation (PEIRs) in Thailand and Indonesia.

World Bank: private fixed capital formation; remittances (Migration and Remittances Factbook); portfolio equity; long- and short- term debt, interest and principal repayments on debt (International Debt Statistics). IMF World Economic Outlook: government spending data, with calculations by Development Initiatives; GDP. OECD: ODA and OOFs, capital and interest repayments on ODA and OOFs. Global Financial Integrity: capital flight and trade mispricing.

ODA remains the largest share of international resources received. From 67% in 1990, only slightly reducing to 62% in 2000 and remaining at more than 50% in 2012. ODA remains a significant financial flow to many countries in the region. For example, it was the largest flow to the Solomon Islands, at US$310 million in 2012 equivalent to 76% of total flows to the country.

Progress since Busan and inclusive development KEy mEssAGEs Progress towards meeting the Busan commitments on development effectiveness is mixed, but the view from the region is of a glass half full Mutual accountability has seen the most progress: targets have already been met by 10 of the 15 countries surveyed in the region Progress has been made in many countries on predictability: nine countries in the region scored above the global average on medium-term predictability and four countries have already met annual predictability targets, with another two on track Untied aid rose in more than half of all countries surveyed, and there has been some progress in the use of country systems: three countries have already achieved the target and one is on track Nevertheless continued and accelerated progress is needed, notably in the systems for tracking allocations towards gender equality and the enabling environment for civil society, which has deteriorated in many countries The story for most countries is one of general progress, but Samoa is the only country in the region not to have regressed in any area covered by the survey There is an urgent need to finalise the monitoring framework. Without monitoring the challenges and bottlenecks to progress cannot be identified and the vision of an evidence-based approach for implementation cannot be realised Governments and donors are not the only actors; civil society, the private sector and citizens \u2013 especially women \u2013 all play pivotal roles in achieving the Busan goals \u2018thE hoW\u2019 Finalise the monitoring framework \u2013 particularly regarding indicators on the enabling environment for civil society and partnerships with the private sector Strengthen the enabling environment for CSOs as independent development actors and improve access to sustainable domestic and foreign funding Further establish institutionalized, inclusive, multi-stakeholder mechanisms for determining and monitoring development policy and planning critical to democratic ownership Prioritise investments in gender and women\u2019s empowerment, and in the systems to monitor and assess these investments Encourage healthy and predictable flows of funding for CSOs active in development processes, whether as service providers, innovators, citizen representatives or advocates Monitoring progress against the commitments made in Busan (see Annex B) is vital to understanding the challenges faced in improving development effectiveness and realising the vision of an evidence-based approach to implementation by all partners. This chapter examines the results of the first monitoring survey, which fifteen countries in the region participated in. It presents areas in which countries have achieved progress, two case studies that lay out how this progress has been achieved, and concludes with an examination of areas in which further progress is needed. Two areas: the enabling environment for civil society, and gender parity beyond education, are explored in detail.

Examples of success Many countries across the Asia-Pacific region are progressing against many of the Busan commitments covered by the GPEDC monitoring framework. The most significant progress has been experienced in mutual accountability and predictability. Samoa is the country that has made progress across the largest number of areas in the survey, and is the only Asia-Pacific country that participated in the survey that has not regressed in any areas (see case study in Annex C). Ownership and results Untied aid rose in eight of the fifteen countries surveyed. In Palau the proportion of untied aid rose from 79% in 2010 to 93% in 2013, and in Timor-Leste it rose from 83% to 93%. Kiribati, Nepal, Samoa and the Philippines experienced smaller increases in untied aid. Untied aid also rose in Niue and Nauru, reaching 99% in both countries. Aid on budget targets have already been achieved in two countries, Nepal and Samoa. The proportion of disbursements to the government sector recorded in the government\u2019s annual budget rose from 68% in 2010 to 96% in 2013 in Nepal, and from 83% to 100% in Samoa. Bangladesh has almost met the 85% minimum threshold, with the proportion recorded on budget rising from 80% to 84%, although slightly accelerated progress is needed in order to achieve the target of 90% by 2015. In Tajikistan, considerable progress has been made, with the proportion rising from 46% to 61% in 2013 \u2013 although accelerated progress is needed to meet the minimum 85% target by 2015. Use of country systems targets have been achieved already in three countries in the region, and one country is on track to meet the target. The proportion of disbursements to the government sector that use country PFM and procurement systems rose in Armenia from 38% in 2010 to 59% in 2013, in Bangladesh from 56% to 72% and in Samoa from 49% to 73%. Nepal is on track to meet its target of 70% by 2015, having risen from 55% in 2010 to 68% in 2013. There is inadequate data on the use of country results frameworks for a systematic evaluation of progress across the region. However it is noted that many countries, including Bangladesh (see case study below) and Cambodia (see Annex D), are actively encouraging development partners to utilise results frameworks linked to national development plans. Case study: Results frameworks in Bangladesh31 Bangladesh introduced a Development Results Framework (DRF) built into its Sixth Five Year Plan, 2011-2015. The aim of the DRF is to monitor progress against the five year plan and to assess the results of development cooperation.

The major challenges limiting full uptake are awareness about the DRF and the processes that have been established to track it, particularly among line ministries, limited use of government systems generally among some development partners, and the perception that the DRF is a means for holding the government to account, rather than a tool for use in programming. Capacity constraints within line ministries present a further issue. There are also a number of technical issues to be overcome. Gaps in the coverage of indicators have been recognised and a process is underway to revise aspects of the DRF in 2014.

To date, the DRF is only able to capture disbursements against committed funds in the health and education sectors, and is unable to capture the contributions of the private sector or NGOs. The information systems currently used were designed for debt management, and an Aid Information Management System is under development. Bangladesh has made significant progress against social and economic indicators in recent years, but strengthening institutional frameworks for developing, implementing and reviewing policy has been identified as necessary for continued progress. The DRF is an important step forward. While uptake among development partners and line ministries to date is only partial, developing and building consensus around a sustainable country-led results framework requires time and strong leadership. Bangladesh\u2019s DRF is an important development for effective development within the country, and there have already been successes in aligning cooperation from some providers. Inclusive partnerships Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment targets have been met by two countries in the region, Nepal and the Philippines.33 Both countries achieved all four criteria on government systems that track and make public gender equality budget allocations. Outside the GPEDC Monitoring Framework, many countries across the region have achieved success in equal access to education, particularly at the primary and secondary levels. 39 of 46 countries with data have already met targets to achieve gender equality in primary education, and 4 countries are on track to meet the target. 32 of 42 countries with data have already met gender equality targets in secondary education, and 4 more are on track to meet the target. There is less data on equality targets in tertiary education, but 19 of 32 countries have already met the target with 3 on track to do so by 2015. Women\u2019s representation in national parliaments has grown, from 4% to 12% in Western Asia and 7% to 19% in Southern Asia, some of the fastest progress worldwide (although there remains a long way to go).34 Beyond these areas, however, many countries are making little or slow progress (see section 3.3 below). Case study: Gender responsive budgeting in Nepal35 Nepal is a leader within the Asia-Pacific region in terms of the systems in place to allocate and track expenditure towards gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The country is one of only two countries in the GPEDC monitoring survey in the region that has already met gender equality targets. Nepal\u2019s approach is rooted at the strategic level with a strong emphasis on gender equality as a high national priority. Gender equality and inclusion is one of the four pillars of the country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP). At the functional level, Nepal has developed a system tracking allocations towards gender equality that is built into the national budget process. As the budget is developed, thirteen national ministries are required to mark each budget line item with a score against different aspects of gender sensitivity.

To monitor progress, a set of performance indicators and a system of annual assessments has also been introduced.

NGO domestic revenues totalled $15.7bn in 2008 (including funds from government) plus contributions from foreign sources. India: has one of the largest and oldest civil societies in the world. According to a GoI-commissioned study there are an estimated 3.3 million registered CSOs employing 2.7 million staff and 16.5 million volunteers. The most recent estimates from within the sector indicate total revenues of $9-18bn/year in 2007, of which about $1bn to $1.8bn was from personal giving and $2.8bn from foreign sources, including the Indian diaspora and overseas charities. Most of the balance (about half total revenues) came from fees, and funding from central and state governments was also important. Philippines: has one of the most vibrant and active civil societies in the world; 46% of adult Filipinos count themselves as active members of at least one NGO. However in revenue terms the sector is modest, compared with India and China. The total income of the NGO sector is about $280 million (about 38% from foreign donors and foundations). Of the 89,000 registered NGOs, about 4000 are classified as Development NGOs (generally the best resources) and are active primarily in health and education services and poverty reduction, but also in housing, training, enterprise development and the environment.

In Tajikistan it fell from 64% to 59%, in Armenia from 84% to 80% and in Bangladesh from 80% to 76%. The Marshall Islands, FSM and Cambodia experienced smaller declines in untied aid. The proportion of aid on budget declined in three countries in the region. In Cambodia, the proportion fell from 95% in 2010 to 79% in 2013, in Viet Nam from 81% to 72% and in Timor-Leste from 61% to 54%. The quality of country systems, as measured by CPIA scores, did not improve in any countries in the region and worsened slightly in Viet Nam, which fell from a score of 4.0 to 3.5. Use of country systems declined in two countries, Tajikistan and Timor-Leste, falling from 31% to 6% and 17% to 7% respectively. In both countries this was driven by declining use of country systems by the largest providers \u2013 by Australia in Timor-Leste, and by four multilaterals (AsDB, IMF, EU and World Bank) in Tajikistan. In Cambodia and Viet Nam progress has been made but needs to be accelerated in order to meet the 2015 targets. Inclusive partnerships Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment targets are some way from being met in many countries in the region. While two of the nine countries surveyed met all four criteria, the other seven countries do not have the systems in place to track allocations towards gender equality and did not meet any of the four criteria. Beyond the monitoring survey, while there has been progress towards gender equality in education in most of the region, there is a way to go for some countries,37 and gender equality beyond education is lacking. Gender gaps in employment in Southern Asia and Western Asia are among the highest in the world, with female employment 48.9 and 48.3 percentage points lower than male employment in the same region.38 Violence against women by an intimate partner is higher in South-East Asia than any other region worldwide, with 37.7% of women experiencing violence during their lifetimes. Southern Asia is the only region in the world in which under five mortality rates are higher for girls (who have a natural physiological advantage in terms of child survival) than boys, which implies the existence of discriminatory practices Given the lack of progress towards improving gender equality beyond access to education, establishing systems to track government programmes and allocations is an important step. The monitoring framework for the enabling environment for civil society and for partnerships with the private sector is not yet finalised. Civil-society within the Asia-Pacific region has highlighted the urgent need to finalise the framework for monitoring the enabling environment, as CSOs in many countries in the region face significant threats (see below).

In his second annual report the Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai noted that these controls that are designed to \u2018silence the voices of dissent and critics.\u201942 In the last decade, over 50 governments worldwide have considered or enacted measures that restrict civil society, and the Asia-Pacific region is unfortunately prominent in this regard.43 In the last two years at least seven countries in the Asia-Pacific region have taken legal and/or administrative measures to restrict NGO access to funding, especially from foreign sources.44 The increased imposition by governments of restrictions on NGOs\u2019 funding sources should be of major concern to the GPEDC and post-2015 processes for two reasons. Firstly it results in the loss of precious development resources, and secondly it hobbles a potentially crucial development actor \u2013 civil society. The undue funding restrictions combined with the global financial crisis that has compelled some donors to reduce funding, has in many instances, led to a decline in the number of associations and a reduction in their activities. Another trend that erodes the place of civil society in development relates to the interpretation of collaborative approaches to development. Emphasis on harmonisation of initiatives and stronger country ownership has stimulated the development of stronger consultative group processes at the country level, with oversight from governments and parliaments. However, civil society can often find itself left out of this framework, where it previously played a more prominent (albeit informal) role both in advocating specific development priorities and as an implementation watchdog. While development rhetoric gives increasing weight to civic engagement, the processes of decision- making are in some contexts more exclusively governmental. Transparency and accountability Despite progress in many countries in the region on predictability and mutual accountability indicators, further progress is needed in others, and a few countries have regressed against targets. Mutual accountability targets were met in Nepal in 2010, but have since regressed. In 2013 the assessment of progress towards targets did not involve non-executive stakeholders and was not made public. The Marshall Islands and Nauru did not meet the target in 2013 for the same reasons, while Timor-Leste does not have country-level targets and Palau has neither country-level targets nor an aid/partnership policy. Annual predictability fell in three countries \u2013 Armenia, Tajikistan and Viet Nam. In Armenia the proportion of funds disbursed as scheduled fell considerably, from 88% in 2010 to 69% in 2013. 40John Clark, 2011, \u201cCivil Society in the Age of Crisis\u201d, Journal of Civil Society, 7:3, 241-263 41International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) and World Movement for Democracy (WMD), 2012, Defending Civil Society, USA 42Report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, Maina Kiai, UN HRC, A/HRC/23/39, 24 April 2013 43International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL) and World Movement for Democracy (WMD), 2012, Defending Civil Society, USA 44ICNL, 2013, Global Trends in NGO Law: The Legal and regulatory Framework for Civil Society 2012-13.

Growing tax revenues are driving increases in public spending across the Asia-Pacific region: government spending grew from an average 17% of GDP in 1995 to 26% (over US$ 45 trillion) in 2012. Nevertheless resources remain low in absolute levels and there is some way to go before governments and other institutions with a mandate for social progress are equipped with sufficient resources to realise that vision. In 15 countries in the region, home to 2.1 billion people, government spending is less than PPP$ 1,000 per person. The sources and factors affecting tax revenue vary considerably from country to country. For some resource rich countries in the region, revenue from extractives industries is significant, and managing mineral wealth sustainably and effectively is a key challenge. For others, illicit finance is a major drain on natural resources \u2013 for example an estimated 25% of all goods imported to the Philippines go unreported to customs, and reforming governance and enforcement of tax collection is a pertinent challenge. AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 46 International actors can play an important role supporting countries with DRM. This can take many forms, from supporting institutional improvements in tax systems, support related to sectors such as the extractives industries, or international co-ordination around illicit finance. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the largest recipients of ODA for DRM worldwide, while other countries in the region received smaller levels of support. Domestic resources beyond the public sector are also growing. Civil society contributes an often under-recognised volume of domestic resources that may exceed official aid in many countries. Civil society is playing an increasingly important role in service provision. This chapter considers four components of the debate that are significant to countries in the Asia-Pacific region: managing natural resources; illicit finance; civil society and DRM; and the role of international actors in supporting DRM. 4.1. mobilising resources from the extractives sector The wealth generated by extractives in Asia-Pacific developing countries has the potential to contribute towards considerable social progress, but natural resources are particularly difficult to manage effectively. The large and volatile revenues generated by natural resources are notoriously susceptible to rent-seeking and corruption and can place significant strain on the institutional structures and processes governing them. Hence, natural resources have historically become a curse more than a blessing for many countries worldwide. Resource rich countries in the Asia-Pacific region are dealing with many issues regarding the management of extractives revenues. Close to 35 per cent of exports from the region are from natural resource and extractive industries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b4f52de-452e-4803-8348-f6678efa9254": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b4f52de-452e-4803-8348-f6678efa9254", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95f291067a929d2fa437d5be04f5d2505f43cb5a6b33f60b0d7e32456ddae9ca"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbb32fe3-b5e3-4914-96f7-dce02aac04c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04c759ced51c8bef65557bd8272563acadfdd98f426446c776e7830852c88ec9"}}, "hash": "52d9e0c12d6ff5d4a96efdb379a0d8fb0e42556e4ce9e38a1622f476836285c6", "text": "As a percentage of total exports, natural resource exports are high in LMICs like Mongolia (81%), Timor-Leste (99%), and PNG (77%). In Mongolia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Brunei Darussalam natural resource rents are equivalent to more than 40% of GDP.45 Various responses have been developed by countries across the region, including mechanisms to smooth volatile and unpredictable swings in prices or demand, and a number of countries have established or are establishing sovereign wealth funds. There are questions of the legal basis for governing the sector, ensuring that investments remain sustainable and that the government and country receive a fair share of the revenues. Fiji recently introduced a new clause (30) in its Constitution stating that resource owners will get a fair share of the revenue from extractives. Papua New Guinea is in the process of reviewing legislation and arrangements for revenue generated in its mining and petroleum sectors. The question of transparency is also critical, as transparency underpins accountability mechanisms for both the generation and use of resources. A number of countries use best practice from the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to guide transparent and accountable management of resources from the extractives sector. 46 Countries are also facing the question of how to effectively use resources from the sector, and how to balance current and future needs. Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea have each established mechanisms that allocate a certain level of resources for current spending, while safeguarding assets for future revenue streams. There are important questions of absorption capacity and the levels of resources that can be effectively used and invested without generating waste or opportunities for corruption. Case study: Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund47 In 2005 Timor-Leste established a petroleum fund to manage resources from the petroleum sector. This fund has been widely recognised as having successfully managed revenues in an open and transparent mechanism within a post-conflict context of low institutional capacity. The Timorese economy is highly dependent on petroleum; in 2010 revenues from the sector accounted for 73% of national GDP. The fund was established to prudently manage revenues from the sector, to stablise government revenue and to shield the economy from variations in prices and production. 45World bank data on total natural resource rents as a % of GDP for 2011. See: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.TOTL.RT.ZS 46Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia are EITI compliant countries. Afghanistan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Tajikistan are EITI candidate countries. Papua New Guinea submitted an application to join EITI in 2013.

McKechnie, 2013, Overseas Development Institute AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 47 47 The fund receives all revenues from the petroleum sector and is structured such that transfers to the government cannot exceed a maximum Estimated Sustainable Income (ESI) without approval by parliament. The ESI is calculated on the basis of forecasts for future oil prices (sourced from the US Energy Information Agency) and projections of petroleum production. In practice, Parliament has successively approved excess withdrawals above the ESI levels. To do this the government must first undertake an audit on the impact of excessive withdrawals on the future ESI and justify why excess withdrawals are in the long-term interest of the country. This has been an area of some debate and, at its core, lie questions about appropriate levels of investment and alternative sources of revenue. The ESI model deployed by the Petroleum fund is based on the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund model. However levels of investment in Timor- Leste, a country with a recent history of conflict and without a long history of public investment, may be justifiably higher than in an advanced economy like Norway. The rate of return on marginal investments may be considerably higher and demand for services outweighs current levels of basic service delivery expenditure by a large margin. On the other hand, there are risks of the economy overheating, of Dutch disease and limits to the absorption capacity of government. Extending transfers beyond the level at which they can be used effectively risks the waste of resources and opportunities for corruption.

The government is looking at ways to manage extractives revenues with the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) and by reviewing the legislation and arrangements that govern the extractives sectors. The development finance landscape is also characterised by the Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Programme (PNG SDP), a large private fund. The domestic resources available to PNG have grown rapidly since the Millennium. Tax revenues have grown overall rapidly from just over 1 billion Kina in 2000 to over 6.5 billion Kina in 2012. Nevertheless, domestic resource mobilisation has not kept pace with rapid headline economic growth. A significant proportion of the growth in domestic resource mobilisation has been driven by revenue from the mining and petroleum sectors, although tax revenue from these sectors has been volatile and unpredictable year-on-year. Against this backdrop and within a context in which the terms of governance around mining and petroleum are more favourable on average than other resource-rich countries,49 PNG is reviewing the governance of extractives industries and management of these revenues. Governance of the sector is being reviewed along a number of strands. A review of the Mining and Petroleum policy, found that there are margins to extract additional resources from the mining sector. The government is therefore reviewing arrangements with resource owners and reviewing the legislation on which mining and petroleum taxes are based. The country applied to join the Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) in December 2013, and is developing plans to implement the initiative. 48McKechnie, 2013, pp5 49Both in terms of royalties and profit tax.

The Development Fund will provide an on-going funding stream for economic and social priorities while the Stabilisation Fund aims to absorb and smooth the impact of fluctuating international demand and prices on PNG\u2019s budget and economy. All mining revenues will be captured by the stabilisation fund, which will transfer an amount not exceeding the 15 year moving average of resource revenues as a share of the annual budget, thereby shielding government budgets from fluctuations in mining revenue. Effective DRM policy in extractives industries extends beyond taxation of production of extractive exports themselves. Following large investments in mining and petroleum in PNG, employment has increased and government policy has successfully expanded the tax base among workers within the mining and petroleum sectors and their value chains.

Illicit finance is the unrecorded flow of resources through capital flight, from activities such as bribery, theft, kickbacks and smuggling, and trade mispricing, the over- or under- invoicing of goods or services. One of the primary motives for illicit finance is to reduce the tax bill, so the losses to government and society are substantial. Given the fact that illicit finance is deliberately unrecorded by nature, it is difficult to accurately measure the true size of these flows. Nevertheless, the estimates of the scale of these flows show that it is a substantial issue. Illicit outflows from the Asia-Pacific region are estimated at over US$ 400 billion in 2011. The majority, US$ 345 billion is due to trade mispricing. Countries in the region with significant illicit financial outflows exceeding US$10 billion include China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Turkey. China accounts for the largest illicit financial flows in the region (Figure 9), estimated at US$ 151 billion in 2011, the majority of which is due to trade mispricing (US$ 138 billion). For 22 of the 31 countries in the region for which estimates of illicit finance exist, these outflows are greater than net ODA in 2012. 50PNG Development Finance and Aid Assessment, 2013 AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 49 49 There are various responses to the problem of illicit finance, some of which are implementable at the national level, but many of which require co-ordinated international action. At the national level, steps can be taken to strengthen governance of customs and trade taxation to reduce trade mispricing. Internationally, increasing transparency and co- ordination between countries are important steps \u2013 this includes the automatic exchange of tax information as well as requiring multinational companies to report on their activities on a country-by-country basis. figure 9. Estimates of illicit finance leaving Asia-Pacific Case study: The Philippines51 Recent research has found that the Philippines suffers from both illicit financial flows out of the country and illicit financial into the country. Both have caused significant losses to the Filipino economy and to the resources available to the government. An estimated US$ 133 billion in illicit finance left the Philippines between 1960 and 2011, and an estimated US$ 278 billion flowed in. The primary mechanism through which these resources move is trade mispricing, whereby export or imports are misinvoiced. Both cause a loss of tax revenue, and have negative consequences for national savings. Taxes on international trade account for around 22% of total tax in the Philippines and since 1990 the government is estimated to have lost around US$ 23 billion in tax revenue through export and import trade mispricing. The majority of this is from import trade mispricing, where an estimated 25% of all goods imported to the country goes unreported to Filipino customs. The impact on expenditure is substantial \u2013 estimated tax losses of around US$ 3.85 billion in 2011 are equivalent to 95% of spending on social benefits in the same year and are more than twice the size of the fiscal deficit.52 4.3. international assistance for domestic resource mobilisation While most of the changes necessary to mobilise domestic resources must be driven at the national level, there is a role for external actors in supporting reform within countries.

In 2011 an estimated US$ 105 million ODA went towards core DRM ODA. A further US$ 579 million went towards wider DRM ODA. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region received core DRM ODA totalling US$ 46.8 million (45% of the total to all developing countries). However the vast majority of this went to two countries, Afghanistan (US$ 17.8 million) and Pakistan (US$ 16.9 million), the two largest recipients of this type of assistance worldwide. 17 other countries received core DRM ODA, although for thirteen of these the total received was less than US$ 1 million. The UK, IDA and the EU are the largest providers of core DRM assistance to Asia-Pacific countries. Afghanistan and Pakistan were also the largest regional recipients of wider DRM ODA, receiving US$ 148.3 million and US$ 36.9 million respectively in 2011 for projects in which DRM was an identifiable component of a broader programme. India (US$ 22.2 million), Tajikistan (US$ 21.9 million) and the Solomon Islands (US$ 13.0 million) also received significant amounts. The majority of support for Afghanistan, Pakistan and India went towards programmes that support decentralisation processes, of which revenue mobilisation is a component. In India, decentralisation programmes have focused on three of the poorest states, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (table 3). 21 other countries in the region received smaller amounts, totalling less than US$ 10 million each.

Current reporting systems are weak and it is therefore difficult to understand the landscape, the outcomes achieved, or the strengths and weaknesses of different partnerships. 4.4. Philanthropy and Resource mobilization54 NGOs, foundations, religious institutions contributing to development and other CSOs comprise a philanthropic sector which, in most countries (especially wealthier ones), makes a much larger contribution to development resources than is commonly realized. A recent World Bank review of the situation in 10 countries (North and South) revealed that philanthropies handle about $1.8 trillion dollars per year. That is more than the combined GDP of all countries in the Middle East and Africa.55 Philanthropies in developing countries probably mobilize more funds for development from private sources than all official aid combined, and these resources are more likely to be directed to basic service provision and poverty reduction. And international NGOs contribute an estimated $49bn per year from resources they mobilize privately to development activities in the South (equivalent to 45% of ODA) plus a further $10bn of official aid channelled through them.56 AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 51 51 In developing countries, most NGO funds are raised privately, comprising earnings from services etc. and philanthropy.

It is vital therefore that the \u2018how\u2019 of this agenda carefully considers the role of development cooperation with MICs in the region, their access to concessional finance and, indeed, whether the income group classification system itself has a place in a broader and more complex agenda. 5.

There is considerable variety in the economic, social and environmental challenges they face as well as the capacity and institutions they have to address these challenges. In healthcare, for example, while 13 MICs in the region have met skilled birth attendance targets, 10 are only achieving slow progress and 7 are regressing. 11 MICs have achieved or are on track to achieve HIV prevalence targets, but 8 are regressing.58 Most MICs have already achieved targets on tuberculosis prevalence, but prevalence is rising in 3 Pacific MICs. Spending on health varies widely across MICs in the region: spending per person ranges from over PPP$3,000 in Niue, PPP$1,600 in Palau and PPPS$1,160 in Turkey to less than PPP$100 in three countries (Timor-Leste, Lao PDR and Pakistan).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50201e8a-599a-4fc6-a985-ae5d51155624": {"__data__": {"id_": "50201e8a-599a-4fc6-a985-ae5d51155624", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e66b32a4abf2456f3196e4bd567f0f51dc2715d2fba94a8ac1b7a5c72252f4a"}, "2": {"node_id": "69688fe9-3167-4d9e-afb7-88553e9974f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fe6774c1d1bf0b9a09780323f6623d46f23cc49cecb3cafbc3265ed8107a26e"}}, "hash": "70048858b335a81b579c647e2cab8cea31ba49687348b957e9aa3505e1b8d483", "text": "Funding sources vary considerably too; in the Solomon Islands and Samoa the government accounts for around a quarter of health expenditure; in 15 Asia-Pacific MICs households bear over 80% of total expenditure on health.59 MICs within the region face a variety of environmental and climate related challenges.

But poverty levels vary considerably between countries. $1.25 a day poverty rates range from less than 1% of the population in four Asia- Pacific MICs62 to more than 30% in another four. The proportion of people living on less than $2 a day ranges from less than 5% in five countries, to over 60% in three countries (India, Lao PDR and Pakistan). Government spending per person, a proxy for the resources available to domestic institutions, varies widely, from a little over PPP$ 500 per person in Pakistan to over PPP$ 2,200 in Mongolia. MICs also receive a very different mix of international resources. For 9 MICs, ODA accounts for more than 10% of total international resources received in 2012.

An increasing number of providers are scaling down cooperation with MICs, largely because of their income group status. There are many reasons why the development community should take a much more nuanced view. Development cooperation is motivated by poverty eradication and social progress, and the progress or lack of progress that MICs make will go a long way to determining global progress. MICs in the Asia-Pacific region are home to 57% of people living on less than $1.25 a day worldwide. Ending poverty will require continued progress in these countries so it can be argued that it is inconsistent to reduce cooperation merely because income per capita has passed the lower boundary for LMIC status. Many middle income countries have also highlighted the valuable contributions that development cooperation can continue to make towards their development paths and expressed a desire to continue receiving cooperation. While some MICs have stated that they no longer need traditional development cooperation, this is not common across all MICs. The counter-argument is that many MICs should be able to mobilise the resources they need to eradicate poverty from their citizens and that this will not become the political priority that it should be while ODA is still available to them. Multidimensional poor population (Millions) AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 56 The resolution of this dilemma may be to argue for continuing ODA for MICs facing high levels of poverty and vulnerability but to tailor that support appropriately. The type and nature of cooperation will vary as countries develop economically. In Papua New Guinea, for example, the government is encouraging development cooperation providers to focus more on investment in economic sectors and migrate away from the social sectors in which cooperation has traditionally focused. In Viet Nam, the need articulated by the government is less about the transfer of resources and more about cooperation in areas of governance and institutional development (see below). In stronger MICs, continuing ODA should urge, not deter, stronger government effort. In such situations cooperation can prioritise support for civil society and for local or state governments that are least well resourced, focusing on governance reforms that help create a political and administrative context in which pro-poor development gets its deserved attention. Many MICs have also called for broader policy coherence in development cooperation, in areas such as trade, migration, the environment and the global financial system.64 As their economies develop, enhanced cooperation in these areas becomes increasingly important to continued progress. The challenge of cooperation with MICs should not be in justifying the very need for cooperation; rather it should be to clearly articulate the role and added value that cooperation can bring. Case study: Viet Nam Viet Nam is a middle income country that has experienced rapid growth in the economy and resource availability \u2013 yet the government continues to see an important role for development cooperation into the future. Following reforms in the 1980s, Viet Nam experienced a sustained period of high investment and rapid economic growth until the global economic crisis in 2007. Average annual growth exceeded 7% over a twenty year period and the economy quadrupled in size. Viet Nam became a MIC in 2009. However, growth in the economy and in the volumes of resource flows to the country have slowed and the challenge facing the country now is to increase the effectiveness of existing resources.65 ODA accounts for only a small proportion of the development finance envelope in Viet Nam (figure 12), but its significance extends beyond its dollar value alone.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf525e1f-4404-4bbf-9c64-a9ce3045e2ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf525e1f-4404-4bbf-9c64-a9ce3045e2ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15933682d46f50ff3f4e5a6377049bd132b5020925c206dce0185f9fbdca92d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "a8c47884-8f56-4c91-babd-a234ba289d60", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6758a26de99a30f6da31fe5a1504a30411c6563a16b6d59e98283c88e70488bc"}}, "hash": "0369b8009006c939bb8f28078e8576da9e4eeb20129cf2c4d1d72df2408a775a", "text": "The processes of analysis, dialogue and policy design that are built into ODA-financed projects are recognised among Vietnamese line ministries as strengthening weaker national budget appraisal processes.66 ODA also provides a considerable portion of the funds available for addressing new policy challenges, given poor integration between policy making, planning and budget systems in Viet Nam.67 64Consultations Report, Asia-Pacific Regional Outreach Consultation on Building Evidence for the First HLM of the GPEDC, March 2014 65Cox, M., Tran Thi, H., 2013 66Ibid, pp40 67Ibid, pp41 figure 12 International resource flows to Viet Nam in 1990, 2000 and 2012 Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on data from OECD, UNCTAD and the World Bank 1990 2000 2012 17% 31% 25% Portfolio equity Long term debt Short term debt ODA OOFs FDI Permittances US$ 1.1 billion US$ 8.0 billion US$ 29.0 billion AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 57 57 A UNDP-commissioned study68found numerous ways in which ODA can play a valuable role in increasing the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c951a3e5-5365-4c06-9afa-8cc9c0abef66": {"__data__": {"id_": "c951a3e5-5365-4c06-9afa-8cc9c0abef66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ead9aaac26d150bb0f7e9b62267b8ed6e4e8c1998a76b1f254bd299bb155295e"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d139d8b-88f4-4ce9-8968-1b98e2d1202e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "790881cc812347fe82138fac93da95705413f9aa4d68dbd75411fbe03e0f3f15"}}, "hash": "44d79b211ffedf1f4696fac60a94f2b67ac8756ac98c36ec28454b2eefe4243e", "text": "development effectiveness of other sources of finance going forward. Through sharing knowledge and evidence and via targeted capacity building, development partners can support improvements in evidence-based decision making. Technical support to the government can strengthen fiscal decentralisation priorities. Infrastructure development can be supported by leveraging private investment resources into the sector, supporting the development of a framework for designing and negotiating PPPs, as well as by funding triangular cooperation with countries such as Indonesia that have built up expertise in this area. Development partners have played an important role in developing a health sector financing plan that encompasses the national budget, development partners, the private sector and contributions from citizens. Similar initiatives in other sectors such as education can also be supported. Development partners can also support capacity development and growth in the private sector, for example by linking Vietnamese institutions and companies with counterparts overseas. Finally, development partners can also strengthen national accountability mechanisms with sustainable support to civil society and academic and research institutions. In Viet Nam the role of development cooperation is evolving from a focus on financial transfers (though access to concessional credit is still important to the country: see section 5.3). Despite reaching MIC status, there are clear and important roles for development cooperation in supporting institutional development and increased effectiveness going forward. The Vietnamese government has expressed a desire to continue receiving development cooperation. 5.3. Access to international concessional finance Income group status has a significant bearing on a country\u2019s access to international concessional finance beyond the effect on donor allocation decisions described above. Eligibility for the International Development Association (IDA is the World Bank window that provides concessional loans and grants) is determined primarily by income per capita.69 Other institutions are guided by the way that the World Bank classifies countries. Viet Nam is expected to graduate from IDA in 2017 and the Asian Development Fund (the concessional window of the Asian Development Bank) in 2020, although formal decisions have not yet been made. Following graduation the country will lose access to concessional loans and borrowing will only be possible on commercial terms. There are concerns that this will result in a decline in spending in the social sectors in Viet Nam. The government has historically only used non-concessional financing to fund investments that generate a direct revenue stream that can cover repayments while concessional financing has supported expenditure in the social sectors.70 The Pacific Islands, many of which are MICs (and some of which are UMICs) have articulated their need to maintain access to international concessional finance for infrastructure and climate finance for adaptation and mitigation. They argue that access to concessional financing for infrastructure in particular should move beyond conventional economic considerations to take social and environmental factors into account. The particular circumstances and vulnerabilities of small island developing states (SIDS) mean that access to concessional credit for infrastructure will remain important, despite MIC status. 5.4. the effects of \u2018graduating\u2019 to middle income status on civil society Civil society plays an increasingly important role as both an implementer and funder of development activities in MICs. While growth has been associated with a general rise in domestic philanthropy, this is uneven across countries and is countered both by a general decline in international funding for CSOs in MICs and growing demand for their services. Given differences in the types of CSOs supported by domestic and international financing, CSOs tackling \u2018less sexy\u2019 subjects such as monitoring governance or agricultural development in many MICs face considerable challenges. In addition CSOs in many MICs are face increasing restrictions on their activities.

Funding is often erratic, rising or falling steeply in response to natural disasters or crisis and with variations in public perceptions of CSOs. A high proportion of domestic philanthropy is allocated very locally: philanthropists often like to see the evidence of their largess on their doorstep and since they generally live in more prosperous parts of a country, there is an inherent inequity in such targeting (albeit the beneficiaries may well rank amongst the neediest in the locality). Similarly, CSOs financed by remittances tend to flourish in the (often wealthier) communities in which expatriate workers originate. In contrast to the general, albeit uneven, rise in domestic philanthropy as countries in the region have developed economically, there has been a steep decline in official funding for CSOs in MICs. Many donors are shifting funds away from MICs towards conflict-affected countries and LDCs. International NGOs often similarly prefer funding partners in \u2018more needy\u2019 countries. Coupled with a decline in overall ODA and private philanthropy since the global recession, the shift away from CSOs in MICs has led to hard times for organisations that depend on foreign contributions. While at face value the decline in international funding for CSOs may appear to be offset by growth in domestic philanthropy as well as CSO-funding financed by remittances, closer inspection reveals that this would not be comparing like with like. Private charity in MICs tends to focus on the social sectors, and giving by wealthy individuals is often focused on highly visible \u2018prestige projects\u2019. While social sectors such as health and education may be deserving causes, the overall effect is a decline in support for areas that are typically funded internationally, such as agricultural development, micro- finance, training, water and sanitation. Critical advocacy activities that monitor governance to unearth corruption, poor targeting or inefficiency may become especially difficult to fund. In Russia, 50% of NGOs experienced a considerable funding drop (especially in corporate giving); hence most cut their staff or reduced (or deferred) salaries.72 Alongside reductions in financing, CSOs in MICs that seek to provide rounded contributions to development and who tackle these \u2018less sexy\u2019 subjects face increased demand as a result of the economic crisis and rising unemployment. Furthermore, the governments of MICs are often proving the most ready to restrict CSO freedoms and to more rigorously supervise their fundraising activities. This is partly because these governments, being decreasingly dependent on ODA, are becoming less concerned about their image in the donor community, partly because they are more exposed to the arguments OECD countries use for scrutinizing their own domestic CSOs in the wake of the rise of international terrorism (see section 3.3 on Challenges for Civil Society), and partly because they have greater capacity to implement the more restrictive policies and laws. 5.5. Do we need to rethink the way countries are classified? The design and use of the income group classification system conflicts deeply with the spirit of debates about global goals for the post-2015 agenda. While the post-2015 debate emphasises the incorporation of all three aspects of development \u2013 social, environmental and economic \u2013 the income group system reduces this to a narrow view of the economic dimension alone. There is increasing recognition about the need to look beyond averages and to disaggregate data in order to understand and support progress for all people. Yet the income group system reduces the perspective to an average that masks progress for people either side of the average. In practice, income groups are often used in decision making as a proxy for understanding capacity to address domestic issues within a country. The reasoning goes that as income increases, capacity is likely to increase, so the need for development cooperation diminishes. However, income per capita is a poor proxy for the levels of resources within the control of domestic institutions with a mandate to address domestic issues, the human and technical AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 59 59 capacity available to these institutions and the political or other factors that can be conducive or detrimental to progress.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f78268be-8f4d-4afc-863b-e69c59523e27": {"__data__": {"id_": "f78268be-8f4d-4afc-863b-e69c59523e27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "503f7c3b748f1c8874bb164367866bf5123b2021897621dfffec7ba069b3a319"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8d37adc-ba79-4485-a4a9-edbf83afb8c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1be7419e4314188282147aa73df4cac96f072564dfc1c7e755c837f2b7178be3"}}, "hash": "a057749e8f86954129672aa9d1533f363ab24e4967eb861ccc0facb195be9ca6", "text": "For example, while GNI per capita is slightly higher in Indonesia than Mongolia, at US$ 3,420 and US$ 3,160 respectively, government resources per person are considerably lower: spending per person is PPP$ 700 in Indonesia and PPP$ 1,700 in Mongolia.

In 2012 the lower boundary for classification as a lower middle income country was $1,035, equivalent to an average daily income of slightly under $3. While this is above the widely used $1.25 a day measure of extreme poverty, it nevertheless represents a very low level of income and a level at which people are generally considered to be extremely vulnerable to falling back into extreme poverty. An emerging literature73 on economic vulnerability and poverty argues that people with income levels between $4 and $10 a day are vulnerable to falling into extreme poverty, and that only once levels reach above $10 or $12 does this vulnerability starts to subside. Countries with an average income of $3 per day \u2013 even without considering inequality \u2013 are some way off achieving these levels. Even in new UMICs, anyone living around or below the average level of income may still be vulnerable to poverty as the threshold for classification as an UMIC is $3,976 per person, or $11 a day. Of the 34 MICs in the region, 19 are LMICs and 15 UMICs (of which 10 have graduated to UMIC status since 2009). There is an urgent need to re-evaluate both the way in which countries are classified and the way that these classifications are used. The income group system is a forty year old concept that was designed for a purpose entirely different74 from that to which it is applied in a modern and increasing complex development landscape. Looking forward, through the vision that is being expressed in the emerging post-2015 debate, there is a clear need to develop more advanced systems for understanding and engaging with countries that adequately accounts for needs and capacity. 73See, for example, The strugglers: the new poor in Latin America, 2013, Birdsall, N., Lustig, N., Meyer, C. 74The original income group thresholds were designed on the basis of the World Bank\u2019s civil works preference system for procurement, and haven\u2019t been updated since (except for inflation).

AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 61 61 6.1. Defining south-south Cooperation In comparison to other international financial resources, SSC is a loose concept which means different things for different providers in different contexts. For some SSC providers, cooperation is mainly about knowledge sharing or technical cooperation, whereas for others the provision of grants, loans, guarantees or credits are important modalities. Trade, overseas employment and other forms of cooperation between private actors and civil society are also important modalities. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region are active as providers of cooperation, although the information about the scale and nature of the cooperation they provide is partial. In part this is due to the uncoordinated nature of cooperation from many providers, where alignment and information capturing systems among agencies within the provider country are underdeveloped. There is also no central forum in which information is captured across SSC providers. AP-DEF is leading work to map SSC within the Asia-Pacific region to provide a platform for exchange and learning about SSC among SSC providers and recipients. Table 4 below presents estimates of the scale of cooperation provided by different SSC providers. Turkey, Russia and Thailand report cooperation to the OECD, although estimates may capture only partially capture the true volume of activities (see case study on Thailand below). China is the largest provider of SSC worldwide, and the cooperation it provides \u2013 estimated at US$ between US$ 4 and 5 billion in 2012 \u2013 is equivalent in scale to many major traditional donors. Turkey has grown as a provider of cooperation in recent years, in part due to rising humanitarian assistance to neighbouring countries. India and Russia also provide considerable volumes of cooperation. table 4 Estimates of the scale and nature of cooperation from providers in the region SSC provider Rough scale Notes China US$ 2.7 billion non-military aid excluding concessional loans + concessional loans from the Exim bank of around US$ 1.6 \u2013 1.9 billion.

AP-DEF is working to support countries to better understand the volume, delivery and impacts of SSC. It has started to map out the flows and types of cooperation provided through DFAAs, PEIRs and forthcoming CAMIs such as the one being piloted in Bangladesh. Institutional capacity building that improves the ability of recipient countries to strengthen policy and enabling conditions for SSC, and to enhance policy coherence, coordination and institutional arrangements, is important for ensuring that SSC has the greatest impact on development. Case study: SSC in Papua New Guinea South-South Cooperation in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is growing and while this brings greater access to development cooperation and finance, the DFAA for PNG highlighted a number of issues about the type of cooperation that is received from SSC providers. Chinese assistance to PNG has grown almost three-fold since 2005 (nominally) and is expected to double by 2017. China was estimated to be the fifth largest provider of grants to PNG in 2012. However, the experience of PNG has been one where Chinese ODA operates differently to other bilateral partners, with different programming, disbursement and forward planning structures. This adds complexity on PNG\u2019s development cooperation management systems. 6.3. the providers\u2019 perspective Many countries in the region are providing increasing amounts of SSC. Chinese cooperation has grown to levels equivalent to those of many established donors; Turkey, India and others are also providing increasing amounts. Within these countries, in different ways, initiatives are underway to strengthen policies and institutions with oversight of development cooperation. Other countries in the region, such as PNG, have expressed an objective of becoming a provider in the future. Most SSC providers in the region see SSC as distinct from ODA and there is a need for SSC providers to develop an appropriate definition for SSC, and to develop measures on its development impact. The cooperation offered by many countries as they begin to offer assistance is often demand-driven, ad hoc and uncoordinated. Issues may arise, often in neighbouring countries, that an agency or ministry within the SSC provider is able to offer support on. As this type of cooperation grows, or as development cooperation becomes more politically 75Bogota Statement Towards Effective and Inclusive Development Partnerships, March 2010 76These countries include Cambodia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nepal, Philippines, Samoa and Tajikistan from the Asia-Pacific region. AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 63 63 important within the provider, the need to co-ordinate and develop an institutional structure to guide and support cooperation, grows. Many SSC providers in the region are dealing with questions that arise as the cooperation they offer grows beyond small and ad hoc engagement. Central to this is establishing the aims and objectives that the country seeks to achieve through cooperation, and determining the balance between seeking to reinforce their own development path through strategic cooperation, and supporting other countries for more altruistic reasons. Alongside the question of objectives lies the question of what needs exist and what capacity the SSC provider has to address them. Practically, SSC providers are establishing the toolset they can use in their development cooperation. As noted above, this looks quite different for different countries and will evolve over time. Different modalities may be viewed in different perspectives. Thailand, for example, engages with countries in the region through a range of modalities, including the provision of finance, knowledge sharing and technical cooperation. However, rather than viewing different modalities as part of an overall package, they are viewed as distinct from one another, and Thailand reports only the financial support it offers as aid. As cooperation grows so the trade-offs between fragmented and coordinated, flexible and formalised models of cooperation arise. Different institutional structures will be appropriate in different contexts, given differing objectives and varying political and institutional contexts within the SSC provider. Greater coordination allows stronger oversight and alignment to a centralised strategy as well as improved knowledge sharing amongst practitioners that are often disbursed across many ministries or departments. More formalised structures may be necessary to mainstream the monitoring, evaluation and feedback loops that are needed to improve the effectiveness of cooperation. One key question that many SSC providers are asking is whether to establish a dedicated entity that leads or coordinates cooperation. Thailand\u2019s PEIR recommended that the country consider establishing a single entity to bring together cooperation provided by various agencies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6628a7a8-4abc-45b3-9ab0-752f81be6a15": {"__data__": {"id_": "6628a7a8-4abc-45b3-9ab0-752f81be6a15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "001ad6d5b6f9f699cc28a3c1fc78b99d6b53b6390449835034899894778a9896"}, "3": {"node_id": "b98a0f79-b17a-414d-b693-f31934f36887", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb7f3a7aad9137b18793edea637dd5d51a8e6d2d1f5e337c0276cd7f92803815"}}, "hash": "def14f70b57474e1757fd9d27222755e815a7c9830d3feed2cdfe0908e3ed6d3", "text": "In Indonesia a secretariat has been established but struggles with low capacity and the task of coordinating numerous entities that are involved in providing cooperation. As countries develop different motivations and priorities for their cooperation models, so the nature of that cooperation, the partnerships it entails and the institutional structure it sits within will differ. SSC providers across the region offer various types of cooperation and are at various stages of dealing with these issues. Case study: Indonesia Indonesia has a long history of active international engagement and as its economy grows, the country is becoming more active as a SSC provider. The key issues facing Indonesian cooperation are strengthening co-ordination and information sharing among the many agencies providing cooperation. Institutionally, Indonesia\u2019s cooperation is rooted in the Jakarta Commitment (2009) and the country\u2019s national development plans. In 2010 a Coordinating Team for the Development of South-South Cooperation was established to develop a Grand Design that will guide SSC over the period 2011-2025, and a Blue Print setting the policy framework for the first phase, over 2011-2014. The goals of Indonesian cooperation are to accelerate the country\u2019s own economic development, to support Southern countries to achieve \u2018collective self-reliance\u2019, and to support foreign policy objectives of Indonesia as a global player.77 However, despite a developing oversight structure for cooperation, in practice the cooperation offered to date has been largely ad-hoc and uncoordinated. Financing streams for cooperation are unsecured and cooperation has not been integrated into the state budget system. Given the large number of line ministries and agencies, a lack of clarity about how Indonesia defines the development cooperation it provides, and the absence of an information system to report or track development cooperation, estimates for the total volume of activities undertaken by Indonesia vary quite considerably. Information sharing and lesson-learning within the government is difficult and there are many \u2018hidden\u2019 programmes. A secretariat dedicated to SSC has been established, but is reported to suffer from a lack of capacity. 77Sofjan, D., and Kenngott, C., 2014, pp11 AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 64 A UNDP assessment of Indonesian cooperation proposed that, in order to move the agenda forward, Indonesia can consider a number of recommendations. These included a review of the legal and policy structure to mitigate stumbling blocks to progress, considering the establishment of a single entity to scale up SSC and knowledge sharing programmes, and awareness-raising among key stakeholders. These steps may help improve co-ordination and knowledge sharing. Case study: Thailand Thailand continues to engage as a provider of development cooperation, largely to countries within the South-East Asia region. The key issues facing Thai cooperation are improving coordination within government and with partners, and articulating a clear strategy for engaging in cooperation. Thailand reported cooperation totalling US$ 23 million to the OECD in 2012, down from a high of US$ 166 million in 2008.78 However the true total, including all forms of cooperation, is likely to be higher. The majority of cooperation reported to the OECD (US$ 16.4 million) was in the form of grants while a portion was loans (US$ 6.2 million), and most was disbursed within the region: Laos has historically been the largest recipient of Thai cooperation. There is no overarching strategy that governs Thailand\u2019s goals or tools for international development cooperation, although two key national policies highlight development cooperation as a mechanism that can support Thailand\u2019s own development needs.79 As such one of the issues Thai cooperation faces is that different actors have different views on how to meet the needs and interests of their partners. There are two agencies focused on development cooperation: Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency (TICA), which administers technical cooperation, and the Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency (NEDA). However various other ministries and institutions including the EXIM bank also engage in cooperation with partners. This is highlighted in table 5, which shows the range of implementing agencies involved in cooperation with Myanmar over 2009-2011. 78These figures are gross disbursements of ODA as reported to the OECD DAC (table 2A) 79These national policies are the Policy Statement by the Council of Ministers and the 11th National Economic and Social Development Plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b98a0f79-b17a-414d-b693-f31934f36887": {"__data__": {"id_": "b98a0f79-b17a-414d-b693-f31934f36887", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "001ad6d5b6f9f699cc28a3c1fc78b99d6b53b6390449835034899894778a9896"}, "2": {"node_id": "6628a7a8-4abc-45b3-9ab0-752f81be6a15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "def14f70b57474e1757fd9d27222755e815a7c9830d3feed2cdfe0908e3ed6d3"}}, "hash": "cb7f3a7aad9137b18793edea637dd5d51a8e6d2d1f5e337c0276cd7f92803815", "text": "AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 65 65 table 5 Thai cooperation with Myanmar by implementing agency, 2009-2011 Implementing Agency Sectors Cooperation, 2009-2011, Thai Baht millions Ministry of Commerce Technology transfer and technical assistance, trade 6.12 Ministry of Education Education 0.33 Ministry of Energy Education, technology transfer and technical assistance 7.00 Ministry of Foreign Affairs Education, health 0.34 Ministry of Justice Technology transfer and technical assistance 0.03 Ministry of Labour Technology transfer and technical assistance 0.17 Ministry of Natural Resources", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48aaa869-edaa-4621-ac5d-1cbac7af45d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "48aaa869-edaa-4621-ac5d-1cbac7af45d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a7550933a4630c30b82c5bacf80841bb4c19f160a5507f97573de232f540bec"}}, "hash": "8a7550933a4630c30b82c5bacf80841bb4c19f160a5507f97573de232f540bec", "text": "Technology transfer and technical assistance 0.05 Ministry of Public Health Health 0.78 Ministry of Science Technology transfer and technical assistance 0.70 Ministry of Transport Education, technology transfer and technical assistance 1.71 Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency Transport infrastructure 0.11 Office of Higher Ministry of Education Commission Education 8.34 Office of the Prime Minister Education 0.26 Thailand International Development Cooperation Agency Agriculture, education, trade 9.27 Source: Strategic Review of Thailand\u2019s International Development Cooperation, 2013 The institutional structures that co-ordinate development cooperation activities both across and within agencies have been identified as areas that could be improved in order to increase the overall efficiency of Thai development cooperation.80 At present there is no committee that oversees all development cooperation and economic, technical and other types of cooperation are viewed as distinct from one another. This is reflected by Thai reporting to the OECD, which focuses on the financial cooperation Thailand provides, excluding other forms of cooperation. In addition to coordination of activities, the lack of structures to capture information and knowledge on the practices and experiences of different agencies constrains lesson learning about efficient delivery. Steps to improve coordination have been implemented within some ministries, such as the committee on international cooperation within the Ministry of Public Health. This committee was created as a forum to share and integrate strategies and information, and identify areas where different actors working on public health can add greater value by working together. However coordination remains a challenge in many agencies involved in development cooperation. 80M. Miller and W. Prapha, 2013, pp30 AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 66 Monitoring and evaluation has been emphasised in TICA\u2019s strategic framework and is integrated into some technical assistance programmes. However macro-level evaluations of Thailand\u2019s development cooperation is difficult because there is no overarching strategy against which success can be measured and, even where evaluation processes do collect information, feedback mechanisms to improve the design of future policy and programmes are weak. Thailand is actively seeking to promote itself as a regional knowledge hub, particularly in the area of higher education through the Office of Higher Education Commission, and to scale up partnerships with international organisations that provide support for triangular cooperation. Both of these have been highlighted as areas in which clearer strategies, and identification of needs as well as the capacity to meet them, could improve cooperation efficiency.81 81Ibid AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 67 67 7. Knowledge sharing 82Armida S. Alisjahbana, Indonesian Minister for National Development Planning, 2014 Why knowledge sharing matters for development cooperation, UNDP, Indonesia KEy mEssAGEs The knowledge and experience of their peers is often more valuable to developing countries than that traditionally offered by OECD donors and other rich world institutions, since the context in which the experience is gathered is more comparable. Knowledge sharing (KS) can help strengthen the international standing of countries that provide the knowledge, even leading to strengthened trade and investment links. Identifying the knowledge needs of different countries and who is best placed to meet those needs, as well as facilitating the connection, will be haphazard unless a dedicated framework is developed to play these roles. Knowledge sharing is not just government-to-government and in many contexts non-state actors may be better placed to provide knowledge. Donors can usefully help finance the knowledge hubs and coordinating mechanisms needed for this framework. \u2018thE hoW\u2019 Donors to encourage and offer funding to help form bilateral KS links and to establish knowledge hubs for particular topics in Southern countries, possibly also establishing an international unit to foster KS. Where possible these hubs should be housed within existing institutions. Conduct and share globally a stocktaking of existing knowledge hubs (whether based in the North or South): a) to enable Southern governments and other actors to judge which offer priority skills and experience to them, and b) assess which Southern entities (governmental or non-governmental) could usefully contribute their knowledge through these hubs. Southern countries who are prepared to share their expertise could anchor responsibility for promoting and nurturing KS in a specific government agency \u2013 perhaps the agency responsible for the country\u2019s SSC programme, if there is one. These nodes could be connected with counterparts in other countries as SSC (including KS) becomes a more widely used development approach. Such a global network will help countries identify KS opportunities that are most relevant to their needs and comparative advantages.

Acquiring and making effective use of pertinent knowledge is pivotal to addressing the toughest development challenges. The most precious knowledge is often based on the experience of development initiatives elsewhere, especially where the contexts have significant similarities. Mainstream development literature often implies that the knowledge needed lies mostly in the global North and that therefore donor organizations and centres of excellence in the North are the principal actors in KS. However in reality it is developing countries, especially those who have graduated to MIC status, that are likely to have the experience that poorer counterparts most urgently need, and many are increasingly prepared to release their skilled manpower for the time needed to share their skills with others. This South-South exchange of knowledge helps level the development playing field. Donors may support KS (e.g. through facilitation or financing) but the most important roles \u2013 identifying and sharing needed knowledge \u2013 are played by Southern actors. There are many examples of successful KS from the region and beyond. Indonesia was widely praised for its handling of reconstruction in the province of Aceh following the 2004 tsunami, in particular for the emphasis on community- based housing reconstruction. Following the devastating Haitian earthquake of 2010, Indonesia provided invaluable advice to Haiti about clean-up and reconstruction in an exchange facilitated by the World Bank.82 AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 68 In 2008 the Government of Indonesia entered a 5-year partnership arrangement with the Palestinian Authority to provide training in various development fields, such as growing tropical fruit trees, in a KS programme financed by the Japanese government (JICA). While Indonesia is very distant from the West Bank and there is no common language, their shared Muslim faith provided a strong socio-cultural bond. Indonesia has also provided advice to Afghanistan, in the fields of public health, agriculture and community development, and is poised to share its knowledge with Muslim countries in various fields. This may be particularly appropriate in more sensitive areas of development and nation- building such as good governance and democracy building.83 Knowledge sharing is a two-way street, however, and Indonesia has learned as well as taught. Brazil\u2019s highly praised Bolsa Familia programme of conditional cash transfers to poor households was adapted to the national context and used as a pilot for a similar scheme in Indonesia \u2013 the Program Keluarga Harapan (Family Hope Programme). The pilot, financed by the World Bank, was highly effective and has now been scaled up, after certain modifications, to become a national programme funded by the national budget covering 3.2 million households in 2014.84 Beyond its direct benefits, KS has helped Indonesia establish trade and investment ties with other Southern countries. The division between the donor and recipient is not as clear cut as in traditional ODA relations: all parties may contribute and draw benefits. Hence KS can create many positive spill-over effects beyond those intended. It has also helped strengthen Indonesia\u2019s global standing. Many developing countries are increasingly keen to be more assertive as regional and global leaders of development and KS is an important part of the strategy towards this goal. One rationale is to achieve greater bargaining power in the international community through regional cooperation. Guided by its International Development Cooperation Agency, Thailand has an overt strategy of promoting cooperation with their neighbours in order to create a stronger ASEAN Community in the economic, socio-cultural and security areas. In an increasingly interconnected world, there is also recognition that many pivotal challenges can only be overcome by closer cooperation, sharing experience and developing a more unified voice (such as in areas of climate change, bio-technology and food security). Finally, many countries that have made important development advances feel a duty or at least a calling to share that experience with others who have yet to make those advances. As the dividing line between rich and poor nations becomes more diffuse, and MICs have a more prominent place in global policy-making, many MICs recognize that KS (and other elements of SSC) help them strengthen their international relations and gain increased international recognition from working as an effective development partner. The Thai government, for example, considers that providing knowledge and technical cooperation to other developing countries will enhance its international standing, making it better placed to meet the development needs of Thai society. Building knowledge hubs is a key component of KS. Knowledge hubs help seekers and providers of development solutions to network and provide a clear reference point for expertise in specific areas.

Knowledge hubs are not a new phenomenon and have historically sparked transformative change around the world. In the 1950s a Rockefeller Foundation project in Mexico led to the establishment of an institute to research crop disease and drought resistance, and to develop hybrid crop varieties better suited to the Mexican context. Not only was the project itself effective, but it inspired agricultural scientists in India and Pakistan in the 1960s to learn and adapt the approach for the South Asian context \u2013 out of this was born the \u2018Green Revolution\u2019.

While initially funding was from philanthropic foundations, the centres and CGIAR are now supported by ODA, with a secretariat in the World Bank. While Northern funding, expertise and innovation was important, what made this programme effective was the inputs of thousands of Southern agriculturalists and scientists and the close connection that was possible between the research centres and the farmers who came to benefit from the research. This example also illustrates that knowledge sharing is not just government-to-government and in many contexts non-state actors may be better placed to provide knowledge. Foundations, universities, NGOs and the private sector can and should also participate in KS. The Grameen Bank, which millions of poor people (mostly women) in Bangladesh through micro-finance, went on to develop the Grameen Foundation.

It has also established \u2018Banking without Borders\u2019, another non-profit body, to enlist funds and volunteers from the commercial banking sector in advancing micro- finance in the global south.

The International Budget Project (IBP) connects and promotes exchange between CSOs engaged in budget analysis worldwide to advocate for pro-poor policies and enhance the accountability and effectiveness of national and local public expenditure. IBP started in 1985 when a group called DISHA in Gujarat, India realized it needed to better understand budgeting and expenditure processes to achieve its goal of including marginalised tribal people of Gujarat in the state\u2019s development priorities. It sought help from a US NGO, and the endeavour quickly made CSOs in other countries recognize that these tools would be valuable for their advocacy too. The private sector can make important contributions to KS. In 2007, the mobile phone company Safaricom launched a mobile phone based payment and money transfer service, known as M-Pesa. This was based on a DFID-funded pilot undertaken with Vodaphone. The scheme was extremely successful in Kenya and is now one of the most widely used money transfer mechanisms \u2013 whether as payment for goods and services or for making micro-finance deposits. Safaricom and Vodaphone have since helped replicate the approach in Afghanistan, India, Tanzania, South Africa and Egypt. Based on their experience in knowledge sharing and SSC, the governments of Indonesia, Korea and Mexico are collaborating with the World Bank, UNDP and others to advance ideas for promoting this important topic, in particular by establishing country-led knowledge hubs. The structure for a framework to underpin effective KS could look something like the structure in figure 13.

Data is for 2012. figure 15 Foreign Direct Investment in Asia-Pacific The scale of the private sector and the speed of growth highlight the potential that successful, development-effective partnerships with business could have on development outcomes in many countries. The private sector, particularly small and medium enterprises, is the largest employer in much of the region. The private sector provides essential goods and services and, if taxed effectively, can contribute less volatile revenues to the government through taxation. State-owned enterprises in Asia-Pacific The structure of many Asia-Pacific economies is such that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) dominate or account for a significant proportion of economic activity. SOEs account for an estimated 33% of GDP in Viet Nam, 30% in China, roughly 25% in India and Thailand and close to 15% in Singapore. Beyond their share of total production, SOEs are also major employers (roughly 15% of the workforce in China) and major contributors to fiscal revenues (25-30% in Viet Nam).86 The existence and role of large SOEs in many countries has an impact on the potential for effective partnerships with business. For many countries the dominance of SOEs is thought to be crowding-out private investment in key sectors (see case study on Malaysia in Annex F). 8.2. Public-private collaboration Where corporate and social incentives are aligned, and effective partnerships are built between the public and private sectors, great things can be achieved. The private sector can offer greater efficiency and innovative technological solutions. When combined with the public sector\u2019s mandate to serve and vision to achieve progress in social goals, there is great potential for development progress. 86The statistics in this paragraph are from Policy brief on Corporate Governance of State Owned Enterprises in Asia, OECD, 2010. AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 74 Public-private partnerships (PPPs) between the government and a for-profit business are increasingly used in certain sectors, notably infrastructure and transportation. PPPs have been used to fund investments in the power, gas, telecoms and transports sectors in Bangladesh and in ports, power, telecoms, roads and railways in Sri Lanka. PPPs are a core part of the AsDB\u2019s Strategy 2020, with the bank aiming to \u2018promote public-private partnerships in all of its core operational areas\u2019.87 It is estimated that the Asia-Pacific region needs to invest US$ 8 trillion in infrastructure by 2020, and funding from traditional sources is insufficient. PPPs have been identified by many governments as a way to reach scale and increase the amount of funding available for infrastructure across the region. The Malaysian government has proposed 52 infrastructure PPPs over 2011-2015 and aims to raise US$ 5 billion from the private sector each year. In Viet Nam, the government aims to source US$ 6.5 billion annually over 2011-2020 and in Indonesia US$ 4.2 billion per year over 2011-2025.88 While PPPs offer considerable potential, they are not appropriate in all contexts or for all investments. There are also challenges to implementing them successfully. Many governments in the region have limited capacity to manage PPPs effectively \u2013 evidenced, for example, by the fact that a number of Pacific Islands as well as other countries like Mongolia still routinely contract out key aspects of the PPP cycle, such as undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. Where public capacity to manage PPPs is low the risk of projects overrunning, suffering from poor work specifications, or failing for other reasons, is greater. Studies conducted by civil society groups have also shown that privatization of public services has led to the exclusion of the poor and has had severe ramifications on issues of equity and access to services.89 There is also global evidence that PPPs can be an expensive form of financing that increase the cost to the public purse, due to investor demands for high rates of return even on low-risk projects and costs of up to 10% for arranging financing.90 To minimise risks to the public purse, governments can strengthen the legal and institutional environment underpinning PPPs, ensure that transparent accounting, reporting and auditing is undertaken, build value for money assessments into the PPP process, and ensure that budgeting procedures are aligned to wider procurement processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11132233-57d9-4ca4-88bc-1584c83591a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "11132233-57d9-4ca4-88bc-1584c83591a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Effective Development Co-operation Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d03f4d10dabc047db2663778aa599aaf8f2f4af36ee0d742675c8a6ce1a1cd72"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b78b3e5-b56a-4926-aed0-7dacf18e8cf1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-effective-development-co-operation-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c20284c0fd6576b5bbfea6be454e12357bfa582c7489ea958ac27a3c8a6da46a"}}, "hash": "83c9499def46a92590ab2046a3ae85d3f5596d74972160c302a5a9fcb68a6d12", "text": "91 In pursuing PPPs and other forms of public-private collaboration it is vital that hard-won principles of development effectiveness are retained: openness, transparency and accountability, democratic ownership, inclusivity, financial and operational additionality and a focus on development outcomes.

In 2005, visitor receipts were equivalent to 45% of GDP, and the number of visitors in 2007 was four times the total \u00acpopulation. Historically, there had been little collaboration between the public and private sectors, however, concerns about environmental management, Palau\u2019s image as a tourism destination and other issues brought actors from the government and private sector together. In 2008, the Tri- Org \u2013 a partnership between the government (Palau Visitors Authority), tourism industry (Belau Tourism Association) and the wider private sector (Palau Chamber of Commerce) \u2013 was created to develop the Tourism Action Plan. The plan presents detailed actions to address the issues facing the sector, setting out how to share responsibilities among public and private actors. Actions are prioritised and scheduled, with capital and recurrent costs specified. Since its development the plan and the partnerships that it captures have enabled co-ordinated effort to address the challenges facing tourism in Palau. One example of this is the recent announcement that Palau plans to become the world\u2019s first commercial fishing-free nation. While commercial fishing is important economically, recognition that the benefits of improved oceans outweighed the costs of losing commercial fishing meant that this move was supported by both the public sector and by organisations representing the private sector as a whole. 87Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008-2020, 2008, Asian Development Bank, pp14. 88Public-private partnership operational plan 2010-2020, 2012, Asian Development Bank, pp5 89See for example, Reality of Aid 2012: Aid and the Private Sector, Catalysing Poverty Reduction and Development? 90Financing for development post-2015: improving the contribution of private finance, 2014, Griffiths, J., Martin, M., Pereira, J., Strawson, T., European Parliament 91Key issues in managing fiscal risks from public private partnerships, 2012, IMF AsiA-PACifiC EffECtivE DEvEloPmEnt CooPERAtion REPoRt 75 75 Socially-motivated business Many countries in the region have also seen a growth in businesses that are established explicitly for developmental purposes or organisations that target businesses as a mechanism for reinforcing social progress. The Asia-Pacific Business Coalition on AIDS is one such example.92 This network of business coalitions brings together national organisations in eleven countries to support companies in managing the impact of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Through education, development of workplace policy and leveraging corporate resources such as marketing skills and human resources, it aims to strengthen the effort against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria through the private sector across the region. Ethical business networks Private sector umbrella organizations and business leaders clubs can play important and innovative roles in promoting high ethical standards in public and private life, including by requiring commitments to a defined code of conduct as a membership criterion. One of the world\u2019s leading examples of this is in the Philippines.

Its Integrity Initiative promotes high integrity standards in the business community, and also reaches out to government and other sectors. Its Coalition Against Corruption is an alliance with academe, civil society, and the Church to fight corruption through strengthening public participation in governance, supporting counter-corruption projects and ensuring the proper use of public funds, especially by encouraging ethical procurement processes. And its Transparent Accountable Governance project, again with CSOs, assesses the scale and public attitudes towards corruption and promotes public awareness of and debate about the subject.

The global financial crisis hit many countries in the region and in a number, including Cambodia, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, investment levels have not fully recovered. Countries also face varied challenges in realising private sector growth. Table 6 highlights the results of a survey of business leaders94 who were asked about the most problematic factors for doing business. Across the Asia-Pacific region, corruption was highlighted as the most common constraint to doing business, topping the list in 11 countries (of 29 surveyed in the region). Access to financing was the primary constraint in 7 countries. Inefficient government bureaucracy was identified as one of the three most problematic factors for doing business in 15 countries in the region. In 8 countries policy instability and in 7 countries an inadequately educated workforce, were also listed as one of the three most problematic factors for doing business. Alongside the factors listed above, capacity building has also been identified by a number of countries in the region as a key constraint to private sector development. While this is partly about capacity within the public sector for managing private sector relationships (see section 8.2 above), low capacity within the private sector itself is also a constraint in some countries, particularly LDCs and fragile states. Afghanistan and other countries have highlighted this as a priority for development of the private sector. table 6 The most problematic factor for doing business in Asia-Pacific countries Countries Corruption Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Thailand and Timor-Leste Access to financing Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, China, Korea, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam Inadequate supply of infrastructure India, Philippines Policy instability Iran Inadequately educated workforce Lao PDR, Mongolia Tax rates Turkey Restrictive labour regulations Singapore Insufficient capacity to innovate Hong Kong Inefficient government bureaucracy Malaysia Government instability Nepal Source: Global Competitiveness Report, 2013-14, World Economic Forum 94The Executive Survey, run by the World Economic Forum.

The government of Samoa began efforts to reform the delivery and effectiveness of aid and development finance during the 1990s. National development has been guided by a series of development strategies96 that form the foundation for more detailed sector strategies. These strategies are costed and encourage development partners to incorporate their cooperation within the relevant government strategy. Both the national and sector plans incorporate strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks that link expenditure to results over the medium term. The government has also developed strong analytical capacity to track progress and identify gaps and challenges. The strength of these country planning and monitoring systems has helped the Samoan government to lead its development agenda and encourage development partners to align their cooperation with the national vision. Development partners are closely engaged with the implementation of national plans. Quarterly donor-government meetings are held to align cooperation and ensure complementarity between partners. Donors also sit on sector steering committees, and the government\u2019s sector plans reflect the contributions of all donors engaged in each sector.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) donated a 5-metre dish antenna that enabled me to receive signals from com- munications satellites placed over the Indian Ocean. It was a crowd-puller for several weeks: every- one from cabinet ministers and civil servants to school children wanted to see pictures coming in from the skies. Today, television rules how Sri Lankans work, dine and socialise. And when an important cricket match is being broadcast live,I have to look hard to find any signs of life on the streets of Colombo. Even if the novelty of images from the skies has completely worn off, debates on their social and cultural impact continue. In the early days, I was often approached by people who were concerned about what satellite television might do to local cultures,traditions and values.Some of us who suffer from information overload find it difficult to imagine its even deadlier opposite: information starva- tion.

Every TV programme has some education content: the cathode ray tube (and now the plasma screen!) is a window on the world; indeed, on many worlds.Often it\u2019s a very murky window, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that, on balance, even bad TV is preferable to no TV at all. In the mid 1970s, I was associated with the world\u2019s first systematic attempt to transmit educa- tional television programming directly to villages.The Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) involved 2,400 villages in six Indian states,and used a leased American communications satel- lite to beam television programmes carrying information on family planning, crop production, healthy living and other practical matters that can raise the quality of life \u2013 and often save lives. Working with the indefatigable Dr Yash Pal and his dynamic team gave me valuable insights on how developments in communications can produce tangible benefits for large numbers of ordi- nary people. Soon after SITE ended, I wrote, \u201cOne of the most magical moments in Satyajit Ray\u2019s exquisite Pather Panchali is when the little boy Apu hears for the first time the aeolian music of the telegraph wires on the windy plain. Soon, those wires will have gone forever; but a new generation of Apus will be watching, wide-eyed, when the science of a later age draws down pictures from the sky \u2013 and opens up for all the children of India a window on the world.\u201d Those experiments with the \u2018schoolmaster satellite\u2019now seem to belong to a completely differ- ent age. Much has happened since, particularly in the 1990s when commercial satellite television proliferated, opening up fierce competition in the skies over India. Many millions of dishes have bloomed across the subcontinent, and tens of millions of modern-day Apus are now growing up taking satellite television, mobile phones and Internet for granted. But we have to acknowledge that the communications revolution has bypassed tens of millions of others in many parts of the world.We are reaching the point in our technological evolution when we can \u2013 and must \u2013 commit more time and resources to solving the problems of poverty, depriva- tion and inequality. I discussed some of these concerns while addressing the UN General Assembly 20 years ago, during the World Telecommunications Year 1983.I suggested that the \u2018A telephone in every village\u2019 would be one of the most effective social stimulants in history,because of its implications for health, weather forecasting, market information, social integration and human welfare. I added,\u201cEach new telephone installation would probably pay for itself, in hard cash, within a few months. I would like to see a cost-effectiveness study of rural telephone systems for the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. But the financial benefits, important though they are, might be insignifi- cant compared with the social ones.\u201d vi Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals When I spoke my mind from that famous podium in New York,I did not imagine how quickly my words would be illustrated by actual developments. Just as satellite television swept across the globe during the 1980s, the Internet spread rapidly in the 1990s.Virtually everything we wish to do in the field of communications is now technologically possible. The key limitations are financial, legal, social and political. In time, I am sure, most of these will also disappear, leaving us with only limitations imposed by our own morality. And making the right choices and investments is indeed a hard task.There is a danger that techno- logical tools can distort priorities and mesmerise decision-makers into believing that gadgets can fix all problems.A computer in every classroom is a noble goal \u2013 provided there is a physical classroom in the first place. A multimedia computer with Internet connectivity is of little use in a school with leaking roofs \u2013 or no roof at all.The top priorities in such cases are to have the basic infrastructure and adequate number of teachers \u2013 that highly under-rated,and all too often underpaid,multimedia resource. We must therefore take a few steps back from the digital hype and first try to bridge the \u2018Analogue Divide\u2019 (to coin a phrase) that has for so long affected the less endowed communities in developing countries (and even in some developed ones).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a41b3cb-df70-4ee1-b0b9-262b3b4498fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a41b3cb-df70-4ee1-b0b9-262b3b4498fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0ec0ed3d12bef3c9310ea0fa66d37f61014e73e9d0f136e0947891fe4b7e289"}, "2": {"node_id": "24a8dc06-03df-4b3b-b2f5-f543a0ceacb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef2e69e983ee353209e917a77a32ec50ff5948cd133326cf82676baf3d6d798b"}}, "hash": "6560b956b160d19166a098a74e8fef5e2e81e6b76345b44314898716a8282ec9", "text": "Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) should be part of the solution,not the only solution.

(This inspired British inventor Trevor Bailey to develop the wind-up radio). Our big challenge, therefore, is to get ICTs to solve real life problems without creating any new ones.In the early part of the last century,Mahatma Gandhi proposed a simple test for the effective- ness of any development activity: find out how the last man would be affected by it. We should adapt this as a test for ICTs in development: how will the last man, woman and child be reached, touched and transformed by these marvellous communication tools? This Regional Human Development Report is a pioneering attempt to examine how ICTs can be used effectively to bring about such development and social change.It is no coincidence that it cov- ers the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 home to the world\u2019s largest television audience, and where mobile phones and personal computers are among the fastest selling consumer electronic products.Using the United Nations\u2019eight Millennium Development Goals as a benchmark, the Report presents the experience of nine Asian countries. There is no single formula for success; each country has to define what works best within the range of options and technologies available. Such decisions and choices have to be made quickly and resolutely as the development needs are vast and urgent. The information age has been driven and dominated by technopreneurs \u2013 a small army of \u2018geeks\u2019who have reshaped our world faster than any political leader has ever done.And that was the easy part. As this Report shows, we now have to apply these technologies for saving lives, improv- ing livelihoods and lifting millions of people out of squalor, misery and suffering. In short, the time has come to move our focus from the geeks to the meek. Sir Arthur C. Clarke Colombo, Sri Lanka [A well known writer of science fiction, Sir Arthur C. Clarke has long advocated the appropriate use of information and communications technologies for development.He was the first to propose the concept of the geostationary communications satellite in 1945, and one of his short stories inspired the World Wide Web. He has lived in Sri Lanka since 1956 and was, until recently, Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa,Sri Lanka.] vii Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals Preface The Regional Human Development Report on Promoting ICT for Human Development: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals,is a first-time attempt to systematically assess the role and impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) on human development in Asia.Initiated joint- ly by UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) and Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Reports Initiative (APRI), the Report makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the potential and challenges of using ICTs to achieve human development goals. The Report covers nine countries in Asia: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,Thailand and Vietnam. This timely effort comes in the wake of an increasing global acceptance of ICT as a tool to fight poverty, especially in the developing world. Ambitious ICTs infrastructure initiatives and develop- ment strategies and programmes on ICT are being widely launched across Asia. While the advan- tages of ICT for development are enormous and rightly acknowledged, it has become equally imperative to recognise that benefits of ICTs are not evenly distributed. Many sections of societies in developing countries of Asia have been barely touched by the opportunities of the information age.It is this digital divide that needs to be urgently bridged today.The gap in opportunities occur- ring across and within countries due to differences in starting points, inaccessibility to technology and knowledge exchange, lack of infrastructure and inhibiting social and cultural factors, needs to be overcome.There is also the gap in relevant content that addresses the concerns of the worst off. This Regional HDR is a major step towards bringing this to the centre of the development debate. The Report\u2019s unique approach lies in its use of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to meas- ure and monitor the impact of ICTs on human development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf70cc51-4585-4ec6-8195-fa8b21967b96": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf70cc51-4585-4ec6-8195-fa8b21967b96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23c3b170e05dea176c974551677a103bcee8c4dba6051e8d46181e93594625b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "dced0ac2-81b2-44d5-88bc-e34068623061", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "270048037b2ddd079a3ca05d83bf3cfbddefe2a10ee6c86e2605ab1e08de69dd"}}, "hash": "d8efb2bd8bfa7761f4d9bf0506dad80c79353658072f3138e8d796011a7d81d9", "text": "Its comparative study across the nine countries in Asia highlights both qualitative and quantitative linkages between ICTs and human development and the channels through which the linkage effects occur.

Country-specific experiences, and cross-country comparisons capture the rich variety of ICT initiatives in the region, as well as their successes and failures. Conscious efforts are needed to level playing fields for harnessing the use of ICT for human development in the region. The possibilities of using ICT towards realizing MDGs are numerous.A future in the information and communications age that not only includes the poor,but also provides them with increasing oppor- tunities and choices for a better life, however, will not occur automatically.The role of governments will continue to be central in deployment and facilitation of ICT initiatives. Civil society groups are emerging as important stakeholders, particularly to complement the efforts of governments. The trend of deregulation of ICT industries is also increasing the role of industry in ICT.The challenge is to channel this for human development initiatives. Effective partnerships among stakeholders, as the Report emphasizes, is also key to any successful ICT initiative towards human development.ICT is only a tool.The success of harnessing this tool effectively is dependent on the commitment of the stakeholders to the realization of the MDGs. The battle for poverty and MDGs will be won or lost in parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This Report, therefore, is a timely analysis on the potentials of ICT as a tool and the role it can play in achieving these goals and enhancing human development. Hafiz A.

growth-inducing effects of ICT use can indeed be substantial MDGs Developing countries the world over have made the widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) a central feature of their development agenda. To that end, they have devised policies aimed at pro- moting the use of information technology for development; radically altered their communi- cations polices; invested massively in strength- ening and extending their ICT infrastructure; and launched numerous e-governance initia- tives. Conviction that ICT use can accelerate the pace and improve the quality of development is strong. The United Nations (UN) too sets great store by these technologies. The UN ICT Task Force (2003) had concluded that ICTs can act as a human development enabler, and have the potential to enhance the contribution of other polices aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set by the September 2000 Millennium Summit. ICTs, wisely deployed, can potentially impact almost every sector,making development budgets,pri- vate sector investments and commitments from development partners go that much further in terms of cost effectiveness, impact and reach. This is bound to increase the effectiveness of new and more responsive solutions in the fields of health, education and related MDG focus areas. Even though in some areas the first-order causal relations between ICT use and the real- ization of the MDGs is limited, the growth- inducing effects of ICT use can indeed be substantial. And inasmuch as increases in per capita income contribute to human develop- ment, the realization of the MDGs is furthered. However, it must be recognized that the poten- tial of ICTs and the promise they hold for devel- oping countries can, at times, be exaggerated. The use of ICTs for development between 1995 and 1997 was examined by the Working Group on IT and Development of the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development.1 It noted that despite the posi- tive impacts experienced in industrialized coun- tries and certain sectors of many developing nations,evidence showed that there were many people, especially in the least developed coun- tries, whose lives had been barely touched by ICTs. There were also many whose lives were being negatively affected by their exclusion from the global information society or by the social or economic dislocations that can accom- pany the introduction and diffusion of these technologies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "938c6b27-07da-4cd1-86be-013f2a1cae72": {"__data__": {"id_": "938c6b27-07da-4cd1-86be-013f2a1cae72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53cb9d036ad75ac1d937041785a47f48fa867dfdee02b0a2d25389c0aeb0a751"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c6cc39a-80f4-4501-9a97-d80bdc542bb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19612c4cc597022bd1279e8a7665b96c0207077f9f995d4f25d7f7dff07b5d06"}}, "hash": "bb76f4ea55d32e5ab83adc2bed89e8f8ff1a7e95e5b53f7ddca965e42348f4e2", "text": "This Regional Human Development Report (RHDR) on Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals is an attempt to holistically assess the role that ICTs can play in advancing human development in Asia.

According to one definition2 \u201cICTs are basically information-handling tools \u2013 a varied set of goods, applications and services that are used to produce, store, process, distribute and exchange information. They include the \u2018old\u2019 ICTs of radio, television and telephone, and the \u2018new\u2019 ICTs of computers, satellite and wireless technology and the Internet.\u201d More specifically, the division between old and new technologies in the broad area of ICT can be seen as that between those based on analogue devices and on digital devices (Box 1). Seen in this way, it should be clear that there is a new digital com- ponent even to technologies such as the radio, television and telephone. Technology being digital has important impli- cations. In particular, it permits a greater degree of interactivity and has superior multimedia capabilities, thereby substantially enhancing communication possibilities. Moreover, devel- opments in digital technology have significantly reduced costs of data storage,manipulation and \u201cICTs are basically information-handling tools \u2013 a varied set of goods, applications and services that are used to produce, store, process, distribute and exchange information. . . .\u201d Analogue and digital are alternative means of capturing and representing events and phenomena. The principal difference between them is that while analogue representations are continuous, digital representations consist of discrete and discontinuous data or events. An example conventionally used to illustrate this is the difference between digital and analogue watches. Digital watches go from one value to the next without displaying all intermediate values. In effect, they display only a finite number of times of the day. In contrast, analogue watches, with hands that move continuously around the clock face, not only touch the numbers one through 12, but also the infinite number of points in between. However, there is no limit to how accurate you can make digital technology.For example,if you wanted your clock to display time in 100ths of a minute, you could do that. Computers are digital machines because, at their most basic level, they can distinguish between just two values, 0 and 1, or off and on. As opposed to this, analogue devices are those in which continuously variable physical quantities such as electrical potential, fluid pressure or mechani- cal motion are represented in a way analogous to the corresponding quantities in the problem to be solved.1 \u201cBits have always been the underlying particle of digital computing, but over the past 25 years we have greatly expanded our binary vocabulary to include much more than just numbers.We have been able to digitize more and more types of information, like audio and video, rendering them into a similar reduction of 1s and 0s\u201d.2 A digital photograph,for instance,consists of an array of dots that are either black or white.From afar, the viewer does not see the individual dots (the digital form), but only lines and shading which appear to be continuous.Although digital representations approximate analogue events, they are useful because they are relatively easy to store and can be manipulated electronically. Digital representation often involves converting analogue to digital, and back again.The music on a compact disc itself exists in an analogue form, as waves in the air. These sounds are then translated into a digital form that is encoded onto the disk. When you play a compact disc, the CD player reads the digital data, translates the data back into a voltage wave that approximates the original analogue waveform, and sends it to the amplifier and eventually the speakers. There are many advantages associated with digital representation. A bit has no size or weight. It gives us an accurate way to represent data, an easy way to mechanically store and manipulate that data, and it can travel at the speed of light.Two other advantages of digital technology are: the representation does not degrade over time and the digitized information can often be compressed.3 Box 1 Digital vs. Analogue 3 Overview transmission, while increasing the potential of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d4affea-3e7a-408c-a48a-4cae6b8656fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d4affea-3e7a-408c-a48a-4cae6b8656fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f3550179039b12116b7362205a617c1e6b603641803035b9824866636415f82"}}, "hash": "5f3550179039b12116b7362205a617c1e6b603641803035b9824866636415f82", "text": "technology. This Report broadly follows UNDP\u2019s definition and, while accommodating both the roles of old and new technologies, focuses on the role of digital technologies. This is partly because older technologies make fewer demands on user skills and are considered to be \u2018skill independent\u2019, while newer technologies are far more \u2018skill depend- ent\u2019. Users need more education or training in their use, especially to exploit the potential of interactivity. The skill dependence associated with new technologies makes their diffusion among disadvantaged sections more difficult, necessitating a coherent policy environment complemented by effective partnerships between public and private sectors and civil society. Since our concern here is with the use of ICTs for advancing human development,such diffu- sion is indeed crucial. Despite a long record of economic growth and improvement in living standards across the globe, the incidence of such development has been extremely uneven. Large parts of the developing world are still characterized by the persistence of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, ill-health and disease, and illiteracy and unequal access to skills and knowledge. Of the 4.9 billion peo- ple in developing countries, in 2000 around 1.1 billion lived on less than US$ 1 a day (1993 pur- chasing power parity (PPP)\u2020 US$), more than 950 million were illiterate, 1.2 billion lacked access to an improved water source, and 2.7 billion lacked access to basic sanitation. Nearly 104 million boys and girls in the primary school age were out of school, while 11 million children under age five died each year from predictable causes \u2013 equivalent to more than 30,000 children a day.3 The growing consensus on the need to urgent- ly deal with each of these forms of deprivation stems from the pressure to improve social indi- cators or the belief that an education, good health and a reasonable livelihood for all are justifiable ends in themselves. It is also a recog- nition that progress on each front has implica- tions for other areas and that holistic human development is, in the final analysis, a prerequi- site for sustainable growth. In Asia too the record of growth and human development has been mixed. The region is home to the erstwhile miracle countries, which had experienced dramatic growth rates over a long period prior to the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Many have also recovered from the crisis since and are recording creditable rates of growth. Meanwhile, China continues with its more than two-decade long boom and India is showing signs of delivering sustained high rates of growth. The two most populous nations of the region are now leading the Asian economic drive. Not surprisingly, human development mapping in Asia has reflected overall progress over the last two decades. Yet in many countries in Asia and among sections of the population even in the relatively better-off countries, human development continues to pose a significant challenge,putting a blemish on otherwise com- mendable achievements. The persistence of income poverty, hunger, low levels of adult lite- racy, preventable diseases and poor healthcare as well as significant gender inequalities reiter- ates the need to place human development at the core of national and international develop- ment agendas. However,it has been evident for some time now that collective action on a global scale is crucial when choosing to deal with the alarming levels of poverty, hunger and deprivation. Commitment to such collective action was won at the historic UN Millennium Summit held in September 2000, where Member States of the UN agreed to work together to eradicate pover- ty, promote human dignity and equality, and achieve peace, democracy and environmental sustainability. The Millennium Declaration issued at this Summit demonstrates the com- mitment of world leaders to collectively work towards a global partnership for improving the human condition. A concrete contribution of the Declaration was the global consensus on the eight specifically identified MDGs to the realization of which 191 UN Member States have pledged themselves. The Goals are time-bound, most of which are to be achieved by the year 2015,taking 1990 as the base year (Box 2).Associated with each MDG are Besides analysing the extent of and the constraints to ICT diffusion, this Report studies the specific ways in which the technology has been deployed in efforts that can contribute to realizing the MDGs in different areas \u2020 A method of measuring the relative purchasing power of different countries\u2019 currencies over the same type of goods and services. 4 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals specific targets, totalling 18, to be monitored through 48 specific indicators (Appendix 1).

Given this focused agenda, this Report uses the MDGs as the framework to analyse the way in which ICTs can be harnessed to promote human development. Besides analysing the extent of and the constraints to ICT diffusion, it studies specific ways in which the technology has been deployed in efforts that can contribute to realiz- ing the MDGs in different areas. Many of these applications are in the nature of pilot projects \u2013 experimental in character, small in scale and uncertain in terms of sustainability. Yet they provide the material to assess the role that ICTs can play as well as the models that,if successful, need to be scaled up. The Asian region is particularly well placed to harness and strategically deploy ICTs for devel- opment as it is home to some of the fastest growing ICT markets,and has the fastest growth of ICT industries in the world.However,the digi- tal divide, both between Asian countries and within them, reveals the enormous disparities in ICT access, connectivity and skills.This divide can be a major hurdle in the effective application of ICTs for over- coming the human development chal- lenge. Teams of experts commissioned exclu- sively for this project prepared nine detailed country studies on the theme (Table 1). The nine countries \u2013 China,4 India,5 Indonesia,6 Malaysia,7 Mongolia,8 Pakistan,9 Sri Lanka,10 Thailand11 and Vietnam12 \u2013 are spread over the three distinct sub-regions of South Asia,South East Asia and East Asia,pro- viding a rich and diverse canvas. Each country study provides extensive qualitative documen- tation on the specific uses of ICTs across the MDGs for promoting human development.\u2020 Since this Report is based on an examination of such projects in a wide variety of contexts in Asia,it has a rich material base on which to build its arguments and its policy suggestions. A separate statistical exercise, aimed at identify- ing key ICT indicators relevant to and available for Asia, was undertaken to complement the country studies. Indicators were selected with the intention of collating such data on ICT use and diffusion as could help in formulating and computing composite aggregate indices that quantitatively capture the role of ICTs in human development in individual countries. The find- ings of the RHDR are thus informed by an inter- esting combination of a qualitative analysis from the nine countries and a quantitative exploration.

Even though Asia\u2019s record is better than average for developing countries as a group, there are substantial divergences between Asian countries and within each of them.This has implications for the use of ICT for advancing human development and realizing the MDGs. While, on the one hand, the human development shortfall and the potential for using ICTs to ensure progress encourages the promotion of the technology as a tool for human development, the inequities that a low level of human development entails raises the possibility that ICT use could be accompanied by a widening digital divide, on the other. The need for a nuanced policy stance to deal with these complexities is obvious.

This helps define the distance that remains to be travelled to real- ize goals in each of the areas, the areas in which progress is being made, and those regions and areas in which there are signs of stagnation and reversal. On that basis, the significance of differ- ent kinds of experiments with the use of ICT4D can be judged. Chapter 3 offers a detailed discussion on the ways in which the technology can be used to facilitate human development advance.It identi- fies the different possible uses of the technology in specific areas of human development and assesses its potential as an instrument to break down barriers to knowledge creation, dissemi- nation,participation,and economic opportunity. Chapter 4 assesses the status of ICT diffusion in Asia in terms of the extent of cross-country and intra-country horizontal and vertical diffusion.It notes that while there is evidence of rapid pen- etration of ICTs, albeit from a low base, the level of penetration and the regional spread of the technology are still limited in many countries. Thus, there are substantial variations in the rate of increase of ICT expenditure across the nine countries chosen for study,though the variation is lower in terms of the level of ICT expenditure relative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The latter figure does suggest a tendency towards some degree of convergence within the Asian region as all countries attempt to exploit the benefits of the technology. Overall, however, from the point of view of the use of the tech- nology for human development purposes, its degree of penetration is uneven and far from satisfactory. Chapter 5 reports an exercise that aims to iden- tify, collate and consolidate evidence of a kind that permits an assessment of the impact of ICT on human development. Towards that end, it is necessary not only to identify indicators of the status of ICT use, but also to analyse the nature of the interdependencies between indicators of ICT development and those reflecting human development concerns of the kind captured by the MDGs. The chapter attempts to do this by using empirical evidence from the nine Asian countries to construct a composite index on the use of ICT for development.The resulting indices present the relative position of the nine coun- tries in terms of development of ICT for the attainment of the MDGs. By the late 1990s, all nine Asian countries had put policy frameworks in place, seeking to accelerate the pace of ICT development. Chapter 6 aims to examine the extent to which these frameworks are sensitive to human devel- opment concerns and the ways in which they implicitly seek to realize the MDGs by promot- ing ICT use.The evidence suggests that as Asian nations progressed, so did their understanding of using ICTs for human development. The zeal to devise an appropriate policy framework was, therefore, also accompanied by a tendency to place human development concerns at the heart of each nation\u2019s ICT regulatory framework. The experiences of the countries chosen for special study as the basis of this Report suggest that, at a macro-level, ICT policy is indeed sensi- tive to human development concerns and seeks to use the technology in partnership with Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), donors and the private sector. What needs to be examined, therefore, is the degree to which this economy-wide commitment is being translated into specific projects that advance specific MDGs. Chapters 7 to 12 make an effort to arrive at such an assessment in each MDG area by examining, in some detail, a selected set of experiments to use ICTs for development in the nine countries The experiences of the countries chosen for special study as the basis of this Report suggest that, at a macro-level, ICT policy is indeed sensitive to human development concerns and seeks to use the technology in partnership with NGOs, donors and the private sector 6 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals chosen for special study.While the experiments are most often in the nature of pilot projects and conclusions regarding their financial viabil- ity and sustainability cannot yet be drawn, this analysis does strengthen the view that the potential of the technology is immense and that there are efforts underway to exploit that potential.

Human development in Asia: milestones and challenges Human development is defined as the process of enhancing the capabilities of individuals so as to expand their choices to live the kind of lives they value MDGs C h a p t e r 1 Human development is defined as the process of enhancing the capabilities of individuals so as to expand their choices to live the kind of lives they value. While this does not preclude the pursuit of economic growth as a major goal of policy, it does require treating the quality of life of people as the ultimate concern, and pro- duction and prosperity as a means to that end.1 As was made clear in the introductory state- ment to UNDP\u2019s first Human Development Report released in 1990: \u201cPeople are the real wealth of a nation.The basic objective of devel- opment is to create an enabling environment for people to enjoy long, healthy and creative lives.\u201d When stated in this form, the concept remains wide in scope and amenable to vari- able interpretation. However, a broad agree- ment on some aspects of human develop- ment has evolved over time. The discussion has also yielded a range of indicators and indices that capture, in summary form, specif- ic aspects of both the state of people\u2019s capa- bilities and the quality of their lives. However, the concept of human development requires a degree of simultaneous advance in all direc- tions. This is because the notion that improvements in various social indicators are inter-linked is implicit in human develop- ment as a concept. Literacy and education are, for example, of intrinsic importance but also of immense instrumental significance in social development. Education, particularly female education, has a fundamental influ- ence on attitudes to health, on health-seek- ing behaviour and therefore on health status. Similarly, there is evidence of a strong direct correlation between life expectancy and liter- acy, and an inverse relationship between infant and child mortality and the level of maternal schooling. This is because, at given levels of income, schooling increases the abil- ity to improve nutrition; it contributes to the ability to initiate earlier and more effective diagnoses of illness, and to hygiene and the prevention of illness. Advancing inter-linked goals of this kind sub- stantially increases people\u2019s capabilities, enhances the choices that they have, and per- mits them to participate in, contribute to and benefit from the process of development. This is, however, not to say that human development is just another term for social development. It is, in fact, \u201ca holistic paradigm embracing both ends and means, both productivity and equity, both economic and social development, both material goods and human welfare\u201d.2 The principal concern of this Report is to exam- ine how the use of ICTs can influence the effort to improve specific indicators of social develop- ment and thereby accelerate the pace of human development advance. The focus on ICTs is imperative because of their tremendous potential to increase productivity,expand communication possibilities, build networks, ensure inclusion and facilitate delivery of services.This makes the technology an exceptional tool to enable human development policies, especially by enabling greater access to education and knowledge, health services and better liveli- hood opportunities in rural areas where the majority of the population lives. Human development advance: some evidence While the decade of the 1990s was marked by significant progress in terms of identified human development indicators across the 9 10 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals world including the Asian region, it was also a decade that appears to be characterized by a setback in human development advance.Given changes in methodology and revisions of data by international source agencies, there are problems associated with comparing changes in the Human Development Index (HDI) values over time.But if such a comparison is made,the global Human Development Report 2003 noted, it appears that HDI values had fallen in that year in 21 out of a sample of 113 countries with complete data. It also noted that while the 1980s had seen the HDI value decline in four countries, the figure rose to 15 during the 1990s. Factors explaining these declines varied, being attributable to lower incomes and failed economic growth in some countries or to the spread of HIV/AIDS, which lowered life expectancy, in others. However, the Asian region \u2013 both South Asia,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7e8e0c8-49dc-43b0-8c1f-d64fd85d3a95": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7e8e0c8-49dc-43b0-8c1f-d64fd85d3a95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe93ff73bf3c2a1ed1e328020ac9dfd191ce25eda20836f358bdfb006334002d"}}, "hash": "fe93ff73bf3c2a1ed1e328020ac9dfd191ce25eda20836f358bdfb006334002d", "text": "and East Asia and the Pacific \u2013 was character- ized by improvements in HDI values over 1990- 2002. This was in keeping with the overall trend in developing countries, but contrary to the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa where reversals were observed in a significant num- ber of countries (Table 1.1).Further,as Table 1.2 indicates, both in terms of the growth of per capita incomes and the pace of reduction of poverty, East Asia and the Pacific, and South Asia performed much better than other regions of the developing world during the 1990s. In fact, the evidence suggests that the incidence of poverty increased in all regions other than Asia. The average of the values of the HDI in the nine countries taken up for study in this Report is also higher than elsewhere in the developing world. With the exception of Pakistan, all countries belong to the medium human development cat- egory, though Malaysia is close to breaking into the high human development category. This points to the considerable differences between these countries, reflected in a variation in human development values from 0.497 to 0.793,and HDI ranks from 59 to 142 (Table 1.3). However, most countries are better than average performers on the human development front when compared with other developing countries. Comparing the HDI values for the year 2002 for the nine countries with those calculated for all developing countries put together,only India and Pakistan have a value lower than the developing-country average. In fact, China, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka record figures that are higher than even the aver- age HDI value for the world as a whole.The coun- try-specific human development indices also indicate that,in keeping with the overall situation in Asia,human development indices point to con- tinuous progress over the past two decades or more in all nine countries. Despite the positive picture the evidence (Table 1.3) paints with regard to Asia, there is ample cause for concern. The first and obvious cause is the fact that close to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor live in the Asia-Pacific region, with more than 693 million people living on less than US$ 1 a day in 2000. The second problem is that the record of poverty reduction across the region has been uneven. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Survey of the Asia Pacific 2002 argued:\u201cThe incidence of extreme poverty in East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific declined rapidly during the 1990s, from 28 to 15 per cent between 1990 and 1998. On this trend-line basis and given sustained efforts, the goal of halving poverty between 1990 and 2015 would be within reach in East Asia and South East Asia.

Eastern Europe and Central Asia had very low poverty rates in the pre-transition period.

Table 1.3 Trends in the HDI from 1975 to 2002 12 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals declined during the 1990s. But even here it was true that per capita incomes were increasing in absolute terms. If, despite this, poverty was increasing everywhere excepting in East and South East Asia, it must be true that inequality must have been increasing during these years. Even in China and India, critics argue, the data properly interpreted point not just to an overesti- mation of the poverty decline, but also to an increase in income inequality that is either damp- ening the pace or reversing the trend of poverty decline more recently.\u2020 Given the role of these two populous countries in deciding global poverty trends,urgent action is obviously necessary. Such controversies reflect the need to examine human development trends at the national level and make cross-country comparisons to yield a regional perspective.This Report, based on nine country studies, seeks to achieve precisely that. The experiences of these countries reflect con- siderable diversity,and permit the exploration of a variety of factors that constrain or facilitate human development advance.It must be noted, however, that divergences in human develop- ment within the Asia-Pacific region as a whole are far greater than that between the nine coun- tries chosen in this Report for special study, to illustrate and analyse the role that ICT can play in advancing human development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}:

(2004) 13 Human development in Asia: milestones and challenges primary, secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio, and GDP per capita. While Malaysia, Sri Lanka and China have relatively high values for life expectancy at birth (over 70 years,which was much higher than the world average of 66.9 years), Mongolia, India and Pakistan fall short of these countries by 10 years with a far lower life expectancy of just over 60 years (Table 1.4). The cross-country comparison also reveals cer- tain features of relevance to the use and role of ICTs in advancing human development.Thus, in keeping with the perspective underlying the human development framework, it is clear that a country\u2019s performance in terms of the HDI is not determined solely by its GDP. Some coun- tries, especially Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Mongolia, have recorded a much better per- formance in human development terms than appears warranted by their GDP levels relative to the other countries (Figure 1.1). Hence, if factors contributing to human development advance are facilitated by the enabling environ- ment that the use of ICTs creates, investing in IT to design such an environment can help advance human development even if GDP growth does not keep pace with the diffusion of ICT. In this context, the fact that countries such as India and Pakistan,which have the lowest HDI value among the countries in the nine-country sample, record high ranks for certain ICT devel- opment indices (see Chapter 5) is heartening. That having been said, we should be careful not to extrapolate this argument too far. Whether this ICT development can be sustained and translated into faster human development depends on factors that constitute components of the HDI. Given the skill-dependence of the technology, an index of significance for ICT application and use is that relating to education and literacy. Comparing adult literacy rates, defined as the percentage of literate people aged 15 years and above, across the nine coun- tries, shows that the differences are quite marked (Table 1.4). In 2002, while five of the nine countries (China, Mongolia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Vietnam) recorded literacy rates in excess of 90 per cent and two others (Indonesia and Malaysia) above 85 per cent, Pakistan recorded the lowest rate at 41.5 per cent and India figured second last with 61.3 per cent.

To the extent that the better-endowed sections are more capable of taking advantage of the new technology, inequalities will only increase. Finally, the countries being considered are also characterized by stark differences in GDP per capita (measured in terms of PPP US$). A higher per capita income makes it easier to mobilize resources and finance investment in not just basic infrastructure such as roads and electricity, but also in specialized ICT-related infrastructure. Malaysia has a high GDP per capita of US$ 9,120, which is even higher than the world GDP per capita figure of US$ 7,804, followed by Thailand\u2019s figure of US$ 7,010.China comes next with a much lower US$ 4,580 to be followed by Sri Lanka (US$ 3,570),Indonesia (US$ 3,230) and India (US$ 2,670). Finally, Vietnam, Pakistan and Mongolia constitute the lower end with GDP per capita at or below US$ 2,300. Human deprivation indicators The differential capabilities that stem from these factors can have significant implications for the effectiveness of ICT as an enabling instrument for advancing human develop- ment and realizing the MDGs, because of the strong relationship between human develop- ment indicators and specific indicators of dep- rivation (Table 1.5). Malaysia and Thailand, the top two performers among the nine in terms of the HDI,have the lowest incidence of poverty (less than 2 per cent) measured as the propor- tion of the population living below the income poverty line of US$ 1 per day. India records the highest incidence (34.7 per cent), followed by Vietnam (17.7 per cent), China (16.6 per cent), Mongolia (13.9 per cent), and Pakistan (13.4 per cent). If one were to consider the data on the proba- bility at birth of people not surviving to the age of 40, there is some correlation between this data and a country\u2019s HDI ranking. Countries with less than 10 per cent of their population in the 2000-05 cohort who will not live to the age of 40 are Malaysia (4.2 per cent), Sri Lanka (5.1 per cent) and China (7.1 per cent). Pakistan (17.8 per cent), India (15.3 per cent) and Mongolia (13.0 per cent) perform rel- atively poorly on this score. Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia constitute the medium per- formers on this index, with around 10 per cent of their population not likely to live till the age of 40. It should be noted, however, that Thailand was ranked second in terms of HDI among the nine countries considered. Finally, India and Pakistan perform poorly in respect of malnutrition, with the percentage of children under five years of age who are under- weight for age placed at 47 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively. Indices of this kind enter the UNDP\u2019s Human Poverty Index (denoted as HPI-1 for developing countries) (Table 1.5).Of the nine countries covered in this Report, the HPI-1 rank for Malaysia is not available.Of the rest,Thailand and China come out on top,with ranks of 22 and 24 out of 95 countries. They are followed by Indonesia (35), Sri Lanka (36), Mongolia (38) and Vietnam (41), with almost successive ranks according to this scale. India, ranked 48, and Pakistan, ranked at a distant 71 as per the HPI-1, are again the laggards in the fight against deprivation. The gender divide The other danger is that rapid ICT diffusion and development,if unaccompanied by appropriate policies, could widen the digital divide leading to different degrees of marginalization. Inadequate human development also implies a higher degree of discrimination against particu- lar sections, such as women and indigenous populations. Thus, human development advance cannot be registered without address- ing such divides. And as long as they remain unaddressed, any increase in the application and use of ICTs would be accompanied by a worsening of the digital divide as well. Inadequate human development also implies a higher degree of discrimination against particular sections, such as women and indigenous populations. Thus, human development advance cannot be registered without addressing such divides 15 Human development in Asia: milestones and challenges Women are key agents of development and their equal participation in decision-making processes is an essential precondition for equi- table and holistic development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a023c05b-6072-4be2-93c4-6434d997dd14": {"__data__": {"id_": "a023c05b-6072-4be2-93c4-6434d997dd14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b0e171482e272bd1045d5a2a8f4bbf52f43aa80f96ba46cf9eb8cc5ef2c1c23"}, "2": {"node_id": "400f069c-2116-40e6-b1ce-c97f64a81b9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3909810f7174d1aa7832b0941c9ff87f943771b64a7b86e25eefd0921d0be386"}}, "hash": "c2803279ae7536de5f43fd4c90a2675ed5afc52aca6a4e4942ed6a7151d09f2b", "text": "Unfortunately, wide gender gaps remain a weak aspect of human development in Asia.

Similarly,a comparison of male and female litera- cy rates reveals a dismal situation in Pakistan and India,with high male-female gaps.In Pakistan the female literacy rate is only 28.5 per cent,which is 24.9 percentage points below the male literacy rate.In no country covered does the female liter- acy rate exceed the male literacy rate,although in Mongolia the male-female gap is only 0.5 of a percentage point. The combined school enrol- ment ratio also reveals significant male-female gaps, especially in India (14 percentage points), followed by Pakistan and Mongolia (12 percent- age points).It should,however,be noted that the combined enrolment ratio for females exceeds the male ratio in Mongolia, which perhaps reflects the effect of privatization of ownership of animals that results in male children being made responsible for herding.

Table 1.7 Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and indicators Among the principal contributions of the declaration adopted at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in September 2000 was the delineation of a set of goals and time-bound targets that provide that much-needed focus to accelerate progress towards the overall objective The most basic needs for human development are living a long and healthy life, being educat- ed, having a decent standard of living and enjoying political and civil freedoms to partici- pate in the life of one\u2019s community. All of these requirements were recognized by the Member Countries of the UN, when they adopted the Millennium Declaration, which defined a set of Millennium Development Goals and correspon- ding targets. The human development concept is, no doubt, much wider in scope than can be captured by the MDGs, but there are strong links between the two (Box 2.1). The three key dimensions of human development that are captured by HDI, namely a decent standard of living, education and health (for which longevity is a proxy), are entirely consistent with Goals 1 to 7, which focus on eradication of poverty and hunger,and on improving healthcare and education. Progress on Goal 3, which focuses on gender equality and empowerment, is captured by gender-related indices, developed as supple- mentary indices for human development meas- urement. Thus, while the human development approach has a broad thrust that advocates expansion of human choices,the MDGs are con- structed as goals and targets that provide a use- ful framework to monitor progress as well as build and widen the constituency for human development. The MDG targets cover a majority of the most critical development challenges. These include a wide range of interrelated issues each of which cannot be addressed in isolation. Apart from the eradication of poverty and hunger,the targets deal with education (achieving universal primary education), healthcare (eradicating major diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria as well as reducing child mortality and improving maternal health), gender equality and empow- erment of women, environmental sustainability and global partnerships for development. From the point of view of this Report, which is concerned with the use of ICTs to advance the human development agenda, the MDGs are a useful point of departure. Any effort to deploy ICTs for human development must specify the problem to be dealt with, assess the infrastruc- ture and hardware requirements, develop appropriate software and make the necessary institutional/organizational adjustments. This requires a clear identification of the task at hand in each specific context. The goals and targets prescribed under the MDGs spell out the human development agenda in a form that is appropriate to examining the ways in which ICTs can and have been deployed to realize this agenda. Given these features of the MDGs and the global consensus around them, this Report specifically explores how ICTs can serve as an instrument to provide an enabling environment for realizing those goals and targets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2200017a-6259-4340-96ec-6420d01df595": {"__data__": {"id_": "2200017a-6259-4340-96ec-6420d01df595", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "560a63de79de822cff98c64df8c6eb7e30acc0646bdee92ce810820e01b1265e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a9db79d-f5e9-40c5-bd64-b9bcbe4bae5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0adf44f9615509d2cc02ed6f074ac85dd9fbcc6e4034dfd2d67ba7bb547def7e"}}, "hash": "71c01318524e77b061c964eabd015995ee89735360e5903dc0e6a374899772aa", "text": "Even in Asia, which, as we have seen, is a better performer on average in terms of the HDI and where many nations are ahead or on track in realizing the MDGs, a number of countries have a long distance to travel if those goals are to be attained.

These assessments that have tracked the per- formance of countries in terms of MDG progress clearly show that there are remarkable dispari- ties between and within regions, with human development reversals seen in some cases in sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS. Even in countries where the record 21 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals MDGs C h a p t e r 2 22 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals has been good on average, there are specific areas of poor performance that are cause for concern. Thus even though most Asian coun- tries,including some of the poorest countries of South Asia, show advances, the importance of sustaining the effort to realize some or all of the MDGs remains. The findings of this and many similar studies highlight the difficulties faced by most regions/countries, when they seek to register all-round progress while trying to attain their MDG targets. East Asia and the Pacific, on the whole, has made remarkable progress in its attempt to halve income poverty and is well on track towards the goals of reducing child hunger and achieving universal primary educa- tion. However, at its current rate of progress, it will still not be able to meet the MDG targets for gender equality, reducing child mortality and providing sustainable access to improved water sources and sanitation by the year 2015. South Asia needs to make significant progress in almost all areas if it is to achieve its MDG targets.While official figures suggest that India has made significant progress towards reduc- ing income poverty, according to a ESCAP/ UNDP study on the MDGs and poverty reduc- tion,1 the pace of poverty reduction has been much slower in the other countries in the region. Thus success in halving the number of people who live on less than US$ 1 a day by the year 2015 is not assured. Further, the region lags far behind in the reduction of hunger and will be able to reach its target in this area only after 2100. South Asia is \u2018on track\u2019 for only two indicators \u2013 reducing poverty and providing sustainable access to improved water sources. At its current rate of progress, South Asia will fail to reach the other goals by 2015; for exam- ple, the goals of achieving universal primary education, gender equality and reducing child mortality are expected to be reached long after 2020. These differences were noted by the ESCAP/UNDP study, which points out that this region is characterized by considerable differ- ences in achievement across countries. The report found that a few countries would meet all goals and even surpass them. On the other hand, there would be some which would meet none of the goals. The majority, however, were expected to fall in between, meeting some goals not others. The nine country studies on which this Report is based highlight these differences across coun- tries.While Malaysia has completed its immedi- This Report specifically explores how ICTs can serve as an instrument or provide an enabling environment for realizing the Goals and targets Key capabilities for human development Living a long and healthy life Being educated Having a decent standard of living Enjoying political and civil freedom to participate in the community life Essential conditions for human development Environmental sustainability Equity \u2013 especially gender equity Enabling global economic environment Box 2.1 Relationship between human development capabilities and the MDGs Corresponding Millennium Development Goals Goals 4, 5 and 6: Reducing child mortality, improving maternal health and combating major diseases Goals 2 and 3: Achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality (espe- cially in education) and empowering women Goal 1: Reducing poverty and hunger Not a Goal but an important global objective included in the Millennium Declaration Corresponding Millennium Development Goals Goal 7: Ensuring environmental sustainability Goal 3: Promoting gender equality and empow- ering women Goal 8: Strengthening partnership between rich and poor countries Source: UNDP Human Development Report, 2003, p. 28 23 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals ate tasks on many fronts, Pakistan and India tend to lag behind in a wide range of areas.

This has been fast in Vietnam, raising hopes of success by target date 2015, but it has been much slower, and in some areas almost non-existent, in Pakistan and India. In almost all countries, slow progress in many MDG areas is the result of the inadequate spread of advances in the relevant area to all its regions.

A much-noted feature of ICTs is that, besides directly enhanc- ing productivity in diverse activities from pro- duction to service provision, they substantially increase the reach of individuals, organizations and governments at extremely low costs. This makes the task of bridging the regional divide, especially that between well-endowed urban areas and relatively remote locations,that much easier.However,the ability to exploit that poten- tial of ICTs rests on an adequate spread of the relevant infrastructure. If investment in the req- uisite infrastructure is inadequate or unevenly distributed across space and segments of the population, the introduction of ICTs could aggravate existing divides. Performance varied across the Goals as well.It is useful, therefore, to follow progress as per each Goal for the nine countries covered by this Report, as a prelude to assessing the role that ICTs can play in this area. A Goal-wise assess- ment of progress towards the MDG targets is also a useful way of identifying the less-noticed bottlenecks to human development advance in the region.\u2020 Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger This Goal relates to the most basic capability that people must have,which is enough income for subsistence and access to sufficient food to ensure the minimum nutritional intake. The principal targets are to halve,between 1990 and 2015,the proportion of people whose income is less than US$ 1 a day and those living in hunger. While there are many problems with the data, the evidence points to considerable success in Asia and the Pacific in the effort to reduce income poverty. Over the 1990s, countries of the region as a whole are estimated to have reduced the incidence of income poverty from 34 to 24 per cent.2 Although this left an estimat- ed 768 million people in the region living on less than US$ 1 a day, it represented striking progress.3 If this trend continues, realizing the Goal of halving poverty to 17 per cent by 2015 should not be difficult. Progress appears to have been particularly remarkable in the case of the most populous countries of the region, which are also home to the largest share of the world\u2019s poor.

While using a standard international poverty line of US$ 1 per day yields a substantially greater absolute number of poor people, the trend in reduction of poverty is still impressive. Even in India, the official National Sample Survey Organization\u2019s (NSSO\u2019s) 55th Round sur- vey results relating to 1999-2000 point to a sub- stantial decline in poverty in comparison with 1993-94. The figures indicate that poverty declined by 10 percentage-points, from 35.97 per cent to 26.10 per cent between 1993-94 and 1999-2000. This was not only much larger than the 2.9 percentage-points reduction during the previous five-year period from 38.9 per cent in 1987-88 to 36 per cent in 1993-94, but also meant that while the number of poor had increased from 307 million in 1987-88 to 320 million in 1993-94, that number had fallen sharply to 260 million by 1999-2000. However,the 55th Round,rather than leading to unanimous recognition of the major gains reg- istered on the poverty reduction front, has led to controversy with some arguing that a change in methodology adopted in that Round had substantially contaminated the data. According to Abhijit Sen4: \u201cAlthough it is now the official position that poverty declined very substantial- ly between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, this is a claim which is vitiated by serious problems of comparability. Different recall periods were used in the 50th (1993-94) and 55th (1999- 2000) Rounds of the National Sample Survey and this has led to two sources of non-compa- rability. First, the 55th Round used only a 365 days recall for clothing,footwear,durable goods, education and institutional medical care, whereas the available 50th Round results for these items are by a 30 days recall. Secondly, while estimates of consumption of food, paan, tobacco and intoxicants had been collected using only a 30 days recall period in the 50th Round, all respondents were asked both the 30 days and 7 days questions in the 55th Round. Since a 7 days recall is known to elicit a substan- tially higher consumption estimate for food etc., the presence of this question in the 55th Round Consumption Survey might have affected responses to the 30 days question.\u201d Following the controversy,some analysts placed the estimate of poverty incidence for 1999-2000 at around 33 per cent.The latter makes the pace of poverty reduction the same during the two five-year periods 1987-88 to 1993-94 and 1993- 94 to 1999-2000.Taking the rate as indicated by the official poverty figures, India is well on the way to realizing the MDG in this area. Poverty would have stood at 35.06 per cent in 1990-91 and would fall to just 3.06 per cent by 2015-16, which is way below half. The goal of halving poverty would be achieved as early as 2004-05. On the other hand, if the rate of reduction sug- gested by the independent estimate is taken into consideration, poverty would touch 22.38 per cent in 2015-16, which is close to 4 percent- age points \u201cshort\u201dof the MDG target.5 There are some countries where the record is unambiguously positive. Malaysia has an out- standing record on poverty eradication. The MDG target does not appear relevant here. A comprehensive and aggressively intervention- ist policy adopted by the government resulted in reducing the incidence of poverty from 49.3 per cent of the households in 1970 to 7.5 per cent in 1999. Currently, the focus of poverty eradication is on addressing pockets of poverty in remote areas and among the indigenous Orang Asli and other Bumiputera minorities in the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Similarly, Sri Lanka has undoubtedly achieved a great deal in reducing poverty since Independence. These gains are reflected in impressive human development indicators which distinguish Sri Lanka from other low- income countries. Another striking case is Vietnam, which has reduced the proportion of people living on less than US$ 1 (PPP) a day from 50.8 to 9.6 per cent in the 1990s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "664dbc32-72d4-4e0e-9f9a-381519e5f31c": {"__data__": {"id_": "664dbc32-72d4-4e0e-9f9a-381519e5f31c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d1dc9b3798f9cd8d93b09ac17831c8ce34e6667f5b14fe356981e9c42b55d50"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e992603-4097-4412-9759-c2ec64f379d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e71489870333f7d0b29796a5287ba1dbe4be2340b42f5f637c4ea8460506cd66"}}, "hash": "66e4907ab525d45f07f38cb0a6671219a561c5694c1d2ae3e65bb3d78e431206", "text": "Given the differences in the per capita income levels of these success stories, there is reason to believe that a concerted effort at poverty A much-noted feature of ICT is that, besides directly enhancing productivity in diverse activities from production to service provision, they substantially increase the reach of individuals, organizations and governments at extremely low costs 25 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals reduction can have significant effects.

The total num- ber of poor people dropped from 54.2 million (or 40.1 per cent of the total population) in 1976 to 22.5 millions (or 11.3 per cent) in 1996. During the period of the financial and eco- nomic crisis in 1997-98, the rupiah exchange rate plunged from 2,500 to 15,000 against the US dollar; consequently,the prices of essentials rose substantially. This resulted in an increase in the total number of poor people to 47,974 million (or 23.43 per cent) in 1999.As the econ- omy stabilized and improved,poverty statistics also improved. The total number of poor peo- ple dropped to 38.4 million (or 18.2 per cent) in 2002.6 Similarly, the percentage of Thailand\u2019s popula- tion under the national poverty line steadily declined from 32.6 per cent in 1988 to 11.4 in 1996. The economic crisis reversed this trend; 15.9 per cent of Thais were classified as being \u201cpoor\u201d in 1999, revealing the vulnerability of the marginal groups. In 2001, as the country was moving out of the crisis, 13 per cent or 8.2 million people still lived under the poverty line.7 The country studies also point to instances where progress has been extremely slow. In Mongolia, the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) conducted in 1995 and 1998 showed that the poor and very poor constitut- ed 36.3 per cent and 35.6 per cent of the pop- ulation, respectively. This amounts to an annu- al decline of less than a third of a percentage point, suggesting that if current trends persist the MDG in this area will not be realized. An even more disconcerting case is Pakistan, where trends in rural poverty point to signifi- cant increases between 1987 and 1998, rising from 18 per cent to 35 per cent; while urban poverty has risen more gradually from 15 to 21 per cent.The rural trend has driven the country overall to a nearly 15-point increase in poverty (from 17 to 31 per cent of the population) dur- ing this time frame.8 It would seem at first blush that Pakistan is losing ground with regard to MDG 1. Thus the nine countries studied as part of this project corroborate the substantial inter- country and intra-country variations in the pace of progress toward Goal 1 of the MDGs. While this illustrates the potential for progress in the low achievers, it also indicates the distance that remains to be travelled.The country studies also illustrate the possibility of individual countries that register substantial progress in poverty reduction slipping back. Thus ICT needs to be harnessed not merely to contribute to and facil- itate poverty reduction, but also to constantly monitor poverty trends and alert policy makers of likely or actual reversals of past achievements. Poverty is the product of economic processes occurring at a variety of levels \u2013 local, national and international. Existing social and economic relations structure the impact of external factors and determine who will have access to subsis- tence and livelihood opportunities as well as access to education and assets,which can help to increase these choices. In the medium term, suc- cess depends on changes in these areas but ICTs can be used to ameliorate poverty in many ways. Thus, ICTs can be used to increase access to market information,reduce transaction costs for poor farmers and traders, and facilitate the development of alternative marketing strategies. Micro-finance institutions in rural and urban areas, which support these agents and activi- ties, could benefit from the use of ICTs.They can also increase the efficiency, competitiveness and market access of developing country firms, particularly small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs).ICTs can also enhance the cost effective- ness and reach of government services, enhance the provision of public services with a pro-poor focus (e-government) and facilitate development of integrated solutions. Finally, ICTs can facilitate poverty mapping and moni- toring, help evaluate the impact of poverty reduction strategies and mediate enhanced support to the poor.

Data are not available for Malaysia. Pakistan\u2019s experience suggests that progress towards realizing the target of reducing hunger and malnutrition can be stymied if the overall poverty alleviation effort is lagging. Two key indicators are used to measure progress in this area: the prevalence of underweight children (under five years of age) and the proportion of the population below a minimum level of dietary energy consumption. In the past, Pakistan had made modest progress in lowering the number of malnour- ished children. While in 1978, nearly half (49 per cent) of all children under five years of age were malnourished, the figure dropped steadi- ly, if slowly, to 40 per cent in 1990 and 38 per cent in 1995.11 UNICEF data suggest that the figure had not changed by 2002 (Table 2.2). Further, the Pakistan Human Condition Report12 states that malnutrition in children under five years of age stood at 42 per cent in 1998. In human terms, this translates into 10 million malnourished children, two-thirds of whom are stunted, 40 per cent underweight, and nearly 10 per cent wasted. Clearly, these are unacceptable levels.This situation has aris- en because ground on poverty reduction, in general, is being lost. According to FAO meas- ures used for the World Development Indicators database, nearly a quarter of the population in Pakistan lacked the necessary calorie intake for a reasonable subsistence in 1990, as did 20 per cent in 2001 (Table 2.3). As has been repeatedly stated, hunger and mal- nutrition are not the result of inadequate food availability. Thus, although Thailand is one of the top producers and exporters in the world food market, 18 per cent of its population, or 11.5 million people, are undernourished, and 19 per cent of children under five are under- ICTs can be used to increase access to market information, reduce transaction costs for poor farmers and traders, and facilitate the development of alternative marketing strategies Country 1990 1991 1992 1993 1999 2000 2001 2002 China 19.1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 10.0 \u2014 \u2014 India \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 53.4a,b 47.0c,d \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Indonesia \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 26.4 \u2014 \u2014 26.1 Malaysia \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 23.3 \u2014 \u2014 12.4 \u2014 Mongolia \u2014 \u2014 12.3e \u2014 \u2014 12.7 \u2014 \u2014 Pakistan \u2014 40.4f \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 38.0h Sri Lanka \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 29.4g \u2014 \u2014 Thailand \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 18.6 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Vietnam \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 33.1 \u2014 \u2014 Note: The years presented are those for which data are available for the countries considered in the period 1990-2002. a Data for 1992-93; b Age group is 0-47 months; c Data for 1998-99; d Age group is 0-35 months; e Age group is 0-48 months; f Data for 1990-91; g Age group is 3-59 months; h Data for 2001-02 Source: UNICEF estimates, http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/mi/mi_goals.asp, accessed in March 2005 Country 1991 1996 2001 China 17a 12b 11c India 25a 21b 21 c Indonesia 9a 6b 6c Malaysia 3a 2b 2c Mongolia 34a 46b 28c Pakistan 24a 19b 20c Sri Lanka 28a 26b 22c Thailand 28a 21b 20c Vietnam 31a 23b 19c Note: The years selected in the period 1990-2004 are those for which data are available for the nine countries considered. a 1990-92 average; b1995-97 average; c2000-02 average Source: FAO estimates, http://millenniumindicators.un.org/ unsd/mi/mi_goals.asp, accessed in March 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "645a860a-d07f-4847-b73f-00479c26aeb9": {"__data__": {"id_": "645a860a-d07f-4847-b73f-00479c26aeb9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd5ee496412e466db4f415bfd75d4dea4bb10d1cddad4e6c82601561e0791222"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ffa20f0-f65d-43e0-af0b-aaccd675bd1a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83f0c215068b1abdd57b4861b560d561abf77168b716b2ba98d77f196e3518f7"}}, "hash": "a3e8cb9f809c4af20a584a44f578e3869d996784197b6463007f959bc39b6488", "text": "Table 2.3 Proportion of population below minimum dietary energy consumption Table 2.2 Children under five moderately or severely underweight, per cent 27 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals weight.Although ICTs may not be able to have a direct impact (as in the case of education) by way of increasing food supply and reducing hunger, they can have an impact through a vari- ety of related processes.

Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education The target of ensuring, by 2015, that children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling is important for human development. Having an educated workforce is the key to future national prosperity,and a basic requirement in that direc- tion is for all children to be enrolled in primary school.Net enrolment\u2020 in the Asia-Pacific region has remained static at about 93 per cent between the early and the late 1990s.13 However, in this area, the limited data available suggest that country level achievements have been significant. According to UNICEF data, China, Malaysia and Vietnam are significant per- formers in the target pertaining to the indicator \u2018net enrolment ratio\u2019, though there are marginal reversals of past achievement. China and Malaysia are also close to achieving the target for the indicator \u2018proportion of children reaching grade 5\u2019, closely followed by Sri Lanka and Thailand (Tables 2.4 and 2.5). National figures suggest that progress in some countries has indeed been remarkable. The net primary school enrolment rate (NER) in China was reportedly raised from 98 per cent in 1990 to 99 per cent in 2000. Meanwhile the NER of secondary schools was raised from 75 per cent in 1990 to 95 per cent in 2000. Youth above 15 years of age received 7.85 years of education in 2000, which was much longer than the 5.33 years estimated for 1983.14 However, the picture is not the same every- where.

The slow rates of improvement in literacy and edu- cation for both men and women remain major failures of the Indian development process.

Gross enrolment ratios measure the ratios of total enrolment, regardless of age, to the popu- lation of the age group that officially corre- sponds to the level of education shown.

However, what matters is the net enrol- ment ratio, which is the ratio of the number of children of official school age (as defined by the national education system) who are enrolled in school to the population of the corresponding official school age. Here, though there have been some signs of improvement, the Education For All goal is far away. According to National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) of 1992-93 and 1998-99, the proportion of children in the six to14 age group attending school rose between these two peri- ods from 62.6 to 75.7 per cent in rural India and 82.4 to 87.6 per cent in urban India.This implies that in the latter period more than one in every five children in the six to 14 age group was not attending school. Further, the proportion of pupils starting grade 1 who reach grade 5, or persistence to grade 5 (measured as percentage of cohort reaching grade 5), is estimated at a virtually stagnant 59 per cent in 1993 and 60 per cent in 1998. Official figures of the drop-out rate for 1997-98 in the Class I-V category was 39.38 per cent, in the Class I-VIII category was 54.14 per cent and in the Class I-X category was 69.33 per cent.16 Thus there appears to be lit- tle progress towards achieving the goal of a full course of primary schooling for children by 2015. To deal with this kind of problem, Indonesia recently revised the law of compulsory primary education that changed the mandatory period from six to nine years.

In the inter- im, the management of primary education is much better in affluent regions than in those with little or no resources and potential. In remote areas that have no basic infrastructure such as service roads and utilities, the condi- tion of primary education is barely adequate at best. In Malaysia the national education system rec- ommended by the Education Committee Report of 1956 stipulated that every child be given a place in primary school. Based on these recommendations, primary school fees were abolished in 1961 and the school-leaving age was raised to 14 years. Basic education was extended to include not only the primary level but also three years of lower secondary school- ing during the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70).The introduction of a comprehensive education sys- tem in 1965 raised the years of school-level edu- cation to 15.Free education for children right up to the upper secondary level was introduced during the Fourth Malaysia Plan (1981-85) and this extended free universal education from nine to 11 years. As a result of these changes, enrolment rates for primary education rose from 53.2 per cent in 1970 to 98.8 and 97.7 per cent in 1990 and 2000, respectively, for ages six to 11.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b6fcb22-4cd6-4ffb-89b4-0b0b7617f432": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b6fcb22-4cd6-4ffb-89b4-0b0b7617f432", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05a9c0f96193856d6cbef51cc60e32dc0d867ac83ccd7aab12462f765cbc5b3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4461619f-4ffb-496f-a12a-d32d9cfb8903", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de1282053a7058a0c7d0dab9485f96b7b3591865c8c4faad60697407e19121ff"}}, "hash": "eb2a79cd1520f45f38665ca2a1e39674ad33c99ad833ade4c205b85d75430aa1", "text": "For sec- ondary education (ages 12-18), the figure rose from 47.1 per cent in 1980 to 52.0 and 59.3 per cent in 1990 and 2000, respectively.

ESCAP/UNDP19 reports that in 2002 the literacy rate for females was 98.5 per cent and for males as high as 99.5 per cent.20 Until recent reform, six years of primary schooling was compulsory in Thailand. Consequently, Thailand has achie- ved nearly universal primary education since 1995. However, despite the high enrolment rate, the retention ratio within the education system gradually declines throughout the schooling years. Only 80 per cent of those Class 1 students who enrolled in the year 1990 have reached the last year of primary schooling. Just over 60 per cent of those stu- dents have continued further to the last year of lower secondary education. And less than half of those students attended upper sec- ondary school.21 Vietnam\u2019s primary education enrolment rates have also increased considerably to over 90 per cent.22 This is especially impressive given the country\u2019s low level of income. Still, there are a number of underlying qualitative short- comings that would need to be redressed to fully meet this MDG. Almost one-third of chil- dren do not complete grade 5. Moreover, 70 per cent of drop-outs are girls, reflecting their traditional roles and obligations at home. In addition, primary school pupils spend less than half the normal school day in class. Disparities in both quantity and quality of pri- mary education widen as poor families are unable to top up schooling hours on a private basis. Furthermore, net primary enrolment rates in the 12 weakest performing provinces are more than 20 percentage points lower on average than in the 12 best performing provinces. Whereas Ho Chi Minh City achieves a net enrolment rate of over 90 per cent in pri- mary education, Binh Phuoc, hardly four hours down the road, scarcely achieves 50 per cent. Such disparities increase further at higher lev- els within the education system. Besides inadequate progress towards the MDG in some cases, most countries are characterized by poor progress in rural areas and specific remote locations. Poverty is an important determinant of educational attainment 30 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals In other cases, performance has been poor and there are even signs of reversal of earlier achievement. In Mongolia, which has a cred- itable literacy rate that stood at 96.5 per cent in 1989 and 97.8 per cent in 2000, the net enrolment ratio in primary and secondary schools of children in the age group eight to 15 fell from 93.5 per cent to 86.5 per cent.23 Similarly, in terms of enrolment in primary education, Pakistan shows a relatively poor performance, lagging behind countries at sim- ilar income levels by as much as 20 per cent. Much of this lag is accounted for by the gen- der gap: 40 per cent fewer girls attend primary school in Pakistan than in similar countries. Thus, the challenge in Pakistan in meeting this Goal is to increase overall primary school enrolment and, in doing so, to close the enrol- ment gender gap. In recent years, however, national figures sug- gest that the country has lost ground on enrol- ment, with overall net enrolment dropping during the 1990s from 46 to 42 per cent.

In sum, besides inadequate progress towards the MDG in some cases, most countries are characterized by poor progress in rural areas and specific remote locations. Poverty is an important determinant of educational attain- ment. Even in those countries where primary schooling is free, expenses are still incurred for purchasing items such as books,equipment and uniforms. The most deprived families may also rely on their children not only to contribute to the family income but also to attend to domes- tic work and child care. Young girls are particu- larly vulnerable to pressures to drop out of school for this reason. In addition, families have even less incentive to send their children to school when the schools may be poorly equipped or staffed. These factors notwithstanding, there is ade- quate cross-country evidence to suggest that supply-side adjustments can substantially influ- ence educational achievement. This makes the role that an enabler like ICT can play in an area such as education quite significant. It can do so by improving the delivery and administration of educational services by providing wider access to educational material, and improving the quality of content and pedagogy. Given the ability of ICT to provide access to quality educa- tional resources at low cost over a wide geo- graphical area, its role is obvious. It can not only help boost the effort at providing education, but can help reach it to the marginalized, irre- spective of their location. Above all, it can serve these purposes by reducing the cost of provi- sion of educational services as well as improving quality \u2013 two features that may keep children back at school and stem the rise in the drop-out rate as the years of schooling increase. In fact, education is one area where ICTs have been shown to have the most impact. However, countries should not begin with pre-conceived notions of educational applications (distance learning), but focus on content, solutions and capacity development.One objective should be to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of educational administrators, authorities and enablers through the strategic application of ICTs and through ICT-enabled skill develop- ment. The technology can also be used to sup- port teacher training, learning and capacity development.Finally,ICTs can be used to broaden the availability of quality educational materials and resources. All of this depends on cost reduction, an issue discussed later. ICTs can enable the realization of MDGs only if they provide cost effective tools that can be used in adequate measure. This requires efforts in both developed and develop- ing countries and the forging of partnerships between public and private sectors. Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women An area where progress has been disconcert- ingly slow across the region is gender equity. The crucial target for this goal is the elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education,preferably by 2005,and at all levels of education no later than 2015. In terms of pri- mary education there is still some way to go in There is adequate cross-country evidence to suggest that supply- side adjustments can substantially influence educational achievement. This makes the role that an enabler such as ICT can play in an area like education quite significant 31 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals the Asia-Pacific region. The data collected by ESCAP/UNDP25 for 46 of the 58 countries in the region point to the persistence of moderate or severe disparities. Overall, countries have per- formed modestly in terms of female gross enrol- ment ratios for both primary and secondary education. However, the picture in countries such as Pakistan and India is far less encouraging. Although literacy rates have increased in the 1990s for both males and females, the gender gap in 1999 continued to be quite high,with lit- eracy rates for males being 58.3 per cent and for females 33.5 per cent.26 The problem is com- pounded by the lack of access by women to education; women constituted only 28.9 per cent of the student body in the 26 public sector universities, and there were only 10 vocational colleges for women out of a total of 172 in Pakistan.27 Associated with India\u2019s unsatisfactory progress on the literacy and education fronts, are sub- stantial gender differentials in even the modest achievements that have been recorded.The per- centage of females among pupils at the primary education stage rose from 41 in 1990 to 43 in 1992,stagnated at that level till 1996 and rose to 45 in 1998.

The proportion of females among secondary school pupils stagnated at 37 per cent between 1992 and 1995 and then rose marginally to 38 per cent in 1998, where it remained even in 1998. Drop-out rates too tend to be much higher for girls than for boys. Typically, by middle school the ratio of girl to boy students falls sharply, especially in rural areas.28 What is more, the ratio of illiterate female to male 15-to-24-year-olds remained stagnant at 1.6 from 1990 to 2001. Female literacy rates are much lower (with the illiterate proportion usu- ally between 50 and 70 per cent) among Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes, as well as among certain minority groups. However, the experience in other countries leads one to be optimistic. In the case of China, improvement through the 1990s had ensured that in 2000, the ratio of primary school girls to boys increased to 91 per cent, and the ratio in secondary education to 85 per cent. However, rural and minority girls have much less of an opportunity to receive a full primary education and an even lower probability of completing secondary education. Further, in 1999, the average duration of education for men and women was, respectively, 8.1 years and 6.6 years. On the literacy front, between 1990 and 1999, the ratio of female adult illiterates declined by 10 percentage points. However, the ratio of female adult illiterates is, at 22 per cent, higher than that for male adults by 9 per- centage points.29 China, like India, reveals a wider gender gap in secondary rather than in primary education (Tables 2.6 and 2.7), though China is \u2018on track\u2019 and India is rated as \u2018far behind\u2019 in maintaining gender equality.

In Indonesia, the expansion in the education system has benefited women, particularly after the government introduced the policy on com- pulsory basic education till nine years and abol- ished the payment of primary school fees.At the primary school level, enrolment of girls and boys is equal. The proportion of illiterate women aged 10-44 years decreased from 7.6 per cent in 1996 to 5.3 per cent in 1999, while that of illiterate men fell from 3.8 per cent in 1996 to 2.7 per cent in 1999.30 The most striking case is Mongolia, where there are far more girls than boys enrolled in second- ary education, with the enrolment ratio of girls to boys at 1.11.31 Also male enrolment rates, particularly at the higher grades, have declined more sharply than female rates. This could be related to the privatization of ownership of ani- mals, when more boys were required to under- take herding.In 2000, the number of boys drop- ping out was 42,078, which amounted to 61.7 per cent of total drop-outs. However, girls\u2019 sec- ondary school enrolment rate, although high, is still below the target of 95 per cent.32 The tran- sition has had a sharp impact on enrolment rates for girls and boys, eroding the achieve- ments in the previous period.

In fact, Malaysia has more than achieved the tar- gets in the MDG area of eliminating gender dis- parity in primary and secondary education well before the preferred 2005 timeline.

Women\u2019s participation in work Data on the proportion of women who are actively involved in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector is scarce. Available data suggest that, despite substantial differences in levels, the proportion of women engaged in wage employment is on the rise. By 2002, the share of women is estimated to be, despite the increase in the 1990s, as low as 8.9 per cent in Pakistan, followed by India with 17.3 per cent. Vietnam and Mongolia top the list,with 51.4 per cent and 49.4 per cent, respectively (Table 2.8). Less satisfactory though is the participation of women in decision-making at the national par- liamentary level: this is typically below 10 per cent in most developing countries in the region. A notable exception is Vietnam, where the pro- portion of women in the national parliament has increased significantly from 18 per cent in the early 1990s to 26 per cent in the late 1990s.\u202036 It needs to be noted, however, that women\u2019s representation in parliaments and local governments does not necessarily reflect empowerment in the full sense of the term. There is substantial evidence of proxy represen- tation in political structures, as the decision- making usually lies in the hands of male party workers.However,once women come to occupy these positions, they can be supported in ways that empower them over time. ICTs can play a major role here, such as through the provision of access to information and analysis relating to issues that fall in their ambit of decision- making. In China, women constituted 47 per cent of the total work force in 2000. Further, 39 per cent of working women were employed in the non- agricultural sectors. In addition, contrary to trends elsewhere, 36 per cent of all government officials and 20 per cent of all entrepreneurs were women.37 However, income gaps between men and women continued to widen.The Second Survey of the Social Status of Women conducted in 2000 in China showed that during the second half of the 1990s, although the income of employed women greatly increased, income gaps compared with men grew wider.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f71fe70-1975-4ad0-a9bd-7c705c42f3e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f71fe70-1975-4ad0-a9bd-7c705c42f3e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f37a0d13dfbea03d24467320b44ea8c5190dc69a0ee98d96737d30fd77f1c414"}, "2": {"node_id": "0de47e7f-198e-4e77-a8a8-1023fd6e29d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "263511eadaa9f2dcdded09f7316b317df9de88e05604a08815bde6ba39b430a6"}}, "hash": "540fe205f3809fa168c3139d0b90990a3f0c68f1a764f3bd56cfa28278506281", "text": "The sur- vey showed that the average monthly income for men in Shenzhen was 5,098 Yuan (approxi- mately US$ 616), while that for women was 2,947 Yuan (US$ 356).Thus,the monthly income of men was 1.7 times higher than that of women.

Despite the progress in women\u2019s social and political participation, the level of women\u2019s participation in national and social decision- making is still low. In 2000, the proportion of female leaders in provinces and municipalities was 8 per cent, marking an advance of just 2 percentage points since 1995. In India, figures from the NSSO reveal that the percentage of women in the 15+ age group who were either working in a casual, principal and secondary status or seeking or available for work fell from 44.4 per cent in 1983 to 42 per cent in 1993-94 and 38.5 per cent in 1999-2000. This was not only far greater than the fall from 87.1 to 85.4 and 83.5 per cent, respectively, in the case of men,but was due to a much sharper fall in rural than in urban areas. Within the category of paid employment, gen- der differentials in wages are lower in India than elsewhere in Asia, including, in East and South East Asia. However, in recent times those differ- entials appear to be widening in both urban and rural areas.Thus,besides general worsening of conditions of employment,gender-based job segregation, which ensures that women find work at the lower end of the skill and value- added spectrum, appears to have played a role. In Indonesia, the labour force participation rate of females aged 10 and above was 45.6 per cent in 1999 and that for males 73.5 per cent.38 According to the global HDR 2002, the share of employment in the agricultural sector in total employment (1995-2001) for men and women was almost equal, with the figure for women at 42 per cent and that for men at 41 per cent. In the case of the industrial sector, the employ- ment share in total was only 16 per cent for females, while it was 21 per cent for males. The service sector\u2019s contribution to total employ- ment was higher for women (42 per cent) than for men (39 per cent). However, two years of severe economic crisis (1997-99) had affected women adversely. According to a National Development Planning Board Study,39 about 17.8 per cent of the total population lived below the national poverty line.Almost half of the poor were women. Although, in 2001, Indonesia had its first female President, the number of women in positions of policy- and decision-making in the government remains low. There were only two women cabi- net ministers in the government as of April 2003. In the parliament also the number of women representatives remained low. In 2002, only 8 per cent of members of parliament were women. In 2004, only 8 per cent of members of parliament were women.40 The figure for women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector has held steady at 36 per cent in Malaysia for the past decade, indicating room for some measures to increase their participation in the industrial economy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cee5f778-46b9-4fc1-ab9c-3f27fdb1de69": {"__data__": {"id_": "cee5f778-46b9-4fc1-ab9c-3f27fdb1de69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51c6c24f89db8c60ecb386aba74c3b84c119221fa748d9c4e4861ee80080bcb4"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c5b32d4-1919-486f-827c-0daaed03712c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ae72d48407fff7336e8cea34047651ba42310b453953ea0ac56ca17ca374d55"}}, "hash": "78c0d6d0bdc23ff01cb83986378ca1a3e4f3826745f9410f4a4fece26c555ec3", "text": "The female labour force participation rate has stagnated at around the mid-40 per cent level.

The privatization of herds, housing and state enterprises has overwhelm- ingly benefited men rather than women. Women have had to find alternative means of survival, usually through self-employment in the informal sector. Their representation in decision-making is also very limited.As of 2000, women held 11.8 per cent of the seats in parlia- ment, and 4.5 per cent of the speakerships of aimag and capital citizen\u2019s khurals, and accounted for 12.9 per cent of their members. Similarly, 13 per cent of the speakers of soum and district khurals, and 25 per cent of their members, were women. Except for one vice cabinet secretary, one vice minister and one ambassador, there are no women ministers or even aimag governors. Sixteen per cent of the heads of departments within line ministries and 3.3 per cent of soum and district governors are female.42 Fundamental rights of women in Pakistan are curtailed through a combination of discrimina- tory laws, cultural practices and social exclu- sion. The situation was further aggravated by a Throughout the region a range of measures is required to reduce gender inequality, varying from creation of employment opportunities specifically for women to reforming social practices that work against them 35 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals controversial suite of \u201cIslamic laws\u201d introduced during General Zia\u2019s military regime (1977-88), which have sanctioned discriminatory treat- ment of women. A telling statistic, which reflects the adverse ratio for life expectancy as well as cultural bias towards male children is the overall ratio of men and women in the population. In contrast to many other countries, in which women out- number men in the total population,the gender ratio in Pakistan in 2000 was, at 108:100, in favour of men. Not surprisingly, the female labour force participation rate of 13.7 per cent is far below the 70.4 per cent participation rate for men, and the proportion of women in the non- agricultural work force has consistently remained below 9 per cent.43 While basic gender development indicators are satisfactory for Sri Lanka, the empowerment of women still remains a challenge. The female labour force participation rate in 2001 was 32.4 per cent, while the rate for males was 66 per cent. The total labour force of Sri Lanka by the end of 2001 consisted of 33.5 per cent women and 66.5 per cent men. Fifty-two per cent of working women (as compared with 37.8 per cent of working men) are involved in the agri- culture and fisheries category,crafts and related work. Interestingly, while nearly 10 per cent of working women are professionals, the corre- sponding percentage for men is less than half of that. Notwithstanding this, only 1.5 per cent of the working women are in the senior official or manager category, whereas 2.2 per cent of working men are at this level.Among the senior officials and managers in Sri Lanka\u2019s public and private sectors, 25.6 per cent are women and 74.4 per cent are men.44 Though Sri Lanka currently has a woman head of state and had the first woman prime minister in the world in 1960, the number of women seeking election to public office remains low. Parliamentary seats held by women as a per- centage of the total number of seats was 4 per cent in 2000 \u2013 a decline from 4.8 per cent in 1994.There was only one woman cabinet minis- ter in the government as of April 2003 and she headed the ministry of women\u2019s affairs. Empowerment is also the weakest link in the overall gender situation in Thailand. Over the 1990s,the percentage of women in the national parliament increased from 2.23 per cent to just 9.57 per cent in 2001.Thailand has a rather high labour participation rate, and that rate is higher in the non-agricultural sector. Women workers play an important role in manufacturing, where docile and disciplined workers are sought for the assembly lines. These women earn only around four-fifths of the wage paid to their male counterparts. Similarly, while women con- stitute a large part of the work force in the pub- lic sector, they have only 14.19 per cent of high- level management positions.45 In Vietnam, the socio-economic situation of women appears to have improved substantially over the last 10 years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "339d21cb-95d5-44ef-ad04-cf93ea9d667b": {"__data__": {"id_": "339d21cb-95d5-44ef-ad04-cf93ea9d667b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86c08d60eaa56adeec214c98c387fc963ced5d76b48c0ab65847eb87e031d7b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8572fad-e4d4-4378-a489-0e4272a79e30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f09857a768974a916dcaa1cdd0ec8ac86151ede86c7e4b9c12d84804372b47ce"}}, "hash": "50aa111e2ff96612578b96b5c9c30381902b7243eeb851da883930c73d84a08d", "text": "Female representation in Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly is high relative to other countries, with women comprising some 25 per cent of delegates in the 11th Legislature of the National Assembly.At the provincial level, at the turn of the decade, the number of female representatives in People\u2019s Councils was signifi-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb96a76c-24da-4868-8ff8-f05703315364": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb96a76c-24da-4868-8ff8-f05703315364", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39d0b6f3b505677a44db5b90c29c966459f2f468f4ba8b7b8ac2db991be802d9"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f5c6b53-ccd3-4105-8518-03940087b42a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "548e8d549a1cd3b66d57f48552d4efe1a618d51640d332e0540a087dddac1275"}}, "hash": "27c5f3930b29a1fd417db326a6fa2eea448d71729fcb980068f1f4cbe26ac6a1", "text": "cantly lower than that for men, though there were significant variations across provinces. In provinces like Tuyen Quang, Dong Nai and Son La nearly one-third of representatives were female, while in others such as Tra Vinh and Khanh Hoa the figure was below 10 per cent. Thus, it is clear that throughout the region a range of measures is required to reduce gen- der inequality, varying from creation of employment opportunities specifically for women and ensuring equal pay for equal work to changing mind-sets and reforming social practices that work against giving women an equal position in the economic, social and political mainstream. The use of ICTs for realiz- ing the MDG in this area must be assessed in terms of its ability to influence outcomes on one or more of these fronts. To cite some obvious applications, ICTs can deliver educational and literacy programmes specifically targeted at poor girls and women, using appropriate technologies in both formal and non-formal educational settings (e.g., pub- lic access centres). In addition, such technolo- gies can be used to influence public opinion on gender equality through information and com- munication programmes using a range of ICTs. Goal 4: Reduce child mortality With regard to the goal of reducing under-five mortality, the region as a whole appears to be \u2018on track\u2019 to achieving the target of reducing With regard to the Goal of reducing under-five mortality, while the region as a whole appears to be on track to achieving the target of reducing the rate by two-thirds, there are still millions of children dying before reaching five 36 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals the rate by two-thirds. However, there are still millions of children dying before reaching five because of significant inter-country disparities in achievement. Of the 44 countries for which data were available, ESCAP/UNDP46 projected that only 18 will succeed, while 26 will fall short of the goal.47 Of the nine countries that are the focus of this study, HDR 2002 categorized Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Thailand as \u2018on track\u2019 towards achieving this goal, while India and Vietnam were lagging. Pakistan and China were categorized as \u2018far behind\u2019.In 2003 Pakistan had the highest under- five mortality rate (103),\u2018far behind\u2019its 2015 tar- get of 42 per 1,000 live births (Table 2.9). China was also similarly placed according to this assessment. In fact, in China, rapid improvements in health- care before 1990 gave hope that mortality rates of under-fives could be cut by two-thirds in the following 25 years. However, the experience since then points to the persistence and widen- ing of rural-urban differentials as a result of which the rural mortality ratio is three times higher than the urban.This could affect its real- ization of the MDG in the area. The experience in India is similar. Evidence from the Registrar General\u2019s Sample Registration Surveys (SRS) suggests that, while Infant Mortality Rates (IMRs) have declined over time, the rate of decline has decelerated over the 1990s. This problem is more pronounced among girls. The IMR for males fell by 26 per cent between 1981 and 1991 (from 110 to 81 per 1,000) but only by 12 per cent over the subsequent decade, to 71 per 1,000.48 The deceleration in the rate of decline of infant mortality among girls over the two decades was even sharper, with the rate of improvement falling from 27 per cent to 10 per cent, such that the female IMR was 72 per 1,000 in 2001. Of course, this conceals the extent of female foeticide which is likely (if anything) to have brought down female IMRs. Even by the mid-1990s, of the more than 25 million children born every year, close to 2.5 million were expected to die before they were one year old and another 1.2 million before reaching the age of five. A major cause of morbidity is, of course, malnutrition. Nearly one out of every two children was malnour- ished on both weight-for-age and height-for- age bases. More than a third of women were undernourished as per the Body Mass Index (BMI) and over a half of ever-married women and three-fourths of children suffered from anaemia.

Table 2.9 Children under-five mortality rate 37 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals In Mongolia, UNICEF-WHO figures estimated that infant and under-five mortality rates fell sig- nificantly in the last decade. IMR declined from 74 in 1990 to 56 per 1,000 in 2003, while the under-five mortality rate declined from 104 per 1,000 in 1990 to 68 in 2003 (Tables 2.9 and 2.10). In Vietnam too, under-five child mortality rates have been reduced significantly from 53 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 23 per 1,000 live births in 2003. Similarly, IMRs have been reduced from 38 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 19 per 1,000 live births in 2003.However,region- al disparities are enormous.IMR for the 12 weak- est provinces is of the order of 60 per 1,000 live births, which is more than thrice that of the 12 best performing provinces (17 per 1,000 live births). The number of children dying before one year of age in a province like Kon Tum is,on average,eight times higher than in Ho Chi Minh City. In addition, malnutrition also remains a serious problem. One-third of all children under five are underweight. Finally, Malaysia is either close to realizing the target or is \u2018on track\u2019 in this area.The child mor- tality rate per 1,000 live births was 21 in 1990 and 7 in 2003 and the infant mortality rate 16 and 7, respectively. The implications of the above description of the experience with reducing child mortality should be clear.Even in an area where the effort to realize the MDG is less difficult, where many countries are \u2018on track\u2019to realizing the Goal and some have already achieved the target, there are many who are slipping or falling far behind. The majority of children who die before turning five do so because of a combination of malnu- trition and preventable diseases such as diar- rhoea and measles.Very similar factors seem to explain current levels of infant and under-five mortality. The Indonesia Demographic Health Survey 1997 showed that almost half (47 per cent) of infant deaths occurred in the first month of life (neonatal deaths), and over two- thirds (71 per cent) of those happened in the first six days,the cut-off point for early neonatal death. The Indonesia Household Health Survey 2001 showed that perinatal complications ranked first among the causes of infant deaths (34.7 per cent) followed by acute respiratory- tract infection (ARI) (27.6 per cent) and diar- rhoea (9.4 per cent). The leading causes of under-five mortality were ARI (22.8 per cent), diarrhoea (13.2 per cent) and nervous system disorders (11.8 per cent). Neonatal and infant mortality rates are significantly associated with factors determined by the socio-economic sta- tus of mothers, such as their health, nutritional status and their access to healthcare from preg- nancy through the postnatal period.Two of the three major causes of child mortality were related to communicable diseases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c27064d-f709-428f-be73-13dce6de9d0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c27064d-f709-428f-be73-13dce6de9d0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9924e25dcec332ed149a93c645874094ed9b5a06222d72025cb21144dd51a83"}, "2": {"node_id": "600c0d3b-8802-45ce-9ec0-019630da01e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00c855f94a5a9f4294abefc8fca510ca8211c39da19e0ef8676437f0da6f27ea"}}, "hash": "dce9476d963eb15d45d666cb586cb878779c0fabf1dda8b60c1e0911136bd61f", "text": "Low birth weight, nutrition and immunization status and influencing factors such as the status of hous- ing, sanitation, clean water supply and health- care increase child susceptibility to infectious diseases.50 Goal 5: Improve maternal health In the case of maternal mortality,where the goal is to reduce the rate by three-quarters between 1990 and 2015, data to properly assess trends is not available.However,ESCAP/UNDP51 concluded that there appears to have been very little progress in the 1990s.

Data for this MDG is difficult to obtain because estimating Maternal Mortality Rates (MMRs) requires current information on the number of deaths of women of reproductive age and the cause of death. Registration sys- tems needed for such information-gathering are inadequate in most countries in the Asia- Pacific region. Given the lack of reliable data, the tracking of trends in MMRs becomes a formidable challenge. However, the available evidence suggests that in China the MMR dropped from an estimated 95 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 56 in 2000 (Table 2.11).The proportion of births attended by skilled health workers in hospitals increased from 45 per cent in 1990 to 66 per cent in 2000. However, as usual, these national figures mask the great contrast between rural and urban areas. In the urban areas, better economic growth led to medical services for women and good access to emergency obstetric care. In India, maternal mortality claimed 570 lives for every 100,000 live births in 1990. MMR for the country as a whole was estimated to have declined to 440 per 100,000 live births in the mid-1990s. But available estimates seem to suggest that this rose to 540 in 2000.52 Thus the slow decline of maternal mortality in India appears to have been reversed during the second half of the 1990s. Once again, there are significant rural-urban differentials, with the rural rate estimated to be nearly double the urban rate. A part of the reason for the slow decline and even reversal of maternal mortality is that the nutritional problems associated with effective child-bearing remain significant and wide- spread. Poor nutrition for girls during adoles- cence (and resultant anaemia and inadequate calcium intake) contributes to future obstetric risk and also affects the reproductive process. While the all-India average intake of calories is substantially below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for both men and women, the largest deficits are in the case of pregnant and lactating mothers. This can con- tribute to foetal loss, low birth weight and death during infancy. Deficiencies of micro- nutrients are rampant: not only calcium for pregnant and lactating women, but iron, riboflavin and vitamin C for all women. The MMR for Indonesia was reported to be 650 per 100,000 live births during in 1990, 470 in 1995 and 230 in 2000. Despite the significant decline, the 2000 figure is still high relative to that which prevails in China, Malaysia and Thailand. In response to the continued high MMR and its slow rate of progress, the Ministry of Health had adopted a number of strategic policies. The most recent one was the National Strategy for \u201cMaking Pregnancy Safer\u201d (MPS) 2001-2010 that set the target of MMR for 2010 Progress in dealing with HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases like malaria has also been disappointing in the Asia-Pacific region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d6ebc71-ab66-4ad2-8bdd-6c3d3014fdf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d6ebc71-ab66-4ad2-8bdd-6c3d3014fdf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8571bb94bd1341f3a023aa0adc0ac2d2745dfc644911ac2bc3bb72257bee6667"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3e47872-14d8-4eee-9497-d36b25686a1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e5f3d6889f87dbcdd67ee0dc1cd188c0d8809db4c551a2c0830c60e4e44543a"}}, "hash": "18c1ef87784c416d77946ad211f7fc7de838191fc64bb0c433b3850df7b41210", "text": "HIV/AIDS has been spreading rapidly over the last 15 years, with the number in the region infected as of end 2001 placed at 7 million Country 1990 1995 2000 China 95(5) 60(5) 56(5) India 570(1) 440(5) 540(4) Indonesia 650(1) 470(6) 230(1) Malaysia 80(3) 39(5) 41(5) Mongolia 65(3) 65(1) 110(2) Pakistan 340(1) 200(1) 500(1) Sri Lanka 140(3) 60(5) 92(5) Thailand 200(1) 44(5) 44(5) Vietnam 160(1) 95(1) 130(1) Source: WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA World Bank, Millennium Indicators Database 1 No national data on maternal mortality available.

In Mongolia,maternal mortality per 100,000 live births appears to have increased since the mid- 1990s, though the level in 2000 was better than in some other countries studied. Approximately 60 per cent of the maternal mortality occurred in rural areas. This high mortality is caused by several factors,among which is the lack of infor- mation and knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth among both women and men. In rural areas, a member of a family living under the poverty line gets food with 1,587 calories or around two-thirds of the required daily calorie intake. This negatively affects women\u2019s health leading to anaemia and antenatal, delivery and after-delivery complications. For example, mothers living above the poverty line died from abortion or ectopic pregnancy, while mothers living below the poverty line died from serious complications at later stages of pregnancy, sep- sis and haemorrhage. Maternal health in Pakistan among poor women is an issue of particular concern. Antenatal and childbirth care by trained staff reaches only 29 per cent of the population. Estimates for the annual number of maternal deaths vary widely, with studies from the mid- 1990s reporting approximately 25,000, to more recent press reports of 30,000 in only the coun- try\u2019s second-largest province, Sindh. Each year over 375,000 women suffer from pregnancy- related complications.Contraceptive use is low, with estimates varying from 12 to 29 per cent. Available estimates suggest that MMR stood at 340, 200 and 500, respectively, in 1990, 1995 and 2000. As compared with these cases and due to the wide availability of healthcare, maternal mortal- ity is low in Sri Lanka: it was as low as 65 per 100,000 live births in 1995 and an estimated 92 in 2000. The use of prenatal services is almost universal in Sri Lanka. Surveys have indicated that around 99 per cent of mothers receive some prenatal care. Delivery rarely takes place at home, with 95 per cent of births now taking place in medical institutions. Both factors explain the relatively lower levels of maternal mortality. In Thailand, the reported MMR fell sharply dur- ing the first half of the 1990s and stood at 44 per 100,000 live births in 2000. Health coverage with four antenatal visits was 83.4 per cent in 1995 and the coverage of deliveries attended by health personnel or a trained healthcare worker was 97.9 per cent in 2001. Among pregnant women, the incidence of anaemia was 13.4 per cent in 1995,and was targeted to be reduced to less than 10 per cent by 2000 in the Eighth National Plan of Action on Public Health. Available data suggest that MMRs in Vietnam have been reduced from an estimated 160 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 130 per 100,000 live births in 2000, due partly to the decline seen during the first half of the 1990s. Thus, while some progress appears to have been achieved over the past decade, the trend appears disconcerting. Here again, significant regional disparities prevail. More than 40 per cent of women in rural areas still deliver at home, often without professional healthcare assistance, compared with only 7 per cent in urban areas. Similarly, the MMR in the isolated areas of the Central Highlands is estimated to be more than four times higher than the national rate. This is due, in large part, to inadequate access to essential obstetric care, lack of infrastructure in remote and mountainous areas and lack of basic knowledge on maternal healthcare at the household level. Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Progress in dealing with HIV/AIDS and infec- tious diseases such as malaria has also been disappointing in the Asia-Pacific region. HIV/ AIDS has been spreading rapidly over the last 15 years.

The first target associated with this Goal is to halt and begin a reversal of the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. The extent of the problem is enormous in the more populous Since HIV/AIDS tends to be concentrated among certain vulnerable groups and segments of the population, ICTs, including radio and television, can play a major role in targeting these groups 40 Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals countries. For example, in China, the preva- lence rate among adults may be relatively low at 0.1 per cent, but this translates to around 850,000 people and infections have been on the rise. Similarly in India, a prevalence rate of 0.6 per cent means that 4 million people are infected.54 In Indonesia, infections have been rising among drug users, sex workers and men who have sex with men. However, the case of Thailand is an encouraging example: high prevalence rates have been brought under control through State action. Comprehensive measures have been taken, including the dis- tribution of anti-retroviral drugs to HIV-posi- tive pregnant women. The second target is to halt the spread of malar- ia by 2015, and ensure the reversal of the inci- dence of malaria and other major diseases. The need to curb the spread of malaria has gained urgency recently due to the malarial parasite developing drug resistance and insecticides becoming less effective in controlling mosqui- toes. Another serious concern is the spread of tuberculosis (TB). In South East Asia alone there are around 3 million cases reported every year.55 Information in this area is a real problem. For example, due to the lack of political and cul- tural openness, estimates of the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in many countries are uncertain. Social taboos of various kinds also restrict the acknowledgement of AIDS. Yet, the evidence points to rapid spread. In China,since the first detected case in 1985,the epidemic has been expanding dramatically. The Ministry of Health acknowledged that there were more than 1 million people living with HIV/AIDS in China in 2002 and warned that this number could increase to 10 million by 2010 unless effective prevention measures were taken.56 While perhaps not a nation-wide health prob- lem, malaria occurs in 22 provinces of China. Hainan and Yunnan are the most seriously affected provinces accounting for more than 50 per cent of the national total of reported cases in 2000. These two provinces also have the more dangerous falciparum form of malar- ia. The less severe vivax form of malaria occurs in all 22 affected provinces. The reported 24,000 cases per year are believed to be only 10 per cent of an actual number of 240,000 cases per year.57 In 2000, there were approximately 4.5 million active TB cases in China and 1.5 million had the highly infectious smear-positive form of TB.The national prevalence rate of smear-positive TB in 2000 was 122 cases per 100,000 persons,a mere 9 per cent decline from the 1990 rate. TB is about 50 per cent higher in the poorer central- western provinces compared to the wealthier eastern provinces. The incidence of TB is nearly twice as high in villages than in the cities of China.It is clearly linked to poverty and to poor- er access to healthcare.58 In India, after hunger, the principal health threats stem from some \u201cold\u201d diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis, malaria, kala-azar and, \u201cnewer\u201d ones such as HIV/AIDS. Some of these have staged a comeback because of insecti- cide resistance among vectors, resistance to antibiotics and poor public health practices. Thus malaria, whose incidence was estimated at 75 million cases and 0.8 million deaths in 1947, and which had retreated to incidence levels of 0.1 million cases and no deaths in 1964, staged a comeback with 7 million cases in 1976. Though this incidence rate has come down since, it has stagnated at around 2 mil- lion cases over the last few years ending with 2001. In the case of kala-azar, endemic in the states of West Bengal, Jharkand and Bihar, the official Economic Survey for 2002-03 reports that there has been no significant decline in reported cases and deaths due to inadequate insecticide spraying operations and poor out- reach of diagnostic services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f18a8ec-9e0e-454a-9c22-6314d1fae333": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f18a8ec-9e0e-454a-9c22-6314d1fae333", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b4c78759a3f6085a661dc53241ecb53ee96f0fe8a5cde92eade5cd52241fcc8"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b91c279-4250-4205-bec9-e68df403b879", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc52cbbadccd414a65d0ba39ccd78e62d8f6c4956c61cea3f84f162ec6f58cc5"}}, "hash": "cbdd7e2d8f39ce3c12cb49ef4b612c173c7cf591da32c73d7f33c6f367c38b79", "text": "Inadequate public expenditure on health is an obvious problem here.

The number of HIV infections was 4.58 million in 2002, 3.97 million in 2001, and 3.86 million in 2000. With these estimates, it is argued that while the epi- demic is still spreading in the country, there is ICTs can be shown to have an impact both within the context of the formal healthcare system as well as in facilitating knowledge-sharing, awareness-raising and co-ordination. ICTs can help in identifying affected populations and individuals 41 Asia\u2019s march towards the Millennium Development Goals no significant upsurge in the number of new infections. In fact, in comparison to the 4.58 million HIV infections in 2002, there has been an increase of 0.52 million in 2003,as compared to that of 0.61 million in 2002.However,the offi- cially reported number of new infections, at 0.11 million in 2001, is still extremely high.The cumulative number of actual AIDS cases was reported at 48,933 as on 31 March 2003.60 Of these cases, 36,411 are males. With more than 85 per cent of these cases identified as having acquired the infection through sexual trans- mission, this rather than perinatal transmis- sion, use of blood products or of injectable drugs, seems to be the principal means of transmission in the country. With the combined public and private expen- diture on health estimated at 5.1 per cent of GDP, India spends more of its income on health than most other developing countries and almost as much as many developed coun- tries. However, just 17 per cent is expenditure by the State, pointing to the predominance of private expenditure in the total health expen- diture. The predominance of private outlays implies that public health initiatives to reduce morbidity due to common communicable dis- eases and nutritional deficiency would be inadequate. A UNAIDS monitoring report released in 2001 included Indonesia as one of the countries that is experiencing explosive epidemics in different population groups.61 During the past few years, the country is experiencing new, rapidly devel- oping sub-epidemics of HIV in several provinces and communities, and now perceives HIV/AIDS to be a serious threat.Since the first case of AIDS was reported in Indonesia in 1987, there has been considerable debate on the extent of transmission of HIV that would occur in the dif- ferent population groups across the country. Due to a lack of reliable statistics,the number of the infected is not known. Nonetheless, it has been recognized that the social and behaviour- al environment in many parts of Indonesia has factors in common with countries that have already experienced major epidemics of HIV/AIDS. According to the UNAIDS 2004 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic, at the end of 2003 the number of adults (15-49 years) living with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia was estimated to be 110,000, and the estimated number of AIDS deaths was reported at 2,400. Given the cur- rent features of Indonesia\u2019s social transition, the actual number of HIV sero-positive cases is probably far higher than the reported fig- ures although this number cannot be deter- mined with precision due to limitations in the healthcare reporting and surveillance sys- tems.The challenges facing the HIV/AIDS pre- vention effort in Indonesia include a highly mobile population, vast unreported sex industries, changes in social norms, low levels of condom use, low awareness of preventive measures, an increasing number of intra- venous drug user (IDUs), and economic crisis (women in search for survival, increasing number of street children). In 2003, Indonesia\u2019s National AIDS Commission (NAC) revised the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, originally developed in 1993, as a result of the increase in HIV infections over recent years and, just as important, to respond to the commit- ments made at the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS. Among other diseases, malaria remains a major public health problem in Indonesia.Malaria cases were reported at 33 per 100,000 of the popula- tion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b52fbea2-0e37-4429-be8d-6347e5574635": {"__data__": {"id_": "b52fbea2-0e37-4429-be8d-6347e5574635", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development 2005: Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "743874f45b523e6b2627f00fc0f2ee96ad065ce40065eb9cc84443f5a6e0ad4a"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf5272ff-8861-4d87-9bfd-bf96a723f3d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f74dc7b8f9efea05c61176c9a2676cc468a44e85ad51f959248479abccd053b1"}}, "hash": "c95aa40d346fa976b36a7d465fcecb936fa57520ed51a2ed48e7d8966079624c", "text": "TB also continues to be a major killer that ranks third in the mortality list after cardio-vascu- lar and respiratory diseases and is the primary cause of death attributable to infectious diseases in adults in Indonesia.62 Pakistan\u2019s recorded experience of the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1986 when the National Institute of Health in Islamabad conducted its first HIV/AIDS test.63 Since then, of the 3,136,000 tests conducted as of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24994bfb-963a-4bba-8444-bc6d13f7287b": {"__data__": {"id_": "24994bfb-963a-4bba-8444-bc6d13f7287b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-2005-promoting-ict-human-development-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metada
