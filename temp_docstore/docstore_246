These enterprises are a significant drain on the budget and the economy as a whole; their generally inefficient and subsidized operations inhibit the development of competitive private sector alternatives and impose a significant cost burden on the consumer. Subsidies and grants to these state-owned enterprises and other agencies, including payments on the senior citizens benefit scheme account for about 15% of the recurrent budget. Debt service payments are budgeted to take approximately 2.5% of recurrent expenditure is 2009. Together these two expenditure categories plus wages and salaries account for two-thirds of the recurrent budget leaving only one-third of resources to meet programme delivery costs. 21.

It is understood that so far licence revenues have indeed remained buoyant. The number of fishery mother-ships (average of eight vessels everyday throughout August 2009) and the frequency with which purse seine vessels have been observed transshipping catches in Tarawa lagoon would seem to support this. 23. The government is moving towards ratifying the Pacific Islands Free Trade Agreement (PICTA) and its sister agreement the Pacific Closer Economic Relations Agreement (PACER). Compliance with these agreements requires a restructuring of the Kiribati tax and tariff regime, this is currently being formulated for implementation in 2010. The primary objective would be to broaden the tax and tariff base away from specific trade taxes to a system based on consumption tax. This would be a move towards eventual WTO compliance. 24. Kiribati uses the Australian dollar as its national currency. It does not have a reserve bank; its only major commercial bank is a subsidiary of ANZ Bank Pty. The government retains a 25% shareholding in the Bank of Kiribati. The government therefore has no independent monetary policy and no control over its external exchange rate. The financial sector of the economy is very underdeveloped. The Kiribati Provident Fund, the Development Bank of Kiribati and the Kiribati Insurance Corporation comprise the main players in the financial sector. There are also small \u201cVillage Banks\u201d which operate at the community level. 25. Kiribati has a very substantial trade deficit, having virtually no commodity exports. Its trade deficit is offset by flows of factor income from abroad (RERF, seafarers, remittances and fishing licence fees) and development assistance. There is very little foreign direct investment. The country is virtually totally reliant on imports of fuel for all transport and power generation requirements. On the outer islands there is some use of solar power for lighting but this is not significant in total, see section 9. 26. The principal economic resources available to Kiribati are the fish stocks in its large EEZ and its small but important tourism sector, primarily focused on the Line Islands. Beyond this the opportunities for generating additional economic growth are limited. Seaweed cultivation has been successful but has experienced problems with transport, storms damage and lack of management skills. Agriculture development is severely constrained by the lack of land, although there could be some scope for niche-market coconut products if quality and markets could be developed. 27. In recent years Tarawa has become a transshipment port for purse-seine fishing vessels unloading catches to mother-ships. This has provided a boost to the local economy on Tarawa, but has also had some unfortunate social consequences and poses serious health risks around HIV/AIDS and other STIs. 2.4 Impact of the Global Economic and Financial Crisis 28. Kiribati has been, and is still being adversely impacted by the affects of the global fuel and food price increases of early 2008. Consumer price inflation was very high in the second half of 2008 reaching an annual rate of 18.6% in the fourth-quarter of 2008. Through to the second quarter of 2009 the annual rate was still high at 13.2%. Although global food prices fell in the second half of 2008 these falls were not translated into commensurate reductions in consumer prices in Kiribati. The retail prices of many basic foods have now appeared to plateau at much higher levels than previously. At end June 2009 for example the retail price of rice was double that of December 2007, and the prices of sugar and flour, two other of the most purchased items by poor households, were two-thirds and one-third respectively above the end 2007 levels. 29. Formal offshore employment is presently estimated at around nine-hundred persons, significantly down on the number at the beginning of 2008. In mid-2009 the number of seafarers on foreign merchant vessels, the largest group or workers, was approximately 720, this is a decline of almost 200 on the average 2008 level, a 13 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence fall of 20%. Moreover the average number of seafarers in 2008 was itself some 15% below the average level of 2004/05. The numbers engaged as fishing vessel and cruise ship crew have also declined as one", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a4bc15d-24b4-43a1-9eae-19faa5a84aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a4bc15d-24b4-43a1-9eae-19faa5a84aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "902c413f9cc186c5e3e409732c6f2ac29cab32830069e988f7fe146c0f079293"}}, "hash": "902c413f9cc186c5e3e409732c6f2ac29cab32830069e988f7fe146c0f079293", "text": "of the principal Japanese fishing companies has cut back its operations and as cruise ship operators have cut back their voyages consequent on the fall in demand. The cut back in cruise ship operations is also reportedly having a serious impact on the island of Tabueran in the Line Islands. At its peak in 2003 there were approximately three visits per month to the island by cruise vessels originating in Hawaii, a total of more than 120,000 visitors landing during the course of the year. Although the number of vessel visits had dropped to around one per month by 2007 and early 2008, by the end of the year the visits had stopped completely. The people of this remote island have now lost their primary source of income, its return is uncertain. 30. In 2008 seafarer and other remittances from workers offshore are estimated to have amounted to between A$12\u201315 million; this will have declined in line with the number of seafarers and others and will have a direct impact on the incomes of families in Kiribati. 31. The impacts of the global economic and financial crisis have therefore begun to affect Kiribati in diverse ways through multiple transmission channels: - The cost of fuel imports all but doubled between 2007 and 2008 putting a severe strain on the government\u2019s budget to provide additional subsidies to the domestic shipping operations and the power generator; - The increased cost of fuel also: a) put up the operating costs of local fishing businesses adding to the price of fish in the market; and b) increased the transport costs of the people living on South Tarawa particularly; - The sharp rises in the prices of key basic food items in the diets of poor households (notably rice flour and sugar) during 2008, and which have remained high since, has been especially hard on the poorest and most vulnerable in the urban centre of Tarawa; - The decline in world trade and the lay-up of a number of merchant shipping vessels has reduced the number of I-Kiribati seafarers and had consequently led to a decline in remittances; the loss of remittances is felt immediately by those households in which employment has been lost; - The termination of cruise vessel visits to Tabueran Island has completely removed the source of income and livelihood from the people of this very remote island in the Line Island group; problems with the international air-service through Kiritimati island, although not directly the result of the global economic situation, have exacerbated the loss of the cruise vessels and have reduced the tourist numbers to Kiritimati also; - The reduction in employment on-board cruise and foreign fishing vessels is further reducing employment prospects for I-Kiribati; - The fall in value of the RERF as a consequence of the financial crisis has raised questions regarding the sustainability of the governments current drawdown policy in support of the recurrent budget; - Slow growth in the economy, being experienced even before the impacts of the global slowdown, is likely to lead to a fall in government revenues during 2009 and into 2010; this will add pressure to the budget and will present the government with serious challenges in trying to ensure a sustainable budget balance. 32. The government\u2019s options are limited. A major fiscal stimulus package along the lines of those being implemented in larger countries is not possible within the framework of the current fiscal situation. The government has no recourse to external funding, other than from its regular donors and international finance agencies, and the scope for additional domestic resource mobilization for public investment is very limited. In any event there are considerable lead times in mobilizing major investment projects and there are very large import leakages. It may be possible to bring-forward some already planned donor-funded investments but these are unlikely to be sufficient to make a material difference in the short-term. 33. Labour-intensive small-works projects would be more appropriate in putting income into the hands of households most affected by the economic situation. Such works could involve school classroom and health 14 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence clinic maintenance; repairing guttering on public buildings, perhaps even on private housing; repairs to village roads and causeways.

The inevitable initial social costs arising from such restructuring could be supported by development partners. 35. Some countries in the region have begun to implement social protection measures, often with development partner support, targeting to reduce the burden of education related costs on poor households. This approach might also offer an opportunity for Kiribati to provide pro-poor transfers which would act as a form of fiscal stimulus. 36. Many households are already experiencing the socio- economic costs of lost jobs, declining remittances and falling real incomes. The following analysis establishes a set of poverty benchmarks based on the 2006 household income and expenditure survey. These benchmarks help to define the most vulnerable households in Kiribati and assist in highlighting possible policy options to target the most vulnerable and to mitigate the impacts of the economic slowdown. 3. Defining Hardship and Poverty in the Kiribati Context 3.1 Introduction 37. Traditional Kiribati society, as with Pacific societies generally, embraces caring for and sharing with the extended family. As a result, there has been a strong belief that poverty could not and should not be a part of normal life in the region. The idea that poverty might be present in some form is not, therefore, something that until recently, many Pacific Islanders, and particularly their governments, have been prepared to accept. There has, however, been a growing acknowledgement that the increasing monetisation of Pacific societies and the weakening in traditional social safety nets, has led to an greater awareness of hardship, if not actual \u201cpoverty\u201d in peoples\u2019 lives. 38. The recent food and fuel price rises have brought these issues into sharper focus and have acted as a catalyst in raising awareness of poverty and hardship as serious issues for policy debate. 39. With its poor growth record and likely declining real incomes, the people of Kiribati have been hard hit by the rapidly increasing cost of living in the country. The situation is adversely affecting the overall living standards of those without regular cash incomes and especially the most vulnerable. However, whilst many families are not especially well-off in financial or material terms, their strong family and community ties have traditionally provided social safety nets for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. 40. The changes in socio-economic structures being brought about by the spread of \u201cglobalisation\u201d in its broadest sense, and the impact these changes are having on the ability of households to continue to lead traditional lifestyles, are now leading to poverty and hardship, as now defined and understood in the Pacific, (see Section 3.3 following), being increasingly accepted as concerns by governments and the development community. Some countries in the Pacific region, including Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea (PNG), and Timor-Leste, have already 15 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence fully embraced the need to deal with increasing levels of hardship and poverty and the consequent societal implications. Other countries, though perhaps not yet fully acknowledging hardship and poverty as serious issues, are nevertheless accepting that there are growing numbers of disadvantaged people who are being left behind as economic and social structures change in response to both external and internal developments. 41. Moreover, poverty and hardship should be seen as issues that are best dealt with before they become serious. This has become especially relevant in the past year or so as the impact of rising fuel and food prices have begun to have serious implications for both governments and households alike. Almost everyone, throughout the region, has begun to experience declines in their real incomes as price rises have not been matched by increased earnings. As a consequence many more people have begun to experience hardship as they try to balance their daily living needs with their often very limited income resources and access to food gardens, especially in the urban centres. 42. To be fully accepted poverty and hardship have to be defined in ways which are more easily understood in Pacific societies. Poverty means different things to different people at different times and in different places. This has given rise to much misunderstanding and confusion. Poverty can be either absolute, where families struggle to even provide adequate food for themselves, as in the MDG1 indicator of US$1 per day, or it can be relative, where people are disadvantaged compared to their neighbours in terms of individual national, or localised poverty lines, and where they struggle to meet the needs of a minimum standard of living in their own society. 43.

This would have been the case with many of those people displaced in Solomon Islands during \u201cthe tensions\u201d of the period from 1999 through 2002. The tsunamis of 2006 and 2009 in Solomon Islands\u2019 Western Province, Tonga and Samoa and the floods in Fiji early in 2009 would also have caused many households to experience hardship. It may also be personal due to such causes as unemployment, sickness, death or disability; in some countries HIV/AIDS and NCDs are amongst the greatest causes of these latter problems. In yet other situations it can be the result of discrimination or specific policy choices as in the case of Fiji where the leases on many sugar-cane farms have not been renewed and farmers have lost their livelihoods. 44. Most discussions of poverty centre on its most extreme manifestations: absolute poverty and destitution. There are, however, many other ways in which people can be poor or can suffer hardship. Indeed people can be reasonably well fed and moderately healthy but still live in relative poverty and suffer varying degrees of hardship. Their incomes or subsistence production might be just sufficient to meet their food needs but they may struggle to meet other basic-needs expenditure. Additionally, they might lack access to basic services, such as water and sanitation or health and education facilities, freedom of choice, or socio-economic opportunities. This \u201cpoverty of opportunity\u201d 12 is just as important in defining the extent of poverty and hardship in a society as the lack of income. In fact, often the conditions and circumstances that give rise to poverty of opportunity (poor access to, or standards of, service delivery, poor governance, poor education and health, limited employment opportunities, and social exclusion) are the underlying causes of income poverty. 12 First used in the Pacific context in the UNDP 1999 Pacific Human Development Report, defined as \u201cthe inability of people to lead the kind of lives they aspire to.\u201d 16 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 45. It is recognised that defining poverty by level of cash income or expenditure alone might not be appropriate in the Pacific. Most economies and households include high levels of subsistence production and consumption of own-produced food. The current analysis takes account of this subsistence production/consumption by valuing it as part of both income and expenditure, thus providing a better picture of overall well-being, see Section 4.2. 46. Household survey data on subsistence production also provides a sounder basis for estimating the non-monetary sector in national accounts. Historically in many countries, including in Kiribati, calculating the value of such subsistence production in the national income (gross domestic product) has not been complete; it may have been inadequately assessed in GDP estimates or occasionally it has been missing almost entirely. 47. Often in the past data from censuses and HIES has not been collected with the analysis of poverty and hardship in mind, or has not been fully analysed for poverty indicators and the socio-cultural aspects of the data may have been ignored. This is now changing. There is a growing recognition of the importance of the data generated by HIES, both in terms of the information it can provide on poverty, and also the importance of accurately capturing subsistence production and consumption for national accounts purposes. 48. As a result of the Millennium Declaration endorsed at the UN Summit in 2000 and the subsequent adoption of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) at the World Summit in 2000, there has been a growing awareness of the need to increase both understanding and knowledge of the extent of poverty and hardship in society. The integration of the MDGs as part of a core hardship alleviation and poverty reduction focus in national development priorities and strategies is an overarching goal of all the agencies that have contributed to this analysis. 49. A summary of the key MDG1 indicators derived from the HIES is at Table 1. 3.2 Poverty = Hardship: A Pacific Definition of Poverty 50. After extensive consultations through a series of Participatory Assessments of Hardship (PAH) conducted by ADB13 in ten PICs (including Kiribati) over 2001 \u2013 2005, a working definition of Pacific poverty, or perhaps more correctly \u201cHardship\u201d, was defined in Human Development terms as: An inadequate level of sustainable human development, manifested by: - a lack of access to basic services such as health care, education and clean water; - a lack of opportunities to participate fully in the socio-economic life of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61686b9a-a82c-40f8-954c-83bb3d76fd8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "61686b9a-a82c-40f8-954c-83bb3d76fd8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04d42e7f5d0947ad8683fc5380209637f890f916545bb8d6f1803285c60b5e25"}, "3": {"node_id": "869786e7-15e5-4670-8bf7-8bb280bf54a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7c69b08aa7190640c825c5c81855e88a98d78aad565599ec1422a69948b819d"}}, "hash": "ae79b89e1ea9c18cc38c3708bede48646e692301999550093353d06ce5638203", "text": "community; and - a lack of access to productive resources and income generation support systems (rural credit ,capital, markets, skill) Table 1 Millennium Development Goal Indicators National South Tarawa Rest of Gilberts Line & Phoenix 1.1 Proportion of Population below Basic Needs Poverty Lines % (Note 1) 21.8 24.2 22.0 8.9 Proportion of Population vulnerable to falling into poverty; per capita expenditure <10% above BNPL % 5.6 7.4 3.4 7.0 1.2 Proportion of households with per capita expenditure below the minimum level of dietary energy consumption (FPL) % 5.3 2.2 6.0 0.5 1.3 Poverty Gap Index (PGI) - Depth of Poverty 7.2 8.5 9.9 2.0 Squared PGI - Severity of Poverty 3.5 3.4 4.7 0.6 1.4 Share of poorest quintile (20%) in consumption by region % 7.8 11.2 7.8 11.4 Ratio of Share of poorest quintile (20%) to highest quintile 4.7 2.7 4.7 2.9 HH Gini Coefficient: (0 = perfect equality 1 = perfect inequality) 0.39 0.35 0.42 0.34 Note 1: Proportion of Population below US$1 (PPP) per day not yet available, awaiting PPP indices to be finalised. 13 RETAs 6002 , 6047 and 6157 covering FSM, Kiribati, Fiji, PNG, RMI, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga ,Tuvalu and Vanuatu 17 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence to meet the basic needs of the household, and/or customary obligations to the extended family, village community and/or the church. 51. The findings of the participatory assessments highlighted hardship and poverty as real issues in the lives of many people in both urban and rural areas, and on outer islands and atolls. The concerns of the people showed remarkable consistency not only between the urban and rural areas within each country, but also across the countries of the region as a whole. In other words, despite the wide differences in geography and resource endowments among the atolls of Micronesia and parts of Polynesia, and the high islands of Melanesia and most of Polynesia, the concerns of the people themselves were very similar. 52. The causes of hardship and poverty centre around the lack of regular and sufficient cash income; poor access to or the poor quality of basic services; and the lack of skills to meet opportunities and challenges as they become available. These are the challenges which face governments and policy makers in framing national, sector and community level interventions aimed at alleviating the causes of hardship and poverty and achieving the MDGs. 53. During the PAH in Kiribati nine communities were consulted throughout the country, including Tarawa, the Line Islands and the rural Gilberts. The general perception of the focus and community groups consulted was that absolute poverty did not exist in their respective communities; food was available and everybody was taken care of. There was however an acceptance that hardship most certainly did exist as households struggled to meet the competing needs for an acceptable standard of living. Hardship was due to limited economic opportunities to earn income and provide for the individual and needs of the whole family. In general basic services and infrastructure were available in all sample communities, but it was noted that in some the quality of service delivery was poor particularly relating to water supply, sanitation, roads, transportation, power, communication and access to market. A weakening in the traditional way of life and loss of traditional skills were also major causes of hardship identified by all sample communities. 54. The people defined as experiencing hardship were mainly single mothers with limited income sources, elderly people without support, families with low income and living in crowded conditions, children with low education, unemployed youth, and people with disabilities, see Box 1. Hardship was determined to exist in both rural and urban areas although it was most commonly experienced in the urban centres where demands for cash and social tensions were greatest. Hardship in the rural areas was mostly due to limited access to basic services such as a safe and accessible water supply, transport to deliver cargoes, power, communications and links to markets to sell produce or fish-catches for income.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "869786e7-15e5-4670-8bf7-8bb280bf54a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "869786e7-15e5-4670-8bf7-8bb280bf54a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "04d42e7f5d0947ad8683fc5380209637f890f916545bb8d6f1803285c60b5e25"}, "2": {"node_id": "61686b9a-a82c-40f8-954c-83bb3d76fd8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae79b89e1ea9c18cc38c3708bede48646e692301999550093353d06ce5638203"}}, "hash": "b7c69b08aa7190640c825c5c81855e88a98d78aad565599ec1422a69948b819d", "text": "Hardship in the urban areas meanwhile was focused on low income, overcrowding, criminality, drinking, congested living conditions, depletion of natural resources and dependency on money.

To address these various causes of hardship communities identified priority measures for consideration: (i) creation of income generation activities particularly for unemployed youth, low income single parents and overcrowded/large households; (ii) improve access to basic services and infrastructure particularly water supply, sanitation, roads and transport, power and communications in both urban and outer islands; and (iii) improve quality of education and health services. A particular priority for the outer islands was creation of stronger links with markets to sell produce or fish-catches on Tarawa or overseas for higher income. Another priority was capacity building to facilitate active participation of communities in development initiatives particularly to strengthen skills (both technical and traditional) to generate income and support subsistence livelihoods, improve household management and leadership and decision making skills by women and youth groups. 56. The analysis of the HIES confirms that these perceived needs can be backed by the available data. Access to safe water supply and sanitation are lacking for many low-income households on South Tarawa and the outer islands. Most poor HH are also large households with an average of nearly four children per household. These HH therefore need to spend a significant amount of their limited cash resources on meeting the costs associated with education; fees, books and school supplies, uniforms, lunches etc. Many poor HH are also amongst the \u201cworking poor\u201d; the HH may have one or often more employed persons in the HH but these are often in low- wage or part-time jobs where the income is insufficient to meet the basic needs of the extended family group in the HH. 3.3 Defining the National Poverty Line 57. For Pacific Island Countries (PICs) data for estimating national basic needs poverty lines at the household level are becoming available as more household surveys and analyses are undertaken. Poverty as measured by national basic-needs poverty lines is a relative measure of hardship. It assesses the basic per capita costs of a minimum standard of living in a particular country/society, or sub-region within a society, and measures the number of households and the proportion of the population that are deemed unable to meet these needs. Poverty is measured at the household level; it is not generally possible to disaggregate poverty on an intra-household basis. Thus if the average per capita expenditure/income of a household falls below the basic-needs poverty line then all members of that household are deemed to be equally poor. Similarly if a household has an average per capita income/expenditure above the poverty line then none of the members of that household are considered to be poor. Culture, demographics and many other factors affect the actual distribution of wealth and access to food and resources within each HH; however such detail is not available from broad-based HIES. 58. Every country experiences some incidence of relative poverty, this is true of developed as well as developing countries. However the nature of relative poverty as measured by national poverty lines is not directly comparable across countries. Thus, two countries may have similar levels in the incidence of relative poverty as measured by their respective national (domestic) poverty lines, but have very different levels of overall costs and general standards of living. The measurement of absolute poverty, enabling cross-country comparisons of the extent of poverty, is usually done through the estimation of the US$1 per day PPP value used in Goal 1 of the MDGs (this is currently estimated to be about US$1.50 per day in 2008 PPP terms). Presently this measure of poverty cannot be estimated for Pacific Island countries since PPP indices are not yet available; however estimates should be available by end the 2009. 59.

Households which have adult equivalent per capita incomes or expenditure below the basic needs poverty line are then deemed to be living in poverty. This is explained in the next section. 60. The estimation of poverty lines and the incidence, depth and severity of poverty in society is not an exact science. There is considerable academic as well as empirical debate about the \u201cbest\u201d methodology for measuring poverty in society. Box 2 summarises the view of the World Bank, one of the leaders in the debate on global poverty, its measurement and the development of policies and strategies to alleviate the hardship experienced by those who are poor. The \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d method, as outlined by the World Bank, has been used in undertaking this analysis for Kiribati. This same method has also been used for similar analyses in other PICs14 and elsewhere in the world. It provides a sound and well-tested methodology. 3.4 Estimating the Poverty Line for Kiribati 61. Following the \u201cCost of Basic Needs\u201d methodology, the estimation of poverty lines and, from them, the extent or Incidence of Poverty (IP) in Kiribati has been a four step process: a) calculating the Food Poverty Line (FPL); b) estimating a non-food basic-needs component; c) combining the FPL with the non-food basic needs component to give an estimate of the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL); and finally, d) estimating the Incidence of Poverty against the BNPL benchmark from the HIES data; the Head Count Index (HCI) and other poverty indicators. 62. The Basic Needs Poverty Line is made up of two components, the cost of food and an amount of expenditure for essential non-food basic needs. It is therefore intended to represent the minimum expenditure per week, month or year that is required by an individual, household or family; firstly, to provide a basic, low-cost, minimally nutritious diet, (measured in terms of the minimum daily calorie intake required for basic human survival, which is internationally benchmarked at an average of around 2100/2200 calories/day per adult per capita15), termed the \u201cFood Poverty Line\u201d (FPL). Secondly, an additional amount which is required to meet the costs of purchasing essential non-food basic needs (e.g. housing/shelter, clothing, utilities, school fees and other education related costs, health, and transport) and to meet family/community/church obligations. Most of these non-food costs require cash payments and are often the underlying cause of the greatest financial hardship. 63. Together the FPL and the non-food component make up the benchmark \u201cBasic Needs Poverty Line\u201d (BNPL). The Incidence of Poverty is then measured against the BNPL by estimating the proportion of households and/ or population that have an expenditure (including the value of subsistence production consumed) less than the BNPL value, referred to as the Head Count Index. Households with per capita adult equivalent16 expenditure (p.c.a.e) below the FPL are deemed to be in absolute or \u201csevere\u201d poverty since their expenditure is below that required to meet basic food needs. Those with expenditure below the BNPL are deemed to be in \u201cbasic-needs\u201d poverty. 64. In the Pacific region as a whole and in Kiribati in particular, many households, especially those in the rural areas, are able to provide a high proportion of their daily food needs from their own subsistence production (Tables 8 & 9). However, their ability to generate cash income for non-food basic needs is often very limited, albeit that 14 Poverty analyses are now available for FSM, Palau, Tuvalu, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga. These were supported variously by UNDP Pacific Centre, ADB Regional Poverty Programme and World Bank for PNG. 15 This is the FAO/WHO recommended daily minimum adult calorie intake for a moderately active adult. 16 Adult equivalents are derived from \u201cequivalence factors\u201d where children under the age of 15 years are counted as half an adult, thus a household with two adults and two children under 15 would be equivalent to 3 adult equivalents. This methodology has been adopted to take account of; a) economies of scale in household operations and, b) the downward bias in income that would otherwise occur in households with larger numbers children.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a3de9dc-a7dd-4250-900a-72639a2372f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a3de9dc-a7dd-4250-900a-72639a2372f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13ba89623acfcbbc08b7b54c9e8814db93a8dd49d39a7a52900e4a5d67c7b978"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d3d2d9b-60ab-4ce9-bc2c-e2fb7c82a20b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d134c937d2bed2b431b1ef7b360a198c32f2c266670391609742880e0fbb8971"}}, "hash": "320eefc84205c99c9f505615f45e3e1d3743b6aff4955a6dd43f299d7351b21f", "text": "20 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence in the rural areas the need for non-food expenditure may itself be lower due to lack of access to services.

We define a poverty line as the monetary cost of achieving a standard of living above which one is not deemed to be poor. A poverty comparison assesses which of two distributions (of an agreed indicator of living standards among members of a group) has more poverty on average. The groups can be regions or sectors of a country, the same population at different dates, or the same population observed with and without a policy change. A special case of a poverty comparison is a poverty profile, in which groups of households defined by some common characteristic (such as where they live) are compared at one date. The guiding principle in making a poverty comparison to inform policy is that it should be consistent with the policy objective. When that objective is to reduce poverty by increasing people\u2019s command over basic consumption needs, any two individuals (at one date or at different dates) with the same command over those needs should be treated identically. This requires that the poverty line should have a fixed purchasing power over relevant commodities. The cost-of-basic-needs method The cost-of-basic-needs method bases poverty lines on purchasing power over basic consumption needs. This achieves the desired consistency for the purposes of Bank Poverty Assessments. But putting this method into practice with imperfect data can be difficult. Once \u201cbasic needs\u201d are defined, we need to be able to measure their cost over time and location. Setting basic needs requires an inherent value judgment, which often leads to disagreements. Also price data are often inadequate. World Bank, 1994 65. The depth and severity of poverty between households and population is then estimated by using the Poverty Gap Index (PGI) and the Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI), Section 7.5. Estimates of inequality are made using and Gini Coefficients, Section 8. 66. From the work done to date it is estimated that, on average across the Pacific region (but excluding PNG where the rate is much higher), approximately one-in-four households have per capita expenditure/incomes below what would be considered as the basic needs poverty line in their respective countries. On this measure the proportion of the population being in poverty is estimated to be highest in PNG (53%, 2006), Fiji (34.4%, 2002/03), Funafuti, Tuvalu (27.6%, 2005), Port Vila, Vanuatu (27.2%, 2006) and Honiara, Solomon Islands (32.2% 2006) compared with the lowest in Tonga (22.3%, 2001) and Samoa (20.3%, 2002). In general the proportion of the population falling below the respective national poverty lines is somewhat higher than the proportion of households falling below the poverty lines due to the larger size of poor HH. On average about 30% of the population of the region (excluding PNG) falls below the respective national poverty lines. 67. There are of course wide differences in what are regarded as the minimum acceptable standards of living in countries across the region; the minimum acceptable standard of living in Palau, for example, with its US$ and Asian tourism-based economy is considerably higher than the minimum standard of living that would be acceptable in say Solomon Islands. However in both countries the proportion of the population falling below the respective minimums are similar, and in each case those deemed to fall below the basic needs poverty line are regarded as being disadvantaged and worthy of targeted assistance. 21 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 4. The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 4.1 Introduction & Survey Methodology 68. The 2006 Kiribati HIES was conducted in October/November 2006. The final survey comprised data from a total of 1161 households made up of samples17 of 230 HH in South Tarawa (4.4% of all HH), 706 in the Rest of the Gilberts group (9.5%), and 225 HH in the Line Islands (16.7%). 69.

This is consistent with similar adjustments made in other regional countries. 71. The survey also collected information on household demographics, employment/activity, education attainment, and household characteristics including access to water and sanitation, and energy utilisation for cooking and lighting. These all provide indicators of the characteristics of poor households. 72. Whether data on income or expenditure is used as the basis for the calculation of the poverty line and incidence of poverty depends primarily on the perceived accuracy and reliability of the two data sources. In most cases expenditure data is usually more comprehensive and is generally regarded as the more reliable, see Box 3. For Kiribati the aggregate recorded income figure was some 7.5% less than that given by the expenditure records. Since the household diary and other expenditure records are more detailed, and are used as the basis for assessing the food and non-food expenditure components, expenditure has been taken as the basis for the poverty analysis. 73. The analysis of the 2006 HIES for Kiribati therefore uses per capita adult equivalent household expenditure as the basis for the estimation of the poverty lines, levels of poverty incidence and other poverty related indicators. All analysis in this paper, unless otherwise indicated, is therefore based on a household\u2019s per capita adult equivalent weekly expenditure as recorded by the survey. This is consistent with the approach taken for the most other Pacific poverty analyses. 74. The detailed calculation of poverty lines and the estimation of poverty incidence have therefore been conducted on the basis of: a) per capita household expenditure and, b) the proportion of households and population deemed to have per capita expenditure below the food and basic needs poverty line levels. Households have been split into deciles ranked according to the level of per capita adult equivalent expenditure. For the broader analysis of poverty characteristics and vulnerability, the lowest three deciles (L3D) of households ranked in this manner have been used as the basis for more detailed scrutiny. 17 A stratified probability proportional to size (PPS) sample selection methodology was used based on national enumeration areas. Full details are available in the main survey report; Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2006, Analysis Report, National Statistics Office, Tarawa, Kiribati. 22 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence Box 3: National Poverty Lines; Income or Consumption There are two basic ingredients in measuring poverty. The first is a poverty line that refers to a benchmark level of consumption (or income) that enables a person to attain a threshold standard of living. A person whose consumption is below this benchmark level does not attain the threshold standard of living and is thereby defined as poor. The poverty line is said to be absolute, as opposed to relative, when the threshold standard of living is held fixed both over time and space. Given that absolute poverty lines, and the poverty measures derived from these, are widely believed to be the appropriate bases on which to inform antipoverty policies in developing countries, the discussion focuses on these. The second ingredient in measuring poverty is a survey that collects data on income and/or consumption levels from a sample of household\u2019s representative of a given population. The choice of income or consumption as an indicator of household welfare is often determined by the availability of data. Where choice is available, researchers have normally preferred consumption to income on the basis that the former is a better indicator of permanent income and standard of living of people due to consumption smoothing through savings and insurance opportunities. It has also been argued that it is easier to collect information from respondents on consumption than on income. Once a poverty line has been set and survey data are available, it is a simple matter to determine how many households or people are poor.\u2019 Unfortunately, the setting of poverty lines always involves some element of subjective methodological choice. The poverty line refers to a minimum level of living necessary for physical and social development of a person. A minimum level of living defined in monetary terms comprises both food and non-food components of consumption. An objective approach could, in principle, be adopted for computing minimum food expenditure, the dominant component in the total consumption bundle", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9f22404-da7a-457b-a01c-1208d8af1bd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9f22404-da7a-457b-a01c-1208d8af1bd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a0cfd9c70bf5fa57144ad227ab9095cccfb109eb3b2388c4ad5c5b1ae42e791"}, "3": {"node_id": "ecd65b73-a69c-4328-9419-00d2ae52eaa5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac82633a014212629f654634540f97349abc26100d69af6844fa4fe548a4bf43"}}, "hash": "f96b3daaa3865b73e996f40b5b5d19322364b5e7cb58b2bb60e7c4836fccbd63", "text": "of the poor. However, non-food expenditure is clearly affected by social needs and the minimum on this count obviously differs from one society (or region) to another. \u2026. it is difficult to consider even the physical component of minimum needs entirely on an objective basis. Despite such problems, recent literature has grown substantially to define the absolute poverty line on a reasonably, although not completely, objective basis. Once the poverty line is defined, data are required on size distribution of income or consumption to compute the number and proportion of the population below the poverty line. Household income or consumption expenditure surveys are the principle source of such data\u2026.. ADB 2004b, pp 7 & 8 Poverty lines are defined either in terms of income or consumption. In practice, this choice is restricted by the availability of household survey data since most countries collect data on either household income or consumption. A few countries \u2026 collect data on both income and consumption. Income is a better measure of opportunity for consumption than actual consumption in the case of households that save. But consumption might be a better measure of opportunity for poor households that save little or in fact dis-save. Most practitioners also prefer to define poverty in terms of total consumption expenditure because income data collection faces a wider range of measurement problems. Consumption is less affected by short-term fluctuations due to the consumption smoothing opportunities available to a household. Hence, total consumption expenditure is thought to be a better indicator of the permanent income of a household, particularly in an agrarian economy\u2026.. ADB 2004b, p 41 4.2 Overview of HIES Results 4.2.1 Household Size and Composition 75. In the survey the overall national average household size was reported as 6.2 (5.0 adult equivalent, a.e). However, for poor, very-low-expenditure (bottom-two-decile) households the average HH size was 7.1 (5.8 a.e.), see Table 2.

The lowest HH size was in the rural areas of the rest of the Gilberts group where the size of the HH in the lowest quintile was 6.4 (5.2 a.e.). The table illustrates that over all three sub-regions the size of household declines as household expenditure increases, such that the national average HH size in the highest quintile was 4.7 (3.8 a.e), and even on South Tarawa the size of HH in the highest quintile was only 4.8 (3.8 a.e), implying only 2.0 children per HH; less than half the size of HH in the lowest quintile. This inverse relationship between HH size and HH expenditure is consistent with the situation found in other parts of the Pacific region. However it is perhaps especially marked in South Tarawa. Low-expenditure, poor HH tend to be the largest and therefore most disadvantaged. 76. The proportions of female headed households by sub-region are shown in Table 3 and Chart 1. Overall, approximately one-fifth of households were reported as being headed by women, a high of 22.2% of households on South Tarawa and a low of 10.8% in Linnix.

For households in the lowest quintile average weekly household expenditure amounted to only A$70.66, equivalent to only A$12.06 p.c.a.e., or about one-third of that of the average HH. In South Tarawa average weekly HH expenditure for the lowest quintile was A$145.69 compared to A$252.87 across all HH, however the gap widens at the per capita level with average per capita adult equivalent expenditure being equal to A$41.46 compared with only A$18.24 for the lowest quintile. This reflects the significantly greater HH size for the poorest HH. With the recent steep increases in the cost of basic food items, especially impacting the poor on South Tarawa, it is likely that many households are now experiencing significant increases in their levels of hardship and poverty. 79. Food and non-food expenditure is shown in Tables 5 and 6 (and Appendix Tables A2 & A3). These show a familiar pattern of non-food expenditure increasing as a proportion of total expenditure as total expenditure itself increases. It is also significantly higher in the urban area of South Tarawa compared to the rural parts of the country. Thus, the figures show that for households in South Tarawa the average p.c.a.e weekly food expenditure amounted to A$17.46 while in the rural Gilberts weekly food expenditure amounted to A$14.88 p.c.a.e. For HH in the Line Islands average weekly food expenditure amounted to A$24.80. For those in the lowest three deciles the corresponding figures were A$10.33 p.c.a.e. in South Tarawa, A$6.18 p.c.a.e. in rural Gilberts and A$15.01 p.c.a.e. in the Line Islands. These amounts reflect the local shop and market prices, as well as the proportion of own food produced. 80.

This is a pattern seen throughout the sub-region; in rural areas the amount of non-food expenditure is lower in both absolute and relative terms reflecting the limited availability of services in the rural areas. Urban living inevitably involves greater non-food expenditure; many rural or small-island based households will not have power, water or communications bills to pay. They will often spend less on transport and housing costs. Thus their need for non-food expenditure is less. Moreover, since rural cash incomes are lower the resources available to meet non-food expenditure is also less.

For HH in the lowest three deciles in the Northern and Central Gilberts the proportion of own-food consumed was 56.5% and 46% respectively. This is more in line with, but still generally less than, the share of own production in food consumption seen in the rural parts of other regional countries. In Tuvalu for example the proportion of own production in food consumption was almost two-thirds for outer island HH in the lowest three deciles. Thus in the rural areas of Kiribati own production accounts for just over half of all food consumed compared with only about one-third for food consumed by HH on South Tarawa. 86. These are relatively high levels of imported food dependency, and suggest a weakness in the level of food security. This is especially the case for the Southern Gilberts. Outmigration of working age males from some islands has led to an increase in dependency rates such that there are insufficient numbers of young men to undertake much of the traditional work associated with subsistence livelihoods. Collecting toddy and other tree crops, de- husking coconuts, fishing, tending the babai pits and collecting materials for and maintaining traditional houses all require heavy labour which may no longer be available to meet all the needs of the family and community. 5. The Food Poverty Line 5.1 Low-Cost Diets 87. The first step in measuring poverty is the calculation of the Food Poverty Line (FPL), see Box 4 for a definition. Two methods are typically used to derive food poverty lines: either using a \u201cmodel diet\u201d or using actual food expenditure and consumption patterns of the lowest three decile households as recorded in the daily expenditure diaries. The one method can be used to validate the results of the other since they approach the same issue, a basic diet, from different perspectives. The model diets approach from the nutrition perspective, while the other approaches from actual consumption patterns. From the estimate of FPL we need to be comfortable that actual food expenditure could meet basic nutrition needs, see Box 4. 88. For Kiribati food poverty lines were derived from the actual food expenditure and consumption patterns of households in the lowest three deciles of p.c.a.e. expenditure, as recorded in the daily expenditure diaries. Comparative analyses in other Pacific countries has shown that while there is generally little difference in using the \u201cmodel menu\u201d approach and the actual food expenditure the former tends, on average, to give a higher Box 4: The Food Poverty Line The food component of the poverty line is almost universally anchored to nutritional requirements for good health. This does not generate a unique monetary poverty line, since many bundles of food goods yield the same nutrition. In practice, a diet is chosen which accords with prevailing consumption patterns, about which one might expect to arrive at a consensus in most settings. Ravallion 1998 Table 9 Proportion of Own Production in Food Consumption % of total food consumed Ranked by HH per capita adult equivalent expenditure deciles National South Tarawa Rest of Gilberts Line & Phoenix Average all Households 34.5 30.2 53.2 54.2 Lowest Quintile 29.6 26.2 38.1 57.8 Lowest Three Deciles 33.0 33.3 42.8 60.0 Highest Quintile 32.3 25.9 52.0 46.8 27 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence cost than the actual food expenditure from the household diaries. Since the model menus address not just the calorie value of the diet but the broader nutritional parameters this is to be expected. Using the model menu method would therefore also tend to push up the estimated level of poverty. 89. Separate FPLs have been estimated for the three sub-regions, and a weighted average for the national level. This approach gives a good reflection of local consumption preferences even though these may not provide an \u201coptimal\u201d diet in nutrition terms. This has become the preferred approach and has been used in other regional poverty analyses. 90. The principal items of expenditure, including items of own production consumed, are summarised in Appendix Tables B1 through B4.

This is a normative judgment, though some judgments are more defensible than others. Nutritional requirements for good health are a widely accepted anchor for determining basic foods needs. A defensible approach is to set the food component of the poverty lineaccording to the local cost of a bundle of food goods that meet the pre-determined minimum food-energy requirements in a way that is consistent with prevailing food tastes. How should food-energy requirements be determined? Nutritionists have estimated requirements for maintain- ing body weight when a person is resting, processing food and doing various activities. The food-energy requirements needed to maintain each person\u2019s actual activity level should not be considered binding when setting poverty lines. The poorest are often underweight, which often constraints their activity levels. In such a setting, incorporating existing differences in activity levels (and indeed weights) inro sub-group poverty lines need not be clearly anchored to a fixed standard of living. A better practise is to use the average food- energy requirement for each age group.

Thus the cost of acquiring a minimum adult equivalent diet in South Tarawa is estimated at A$1.57 p.c.a.e. per day Chart 5 Top 12 Food Items HH in L3D: Rural Rice 24.1 Fish (lagoon) 15.2 Sugar 14.0", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cef9d02-6b1c-4bae-acf8-11618607df44": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cef9d02-6b1c-4bae-acf8-11618607df44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82fb6fba8989325ed16ada3c4c649dede35ad46a1d1190f141dbee41dee77ef4"}, "3": {"node_id": "38435c00-063a-4dc9-91a0-7dbf4fb6f02b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "677bca7894d27301a6df10f416cee57cede4a7a342b10e1459e9340d93e91fe8"}}, "hash": "505a544742c89133910a65df8ca6d82cd4685f5f549fa3d2f0e89140fde85648", "text": "Breadfruit 8.2 Toddy 6.2 Flour 4.0 Tinned Mackerel 3.0 Other fresh vegetables 2.7 Coconut 1.8 Tinned Corned Beef 1.4 Doughnut 1.3 Tea 1.8 Chart 6 Top 12 Food Items HH in L3D: Linnix Rice 16.8 Fish (lagoon) 16.5 Sugar 3.5 Pumpkin 2.2 Breadfruit 4.2 Toddy 24.1 Tinned Mackerel 2.0 Other fresh vegetables 1.7 Te Taari (saltfish) 1.5 Te Mwanai (crabs) 1.3 Coconut 2.2 Tinned Corned Beef 1.8 18 The Pacific Islands Food Composition Tables, Second Edition, USP/FAO, 2004 29 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence and A$10.97 per week; for the rural Gilberts HH the costs are estimated at A$1.11 p.c.a.e. per day and A$7.74 per week, and for Linnix HH A$1.57 p.c.a.e. per day and A$10.99 per week. Applying a weighted average across the three sub-regions gives a national average food poverty lines of A$1.30 p.c.a.e. per day and A$9.07 per week. These are the Food Poverty Lines used in the analysis, Table 10. The differences between the sub-regions in the level of the FPL represent the variations in the actual food expenditure patterns, the balance between purchased and own-produced items and the differences in the prices applied to calculate the cost of the diets. 96. Table 11 indicates that a HH in the lowest three expenditure deciles would need to \u201cspend\u201d considerably more on food living in South Tarawa, A$104.42 per week, compared to a HH in the lowest three deciles in the rural areas, A$48.32. This reflects the higher basic FPL in South Tarawa compared with the rural areas, as well as the larger HH size in Tarawa as indicated in Table 2 above. 6. The Basic Needs Poverty Line 6.1 Non-Food Basic Needs Expenditure 97. The FPL is the core of the BNPL calculation. However, in practice even a low-income or low-expenditure family cannot be expected to survive on food alone; there are always other minimum costs of basic needs for survival. Therefore an allowance for non-food basic needs expenditure is added to the value of the Food Poverty Line to arrive at the \u201cBasic Needs Poverty Line\u201d. 98. The allowance for basic non-food expenditure is estimated from the HIES based on the level or proportion of non-food costs reported by households at defined levels of total expenditure. The costs of non-food basic-needs might include expenditure for housing/shelter, essential transport and communications, school fees and other education related costs, medical expenses and clothing. 99. There are a number of generally accepted methods of calculating non-food expenditures for the poverty lines. The World Bank suggests that a \u201cnon-food factor\u201d should be applied to the Food Poverty Line based on the proportion of non-food expenditure actually incurred by households which have an average total income/expenditure equal to or less than the Food Poverty Line, see Box 6. This is intended to represent the bare minimum additional expenditure required to meet non-food basic needs. Households whose total income/expenditure is equal only to the Food Poverty Line have to choose very carefully between food and non-food items; any expenditure on non-food items can be seen as being an essential trade-off between basic food and basic non-food. 100. Alternative methods may be to calculate an absolute amount of non-food expenditure for a particular category of households. This could be for the lowest income/expenditure quintile, the lowest three or four deciles or for any particular decile as may be chosen. The higher-up the income deciles that the reference point is chosen, so the greater will be the level of non-food expenditure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38435c00-063a-4dc9-91a0-7dbf4fb6f02b": {"__data__": {"id_": "38435c00-063a-4dc9-91a0-7dbf4fb6f02b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82fb6fba8989325ed16ada3c4c649dede35ad46a1d1190f141dbee41dee77ef4"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cef9d02-6b1c-4bae-acf8-11618607df44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "505a544742c89133910a65df8ca6d82cd4685f5f549fa3d2f0e89140fde85648"}}, "hash": "677bca7894d27301a6df10f416cee57cede4a7a342b10e1459e9340d93e91fe8", "text": "Table 10 Weekly Per Capita Adult Equivalent Food Poverty Lines Food Poverty Line per capita ae per day per capita ae per week per HH per week A$ average for HH in lowest three deciles National average 1.30 9.07 63.54 South Tarawa 1.57 10.97 104.42 Rest of Gilberts 1.11 7.74 48.32 Line & Phoenix 1.57 10.99 84.39 Table 11 Weekly Per Capita Basic Needs Poverty Lines A$ per capita adult equivalent per week Food Poverty Line Estimated Non-Food Expenditure Basic Needs Poverty Line Weekly cost per HH in L3D A B C = A+B D National average 9.07 7.03 16.09 112.80 South Tarawa 10.97 13.25 24.22 230.57 Rest of Gilberts 7.74 5.60 13.34 83.31 Line & Phoenix 10.99 9.39 20.38 156.53 30 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 101.

For this analysis, consistent with other analyses undertaken for Pacific Island countries, the average actual level of non-food expenditure for HH in the lowest three deciles has been taken as the basis for the non-food factor. The amounts of expenditure on basic non-food items from the survey indicate that the bottom-three deciles HH in South Tarawa would need to spend A$13.25 p.c.a.e per week on non-food essentials. For the other sub-regions the amounts were A$9.39 for Linnix and A$5.60 for the rural Gilberts, see Table 11. Thus the pattern of higher non-food expenditure the greater the degree of urbanisation holds true. 103. The actual average non-food expenditure recorded by households with adult equivalent per capita expenditure in the lowest three expenditure deciles therefore provides the essential non-food basic needs component which is added to the food poverty line to give the Basic Needs Poverty Line (BNPL). The BNPL is calculated by adding this non-food basic needs expenditure to the food poverty line. 6.2 Basic Needs Poverty Lines 104. Adding these non-food amounts to the respective sub-regional FPL gives the cost of meeting basic needs for South Tarawa as A$24.22 p.c.a.e. per week, equivalent to A$230.57 per household per week in adult equivalent terms; for the rural Gilberts the weekly amount required to meet basic needs on the outer islands is estimated at A$13.34 p.c.a.e. per week, equivalent to A$83.31 per household. In the Line islands the costs are almost as high as in Tarawa; A$20.38 p.c.a.e per week, equivalent to A$156.53 per household, see Table 11 and Chart 7. Chart 7 illustrates clearly the higher cost of providing food and non-food basic needs in the urban centre of South Tarawa and also, what is in effect, a quasi-urban environment in the Line Islands where communications and transport present particular problems. As in the case of the FPL the larger size of HH in Tarawa, especially those with the lowest expenditure deciles pushes up the total HH costs of meeting basic needs for the whole HH. These are the Basic Needs Poverty Lines that are used to estimate the level of poverty incidence in Kiribati in the next Section. Box 6 Step two: the non-food component The next problem is making an allowance for nonfood consumption. In principle, one could proceed the same way for non-food goods--identify a normative bundle of such goods, and cost that bundle separately in each region, sector or date. However, anchoring the nonfood part of the poverty line is often difficult. There is even less agreement on the normative standard (comparable to food requirements). And comparable data on nonfood prices are rarely available. Consistency with the consumption behavior of those who are found to be \u201cfood poor\u201d is a defensible guide. A \u201cbasic nonfood good\u201d can be defined as one that a person wants enough to forgo a \u201cbasic food\u201d. One can thus measure the nonfood component of the poverty line as the expected value of nonfood spending by a household that is just capable of affording the food component of the poverty line. This value constitutes the minimum allowance for nonfood goods consistent with being able to afford the bundle of food goods needed to reach food-energy requirements by prevailing diets. But again, that choice is a value judgment, and in some settings a more generous allowance might be considered appropriate. The key point is that the allowance should be equally \u201cgenerous\u201d for different groups if the poverty comparison is to be of use in guiding policies for fighting absolute poverty.

The Incidence and Depth of Poverty in Kiribati 7.1 Head Count Ratio 106. On the basis of the per capita a.e. Food and Basic Needs Poverty Lines in Table 11, the incidence of poverty observed from the household per capita expenditure in the HIES data is summarised in Table 12: Incidence of Poverty for Population and Households. The incidence of poverty is measured by the \u201cHead Count Index\u201d which indicates the proportion of either households or population which had expenditure less than the relevant poverty line. 7.2 Incidence of Food Poverty 107. Table 12 and Chart 8 show that the level of food poverty, those households with per capita adult equivalent expenditure less than the Food Poverty Line (generally referred to as \u201cabsolute\u201d or severe poverty), the poorest of the poor, is low. The data suggests that on average over the whole of Kiribati about 4% or one-in-twenty-five households, representing 5.0% of the population have expenditure which would be insufficient to meet basic food needs as defined by the food poverty line. In all areas, with the exception of the Southern Gilberts, the estimated rate of food poverty being experienced is in fact very low; at most 2.5%. However in the Southern Gilberts the survey results suggest that the rate could be as high as 11% or about one-in-nine households. This pushes up the national average rate. The Southern Gilberts are the most remote islands in the Gilberts Group and are generally amongst the smallest islands; they are vulnerable to drought and experience periodic problems with shipping and resupply. They have limited resources for own-production, as noted above, and if resupply is interrupted there can be serious issues of food security in these islands. 108. However even those HH which are in theory experiencing food poverty may not necessarily be going hungry in practice. Rather, they are likely to be consuming a poor diet with inadequate nutrition and are thus more likely to experience health problems as a result, as indicated in Section 4.2 above. These health problems may then translate into lowered learning abilities in children at school and less likelihood of adults getting employment; a perpetuation of the cycle or hardship and poverty. The reported increases in non-communicable diseases, many of which are related to diet (diabetes, hypertension, and high blood-pressure), suggest that many households do indeed have a poor level of nutrition whilst at the same time having sufficient to eat.

The estimated incidence of basic needs poverty is also shown in Table 13 and Chart 9. Nationally it is estimated that 17.0% of households, representing 21.8% of the population, had weekly per capita a.e expenditure less than the basic needs poverty line. South Tarawa at 18.3% of HH (24.2% of the population) had the highest proportion of HH with per capita a.e expenditure below the BNPL. The rest of the Gilberts, representing the rural areas were very similar in aggregate with recorded basic needs poverty incidence of 17.9% and 22.0% of HH and population respectively. As with the indicated incidence of food poverty, the rate of basic needs poverty estimated for the Southern Gilberts was significantly higher than for the other Northern and Central Gilberts groups. In most parts of the Pacific region it has been observed that rural poverty tends to be lower than that estimated to exist in the urban centres.

Thus although more HH fell below the rural BNPL the largest number of people falling below the poverty line was to be found on South Tarawa. 111. The figures of basic needs poverty incidence suggest that although South Tarawa is the national capital, and therefore the general centre of employment, there are, nevertheless, many households whose expenditure cannot cover the basic-needs costs of a reasonable, minimum standard of living. There are many who might be classified as working poor, especially those engaged in small private businesses and micro-enterprises where hourly rates are low. They may be in employment, either full or part-time, but their income and thus expenditure is insufficient to meet all the needs of their families. 7.4 Vulnerability of Households to Falling into Poverty 112. The recent rapid increases in the price of imported fuel and foods, notably rice and cereal products which, as already noted, feature prominently in the diets of households in Kiribati, will likely be causing many additional households and individuals with income/expenditure levels just above the poverty lines to be experiencing increasing degrees of hardship and difficulty in meeting their basic-needs expenditure. These households are therefore becoming increasingly vulnerable to falling into poverty. 113.

Based on an estimated increase in the poverty line of 10% (a fall in real income of 10%) it is estimated that the additional number of people vulnerable to falling below the BNPL would be 2907 on South Tarawa and 1325 in the rural Gilberts. These would represent an additional 7.4 percentage points and 3.4 percentage points of the population falling into poverty respectively. An additional 7.0% of the Linnix population would also fall below the poverty line. Together a ten percent fall in real incomes of the vulnerable would raise the national level of poverty incidence to 27.4% or by 5.6 percentage points. A twenty percent fall in real incomes would raise the national poverty level to 33.8%. 115. This level of vulnerability is very similar to that seen in other Pacific countries; on average it is estimated that a ten percent decline in real incomes would be associated with an increase of five percentage points in the level of basic needs poverty incidence. Thus across the region, with the recent sharp rises in food and fuel prices, and with a slowing in economic growth most Pacific countries would have experienced an increase in the poverty rate over the last eighteen months. 7.5 Depth and Severity of Poverty 116. The Head Count ratio discussed in the previous paragraphs does not give any indication of the seriousness of the poverty being experienced. For example are those households that are below the poverty line just below it, or are they well below? This analysis is referred to as the depth and severity of poverty. 117. The depth and severity of poverty are measured by the Poverty Gap Index19 (PGI) and the Squared Poverty Gap Index (SPGI)20 respectively, Table 14. The former is a measure of the depth of poverty being experienced by each household below the basic needs poverty line. The latter measures the severity of poverty by giving more weight to the poorest households whose poverty gap is greatest. The PGI is Indicator 2 of Target 1, Goal 1 of the MDGs. 118.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2da34f71-0759-499b-bb3d-f4477851699c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2da34f71-0759-499b-bb3d-f4477851699c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ab0d63130847a08ebd480a4fbd9fe37cc5098cc937937d985de15f2906a4b9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa4d50e4-f63d-4857-ae6b-c840734f1cda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91ae535dedefa4d72274212e3ae19fa5bc7fe32f10fa37670317a6d5c8091fa5"}}, "hash": "df71c568a7efe6d56bde5e4ba0a3f335fd6dae668a88d57fb76f933474f5d2e5", "text": "118.

The index for South Tarawa was 8.5. The indices suggest that households falling below the BNPL in the rural area and in Tarawa have expenditure that is, on average, around 8.5% below the basic needs poverty level. This means that the average poor HH would need to have a real increase in its income of about ten percent to move it above the poverty line. 119. The SPGI, which is a measure of the severity of poverty being experienced, is estimated at 3.5 nationally. This is lower than the recent estimate for Fiji, 5.1, similar to Tonga, 4.0 but above that for Samoa, 2.6. These indices suggest that Kiribati experiences a generally similar level of poverty depth and severity to other regional countries.

The formula calculates the mean distance below the basic needs poverty line as a proportion of the poverty line where the mean is taken over the whole population, counting the non-poor as having zero poverty gap. The PGI is an important indicator as recognised by its inclusion as a specific indicator in MDG1. m Poverty Gap Index: 1/N*(\u2211(BNPL- yi)/BNPL i=1 where: N = total number of households, m = number of households below basic needs poverty line; and yi equals expenditure of each household. 20 Through the process of squaring the index the SPGI gives greater weight to those at the lowest consumption/income levels and thus better reflects the severity of the poverty gap. In both the PGI and SPGI, the higher the index the greater the depth and severity of poverty, respectively. 34 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 8. Income Distribution and Inequality 120. Levels of income distribution and inequality can be illustrated in a number of ways. Chart 10 plots the Lorenz Curve of total household expenditure and Table 15 summarises the Gini Coefficients (where a higher coefficient indicates greater inequality and a lower one represents great equality). The Lorenz Curves are a graphical representation of the Gini Coefficient in that the farther away the distribution from the centre line, the greater the degree of inequality. 121. Figures for the Gini Coefficient indicate that the level of inequality in Kiribati is relatively low by Pacific standards with the national Gini being 0.39, and that for South Tarawa 0.35. The Gini was slightly higher for the rural Gilberts, 0.42, as there appears to be a big difference in the levels of expenditure between the Southern islands and the other parts of the Gilberts group. 122. Chart 11 and Appendix Table A6 show the share of expenditure incurred by each decile for the various sub-regions. On average over the whole of Kiribati, the poorest ten-percent of households incurred about 2.5% of all expenditure while the top decile of households incurred around one- fifth (22.0%). As the Chart illustrates there were some variations between the sub-regions: in South Tarawa HH in the bottom decile had 5% of the expenditure, while the bottom decile in the rural Gilberts only enjoyed 3% of total expenditure in the rural areas. 123. The ratio of the share of the bottom quintile to the top quintile of HH (MDG Indicator 3 of target 1, Goal 1) was 4.7 at both the national level and in the rural Gilberts. In South Tarawa the ratio was 2.7 with the Line Islands also being similar to this at 2.9. 9. Who Are the Poor and What are their Characteristics? 9.1 Location of the Rural Poor 124.

It can be seen that some 50% of the poor reside in South Tarawa, which has an estimated 45% of the total population, thus there is a slightly higher chance of being poor and living on South Tarawa than in the rural Gilberts. The Line Islands have an estimated 9.7% of the total population but only 4% of the poor, thus there is less chance of being poor and living in the Line Group. 9.2 Gender 126. Chart 1 and Table 3 above indicated that on average females accounted for about one-in-five households in Kiribati. The highest proportion of female headed HH were found in both Tarawa and the rural Gilberts where the rate reached almost one-in-four amongst those HH in the lowest deciles. Thus it may be observed that such female headed HH are slightly more likely to be poor than average. On South Tarawa female HHH are also over represented in the highest quintile, accounting for 27.8% of all HH, but are under-represented in the highest quintile in the rural Gilberts, only 18.3%. In the Line and Phoenix Islands female HHH are under-represented all round with only one-in-ten HH being headed by a female. 127. Female HH households do however appear to be particularly disadvantaged in the Northern Gilberts. According to the survey female headed HH accounted for only 13.9% of all HH in the north, but almost 30% of HH in the lowest three deciles were recorded as being headed by females. 128. Females are estimated to account for 48.5% of those falling below the BNPL. Table 17 and chart 13 illustrate the distribution of all females by sub- region and by decile. Further detail of working age females is provided in Appendix Table A7. From this table it is estimated that there are 12,074 working age females on South Tarawa and 10,383 in the rural Gilberts. Of the 7,900 females living in HH in the lowest three deciles, two-thirds are located in the rural Gilberts and only just over one-quarter on South Tarawa. Thus of the 10,383 working age females in the rural Gilberts approximately 50%, or around 5,000 are in the bottom three deciles, and are thus either poor or vulnerable to poverty in the current situation. 9.3 Children in Poverty 129. According to the survey, there were 32,791 children under the age of 15 years, accounting for 38.0% of the population. The distribution of children through the sub-regions is shown in Table 18 and Chart 14. Appendix Table A8 shows further detail of female children. It is estimated that there were an average of 2.3 children per household overall, however amongst HH in the bottom three deciles the numbers of children was 3.6 on South Tarawa, 3.1 per HH in Linnix and 2.5 in the rural Gilberts. In contrast the numbers of children per HH were much lower in the higher deciles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3880c8df-31b5-4aad-b931-ee6b108eb7ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "3880c8df-31b5-4aad-b931-ee6b108eb7ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3637d49305cc27d8d20f5079f0945379b62ce8afb26f35fd6d5760e2a869dba"}, "2": {"node_id": "241b5fd3-b794-47a3-8f65-31f7364fe8b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2271693eaac6f521f98ff21429ab25314f4600f2946401dd09b639cab3c94ef6"}}, "hash": "76c402a2a6a14b0241989a855a93e84aabef54b1e26fdef8b007dca9c97dcaa8", "text": "In contrast the numbers of children per HH were much lower in the higher deciles.

Of the children living in these HH fifty percent are living in the lowest three deciles. Further it is estimated that 22.5% of all children live in female HHH and of these just under one third are in HH in the lowest three deciles. In the rural Gilberts 28.3% of children lived in HH headed by elderly persons and of these 61% of the children were in HH in the lowest three deciles. Thus it would seem that children left in the care of elderly relatives on the outer islands are very vulnerable to being in the poorest households. 132. The situation appears equally risky for those children living in female headed households in the rural Gilberts. The survey indicates that one-third of all children in the rural Gilberts live in HH headed by females, but of these fifty percent are in the bottom three deciles. 133. These figures also point to the increasing levels of dependency in the outer islands. 9.4 Age of Household Heads 134. Table 19 provides a summary of the location and decile of households headed by those over 60 years. The highest proportion of HH with elderly heads is to be found in the rural Gilberts, at 15.6% with the lowest proportion in the Line Islands, only 7.9%. The proportion of elderly headed HH in South Tarawa is estimated at 11.7%. However in both South Tarawa and the rural Gilberts the proportion of elderly headed HH in the lowest three deciles is around one-in-five or 20%. At the top end, the proportion of elderly headed HH in the highest two deciles was ten percent in South Tarawa and only 6.5% in the rural Gilberts. It was even lower, 4.3% in the Line Islands, but equally the proportion of elderly headed HH falling in the bottom three deciles was also lower in the Line Islands. 135.

Lack of employment or other income generating activities is often a primary cause of a household experiencing hardship and poverty. Indeed it is often found that even households that have one or more employed persons still fall below the poverty line if the employment is in the low-wage or informal sectors. This is especially true in large households with many children or old persons, in other words those with a high dependency ratio. These are termed the \u201cworking-poor\u201d and would seem from the survey results that many such households exist in Kiribati. 137. The survey data indicates that on average 18.6% of all households are without any member in employment and a further 5.7% have only one worker in the household. However thirty-eight percent of HH with no workers are in the bottom three deciles, as are 13.5% of those HH with just one worker. 138.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0b8162e-c9d3-4f3e-b92d-3f83ff66743f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0b8162e-c9d3-4f3e-b92d-3f83ff66743f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3dfb227a4f64eb7ff460de1f75e323c4d3744b01e462684685d79f39ad9e0f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a0d4964-d5cb-4ed5-8d79-a8316f01ea3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76fd103f1dbb2503cb3228a9b807b3a02cc11f7cb55f886f1ee2bb3b45079ad8"}}, "hash": "dc3a12cc4cffe048250bd5794ab0fc99b147cf5d4c09b4aff63ce5a11427cac9", "text": "138.

Further details of activity status of all working age persons are provided in Appendix Table A11, and disaggregated specifically for females of working age by sub-region in Appendix Tables A12a through A12c, Chart 16 illustrates. On South Tarawa approximately 30% of all females reported being in full or part-time employment. For those in the top quintile the proportion was about 36%, and for those in the bottom quintile only 26%. In the rural Gilberts the proportion of females in employment in the top quintile was still quite high at 25% reflecting the number of nurses and teachers in the formal sector in the rural areas. For other females in the rural areas the level of employment reported was very low, only 5% of those in the bottom quintile and lowest three deciles. Most rural females in the lowest three deciles were engaged in home duties, around 30%, or claimed to be unemployed, 38 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence approximately 40%. Many of these latter would also no doubt be engaged in subsistence activities and home duties in the village economy. On South Tarawa in contrast, only 10% of females reported being primarily involved in home duties. 141. Although the definition of unemployed can be had to quantify in a subsistence or semi-subsistence environment, the survey data indicates that amongst the bottom three deciles around 40% of all persons claimed to unemployed. Even amongst those in the top quintile of HH the rate of unemployment was reported at 30%. For females in the lowest three deciles the rate in the rural Gilberts was around 45%. 142. These apparently very high, and seemingly rising levels of unemployment compared to the levels reported in the census, are a serious issue for concern. According to the ADB\u2019s 2008 economic report approximately 2000 young people enter the labour force each year. Of these only approximately 500 are likely to find employment in the formal sector of the domestic economy or in regular overseas employment as seafarers, fishermen, cruise-ship crew or care-workers. There are therefore an estimated 1500 young persons to be absorbed into the informal economy each year, in the absence of employment opportunities many of these will become the unemployed, or underemployed of the future. 9.6 Educational Attainment 143. Education is generally acknowledged as being one of the most critical factors in influencing whether a household is likely to be in poverty, and whether it will be able to rise out of such a condition. It is therefore a concern that in Kiribati, at the national level, some 13.7% of all household heads reported having had no schooling at all, with a further 43.8% reporting only primary as the highest level of attainment. The connection with poverty is illustrated by the fact that in the poorest three deciles the reported rate of no-schooling was 16.5%, with about a further sixty percent only reaching a maximum of primary level. Approaching from the other perspective only twenty-percent of HH in the bottom three deciles had a HH head with a junior secondary or better level of educational attainment, Appendix Table A13. 144. The same high level of low educational attainment is reflected in the adult population as a whole. The survey indicates that 12.3% of the total adult population reported having had no education, with a further 35.8% reporting only primary level as having been reached.

Chart 17 shows the nature of energy use for cooking used by HH in the sub-regions and across deciles. In the rural Gilberts and the Line islands more than three-quarters of all HH rely on wood fuel and open fires for cooking. 39 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Gas Burner Gas Burner Gas Burner Kerosene Burner Stove Kerosene Burner Stove Kerosene Burner Stove Wood Stove or open fire Wood Stove or open fire Wood Stove or open fire All Persons Rest of the Gilberts Linnix Average all Households Lowest Quintile Lowest Three Deciles Highest Quintile % of HH Chart 17 Primary Use of Energy for Cooking Even on South Tarawa almost one-quarter of HH in the lowest two and three deciles till use wood and open fires. The remainder of HH on South Tarawa primarily use kerosene stoves, only the in the highest quintile is the use of gas significant. The use of electricity for cooking does not feature at all. In the rural Gilberts and in the Line Islands kerosene is a minor source of cooking fuel, mainly used by those in the higher expenditure deciles; additional detail is provided in Appendix Tables A15a through to A15c. 147. In the outer island areas there is therefore very little use of energy sources other than firewood. This suggests that the cost (and lack of availability) of purchased fuel is a deterrent to its use and that there is a relatively easy availability of firewood, either in the local market or from self-collection. It is only in the higher expenditure deciles where \u201cclean\u201d fuel becomes a major source of cooking energy. 148. Thus while there may be significant health benefits, especially for women and young children, from the use of \u201cclean\u201d energy sources for cooking, the cost of such fuels compared to the \u201cfree\u201d source of firewood is likely to 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Electric, mains or generator Electric, mains or generator Electric, mains or generator South Tarawa Rural Gilberts Linnix Solar powered Solar powered Solar powered Kerosene or spirit lamp Kerosene or spirit lamp Kerosene or spirit lamp Oil lamp or other Oil lamp or other Oil lamp or other Average Lowest Quintile Highest Quintile % of HH Chart 18 Primary Energy Use for Lighting 40 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence be difficult to overcome. Changing to clean fuels might also require significant changes in traditional cooking methods and food types. Any change will therefore likely need to be slow and gradual. 149. Although electricity is not used at all for cooking purposes it is widely used on South Tarawa and in the Line Islands for lighting, see Chart 18. For most HH in the rest of the Gilberts, and particularly those in the lowest decile, kerosene or oil lamps and the main source of lighting. Solar power is however the lighting power source for about one-quarter of HH in the lowest quintile and around one-third of those in the highest quintile. The availability of this lighting source is of significant advantage to those who have access to it, albeit it is necessary to ensure good maintenance of the equipment for sustainability; additional detail on lighting energy are at Appendix tables A16a through A16c. 9.8 Access to Water and Sanitation 150. Access to both safe water and good sanitation facilities are important factors in ensuring good health for children and adults alike. Access to these two is therefore a key issue in considering poverty and hardship alleviation. The environmental health conditions and the availability of quality water and safe sanitation in the overcrowded areas of South Tarawa are of particular concern. 151.

This is reflected in the fact that only amongst the top quintile HH are piped supplies a significant source. Just under one-quarter of top quintile HH in the rest of the Gilberts have piped supplies compared to only 10% of HH in the lowest quintile. For most HH, three-quarters of the lowest three deciles and sixty percent of the top quintile, public or HH wells are the primary source of water supply. Only in the Line Islands is the piped supply widely accessible with around 90% of all HH having access. 152. On South Tarawa approximately 70% of all HH reported having a flush sanitation system; however the proportion was only around 57% of those in the lowest quintile compared with eighty percent in the top quintile. For HH in the bottom quintile almost one-quarter had no sanitation and a further 15% had the traditional over-water closet. In both these cases there is a high risk of pollution and infection from unsafe systems. 153. In the rest of the Gilberts few HH have flush sanitation systems, see Chart 20 and Appendix Tables A18a through A18c. Like the piped water supplies, these improved sanitation facilities are usually associated with government building and quarters. For most village-based HH in the rural Gilberts the sanitation system is of a traditional sort, either the over-water closet type or a household pit. One third of HH and sixteen percent respectively for those in the bottom quintile. Approximately 40% of HH in the bottom quintile in the outer islands reported not having any sanitation system, this means in effective that either lagoon or ocean beach-fronts are used. While such practices are far less of a public health risk in the relatively sparsely populated islands, the significant proportion of HH without proper facilities on South Tarawa in a major health concern. 154. In the Line Islands between forty to fifty percent of HH have access to flush systems, with a further twenty percent using a household pit. This latter being an approximately similar proportion to those HH in the rest of the Gilberts. Some thirty percent of HH in the bottom quintile nevertheless reported having no sanitation system. 155. It has been noted in Section 9.3 on children that there are many children living in households in the lowest two and three deciles. It is also clear that many HH in the lowest three deciles do not have adequate safe water supplies or sanitation systems, particularly those in the overcrowded parts of South Tarawa.

Improvements to water supplies were highlighted as one of the priorities for hardship alleviation by many households on South Tarawa and the outer islands during the participatory assessments in 2005. Although many houses on South Tarawa (and the outer islands) are made from traditional materials there are also many permanent- 42 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence roofed public and community buildings that could be used to improve rainwater catchment and storage. Much storable rainwater is presently lost through inadequate guttering and storage facilities. A programme to support additional water storage could have significant benefits for many families who presently do not have access to safe water supplies through the public system. 10. Conclusions 10.1 Poverty of Income/Expenditure or Opportunity? 157. This analysis has highlighted the disadvantages being experienced by the poorest households in Kiribati in their lack of access particularly to safe water and sanitation, and to the low-level of educational attainment amongst many in the bottom three deciles. It further highlights the reported high level of unemployment that is reported by those with poor education exacerbating their conditions of hardship and poverty. Thus poverty and hardship are multi-dimensional issues. The social and economic problems associated with hardship and poverty are only likely to ease if the economic can be supported to growth and increase employment and income earning opportunities. 158. The national poverty lines and levels of incidence of poverty between the different parts of the country are the \u201cheadline\u201d indicators. They are the basic building blocks on which poverty alleviation strategies can be founded. Far more important from a policy perspective is to analyse the specific characteristics, and where possible, the causes of low-income/expenditure and poverty in the disadvantaged sections of society. Policy-makers at the sector level, and those responsible for framing the national strategies need to know who-the-poor-are, why- are-they-poor, and specifically, what-are-the-characteristics of the poor and poor households, so that targeted poverty alleviation measures can be initiated. 159. The BNPL measures the incidence of \u201cincome or expenditure\u201d poverty but this is just one aspect of poverty or hardship. Families might have low incomes/expenditure, but through good household budgeting and prioritising of expenditure, might still be reasonably well-fed and healthy. Nevertheless they are still likely to live in conditions where they experience varying degrees of hardship. As this paper indicates the poorest households might lack access to basic services, especially water and sanitation if they are in parts of urban Tarawa or in some of the remote outer islands for example. Similarly, they might lack access to adequate health, education and transport facilities. These weaknesses in access can be especially difficult in the outer islands. A combination of low educational attainment, socio-cultural factors relating to age, gender and other personal characteristics may also limit freedom of choice, or socio-economic opportunity. 160. This poverty of opportunity, e.g. lack of access to basic health and education services, employment opportunities, standards of good governance and equal opportunities across gender and age, is now regarded as just as important in defining the extent of poverty and hardship in a society as is the lack of income/expenditure. Often the conditions and circumstances giving rise to the poverty of opportunity are the causes of income/expenditure poverty. Alleviating poverty of opportunity will help to increase incomes and wealth. 161. The analysis in this paper has therefore aimed to provide a basis for this to be carried forward to this policy level. Much of the information and analysis in this report has not been available to policy-makers in Kiribati before. This is the first comprehensive household survey to be carried-out through the country. 10.2 How Does Poverty Affect People 162. Households with income or expenditure levels below the basic needs poverty line will not necessarily be going hungry, although their diet is likely to be poor in nutrition. It is more likely that, whilst they are probably not going hungry they are, nevertheless, struggling to meet their daily/weekly living expenses, particularly those 43 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence that require cash payments (food, power, transport, school fees and other education costs, clothing, housing, medical costs etc).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68955e97-9091-4abb-b7ef-959ab2272b18": {"__data__": {"id_": "68955e97-9091-4abb-b7ef-959ab2272b18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c052430a406a2bc560ce6098b053f87f4d55520dece066eea04e828d25527a43"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c2f8b64-947f-45bb-80ee-7033263eaf17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf2c1245142b0f3fa711b42935973b57157da41b40935b65e48a0f85bd6d8a03"}}, "hash": "c86e7043b53cb72950ba980214e4464e79ee0de42c7fe013442229113bd4ac23", "text": "These families will be constantly trying to balance their incomes with their expenditure and frequently something has to be given up, a trade-off will have to be made between one bill and another, food or fees. 163.

This may be particularly the case for children in the urban centres where local produce, and especially home-grown produce, may not be readily available in household diets. Poor diet and inadequate nutrition are critical issues for the health of children now, and for their future health as adults. The data on food expenditure and consumption for the poorest households provides valuable information for health and nutrition authorities to develop targeted health awareness programmes. 164. The data should also be very valuable to agriculture sector policy makers to target extension and other services to improve local crop production for domestic markets as import replacements. Helping to improve food security, particular for the urban centre of Tarawa, would be an important additional benefit. 165. Urban drift leading to higher levels of unemployment and growing numbers of people living in squatter-type settlements and sub-standard housing conditions result in a deteriorating social environment. Poor housing conditions lead to poor health, poor educational attainment and poor employment prospects, conditions which perpetuate poverty and hardship. The levels of urban hardship and poverty indicated by the analysis of the 2006 HIES point to a wide range of issues that need to be addressed by government policy. Strengthening educational achievement and skill levels, increasing opportunities for employment, not only in the urban centres but also in the rural areas, are amongst the most critical. 44 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 166. Poverty and hardship in the Kiribati context means having to make choices on a daily or weekly basis between the competing demands for household expenditure and the limited availability of cash income to meet that expenditure. Many households struggle to pay bills and, in the absence of home gardens in the Tarawa urban area, to purchase adequate food. They borrow regularly from informal lenders who often charge very high interest rates for small unsecured loans to meet family commitments and community obligations. They will also run-up trade-store debts or borrow from other family members. They are frequently, and occasionally constantly, in debt. 167. As a consequence many of the poorest in Kiribati society live in unregulated, low-quality housing without proper access to water, sanitation and other basic services. Children frequently miss school due to ill-health or because school fees or other associated costs have not been paid; many poor families simply cannot afford the costs of uniforms, books and other related items. Adults themselves are frequently poorly educated and thus unable to get anything but the lowest paid employment, if such employment is even available. The cycle of poverty can therefore be perpetuated. 168. Although hard to quantify with the available data it is widely held that one of the most critical issues is education. Many primary and junior secondary schools appear to be under-resourced and poorly maintained. Without a good basic education it is very difficult for the poor to move out of poverty. Higher income derives from having the ability to take advantage of economic opportunities, this means having an ability to read and write and learn skills. For those wishing to become seafarers or even to take temporary seasonal work under the RSE and similar schemes, a sound basic education is essential. For females where the greatest opportunities are in care-work a good basic education is even more important. 10.3 Impact of the Global Economic and Financial Situation 169. There are many challenges facing the Kiribati economy with high food and fuel prices and with the widening impact of global recession. Over the past six years the Kiribati economy has not performed well. Economic growth has been slow with little growth or no growth in per capita GDP. This will have likely led to a further increase in poverty and hardship after 2006. The recent food and fuel price rises will have exacerbated the situation, and as the above analysis has noted a ten percent increase in the real level of the BNPL could already have led to an increase of up to around five percentage points in the number of households and population falling below the basic needs poverty line. 170. Kiribati is a very open economy and is extensively integrated into the global economy through trade and tourism, finance and employment. It is therefore being impacted by the global economic slowdown in many ways. Jobs are being lost in the seafarer\u2019s sector, on fishing vessels and there is a slowing in demand for crew on cruise vessels. The reduction in cruise vessel", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3246814-9e9b-4141-8dbd-6c6e7fb34b46": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3246814-9e9b-4141-8dbd-6c6e7fb34b46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Kiribati Analysis of the 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/kiribati-analysis-2006-household-income-and-expenditure-survey", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a15304f77489bd19ad2c76164884d428a8fea65b4b450e67c91ec52b5511e78"}}, "hash": "2a15304f77489bd19ad2c76164884d428a8fea65b4b450e67c91ec52b5511e78", "text": "visits to the Line Islands is having a severe impact on the livelihoods of the people on the isolated island of Tabueran. The curtailment of international airline flights to Kiritimati Island is an additional constraint. Together these impacts are leading to a reduction in incomes and remittances. The recent price rises for basic food items is exacerbating the problems for many families causing further falls in their real incomes. The government\u2019s budget has been impacted by the fall in value of the nation\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the RERF, and is likely to be further impacted by reductions in tax and tariff revenues as domestic incomes fall with domestic economic activity already stagnant, slowing further. 171. The priorities of the people, as outlined in Box 1 above, highlight those issues which were deemed important for reducing hardship and poverty at the household and community levels. They provide indicators for government in terms of identifying the policy challenges for creating more economic and employment opportunities, improving infrastructure and access improved quality of services. Other studies have highlighted the need for improving the policy and regulatory environment for foreign investment, access to micro-finance and to markets, either inwards as source of tourism or outwards for potential exports. 45 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence 172. The analysis has identified that the extent of relative poverty and hardship within Kiribati is at a similar level to that being experienced by other PICs in the region. The costs of imported foods and non-food basic needs are high in Kiribati as a consequence of transport and the underlying business environment. But the opportunities for employment and income generation are low. 173. The government needs to commit to renewed economic and public sector reform and to improving governance standards and service delivery. There needs to be recognition of the increasing extent of hardship and poverty throughout the country. More attention needs to be given to addressing the needs of the disadvantaged and those who are being left behind. 174. Amongst the key issues facing Kiribati in addressing the growing signs of hardship and poverty are the need to: - improve standards of governance, including transparency and accountability; - strengthen the institutional and regulatory basis for renewed domestic economic growth and stability; - ensure fiscal discipline and sound financial management within the framework of the resources available and a sustainable investment and draw-down strategy from the RERF; - give greater emphasis to public enterprise reform, reducing subsidies and improving efficiency, promoting private sector investment, access to financial services for people and communities and the creation of new employment opportunities; - broaden and deepen the economic base of the economy, especially in strengthening the contribution of the agriculture sector, and to improve food security; - improve technical and vocational training opportunities in order to meet the skill needs of the private sector; of those who will need lifestyle skills to succeed in the rural economy; and for those who will seek employment overseas; and to - continue to improve the delivery of education, primary health care and health/nutrition education, particularly to those in the more remote islands. 175. At the micro level, it is necessary to address the specific needs of individual communities, islands and villages. This means promoting rural enterprise activities, especially in the agriculture sector, to create income generating opportunities as well as meeting particular local social development and infrastructure priorities. 176. The current high prices of imported food and fuel give many opportunities for domestic agriculture to provide import substitutes for the rice and cereal products that feature prominently in the diets of those in urban Tarawa. 177. In the social area small-scale hardship alleviation projects for improving water supplies, health services, sanitation and similar community based projects need to be priorities. The quality of basic service delivery needs to be improved, through better training of teachers, better staffing of schools and clinics, better maintenance of health and education facilities and infrastructure and improving the availability of essential teaching materials and medical supplies. 178. The potential for a continuing weakening in the fiscal situation in the face of high fuel prices and rising personnel costs in particular is a serious challenge and needs careful monitoring to ensure that fiscal discipline is maintained. Renewed economic growth needs to be generated in the domestic economy through an appropriate investment enabling environment and improving governance standards. Growth oriented, employment-creating strategies, need to be implemented to keep the macroeconomic side moving forward. 179.

The country did not benefit greatly during the period of sustained global expansion that has recently ended. High food and fuel prices, increasing unemployment amongst seafarers and the lack of new employment 46 Kiribati: Analysis of Poverty of 2006 HIES Estimation of National Poverty Lines and Poverty Incidence opportunities in the home economy will continue to limit economic opportunities for people in Kiribati. The global financial situation is likely to continue to have an adverse impact on the value of the RERF for many months, if not years, to come. This will impact adversely on the future fiscal situation. These challenges cannot be ignored. Poverty and hardship are already a reality for many households in Kiribati. Standards of living may already have declined as households have begun to feel the squeeze of higher prices. 180. Those living in the rural outer-islands have the option of falling back on coping strategies relying on increased subsistence production. This choice is not available to those living in the often overcrowded conditions on South Tarawa. Broadening the coverage of social protection schemes beyond the existing \u201cold-age pension\u201d could offer some relief to the most vulnerable. In other countries of the region, notably Vanuatu and Samoa, development partners have assisted governments to provide targeted pro-poor support for education related costs. Such a scheme, or a similar programme of conditional cash transfers for the most needy, could also be appropriate for Kiribati. 181. The opportunity of temporary migration to New Zealand, (and possibly Australia in the future) is becoming the option of choice for an increasing number of young people. But this out-migration may eventually become a threat to the viability of some of the smaller island communities, as is already occurring in some of the other Pacific countries. 182. The option of continuing to accept low rates of economic growth is no longer really sustainable for Kiribati. Hardship and basic-needs poverty are clearly prevalent in the country and the poor economic performance of recent years, exacerbated by the impacts of the global situation, is causing this to worsen. The Kiribati economy and the socio-economic environment are showing signs of serious strain and weakness. Living conditions for many low income and vulnerable households are not improving. The HDI, HPI and MDG indicators all point to areas of concern. Renewed emphasis on reform is needed if the economy is not to slip further behind in the current economic environment. 183.

Yet this is mostly far from reality. The major factors influencing disaster risks are human and social vulnerability, matched with the overall capacity to respond to or reduce the impact of natural hazards. Poverty is therefore a major factor increasing disaster risk, by increasing vulnerability to disasters and reducing existing coping capacities. It is only by addressing these two issues together that we can make the difference between a community trapped in a grinding poverty cycle, and one with secure lives and livelihoods. Another patch of common ground is that the poor suffer the most from disasters.1 94.25% of all people killed by disasters in from 1975-2000 were low income or lower-middle income people. The poorest people comprised 68% of deaths from disasters . These plain numbers are an indictment of socio- economic inequality, and a telling signpost to where disaster risk reduction must concentrate its efforts as of moral necessity. Furthermore, drought, cyclones, and flood seasons are repeatedly depriving the poor of their assets, livelihoods, and labour force, all too often locking them into endemic poverty cycles. Even in the poorest communities, however, there is a wealth of knowledge and experience on how to break this negative feedback cycle. From this set of good practices, for instance, water and environmental management emerge as a very prominent link between disaster risk reduction and poverty reduction. The examples of drought risk reduction initiatives highlighted in this publication are equally inspiring, and make intuitive sense. There is a need to further promote these initiatives, so that they can be scaled up or replicated on a wider scale. This publication has been precisely developed with this purpose in mind. We hope that it will inspire further practical action at the community level, and raise awareness on this critical issue. Mr. S\u00e1lvano Brice\u00f1o Director, United Nations, secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction 1 20th Century Asian Natural Disasters Data Book, Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), August 2002. v Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Preface Natural hazards, which are becoming more intense and frequent, have a devastating impact on the world\u2019s poor. A large-scale hazard that hits a highly vulnerable community with low capacity to cope, reverses hard-won development gains, entrenching people in poverty cycles, and increasing vulnerability. How to break these cycles is a huge challenge for governments, development practitioners and societies as a whole. Sustaining and protecting livelihoods of the poor and marginalized is a way to tackle poverty. This, however, is a huge task for poor communities, especially those that are vulnerable to natural hazards. In this context, the Special Unit for South-South Cooperation in UNDP is pleased to co-facilitate South-South knowledge development and solutions exchange for disaster risk management. This publication captures good practices and lessons learned in linking disaster risk reduction and poverty reduction from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It provides us with a glimpse of how non- governmental organisations are able to undertake projects and programmes that tackle both disaster risk reduction and poverty reduction at the same time. The cases presented show that communities\u2019 disaster risk reduction efforts in mitigation, preparedness, networking, local level insurance, shelter protection and water provision help contribute to poverty reduction. Similarly, it is noteworthy that poverty reduction efforts such as job and livelihoods creation and protection can help reduce disaster risks. It is therefore the Special Unit\u2019s privilege to continue the partnership with the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction in the publication of this series, and to continuously identify and share good practices on disaster risk reduction that benefit poor communities. This reinforces the link between activities that reduce disaster risks with poverty reduction initiatives. This link is vital for the achievement of sustainable development goals, particularly at the community level.

A first publication, entitled Building Disaster-Resilient Communities - Good Practices and Lessons Learned, was published by the Global Network in June 2007 to make the case for increased community-oriented disaster risk reduction action. Building on last year\u2019s effort, the present publication seeks to highlight initiatives that have successfully linked poverty reduction and disaster risk reduction in various parts of the world. It features several projects and programmes that show how disaster risk reduction can be integrated into poverty reduction initiatives (or vice-versa) to help reduce the vulnerability of the poor and protect their livelihoods and development gains. Disaster risk reduction and poverty reduction have also been selected as the theme of the 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction that will be produced by the UN/ISDR system for the second session of the GP/DRR3. Some of the case studies included in this publication will also feed into the 2009 Report, and will contribute to the analysis of the disaster risk/poverty interface. For ease of reference, an abstract is provided at the beginning of each good practice, and all are presented in a format that helps the reader to locate a particular section of the case study (lessons learned, potential for replication, and so forth). A specific section, entitled \u2018The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction\u2019, describes how poverty reduction is approached and achieved by the initiative. Lastly, contact details are provided at the end of each case study for those who may wish to seek further information. Our hope is that these good practices will generate increased interest in the subject among community leaders, implementing agencies, policy makers and other stakeholders. Above all, it is hoped that they will inspire the replication of initiatives that reduce poverty and build resilience among the world\u2019s most vulnerable communities.

In remote northern Gaibandha, located at the confluence of the two major rivers of Tista and Brahmaputra, riverbank erosion leads to permanent loss of land for cultivation and shelter. People often have to live in areas with minimal or no basic services such as safe water, sanitation, health and education. The district\u2019s remoteness and the complexity of its problems result in social marginalization, child labour, exploitation, child marriage, early pregnancies and human rights violations. Ill health, malnutrition and mortality rates are high among women and children. Men migrate to other areas in search of employment, leaving women and children at home more vulnerable. In 2004, Practical Action Bangladesh initiated a five-year alternative risk reduction and management project to address disaster and development issues, particularly among disadvantaged communities living on the edge of mighty rivers. The project also seeks to develop a sustainable model for replication in other parts of the country. The project has increased the earning capacity of over 20,000 households and developed innovative technologies in areas such as disaster warning, rapid evacuation, housing and sustaining livelihoods. The beneficiaries now have a range of mechanisms to cope with disaster risk and poverty in a sustainable manner. Their average income has risen and men\u2019s migration has reduced significantly. Bangladesh \u2018Flood-friendly\u2019 agriculture: A way to manage food insecurity Supporting communities affected by river erosion in Bangladesh Practical Action - Bangladesh 2 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This is an alternative disaster risk reduction and management project focusing on extremely vulnerable communities affected by river erosion and flooding in Gaibandha District, north-eastern Bangladesh. The project aims to reduce the vulnerability of men, women and children to the physical, social, economic and political effects of river erosion, flooding and other natural hazards. Initiated on 1st April 2004 and continuing until March 2009, this five-year project has the following objectives: \u2022 Poor women, men and children living on vulnerable riverbank lands are better prepared to withstand the impact of recurrent natural hazards. \u2022 People displaced by river erosion have access to basic services (food, shelter, water, health and education) through the development of cluster villages and multi-purpose shelters. \u2022 People displaced or at risk of being displaced by river erosion, have alternative livelihood options (i.e. new income-earning opportunities). \u2022 Improved social, civil and political rights for disadvantaged men, women and children affected by river erosion and regular flooding. So far, the project has targeted over 20,000 households. This amounts to some 100,000 direct beneficiaries and over 500,000 indirect beneficiaries. Over 67 per cent of them are women. With funding from the Big Lottery Fund UK4, the project is being implemented by Practical Action Bangladesh in 30 union5 locations, under four highly disaster-prone upazila (sub-districts) in the northern district of Gaibandha. The four highly disaster-prone sub-districts are: Gaibandha Sadar, Sunderganj, Shaghata and Fulchari. Five local partners, along with a Practical Action Bangladesh expert panel, are involved in implementing the project on the ground. The project is supervised by Practical Action Bangladesh in direct collaboration with five local NGOs, and is linked with relevant government line departments and administrative bodies. To date, the project has successfully built the alternative livelihood skill capacity of over 20,000 targeted households.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d683df9-6fa2-4cc9-ac36-dc9d81d524ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d683df9-6fa2-4cc9-ac36-dc9d81d524ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46bbb37b79522c497a4b59fbc0b836e60f6af9479303e6a6309d1199bd0bde13"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ace2502-bd06-45ec-8f03-b86da38400a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf5f82fc3b4953d268e4966ddd06a3f7dd383f0e3b495a114951a550f3a773fe"}}, "hash": "7e96f43f9b5d880df926282be531bdfa0edde4602b332d3ddc8b22b4806f14c2", "text": "Systematic monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment have shown that the 20,000 beneficiaries\u2019 livelihood patterns, access to basic services, food consumption and average incomes have changed very rapidly.

This location makes the area vulnerable to disasters, due to flooding and river erosion. Frequent disasters make life in the area much more difficult than in the rest of country, depriving residents of land, employment opportunities and basic services. As a result, local populations live below subsistence level. They often have to live where there are minimal or no basic services, such as safe water, sanitation, health and education. Communications are extremely poor. The remoteness of the district and the complexity of its problems result in a high degree of social marginalization, child labour, exploitation, child marriage, early pregnancies and violation of human rights. Women and children are the most vulnerable, as men migrate in large numbers in search of employment and livelihood security. To cope with their situation of both extreme poverty and disaster risk, the communities generally depend on external relief and rehabilitation after a disaster. Vulnerable community members are also forced to engage in indentured labour for their survival. The 20,000 households targeted by the project were a highly disadvantaged segment of the community. After losing their lands and shelters permanently in the river, the communities relocated to the flood protection embankment where there were no basic services, employment opportunities or secure livelihood options. The project\u2019s comprehensive approaches have helped them secure access to income and basic services such as shelter, health, education and food. Highly diversified and alternative risk reduction strategies and income opportunities have been explored throughout the command areas (over 1,600 km2) with proven results and visible impacts on the communities\u2019 lives and livelihoods. The project beneficiaries now have a range of innovative mechanisms to cope sustainably with disaster risk and poverty, which has significantly reduced migration. To help manage and minimize disaster risk, the project has developed participatory technologies all over the command areas and in the district. The major risk reduction and livelihood strategies are: \u2022 Providing access to improve livelihood knowledge, skills and information through capacity building training and demonstrations of off-farm and on-farm based technologies. \u2022 Developing infrastructure services and facilities such as multi-purpose shelters, cluster villages, community clinics, schools, safe water and sanitation. \u2022 Establishing community-based early warning and rapid evacuation systems. \u2022 Ensuring better access to common property resources, and to social, civil and political rights. The project works directly with the communities to reduce poverty, disaster risk and vulnerability, by building capacity through technological and social interventions. The interventions include: \u2022 Flood-friendly agriculture, fisheries and livestock resource management. \u2022 Flood-resistant housing and multi-purpose shelter development. \u2022 Alternative income generation through light engineering training. \u2022 Small enterprise development through small businesses, and agro-processing for added value (which has created better access to common property resources, ensuring legal rights). \u2022 Influencing policy makers to recognise successful practices for national and international dissemination. In combining disaster risk reduction with poverty reduction, the project has used comprehensive disaster risk reduction strategies, shifting relief-dependent attitudes towards long-term disaster risk reduction, management and planning. Additionally, the project worked to motivate local, national and international agencies to mainstream disaster issues into development practices for the sake of effective and long-term sustainable solutions. In a nutshell, the project has demonstrated a number of ways to help communities reduce their vulnerability to disasters, which also help them overcome chronic poverty and social problems. It has also developed people\u2019s capacity to cope with frequent natural hazards, and to adapt to climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dddbf59e-2c0d-4640-94c3-f50fdb594dbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "dddbf59e-2c0d-4640-94c3-f50fdb594dbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf038ac2dd894069ee544e6357679c9ce97723c1f557561459971317ea7f3b27"}, "2": {"node_id": "68776673-3c11-40bb-ab64-aad25427ba64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e04b0be51b202293f4f960030d4f7f448cba3371c4302068e9b6d713a4037154"}}, "hash": "a040006ace1debf23250ece8c5c74bc5e9a6c3bda586000a5d6d612458444d4a", "text": "4 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Good Practice The project can be described as good practice because it has developed a very effective risk reduction and management model, as well as a number of innovative pro-poor-based natural resource management technologies.

Innovative ideas included: \u2022 The development of a model cluster village to resettle communities displaced by river erosion. \u2022 The development of multi-purpose shelters to accommodate affected communities hit by flood disasters. \u2022 The establishment of a community-based rapid evacuation system to minimize community risk and vulnerability. \u2022 The development of unique, low-cost and pro-poor technologies such as agricultural production on barren sand bars, floating gardens and cage aquaculture. \u2022 Improved access of marginalized people to basic rights (health, education, sanitation and legal rights), particularly for women and children. All the above ideas, innovations, knowledge and learning strongly motivated community members, policy makers, development practitioners, donors and other stakeholders both at the local, national and international levels. The project also influenced the development of a new policy for poor people living on the edge of mighty rivers in Bangladesh. The project was shared at a number of international forums to influence policy makers and development practitioners in building awareness of climate change issues. These included World Water Week 2007 and the House of Lords event for the Oxfam \u2018Make Poverty History\u2019 campaign in the United Kingdom, as well as other events at Sheffield University (UK), the British parliament, the German and Belgian parliaments, and the Plenary Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Forum for Environment and Development (APFED) in China. 5 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Participatory plans and community-driven approaches are of the utmost importance for achieving objectives and goals. \u2022 Adequate technical and social knowledge and skills are necessary for overcoming challenges. \u2022 An integrated development approach is needed for tackling complex situations involving poverty and disaster risk. \u2022 Adequate administrative support is needed to meet targets on ground. \u2022 Equal participation of stakeholders is needed to achieve goals. The major challenge for this project was: \u2022 How to secure enough funding to replicate the above ideas and reinforce existing knowledge. To improve similar projects in the future, a donor and development consortium could, jointly with the government, review the impacts of the project and develop a comprehensive programme for rapid dissemination of the evidence-based results in similar geographical areas. Potential for Replication The project has initiated a very comprehensive disaster risk and poverty reduction strategy, aiming to develop a sustainable model for replication in other parts of Bangladesh, particularly among disadvantaged communities living on the edge of mighty rivers. Replication could be easily achieved in other parts of the country with a tiny amendment to national policy, and channeling of national and donor funding to relevant development initiatives. To replicate the project in a different context, the approaches require minor adjustments to fit the context and situation, provided that funding is available and relevant policies are in place.

Until recently, its rural communities were not prepared for emergency situations, resulting in the loss of livelihood assets such as homes, livestock and crops during disasters. Such losses aggravated poverty and, in some cases, triggered migration. The poorest people were most affected. To cope with the impact of disasters on their livelihoods, the communities would seek assistance from municipal governments and local organisations, in addition to inter-family solidarity and networks that were often their first survival mechanisms. In the light of this situation, Care International in Bolivia implemented a 14-month initiative to develop community emergency preparedness with a risk management approach, targeting 5,500 community members and involving 500 people including municipal and school officials. Although the initiative was not a development project, it helped reduce poverty by minimizing disaster impact on the vulnerable communities\u2019 economic, social and natural capital.

The initiative was implemented from February 2006 to April 2007 in the following communities of five municipalities located in three departments (regions): \u2022 Department of Chuquisaca: the rural communities of El Zapallar, Pampas de Heredia, El Yaconal and Alto Divisadero in the Municipality of Monteagudo; the rural communities of Ity, Montegrande and Cumandayti, as well as territorial organisations in urban areas and the Neighbours\u2019 Committees of Santa Cruz and San Jos\u00e9, all in the Municipality of Villa Vaca Guzm\u00e1n; and the rural communities of Huayaca, Santa Rosa, Yaperenda and Villa Mercedes in the Municipality of Huacaya. \u2022 Department of Santa Cruz: the rural communities of Kuruyuki and Kurupaiti in the Municipality of Lagunillas. \u2022 Department of Tarija: the rural communities of Caigua and Taiguati as well as municipal associations in the Bolivian Chaco, municipal governments and coordination with the Civil Defence, all in the Municipality of Villamontes. Targeting 5,500 community members and involving 500 people, including officials from municipal associations, municipalities and local schools, the initiative was implemented by Care International Bolivia, with funding from the latter, DIPECHO6, Care Netherlands and municipal governments. 6 DIPECHO: Disaster Preparedness, European Commission Humanitarian aid Office. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction The targeted communities were not prepared for disasters, resulting in the loss of livelihood assets such as homes, livestock and crops. These losses affected the communities\u2019 productive base, aggravated their level of poverty and, in some cases, triggered migration. To cope with poverty aggravated by disasters, the communities needed to seek assistance from municipal governments and local organisations, especially for food and water. This was on top of their usual first lines of response to ensure availability of basic commodities, namely inter- family solidarity and networks. In the light of this situation, the initiative sought to develop emergency preparedness in the communities through the following steps: \u2022 Incorporating a Risk Management Approach (RMA) into development planning. \u2022 Training and providing equipment to volunteer groups. \u2022 Working with teachers to incorporate RMA into classroom teaching. \u2022 Undertaking risk analysis of the communities\u2019 watershed management practices, and helping to improve them. \u2022 Carrying out demonstration projects. \u2022 Disseminating and exchanging experience. Although this was not a development project, the risk reduction efforts helped reduce poverty by minimizing disaster impact on the communities\u2019 economic and social capital through: \u2022 Institutional strengthening: Consolidating institutional structures in local organisational forms by generating appropriate knowledge, tools and methods for a timely response to emergency; establishing alliances with key actors such as the Vice-Minister of Civil Defence and Cooperation of Integrated Development (VIDECICODI), departmental prefectures, municipal governments and community-based committees; establishing structures for emergency preparedness and response through workshops for disseminating legal standards, strengthening existing alliances and the formation of municipal inter-institutional committees; developing community and municipal contingency plans; and strengthening regional civil defence entities. \u2022 Capacity generation: Implementing a training plan to help consolidate a risk management model; forming and training volunteers\u2019 groups in first aid; responding to fires and controlling them; training in forest and water management practices, and 8 Good Practices and Lessons Learned damage and needs assessment (EDAN); and using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) as a tool for integrated watershed management. \u2022 Risk mapping: This helped incorporate a visual representation of threats, risks and vulnerabilities into regional and municipal development, territorial development and zoning, and integrated watershed management. \u2022 Formal education: Education, seen as an essential tool for behavioural change, was used to promote a culture of prevention. A guide on the incorporation of risk management as a cross-cutting theme was developed with the participation of key actors. Sensitization and training activities were also carried out with both teachers and students, who eventually organized educational fairs and theatre/puppet festivals, as well as libraries with material on risk management. \u2022 Demonstration projects: These were one of the main prevention activities, and included improving water reservoirs, building a pedestrian bridge, reforesting river banks, protecting an irrigation channel and channelling a stream.

The sensitization work promoted the understanding that being trained in disaster preparedness can lead to reduced poverty risks inherent in drought, flooding and fire. The rationale was: the higher the vulnerability, the higher the risk of loss of livelihood assets, the higher the risk of increased poverty. The initiative tried to communicate to the communities that reducing risk to their livelihood assets meant that vulnerability reduction was needed, especially in rural areas, and that more risk- sensitive investments in infrastructure and services were needed in urban areas. In a nutshell, the initiative helped incorporate a Risk Management Approach (RMA) into local government planning, develop micro-watershed management plans incorporating RMA, reduce crop losses, and improve livelihood strategies among vulnerable families. 9 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Respecting local processes of participatory planning ensure ownership of the initiative, the empowerment of social sectors to make decisions related to local planning, and the legitimacy of commitments made. \u2022 The development pattern of local areas is often the main cause of disasters and emergency situations. Thus, it is important to adopt a strategy of local land-use planning, incorporating a risk management approach, in order to mitigate the long-term effects of disasters. \u2022 More efforts are needed to institutionalize capacity building processes for emergency preparedness and response, especially in formal institutions such as Civil Defence. Civil Defence departments should develop policies and guidelines about risk management throughout the country. \u2022 More emphasis should be laid on emergency preparedness, given that institutions tend to prioritize capacity building for response. Overemphasis on response only helps to develop and strengthen a culture of reaction rather than prevention. \u2022 Risk management in municipal planning should be developed from an environmental perspective, which helps plan productive activities and natural resource management that is sensitive to prevention of disasters. \u2022 Establishing agreements with municipal governments and Civil Defence branch offices is of the utmost importance. It allows for clear identification and distribution of roles and responsibilities among stakeholders. It also encourages transparent municipal administration, in coordination with strategic allies. \u2022 It is useful to develop maps of institutions and intervention zones in terms of their contributions to the development of targeted regions. This helps to identify strategic partners and allies, to help promote the continuity and sustainability of the work. This was the case with DED (German Development Service) which committed to The following factors were key to the success of the initiative: \u2022 Participation of different stakeholders. \u2022 Alignment to Bolivian regulations on risk management. \u2022 Proper use of local perceptions and experiences. \u2022 A highly motivated project team with significant knowledge of the targeted areas. \u2022 Timely availability of resources. 10 Good Practices and Lessons Learned For more information, please contact: Ms. Erika Meschwitz Care - Bolivia E\u2013mail: emeschwitz@carebolivia.org continuing with specific capacity-building work, for instance, in the use of GIS. \u2022 Threat and vulnerability assessments and analyses are important when establishing the historical pattern of disasters. This helps identify and implement mitigation according to knowledge based on past experience. \u2022 Youth participation in the formation of volunteer groups is important: it contributes to the continuity of awareness raising and local capacity strengthening in risk management. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 The appointment of a new government delayed the initial stages of the initiative. \u2022 Informing and sensitizing municipal governments - which normally are interested in public works \u2013 on the importance of funding risk management activities, and the process involved. \u2022 Communities tend to give priority to \u2018actual\u2019, or concretely visible work, rather than training, or establishing committees to raise awareness about existing regulations and standards. Potential for Replication This good practice can be replicated in similar contexts using the same strategy and methodological documents. This can be done through risk identification, and by the communities themselves developing risk plans aligned to municipal Annual Operational Plans. The methods and tools generated by the initiative can also be adapted to new contexts.

To improve similar initiatives in the future, there is a need to promote stakeholder participation, including at the design stage, and to further evaluate positive and negative experiences. 11 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction National network for DRR helps curb poverty Abstract Poverty is widespread in the Central American country of El Salvador. A 2005 USAID report states that \u201cEl Salvador still suffers from poverty, with approximately 49 per cent of the rural population living below the poverty line\u201d, adding that \u201c61 per cent of the rural population has no access to water piped into the home.\u201d This population continues to be at high risk from disasters. A loss of crops or a damaged home is enough push a family into extreme poverty - a lack of resilience prevents real recovery. After Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1998, regional governments, civil society organisations, NGOs and international NGOs came together to address disaster vulnerabilities in the region. A Regional Network for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) was established, along with national networks for DRR in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. With support from partners including Oxfam America, the El Salvador national network has successfully advocated for government mitigation projects, as well as other prevention and preparedness efforts. A Law for Civil Protection and Disaster Prevention and Mitigation was also adopted in 2005. The El Salvador national network has contributed to a shift in the political discourse, from a sole focus on emergency response to growing emphasis on prevention and mitigation. This has helped protect the population from the devastating effects of disasters and the burden of recovery that trap them in a cycle of poverty. El Salvador A community going over its risk map The National Network for Disaster Risk Reduction in Central America Oxfam America (In partnership with the National Network for DRR) 12 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative The initiative developed a network of Central American civil society organisations and NGOs, which came together to work on disaster risk reduction after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1998. The objectives of the El Salvador\u2019s national network for DRR, known as MPGR in Spanish (Mesa Permanente para la Gesti\u00f3n de Riesgos), can be defined as follows: \u2022 To strengthen local level understanding of and action for DRR. \u2022 To carry out political advocacy from the local to the national level for better policies on disaster preparedness and management. \u2022 To educate its members on DRR and adopt an ongoing process of organisational development. The initiative was launched after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in 1998, when regional governments, civil society organisations, NGOs and International NGOs (INGOs) joined efforts to address disaster vulnerability in the region. One outcome of this post-Mitch process was the creation of national networks for disaster risk reduction in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, as well as a Regional Network on DRR. The El Salvador national network existed since 1998-1999 and while its form and name have changed over the years, Oxfam America has been supporting it along with the other national networks since 2002. The headquarters of the MPGR is located in the capital city, San Salvador, but its 20 member organisations work in every region of the country. The member organisations, all of which are national NGOs operating in El Salvador, carry out work that benefits some 175,000 community members indirectly. The MPGR, the other national networks and the Regional Network for DRR were developed through both national and international efforts. In 2002, Oxfam America decided to help, support and strengthen the networks in an effort to build a stronger culture of disaster risk reduction in the region. The MGPR has received support from Oxfam America, ICCO7-KerkinActie (Netherlands) and Catholic Relief Services (CRS). The initiative has resulted in a more coordinated response to disasters and the empowerment of local communities. It has also allowed these communities to advocate for the assistance to which they are entitled. 7 ICCO: Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Poverty is widespread in El Salvador. While the country is officially a middle-income nation, there is a widening gap between the rich and poor.

Each time a disaster occurs, whether at the local or national level, families and communities that live on the edge of poverty are the most affected. Despite achievements in development, a loss of crops or a damaged house would return them to extreme poverty as they have to struggle to recover from the loss, investing scarce resources in food security or rebuilding damaged houses. Lack of resilience simply does not allow them to recover from disasters. Prior to Hurricane Mitch in 1998, there was no concerted force advocating for disaster prevention and mitigation, or even effective disaster response in the region. Communities had to face disasters in an isolated manner, with unpredictable levels of 13 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction government assistance depending on political will and atmosphere. Now, with the MPGR, there is an active force in El Salvador that has successfully advocated for government mitigation projects, such as building resistant borders along flood-prone rivers, and other prevention and preparedness efforts. Furthermore, the network has also run a successful advocacy campaign for a Law for Civil Protection and Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, which was adopted in El Salvador in 2005. Even though much needs to be done to hold the government accountable to the enforcement of this Law, and reforms that truly work towards disaster risk reduction, these first steps have been a major achievement of the MPGR, in partnership with other civil society actors. The MPGR has helped shift the political discourse from a sole focus on emergency response to growing emphasis on prevention and mitigation. This has in turn contributed to the protection of the population from the devastating effects of disasters, and the burden of recovery that traps them in a cycle of poverty. The Good Practice The initiative is a good practice because in a region like Central America, poverty reduction and social and economic development efforts are thwarted by recurrent disasters. By building local capacity for disaster risk reduction, this initiative contributed to the long-term ability of communities to prepare for disasters. The initiative provided them with a valuable tool to reduce the impact of disasters, and thus continue on a road to development. Each of the 20 MPGR member organisations is committed to building capacity at local and municipal levels. One key way of building capacity is through formal civil protection committees. By law, these committees must be formed at the local and municipal level to coordinate with the National Civil Protection Service during an emergency. Through the member organisations of the National Network for DRR these committees are formed and trained not only in emergency response but especially in disaster risk reduction. The initiative also helps advocate for adequate public policies on DRR, which further supports communities to prevent, mitigate and recover from disasters. The MPGR advocates through various channels, including national media houses. A key factor for the success of the initiative has been the ability of the various member organisations to adopt a common agenda, including a strategic plan, as well as common advocacy and media plans. While many national NGOs work in an isolated manner on disaster response or recovery, it is the collaborative nature of this network that creates enough momentum at the national level to affect public policy, and which can unify concepts and practices at the local and municipal levels to empower communities to take action on DRR. 14 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: 1. Communities are always the true \u2018first responders\u2019 in emergencies, so it is critical to build their capacity at a local level in addition to supporting DRR networks at the national level. 2. Social pressure and advocacy are key to holding governments accountable and ensuring that they carry out prevention and response. 3. It is critical to build cross-sectoral alliances (e.g. with NGOs, INGOS, churches, social movements) to develop networks that have the scope and strength to survive. 4. Working with local NGOs in local emergencies is a good practice. Needs are often overlooked at an international level in the aftermath of \u2018small-scale\u2019 events,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52dcb7e9-2c4a-4f2d-a14f-006bcc090211": {"__data__": {"id_": "52dcb7e9-2c4a-4f2d-a14f-006bcc090211", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69b87d656d94200595f81646b81afeca3a6861f468b43f118987939dc50e7978"}}, "hash": "69b87d656d94200595f81646b81afeca3a6861f468b43f118987939dc50e7978", "text": "while local NGOs have substantial experience with these situations. 5. Building networks is a long-term effort that requires patience, and commitment to work towards a common agenda. For more information, please contact: Mr. Jacobo Ocharan Oxfam America E\u2013mail: jocharan@oxfamamerica.org Potential for Replication This initiative is replicable, although building networks is not an easy task. The first step is to build relationships with key local actors and partners. It is also important to analyze the local context and social structures. Another important aspect of this initiative lies in Oxfam America\u2019s approach to partners. Oxfam America does not act as a donor from afar, but rather works side by side as a partner and provides ongoing support. One of the main constraints to scaling-up the initiative, however, is the overall lack of donors that are willing to invest in prevention efforts. Many donors still claim that prevention efforts do not yield sufficient measurable results, even though tangible results can be achieved at the local level. 15 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Reducing vulnerability and poverty through disaster mitigation Abstract Poverty has reduced community resilience in Honduras, Ecuador and Guatemala to such an extent that poor households and communities are unable to cope with even the smallest shock, let alone a disaster. In turn, such reduced community resilience to disaster has further aggravated poverty. To help break this cycle, the international NGO World Vision initiated a project called the Central American Mitigation Initiative (CAMI) in 1998 in Honduras to help integrate emergency response and disaster risk reduction into development. The project has reduced vulnerabilities, and addressed the causes of disaster and poverty through work on mitigation and livelihoods. World Vision expanded the project to Ecuador and Nicaragua in 2003, renaming it the Community Emergency Response/Disaster Mitigation Project (CERDM). The second phase of the CERDM project began in 2007 and will extend its activities to Colombia and Guatemala. Efforts are being made to secure funding to implement it in all 14 countries of the Latin American/Caribbean Region. So far, the CAMI project has established viable mitigation programmes in 291 communities across three countries - Honduras, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Community teams have been recognized by government offices as viable partners in disaster response. The communities demonstrated their ability to respond to disasters, and municipal authorities have incorporated community risk management into their development plans. The project, which is replicable, helps communities identify their risks and vulnerabilities, then find alternatives to reduce them through wealth creation activities. Honduras School children in Honduras in a drill practice The Central American Mitigation Initiative (CAMI) World Vision - Honduras 16 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative The Central American Mitigation Initiative (CAMI) seeks to integrate emergency response and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into development, while focusing on the human being as the core element in the organisation, in community participation and in development planning. The project\u2019s major goals are to: \u2022 Incorporate risk management concepts into development activities in the targeted communities. \u2022 Strengthen community and institutional leadership capacity for monitoring threats, early warning systems and for planning emergency response. \u2022 Improve community response capacity through forming and training Local Development Committees (CODELs in Spanish). \u2022 Incorporate training and participation of boys and girls enrolled in local schools. \u2022 Reduce the loss of lives and property caused by recurrent natural hazards.8 \u2022 Reduce vulnerabilities, addressing causes of poverty and disaster through mitigation and livelihood activities. Implemented by World Vision, CAMI activities began in 1998 in response to Hurricane Mitch in Honduras. In 2003, World Vision expanded the related programme to Ecuador and Nicaragua and renamed it the Community Emergency Response/Disaster Mitigation Project (CERDM). The second phase of CERDM kicked off in 2007 and would extend its activities into Colombia and Guatemala, training an estimated 6,750 community members to form local emergency committees incorporating CERDM activities, with an estimated indirect impact on 70,000 people. Efforts are also being made to secure funding to implement DRR programmes in all 14 countries of the Latin American/Caribbean Region in which World Vision works.9 The CAMI project was implemented in the following areas with each Area Development Programme consisting of around 10 communities. Working with communities, local governments and the national emergency structures, World Vision\u2019s initiative has established viable mitigation programmes in 18 Area Development Programme areas, covering 291 communities in three countries. No statistics have been gathered for Honduras but 10,000 people have benefited in Nicaragua and Ecuador.

Most of the project activities were carried out by local communities and the World Vision National Offices of Honduras, Nicaragua and Ecuador. However, a damage and needs assessment was completed in compliance with the Government of Honduras and in cooperation with other local NGOs. Local government and NGO representatives also participated in community-based training sessions. As the Area Development Programmes were designed to cover the poorest communities of a region, the project\u2019s direct beneficiaries were those most in need. The total number of community leaders trained as direct beneficiaries of the programme was 448. The leaders were then organized into Rapid Response Teams that would assist the 5,044 people in their respective communities. Funds used were from the CAMI project of USAID, with support from World Vision USA and World Vision Honduras as part of its HEA (Humanitarian Emergency Affairs) strategy. The CERDM project is funded through the support of the Government of Australia (AusAID) and the efforts of World Vision Australia. Partners in the project include: Area Development Programmes, civil defence agencies, the Government of Colombia, the Government of Ecuador, the Government of Guatemala, the Government of Nicaragua, the Government of Honduras, Education Ministries, local fire departments, local Red Cross Societies, World Vision Australia and World Vision USA. The targeted communities have increased their capacity to resist the impacts of disasters. In achieving this, they have gained greater insight into how to address the causes of long-term poverty and under-development, as well as the wherewithal to do so. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction In the past, poverty in the targeted areas has left households and communities unable to face even the smallest shock, let alone a disaster. Little money was prioritized for healthcare, proper nutrition, education or savings prior to disaster, making households vulnerable. Being in a continual or temporary state of poverty meant that people were not aware of or did not have time to think of risk management, as they were busy trying to provide for their families. Poverty decreases the bargaining power as well as purchasing power of the poor, particularly in Honduras, Ecuador and Guatemala. The poor cannot buy land on high ground and therefore become squatters in lowlands and riverbeds. This results in strong exposure to coastal storms, and floods from the mountain ranges upriver. Moreover, due to their lack of land ownership rights, they do not have access to municipal government protection or representation. These vulnerabilities have placed multitudes of the poor at high disaster risk. As a result, disasters have turned their poverty into chronic poverty that exacerbates migration, environmental degradation, poor health and nutrition, squatter settlements and the collapse of family structures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8145dae6-5370-4731-9df3-a4a3b38047ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "8145dae6-5370-4731-9df3-a4a3b38047ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b6b25da0792a1a3765e6779a5e6b27cf621e921affbce218f83495c8290355b"}, "2": {"node_id": "326a3938-8700-4e0c-a995-b993441ca7dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "332b9f037e690f7f6169e2be09f976f7abd12b36898784665d8bc655662a3b39"}}, "hash": "ad21921a1b4c0329e6e9e61fabf9a400496a4a2952f0310244f524c2630e04c7", "text": "Over time, disasters have reduced community resilience in all its aspects, to nothing.

They also borrowed money from relatives or neighbours for basic food staples and they sold off liquid and productive assets. They were unlikely to initiate any measures to reduce risk or recover on their own, and were mostly described as being in shock, not understanding what the media was telling them to do to respond to disasters. They became heavily reliant on humanitarian aid. To minimize and manage risks, the project built local capacity at different levels. Targeting adults, new local emergency committees were organized and committees were trained, and communities undertook risk assessments to raise awareness of weaknesses and strengths. At schools, emergency school committees were organized and children were trained in risk mapping, response and first aid. At the local and national government level, a humanitarian assistance network was formed. Local authorities took responsibility for community training, and DRR policies and strategies were mainstreamed at the national level. At the Area Development Programme level, whole communities were trained to implement early warning systems, to better manage water and sanitation, to map vulnerabilities and strengths, and to build leadership capacities. The key achievements of this project were: \u2022 It encouraged communities to identify their risks and vulnerabilities, and then found ways to reduce them through wealth creation. \u2022 It raised community awareness of new approaches to risk management and promoted changes in behaviour that will ultimately improve their quality of life. Poverty reduction was integrated into DRR initiatives, incorporating protection of communities\u2019 hard- won economic resources into disaster preparation and mitigation. For example, Area Development Programmes have established Early Warning Systems for Food Crises (EWSFCs) that identify food shortage periods, and forecasts weather for seasonal harvests. This information helps community members make informed decisions about food production, which is their major source of income. Also, local governments incorporate risk management activities into municipal development plans, taking the needs of the poor into consideration. Integrating poverty reduction into disaster risk reduction has helped reduce the vulnerability of the poor. This has saved lives, reduced migration, better protected the environment, and achieved and protected development objectives from future disaster losses. In light of these successes, funding was secured to extend the project into two other countries - Ecuador and Nicaragua \u2013 after a flash flood in the Yacumbabma community in Ecuador and the 2005 hurricane season in Nicaragua. The Good Practice As shown by its replicability and improved community and government response to subsequent disasters, the project is good practice. Its success is based on reducing poverty and disaster impact through the involvement of the most important actors: the communities and their governments. The project is good practice also because it has helped reduce the loss of lives and damage to livelihoods and it has increased the speed and quality of response and rehabilitation activities. This was demonstrated by a dramatic difference between the impacts of Hurricane Mitch and those of Hurricane Michelle. However, some failures have persisted despite the introduction of the project: damage to infrastructure and a rise in illness. Also, the project\u2019s weaknesses lie in the implementation of coordination, and sustainability in leadership and training. Although a significant number of respondents responded optimistically when asked about the continuation of the project without World Vision presence, many people still consider the support of World Vision to be fundamental to their ability to continue the work. This realization has resulted in the strengthening of the CAMI/CERDM project through better coordination with other organisations and agencies. 19 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project include: \u2022 The approach requires significant financial and technical investment. \u2022 One of the greatest accomplishments of the CAMI/CERDM project is the targeted communities\u2019 heightened awareness of the relationship between disaster management, environmental conservation and agriculture. Further work on sustainable agriculture, economic development, and soil and water conservation could greatly enhance community viability. \u2022 Strengthening networks among grassroots organisations, community-based initiatives, governments and NGOs is key to building resilience. \u2022 Providing training to communities can be done easily; implementing activities in each community context is more difficult. CERDM Ecuador made great efforts to adapt the project materials to indigenous communities. However, it emerged from participants\u2019 feedback that some workshop methods and material needed to be revised to ensure relevance and appropriateness. Future funds should be earmarked to develop context-appropriate material, especially for indigenous communities. \u2022 An ongoing evaluation for current and future CERDM projects is essential at all levels.

Major challenges were encountered at the beginning of the project, as people were not enthusiastic about the idea of reducing risk themselves.

Replication in other contexts has been done relatively easily with community input and government participation. Replication can be encouraged and supported by the success already achieved in the CAMI/CERDM project. Indeed, there is significant political buy-in as well as funding, mainly because of regional similarities as well as similarity in disaster experience within Latin America. 20 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Reducing risk in poor urban areas to protect shelters, hard-won assets and livelihoods Abstract In two low-income migrant worker neighbourhoods of New Delhi, the socio-economic status of the residents makes them highly vulnerable to frequent fires. This is due to the nature of their housing materials, and their inability to live in less vulnerable areas. In the hot summer season fires destroy their shelters and assets, locking them into a cycle of poverty. To help minimize and manage risks in the two neighbourhoods, a three-year project was initiated in April 1997 by SEEDS, to help the residents design and commission a community fire post. The fire post provided better fire safety to the entire community. The project helped the residents protect their shelters, their assets and savings and, in some cases, their livelihoods. Their reduced vulnerability helped them to gradually increase their savings and convert their temporary squatter houses into permanent units. India The community fire post Integrating disaster risk reduction in urban development SEEDS India (In partnership with the Indian Institute of Public Administration, the National Centre for Disaster Management, the Centre for Development and Emergency Practice - Oxford Brookes University, and the Oxford Centre for Disaster Studies) 21 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Initiative The initiative is an urban risk reduction project implemented in two low-income neighbourhoods of New Delhi. The main objective of the project is to integrate risk reduction in urban development. The focus is on making the lives and livelihoods of low- income vulnerable urban communities safer. Risk from recurring disasters is a major source of urban poverty, and measures are needed to reduce poverty through risk reduction. The project was implemented from April 1997 to March 2000 in two communities, both located in Delhi: a low-income neighbourhood in Delhi\u2019s old city area, and a slum-squatter neighbourhood located within the river bed of Delhi\u2019s Yamuna River. Local community leaders were involved in the project as primary stakeholders, and community workshops were held with their support. Public institutions such as the Indian Institute of Public Administration served as a bridge between the community and government agencies. SEEDS facilitated the process. The project, which targeted some 1,000 households in each neighbourhood, was funded by the United Kingdom government\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) and implemented by the following institutions: SEEDS, the Indian Institute of Public Administration, the National Centre for Disaster Management, the Centre for Development and Emergency Practice, Oxford Brookes University, and the Oxford Centre for Disaster Studies. The three-year project contributed to poverty reduction by helping to protect shelters, hard-won assets and livelihoods against recurrent disasters such as frequent fires, promoting education and public health to improve income generation capabilities, and successfully advocating risk reduction at a national policy level. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction The project addressed urban risk \u2013 an issue that is often ignored despite its great threat to the future of the developing world. Half of India is projected to live in cities in the coming decades, and four fifths of people in India\u2019s megacities live in sub-standard conditions, subject to poverty and disaster risks. Residents of the two low-income neighbourhoods in Delhi are economic migrants to the city. Their low socio- economic status forces them to live in highly vulnerable areas, prone to floods and frequent fires due to the nature of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f7e7c56-8331-473c-acf5-6d88c5019d96": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f7e7c56-8331-473c-acf5-6d88c5019d96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfce15dbcf207525790266fa285a6dabd25cd1e9b7481e97f310627208d612a8"}}, "hash": "cfce15dbcf207525790266fa285a6dabd25cd1e9b7481e97f310627208d612a8", "text": "their housing materials. In the hot summer season fires would destroy their assets and shelters, locking them into a cycle of poverty. Although the communities were technically wealthier than they had been in their rural areas, the frequent fires entrenched them in chronic poverty. Basic survival priorities meant that they had been unable to address their vulnerability to disasters. To help minimize and manage risks, the SEEDS project used its Action Planning methodology to help the community identify and articulate the risks they were exposed to. Action Planning helps communities develop small pilot projects that they can implement with limited funds, to lower risks in their areas. The SEEDS project helped the community to design and successfully commission a community fire post, which improved fire safety for the whole community. The project served as a good demonstration of a community-led effort that helped protect the neighbourhood residents\u2019 shelters, their most precious assets and savings and, in some cases, their lives. Their reduced vulnerability helped them to gradually increase their savings and convert their temporary squatter houses into permanent units. 22 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Good Practice The project can be described as a good practice because the community involved was able to successfully identify the key risk to their livelihoods and assets, and to successfully design and implement a practical solution for reducing risk. The fire post that was commissioned, ensured that trained local residents could extinguish any small fire that could threaten to destroy their entire settlement. Another key success factor of the project was that the community could prepare its own risk reduction plans and implement them with minimal external assistance. The project also showcased specific socio-economic priorities for low-income migrant workers in urban areas, who migrate to the cities for reasons of economic survival. In the risk identification process, community priorities clearly focused on risks to their livelihoods and assets. Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 For poor communities, security of their livelihoods is equally important as the safety of their lives. \u2022 Poor communities do have inbuilt strengths that can help them address their problems, requiring very limited external facilitation. \u2022 Similar projects should be promoted in terms of scaling-up and crossing the critical thresholds of scale, wherein they begin to influence how entire cities function. Pilots need to be converted into norms, and traditional planning systems need to be challenged. The major challenge for this project was: \u2022 Linking micro-planning with macro-level plans during the project\u2019s implementation. This challenge could be met by involving state stakeholders throughout the process. For more information, please contact: Mr. Manu Gupta SEEDS India E\u2013mail: manu@seedsindia.org Potential for Replication The solution of building community fire posts as a preventive measure against fires is easily replicable. However, the community concerned needs to own and drive the process. In the SEEDS project described above, the community volunteered to train themselves in the use of such fire posts, as and when necessary. In a practical sense, this initiative can be easily replicated in another context because the community fire post was only a semi-permanent structure, as it was built in an area where public land was \u2018illegally occupied\u2019 by low- income migrants. To scale up the project, however, some economic and political constraints should be dealt with beforehand. The project can potentially invite objections from public authorities who are not yet sensitized to the issues. Another potential constraint would be to create the political will needed to replicate such an empowering model on a wide scale. 23 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Stabilizing livelihoods through community-based preparedness Abstract Exposed to floods, cyclones or drought almost every year, Malda District, in north-eastern India, is also plagued by low agricultural production and lack of jobs. This situation has exacerbated migration, malnutrition and other related problems that increased vulnerability to disaster. Marginal farmers and landless labourers, who form over 70 per cent of the population, are the most affected. In February 2006, World Vision India initiated a project aiming to strengthen community disaster preparedness and mitigation, and provide wealth creation and diversification. Targeting 15,000 disaster-vulnerable farmers and marginalized people, with a special focus on children, the project sought to improve livelihoods as disaster risk safeguards. The special focus on children helped minimized caste exclusion, encouraging community ownership of the project, community participation, and a successful outcome.

India Children from the Malda District, India Community-based disaster preparedness for poverty alleviation World Vision \u2013 India (In partnership with World Vision UK, the Government of India and UNICEF) 24 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This project aims to integrate emergency response and disaster risk reduction into development in Malda District, West Bengal State, north-eastern India, by targeting the most vulnerable groups through age, gender and livelihood-tailored interventions. Malda District is one of India\u2019s 199 multi-hazard districts. It is known for its exposure to floods, cyclones and drought, as well as heavy seasonal migration. The development focus of the project is on improvement of livelihoods, with the intention of building in disaster risk safeguards. The main goal of the project is to strengthen community disaster preparedness and mitigation measures, and provide wealth creation and diversification. Its key objectives are: \u2022 To promote disaster awareness activities and foster attitudes of preparedness so that communities can deal with disasters. \u2022 To help community members establish alternative sources of income to reduce their vulnerability to disaster. \u2022 To improve access to and use of appropriate water, sanitation and shelter facilities. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) component of the project was initiated in February 2006, with training activities held in 2007. The project is expected to be completed in 2008. Its final phase is under way, under which practices are modelled around the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. The project was implemented in two gram panchayats10 (16 villages) of Gazole Block in Malda District, covering 15,000 community members. Malda is located 300 km north of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal State, and lies at the junction of the Ganga and Mahanadi rivers. Almost every year the district suffers from one or more disasters, with farmers and marginalized people being the most affected. A recent survey says marginal farmers and landless labourers constitute 78.5 per cent of the entire population of the district. World Vision India and the Malda Area Development Program are implementing the project with funding from World Vision UK. UNICEF developed and released the \u2018Colouring Book on Disaster Preparedness\u2019. The Civil Defence Office of the Government of India and the Social Mobilization Office of UNICEF conducted disaster preparedness training courses. The target groups are farmers and marginalized people, with a special focus on children and women. A total of 15,000 people were targeted. The project has made the following major impacts: \u2022 Awareness of disaster response and preparedness measures have risen significantly in local communities of Malda District. Previously, the district did not take disaster preparedness seriously as they were not exposed to the deadly disasters experienced by coastal regions. Now, after the distribution of newly published disaster preparedness colouring books to elementary school children in schools and youth clubs, even illiterate parents are aware of hazards and disaster risks. As a result, Local Relief Action Teams (LRATs) were formed from village volunteers. The community volunteers include many women, and are trained in first aid, rescue methods, and rescue operations in coordination with the government. Villages in Malda District now even have their own pre-positioning units including non-perishable items, and they are adding more people to their key contact lists. Overall, the communities are now aware of the potential risks and are better equipped to help themselves when a disaster occurs. \u2022 Additionally, livelihood and infrastructure development took place to address some of the economic and physical barriers to disaster resilience. Vulnerability assessments were completed and, as a result, 50 vulnerable 10 Gram panchayats are local government bodies at the village level in India. 25 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction families were provided with income-generating activities and 30 of the most vulnerable women were trained on tailoring - as part of the project\u2019s skill development training. The project also involved the community in the following activities: renovation of ponds, installation of tube wells, digging of open wells, construction of roads and the building of two relief centres. \u2022 World Vision is working with 50 vibrant children\u2019s clubs consisting of children aged six to 18.

Each club has also opened a disaster insurance savings account at a local bank. \u2022 Relationships have been established with the government through ongoing meetings and communications on the project. This has resulted in local governments expressing their good will, and providing support for community capacity training sessions. Government staff members participated in a number of the training sessions, resulting in greater awareness of good practices in disaster preparedness among local government officials and networking between community members, the government and World Vision. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Malda district experiences either flooding, cyclones or drought on an average of every other year, accompanied by increasing levels of poverty. The constant and repetitive disasters have left many families unable to plant even one quarter of their total crops. Without fertile land or crops, the household head migrates. There are mounting problems associated with this exodus of men, particularly for women and children left with a meagre 2000 rupees (US$50) worth of food for a family of six. Even though food is available, access to it is difficult. Family members who remain behind are unable to meet minimum living standards. Low agricultural production and lack of employment throughout the year have exacerbated migration, malnutrition, school dropouts and other related problems that increase vulnerability to disaster. Furthermore, the actual loss of lives and property has not accurately been calculated, as the government seldom gives heed to the area. In a nutshell, disaster outcomes have reinforced chronic poverty because of the repeated pattern of disasters, the inability of the poor to recover, and lack of assistance. To implement the project, project communities were identified on the basis of their needs and potential by World Vision India programme managers, and through the Taylor Nelson Sofres11 (TNS) mode of survey reporting. Afterwards, the following strategies were used to minimize and manage risk: \u2022 Providing financial assistance such as grants to the poorest households \u2013 specifically, grants for economic activities that would build coping mechanisms and protect livelihoods. \u2022 Increasing the income of the poorest households by generating income opportunities. \u2022 Creating and increasing livelihood assets to ensure sustainable income, through continuous access to micro-finance. \u2022 Training community-based organisations, to improve their capacity for identifying candidates for economic development programmes. \u2022 Establishing occupation and livelihood-based groups. The project has helped reduce poverty, disaster risk and vulnerability through income-generation activities targeting the most vulnerable and poor. The activities included pond renovation, drinking water purification and relief centre construction. The approach used to integrate disaster risk reduction into poverty reduction was as follows: \u2022 Carrying out vulnerability assessments that measure economic and environmental factors, and identify capacities for reducing disaster risk. \u2022 Conducting Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) exercises, specifically of village mapping, trend analysis, seasonality and wealth ranking. \u2022 Forming Local Relief Action Teams (LRATs), which are core teams of civil defence officials 11 Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) is one of the world\u2019s largest market information groups. It is also the world\u2019s largest provider of custom market research to many of the world\u2019s leading companies. The company is headquartered in London. 26 Good Practices and Lessons Learned and community volunteers trained to respond to disasters. \u2022 Educating people on disaster preparedness and poverty reduction proposals made by stakeholders based on the needs of the communities. To sum up, it should be stressed that integrating disaster risk reduction into poverty reduction does indeed help reduce the vulnerability of the poor. Experience from the The Good Practice The project can be described as good practice first because of its decision to focus on children. This, in India, minimizes caste exclusion and makes interest spread quickly throughout the community. Also, the project sought to ensure local ownership through a methodology that values participation and community volunteerism. In fact, community participation was a key success factor, along with competent training staff, and networking with community-based organisations and the government. two years of project implementation shows that without addressing disaster preparedness, poverty reduction can be achieved but could still be destroyed by the next disaster. This is well illustrated by the new situation in Malda District, where the World Vision project communities are now able to stabilize their livelihoods in times of disaster, even though they are victims of marginalization and discrimination, and are exposed to repetitive natural hazards. 27 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 There are many positive compound effects of children\u2019s participation in a risk reduction learning process.

The project required cooperation and a bottom-up approach to develop the most appropriate strategy for reducing risk. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 Communication was difficult because people initially found it hard to understand the difference between relief and preparedness. Time and tangible results were needed to ensure the full participation of the communities in action on disaster prevention, mitigation and recovery. \u2022 Training mostly illiterate people was difficult. Educational tools had to be well illustrated and training had to be hands-on. Similarly, it was difficult to find educated volunteers. Tapping into school staff proved useful. Similar projects can be improved by: \u2022 Allowing communities to make decisions, even when such decisions are not the most logical or efficient, or are not likely to produce speedy results. \u2022 Addressing disaster risk reduction only after a relationship is established with the community. \u2022 Not addressing disaster risk reduction exclusively: People do not initially show keen interest in the DRR approach because they are used to receiving relief.

However, it is important that there is community buy-in, that the approach is need-based, seeks to enhance people\u2019s capacity, and makes use of local human and material resources. Any project should also make a special effort to involve children and women. Replication in other contexts too may be done relatively easily with community input and government participation. Regarding scaling-up, some thought should be given to the following constraints: \u2022 The majority of people have scant physical assets and limited resources for alternative livelihoods. \u2022 Participation can be ad hoc and at times low. This is because people cannot afford to miss work for an unpaid activity. It may require paying missed wages for meeting attendance and participation. \u2022 Working with government agencies can be most challenging because of their particular political agendas. Their vantage point can often highlight people\u2019s inabilities instead of their capabilities. \u2022 To work with government agencies, a proper strategy and a proper policy should be in place. 28 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Clean water as an entry point to risk reduction and poverty alleviation Abstract Flood is a recurrent hazard in the southern part of Belu District in the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara.13 Following a major flood in March-April 2006, the Community Association for Disaster Management (locally known as PMPB) carried out a post-disaster assessment. The assessment showed that the affected communities were completely unaware of flood resilience measures. The area has great agricultural potential but is hampered by people\u2019s inability to meet their basic needs, by lack of access to markets, fluctuation of market prices and by lack of clean water. These factors, combined with flood impact, result in marginalization of women, poor health and an endemic poverty cycle.In this context, a simple, feasible and convincing entry point had to be identified to not only reduce flood risk, but also to help break the poverty cycle as a stronger incentive for community participation. PMPB identified water well rehabilitation as the place to start. The participatory process of developing, commissioning and maintaining water wells weaned the villagers off fatalistic perceptions of disasters and helped them address their vulnerability and economic conditions, which were linked to lack of clean water. Indonesia Project beneficiaries from the Indonesian province of Nusa Tenggara 12 PMPB is a local network of NGOs working on food security, emergency response and disaster management. It is based in the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara. 13 Nusa Tenggara is a group of islands located between the Sulawesi islands to the north, Bali to the west and Timor to the east.

Flood waters pollute clean water, resulting in severe shortage of clean water in times of flood. Poorer public health, increased workload for women and disruption of education, are other flood impacts. To reduce vulnerability to flood, a water well rehabilitation project has been initiated in 10 villages of southern Belu District under a CBDRM (Community-Based Disaster Risk Management) framework.

The objectives are: \u2022 Increase access to clean water sources. \u2022 To enhance community organisation and raise community members\u2019 awareness of their surroundings. \u2022 To boost community participation and collaboration in development efforts. Under the principle that the community should form the basis of the project and is the subject - not object - of the project, the activities focused on: \u2022 Making clean water available even in times of flood. \u2022 Increasing knowledge and practice of health care. \u2022 Community capacity by introducing SPHERE14 standards and community organisation. The project was implemented from September 2006 to March 2007. Follow-up activities have been carried out since April 2007 to protect the wells from floods by planting bamboo, bakau (a mangrove plant) and other plants as shelters against flood waters - the plants used being determined by the communities themselves. The project covered the following 10 villages of Belu District in the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara: Umatoos, Lasaen and Fafoe villages in West Malaka Sub-District; Lawalu, Naimana, Railor and Fahiluka villages in East Malaka Sub-District; and Lamudur, Kleselson and Forekmok villages in Weliman Sub-District. The Community Association for Disaster Management was involved in the project, and together with the village governance structure, it organized the community to disseminate the activities, appoint water committee working groups, and develop local technical expertise for spreading well development, construction, and maintenance throughout the community. Health officials at sub-district level gathered health-related data, provided chlorine, and developed health promotion materials for the media. For its part, the government, together with the full range of community stakeholders, contributed to the organisation of the following activities: SPHERE basic training; water committee training; general health training; water and sanitation; and community organisation at sub-village level. The Belu District Health Unit helped check samples in laboratories to ensure the quality of the water to be distributed to the community. The project helped build wells in 52 sub-villages with funding from Oxfam GB Jogyakarta, covering a total population of 18,027 people (4,418 households). The project had the following impacts and concrete results: \u2022 The following households in three kecamatans (sub-districts) could access clean water even in times of flood: 4,638 households in Central Malaka; 13,254 households in West Malaka; and 6,725 households in Weliman. \u2022 The negative effects of lack of clean water (e.g. skin diseases and diarrhoea) have been reduced. \u2022 Women could access clean water conveniently as the well points had been agreed upon together with men, and were built next to villagers\u2019 houses. 14 The \u201cSPHERE Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response\u201d is an international initiative launched in 1997 by a group of humanitarian NGOs and the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement to improve the effectiveness and accountability of disaster response. 30 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Annual floods in the targeted sub-villages affect the life of villagers because of their devastating impact on agriculture and livestock. Livestock are an alternative source of income in the event of crop failure. The increasingly difficult economic condition of the villagers has resulted in chronic poverty, and dependence on emergency wells because they are unable to build permanent wells. Following a flood disaster in March-April 2006, PMPB carried out a post-disaster assessment from 21-26 April 2006. The assessment found that the affected communities were completely unaware of flood resilience measures. The three sub-districts had great agricultural potential but were hampered by factors such as people\u2019s inability to meet their basic needs, by lack of access to markets, fluctuation of market prices and by lack of clean water. These factors, combined with flood impact, resulted in marginalization of women, poor health and an endemic cycle of poverty. In this context a simple, feasible and convincing entry point had to be identified to not only reduce flood risk but also to help break the poverty cycle as a stronger incentive for community participation.

The Good Practice The Project can be described as a good practice because it shows that even a relatively simple and inexpensive activity such as rehabilitating water wells can help shift people\u2019s mindset from fatalism and over-dependence to confidence and self- reliance. Not only did the project help build 52 water wells that can withstand floods, and which produce clean and drinkable water, it also opened the eyes of the villagers to the reality that there was positive action they could take against floods and poverty. A key success factor in the project was the optimal use of all human resources available: villagers\u2019 skills, farmers\u2019 groups, women\u2019s groups, the village governance structure, sub-district and district officials, and other local public figures, through good communication and coordination. 31 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Discipline in logistical administration. Efficient, rigorous and transparent logistical administration - from procurement to incoming/outgoing logistics \u2013 was vital not only for project success, but also an incentive for community participation, and as a model practice for community maintenance of the water wells. \u2022 Harmonizing planning and field implementation. Not all the plans could be implemented in full, but harmonization between planning and field implementation helped on-the-ground improvisations conform to the project goals and objectives. \u2022 Community dynamics. Human interactions and relations can easily change based on social conditions. A simple example is the setting of well points, which was expected to be democratic and satisfy all community members. The approach was good but depended on community members understanding that consensus sometimes meant concession, and that collective decision could mean individual sacrifice. The prospect of getting adequate wells - through the negotiations involved in the project process \u2013 prompted some villagers to accept collective decisions that did not suit their individual preferences. \u2022 Persuasion. To address the villagers\u2019 over-dependence on external assistance, PMPB had to convince them that the project activities could not start unless the community began to contribute effectively, e.g. through needs assessment, and approach to indigenous leaders and community leaders. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 Cultural/indigenous activities. Many cultural/indigenous activities affected the smooth running of the project process. For instance, funeral ceremonies required the full attention and presence of the family, siblings, friends, colleagues and neighbours of the deceased, as well as other community members, if not the entire community. Project planning had to be readjusted to unpredictable events that were part of community life. \u2022 Community relations. Identifying the most suitable well points in each sub-village was based on community members\u2019 consent. For the sake of fairness, the process had to be as democratic as possible but, in many cases, democracy was also understood as a zero sum or \u2018win-or-lose\u2019 game. Within grassroots communities, extra care should be taken to ensure that the democratic process does not produce a too obvious loser or disadvantaged group: this may deal a blow to community relations and affect project implementation. This occurred in Laenblidin sub-village (of Lamudur village) where project implementation was disrupted when the disadvantaged group felt that it had the right to delay the process of well digging. A last-minute consensus- building action had to be taken to reach an agreement acceptable to the parties involved. Another challenge for the democratic process was the considerable influence of community leaders, especially village heads, on the articulated interests or needs of the community. Sometimes, leaders presented their personal interests as collective interests. \u2022 Community-NGOs relations. The three sub-districts targeted by the project were an area of intervention of several NGOs. Each NGO had its own approach with different impacts. Many NGOs used a \u2018charity\u2019 approach that tended to treat the community as passive aid recipients, which encouraged a sense of dependence on external assistance. This \u2018charitable\u2019 role was initially expected from PMPB, and extra communication was needed to mobilize community participation. In the light of the key lessons and challenges above, similar projects can be improved in the future through better coordination and communication. 32 Good Practices and Lessons Learned For more information, please contact: Mr.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f1e6ebc-30d6-42e8-a8ad-5564147ceab3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f1e6ebc-30d6-42e8-a8ad-5564147ceab3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9559b6651b643434e9c2ace3d9ab3fb651d96e4c118f0b320953ec261f51f03e"}, "2": {"node_id": "7188ad3f-d735-4ba0-a476-206bb9355e4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a111971b0678afbb850ea84434ea5f9f6ac210b72b6991ee5d6d3c22b0bb4ce3"}}, "hash": "2fffcd6e5849e3d6edad899c50667852172c611fd841290402f18c182a3e73d6", "text": "32 Good Practices and Lessons Learned For more information, please contact: Mr. Jus Nakmofa Community Association for Disaster Management (PMPB) E-mail: pmpbencana@gmail.com Potential for Replication Using access to clean water as an entry point to disaster risk reduction and poverty reduction is a simple and relatively inexpensive need-based community development effort that is easy to replicate.

The current increase in drought frequency and severity has triggered a downward spiral in disaster vulnerability and poverty. In this context, a \u2018Community-Based Rock Rainwater Harvesting and Storage\u2019 project was initiated in October 2006 by Welthungerhilfe to increase the capacity of the most vulnerable communities to withstand recurring droughts. The project focused on drought preparedness through sustainable access to water, improving health. The 14-month project was implemented in close collaboration with other initiatives aiming to reduce poverty. Access to clean drinking water was the top priority in the targeted areas, and solving this particular problem was seen as a way to address many other problems. Drought preparedness focusing on access to and availability of drinking water was the best way to begin enabling and supporting poverty reduction. Kenya Water storage tanks under construction Community-based rock rainwater harvesting and storage Welthungerhilfe (German Agro Action) 34 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This initiative is a rock rainwater catchment and storage project funded by the Directorate General of the European Commission for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO). It is a drought preparedness intervention for poor drought-affected and underserved communities in arid and semi-arid lands. The initiative aims to improve the availability of drinking water and access to it, even in dry periods, improving public health. The goal of this rock catchment project is to increase the capacity of the most vulnerable communities of Kitui District in eastern Kenya, to withstand recurring droughts. Its specific objective is drought preparedness through improved sustainable, community-based access to water, and enhanced health. The project was carried out from October 2006 to 31 December 2007 in Mutha and Ikutha divisions of what was then known as Kitui District, Eastern Province, Kenya.15 It was implemented with the involvement of drought-affected communities, their chiefs and elders, other relief and development agencies operating in the area, as well as relevant government ministries. The project targeted over 36,000 men, women and children from water- poor communities that were highly vulnerable to the effects of drought. Implemented by Welthungerhilfe with funding from DG ECHO, the project contributed to the following impacts: \u2022 Drought-affected water-poor communities had at least 3 litres of safe drinking water per person per day, available for at least 90 days of each dry season within walking distance from their homes, at a maximum of 4 kilometres - thus being able to bridge the worst period when surface water surfaces have dried up. This water was for drinking only, not for any other uses, for which there were other, lower quality options. \u2022 The beneficiaries\u2019 health improved, particularly where water-borne diseases were concerned. This was a result of improved water access and availability, and improved sanitation and hygiene practices. \u2022 The beneficiaries\u2019 drought coping and management capacities have been strengthened. 15 Kitui District is now newly divided into two districts. The project was carried out in what is now known as Mutomo District. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Poor communities have no choice but to try to survive in the driest and most drought-prone areas of East Africa, where they are burdened by chronic malnutrition and a lack of resources. Furthermore, the current increase in drought frequency and severity, which allows for less time for recovery, has triggered a downward spiral in disaster vulnerability and poverty. In this context, the project was initiated by Welthungerhilfe after more than a year of intensive baseline data collection on the ground, including many community interviews, discussions with stakeholders and reviews of secondary data. The strategies adopted by the project are as follows: \u2022 Strategic positioning of water access points to ensure easy maintenance and sustainability, with great emphasis on rainwater collection and storage in an area with low groundwater potential (any area with seasonal rains of 150 mm and more is suitable for rainwater collection). \u2022 Intensive and highly participatory community involvement throughout the project. \u2022 Community capacity building. \u2022 Intensive training, including on hygiene and contingency water management.

As a matter of fact, clean drinking water is vital for maintaining public health, and hence lives and livelihoods. Better water access also frees up community human resources for productive work to maintain livelihoods. The Good Practice This project can be considered a good practice because it deals with rock catchments, which are a key to the sustainable development of rural community water supply. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that Welthungerhilfe has successfully supported different types of rainwater catchment systems like earth dams and pans, and roof and rock catchments in Kenya and other countries. Its broad experience reveals that rainwater harvesting and storage, particularly via rock catchments, is: \u2022 Vastly underused in spite of its high potential. \u2022 An advantageous option for supporting community water supply, especially in arid and semi-arid areas with limited rainy seasons and long dry spells. \u2022 An appropriate low-tech and cost-effective technology. \u2022 Yields an enormous potential for decentralized supply of drinking water. It also emerges from Welthungerhilfe\u2019s experience that: \u2022 Decentralized point sources are an excellent option where other options are too expensive or do not exist. \u2022 Communities adopt and \u2018own\u2019 such ideas and approaches immediately. \u2022 Community capacity can be built so that beneficiaries themselves can own, operate, maintain and manage their water. Key success factors in the project include: \u2022 Intensive and genuine community participation from the assessment stage onwards. \u2022 Close monitoring and assistance by technically knowledgeable staff. \u2022 Deployment of local skilled artisans to remain with the beneficiary communities and guide them throughout their work. Overall, the project was implemented bearing in mind the fact that sustainable poverty reduction not only involves different sectors, but is also a long-term effort that cannot be dealt with through a one or two-year disaster risk reduction initiative. 36 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Rainwater collection and storage for drinking purposes is an ideal drought preparedness tool for arid and semi arid areas that do not have suitable groundwater potential. Currently, Kenya is just using four per cent of its usable rainwater collection potential, even as it is categorised as a chronically water-scarce country, which expects major negative impacts from climate change. \u2022 Intensive community sensitization, mobilization, as well as consistent involvement and capacity building are key to ownership and sustainability. \u2022 As rock catchments depend on suitable geological features, the type of water supply structures involved must be strategically combined with other types of structures \u2013 such as protected wells, sand dams, and so forth - so as to ensure a strategic spread of sources in a drought-prone area. The major challenge for this project was: \u2022 There can be competing demands on beneficiaries\u2019 time. The project approach required the beneficiaries to provide all local labour and materials. In the case of rock catchments with water storage tanks, this required a substantial effort on their part. Cash- for-work contributed to address this issue but could not cover the full amount of time required for completion of the work involved. However, these constraints did not diminish the enthusiasm of the beneficiaries in building \u2018their\u2019 rock catchments. To improve similar projects in the future, additional refresher training and closer involvement of other stakeholders are necessary. To maintain the success of this project in replication, community mobilizers should travel frequently to the field, at least twice a week.

In fact, Welthungerhilfe is already replicating this approach in some neighbouring districts. Replication of this project in a different context, however, would require careful assessment of local social, political, and cultural patterns.

Liberia Drain cleaning to reduce potential for flooding and improve sanitation Integration of mitigation activities into a labour-intensive infrastructure programme in Liberia Mercy Corps 38 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This initiative is a flood risk mitigation project to clear and rehabilitate drainage systems. Even though floods trigger recurrent disasters - due to the heavy rains that regularly occur in Liberia - drainage systems have not been maintained for decades, for reasons including lack of funds, years of neglect and misrule, and the civil war. The main goal of the project is to provide the country with a visible benefit of the new post-conflict era of democratic government, by creating jobs for rural Liberians through infrastructure programmes and roadside brushing. The project began in September 2006 and was completed in September 2007. It was implemented in Sinoe, Grand Gedeh, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Montserrado counties, including Buchanan and Kakata cities, in western and west-central Liberia. The infrastructure work was planned in consultation with county officials, and the project worked with community youth clubs that had been supported in earlier projects. Targeting unemployed rural individuals, the project was implemented by Mercy Corps under a UNDP grant funded by the World Bank. It reduced flood risks, improved the infrastructure of rural Liberia, and generated more than 17,800 days of employment. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Before the civil war the drains were cleaned regularly with public resources, but since then many years of refuse and mud have blocked the drains and created both a health and safety hazard. The targeted communities ignored the problem because nobody had the required resources to deal with it. Cleaning the drains was simply not a priority. However, after Mercy Corps discussed the possibility of cash-for-work options with government officials, the latter were enthusiastic about the idea. In Buchanan and Kakata cities, reducing flood risks involved improving drainage by removing truckloads of debris. This significantly increased the flow of rainwater through the drains, and reduced the risk of local floods and related health risks linked to poor sanitation. The project also addressed local needs, including the provision of clean water through water well rehabilitation, and improved market access though clearance of roads and construction of small bridges. The project activities were an integral component of the infrastructure programme adopted in response to requests from local officials, and the Mercy Corps grant contract with UNDP was adjusted accordingly. The work reduced risk and vulnerability by addressing a public health hazard that had the potential to flood homes and markets. The project introduced elements of sustainability by working through local governments and by leaving tools and materials (e.g. shovels, wheelbarrows, boots and gloves) with government departments. It also contributed to short-term employment through the creation of cash-for-work jobs for several weeks. The Good Practice This project can be regarded as a good practice because it was responsive to the priorities of the targeted communities. This boosted project ownership, making it easy to improve local knowledge of natural hazards during the mitigation efforts. The project was also very popular with both officials and unemployed youth because of its job creation potential. It met the double objective of creating income and achieving work that benefits the public. Government officials expressed satisfaction over the attainment of the two objectives in a single project. A major challenge during project implementation was the donor\u2019s reluctance to allow Mercy Corps to sub-contract local government authorities. 39 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 No matter how much training is provided to communities in Liberia, it is unlikely that technical skills such as well maintenance can be transferred without extensive involvement and constant monitoring. \u2022 Local officials, including development superintendents and engineers, should be consulted and used as much as possible. \u2022 INGOs such as Mercy Corps should be allowed to sub-contract local government authorities, who normally have a good understanding of local needs and priorities, and should be regarded as reliable and trustworthy partners. \u2022 To increase the impact of similar projects in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98f5185c-4b41-41e8-9903-e0a061975212": {"__data__": {"id_": "98f5185c-4b41-41e8-9903-e0a061975212", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d1b19ac937c0e571a3ed743e0426193ff3a0207ba83ebbac8cbf185b6e06767"}}, "hash": "1d1b19ac937c0e571a3ed743e0426193ff3a0207ba83ebbac8cbf185b6e06767", "text": "the future, further drainage and cleaning should be undertaken in small and medium cities.

For more information, please contact: Mr. Tom Ewert Mercy Corps E\u2013mail: tewert@lr.mercycorps.org Potential for Replication The project methodology can be easily replicated in other contexts, but can only serve as a short-term measure because it is not sustainable. If implemented on a larger scale, these employment creation programmes require a clear exit strategy, to reduce potential labour market distortions. The best option to sustain this project is to empower both the government and civil society to accept responsibility for keeping the drains clean. 40 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Drought mitigation initiative brings relief to poor farmers\u2019 assets Abstract Many poor families in Phalombe District, southern Malawi, are dependent on rain-fed agriculture for their basic nutritional intake, and financial assets are either non-existent or very limited. In times of drought, they are forced to sell their assets to purchase food. This depletes their asset base which then needs to be replenished. Another coping strategy employed is migration of male family members, for example, to Mozambique. This exposes the men to risks such as HIV/AIDS and exacerbates drought impact on those left behind. In January 2007, the Evangelical Lutheran Development Service (ELDS) initiated a community- based pilot drought mitigation project targeting some 100 poor rural families in the district. The Project, which is part of Christian Aid\u2019s ongoing global project \u2018Building Disaster Resilient Communities\u2019, tackles the water supply problem by channelling mountain spring water for irrigation, and providing better access to drinking water. The project has directly improved the food security of the poor families throughout the year and particularly in times of drought. By addressing the key problem of asset depletion among poor families in times of drought, the project directly intervenes in the food budget and ensures that families have a stable nutritional intake throughout the year. While the project was initially designed as a drought mitigation initiative, it has become clear that the risk reduction work directly contributes to poverty reduction by ensuring that the families\u2019 productive assets are protected and continue to generate income during crises. Malawi A pipeline channeling water for domestic use and irrigation \u2018Building Disaster Resilient Communities\u2019 Christian Aid (In partnership with the Evangelical Lutheran Development Service - ELDS) 41 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Initiative The initiative is a pilot drought mitigation project that seeks to reduce the negative impact of repeated droughts and erratic rainfall in eight villages of Phalombe District, southern Malawi, by channelling mountain spring water for irrigation, and providing improved access to drinking water. The pilot project is part of Christian Aid\u2019s global project \u2018Building Disaster Resilient Communities\u2019, which was launched in January 2006. Activities in the eight villages began in January 2007 and they were completed in March 2008. Traditional leaders, elders and key community members in the eight villages were involved in the required initial consultations on the project. Communities were involved as a whole during the in-depth vulnerability and capacity assessment process, and during planning. All beneficiaries \u2013 some 100 poor families \u2013 are participating in the implementation. This project was co-funded by the UK government\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) and Christian Aid. The implementing agency was the Evangelical Lutheran Development Service (ELDS) with support from Christian Aid. The project directly improved the food security of some 100 poor families throughout the year and particularly in times of drought. By addressing the key problem of asset depletion among poor families in times of drought, the project directly intervened in the food budget and ensured that families had a stable nutritional intake throughout the year. While the project was initially designed as a drought mitigation initiative, it has become clear that risk reduction work directly contributes to poverty reduction by ensuring that productive assets of farming families are protected and continue to generate income during crises. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction The poor families in Phalombe District struggle with food security at regular intervals during the year. Many families are dependent on rain-fed agriculture for their basic nutritional intake, and financial assets are either non-existent or very limited. Therefore, in times of drought, affected families\u2019 lack of purchasing power leads to crisis situations, tipping whole communities over the edge. In fact, the repeated occurrence of droughts and erratic rainfall in the district has led to an endemic cycle of poverty, where poor families are repeatedly forced to sell off their assets in order to purchase food that they have not been able to harvest themselves.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "738c40c4-e3f0-445b-94d4-a40825c216e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "738c40c4-e3f0-445b-94d4-a40825c216e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3fbe2147c378ef254ba1c8a9bbc1b851ea327eed1ab923029289c576f6d6ac4"}}, "hash": "a3fbe2147c378ef254ba1c8a9bbc1b851ea327eed1ab923029289c576f6d6ac4", "text": "In this way, their asset base is depleted and needs to be replenished on a regular basis without reducing their vulnerability and poverty. Poor communities have tried their best to cope with their situation, which combined disaster risk and poverty. In addition to selling off their assets (e.g., chicken, livestock, radios, and bicycles) when drought strikes, another coping strategy is migration of male family members, for example to Mozambique, exposing men to risks such as HIV/AIDS, and exacerbating drought impact. For communities left behind with fewer human resources, fetching water involves walking more than three kilometres up a mountain range to collect water from three mountain springs. To help minimize and manage risks, the ELDS/ Christian Aid pilot project activities, designed and implemented by the communities, focused on building pipelines that would channel water from the nearest spring in the mountains to the affected communities so that they could use it both for domestic use and for irrigation. The ELDS contributed materials, the community members contributed labour, and the local government contributed technical expertise for conducting the necessary surveys, designing the pipelines and the irrigation system. The result was an irrigated land of about 10 hectares. Even though this may not sound much, as people generally have very small land holding sin this area, it meant that some 100 families were benefiting. Calculations based on past years have shown that a harvest of maize from about 0.1 hectares, grown with improved seed and timely fertilizer application, can feed a family of six for about eight months. In a very good year, the harvest can last through the year, but that is not always (and increasingly less) the case. 42 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The project also provided seeds and fertilizers, plus storage structures to store maize, and support in post- harvest pest control. This work was based on experience with grain banks that communities have constructed in the region, which have been successfully used to store and treat maize with post-harvest pesticides. The families who were part of this initiative in the last year still have grain from last year\u2019s harvest. The fact that irrigation added another cropping season to the annual cycle means that even in poor years, the second harvest ensures food security for families who would otherwise have been exposed to the risk of hunger. Additionally, enhanced food security means that families can hold on to their productive assets and reduce their vulnerability to future droughts by accumulating small surpluses to be sold on local markets. The time saved by women by not collecting water from the mountain spring, can now be used productively for child care and to engage in community organisations. As the community installed four points in the pipeline from which to draw water, women also do not have to queue and wait as long as before. Apart from the women, elderly people in the communities have also benefited directly from the improved access to water for domestic use. The elderly - many of whom look after orphans of relatives and who have nobody to support them in their daily chores \u2013 often could not tackle the three kilometre walk into the mountains to fetch drinking water and were dependent on (polluted) shallow wells or favours from neighbours. This initiative identified opportunities to reduce the poor families\u2019 vulnerability to drought as well as protecting their productive assets, directly contributing to poverty reduction. This would not have been possible without comprehensive capacity and vulnerability assessments being conducted in a participatory manner, and after much training, sensitization and reflection by project staff. As well as protecting productive assets, the communities are also expecting less dependency on volatile price markets. As farmers in the district usually sell their produce at the farm gate, they are often forced to sell their harvest below the actual market prices. During lean periods, the price of staple foods, in particular of maize, can become unaffordable, which had forced poor families to resort to eating wild fruits, and becoming vulnerable to malnutrition. The Good Practice This pilot project can be described as a good practice because it reduces vulnerability to both disaster and poverty, with the participation of the beneficiaries themselves key to its success. Keys to the success of the project were: \u2022 The process: Existing opportunities were identified in a participatory process of analyzing capacities and vulnerabilities of the communities and the most vulnerable households.

Also, the local government was directly involved from the start, including in the assessment process, the design and implementation of the project, contributing their technical expertise. \u2022 Addressing root causes through a process of learning: During the project, the rationale of drought mitigation through irrigation supply was broadened as participatory analysis, planning and implementation allowed communities to identify direct links to poverty reduction. Thus, avoiding asset depletion became an integral part of the project design. \u2022 Addressing the potential of conflict by an inclusive approach: An area was defined for irrigation, based on the irrigation capacity of the stream. While the identified land was held by specific members of the communities, it was agreed that they would continue to use it during the rain-fed cropping season, but that the land would be divided up equally among communities and members during the irrigation season. In this way, the communities ensured support from and benefits for all families involved. 43 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project were: \u2022 Through the participatory vulnerability and capacity building process, communities realize what opportunities exist within their areas and in their villages. They start thinking about things that they themselves can do instead of relying on external analysis and support. \u2022 Initiatives identified by community members themselves have a much greater probability of being seen through and being sustainable. The contribution that communities gave in working on carrying the pipes up the mountains and overseeing the construction of the pipeline has been substantial. \u2022 Involving local government from the start (i.e. during the assessment phase) helps secure their support and contribution in implementation. Enough time needs to be given to the initial phases to get every relevant individual in the respective departments (in this case the Ministry for Irrigation and Water Development) on board. \u2022 Being inclusive and involving community members without direct access to arable land ensured broader support and greater benefit. While the identified land was held by specific members of the communities, it was agreed that they would continue to use it during the rain-fed cropping season, but that the land would be divided up equally among communities and members during the irrigation season. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 The soil in the area was very stony, which seemed to limit the participation of some communities and community members who did not have access to productive land, and therefore would not have benefited from irrigated agricultural production. Therefore, it was agreed to earmark plots on the irrigated area for those families during the irrigation season only. The chiefs agreed to continue leaving the land for private use during the rainy season but to distribute it during irrigation season to include other community members and villages from the surrounding areas. In this way, broad support and greater benefit was ensured. \u2022 The sustainability of the initiative is a key challenge as the provision of seeds and fertilizers was initially organized by the implementing agency. To address this issue, the villages built grain banks but also opened accounts with local banks. Seeds and fertilizers are now given to farmers on a revolving basis and they make payments to the joint bank account. The account is then used to pay for new seeds and fertilizers in every season. The communities wish to upgrade this system by introducing high value crops such as vegetables into the production cycles, and a seed bank to consolidate the system and produce a surplus. \u2022 Furthermore, while seeds and fertilizers are readily available in the area, marketing of their produce is more difficult for local farmers. Usually they sell to intermediate buyers who then sell on to urban markets, with farmers losing out on price. By working together within the community, farmers could do joint marketing to increase their bargaining power and negotiate better farm gate prices with middlemen. The project staff and some community members would even like to improve direct access to markets, particularly for vegetables such as cabbage. 44 Good Practices and Lessons Learned For more information, please contact: Ms. Bina Desai Christian Aid E-mail: bdesai@christian-aid.org Potential for Replication The participatory, reflexive and integrative approach of the project is easily replicable. However, the activity of providing irrigation is dependent on whether an adequate water source is available, in this case the mountain springs.

With each drought year, the villagers have taken increasingly extreme measures, including selling livestock and household assets to buy food. Men started migrating to neighbouring Mozambique or to towns to find work, and returned home infected by HIV which they passed on to their wives. With time, due to illness, the main bread-winners could no longer work. Many elderly women have been left to look after their orphaned grandchildren - who they marry off early if they cannot afford to keep them in school. As a result, these households became dependent on yearly food aid. In early 2006, Tearfund16 initiated a livelihood diversification project through micro and medium- scale enterprise development for poor women in the village. The initiative was taken following a risk assessment that identified low agricultural productivity and lack of alternative livelihoods as the sources of growing poverty and vulnerability. Malawi A member of the \u2018Sekan- dikudyele\u2019 group with a juice extracting machine 16 Tearfund is a UK-based Christian relief and development agency working with a global network of local churches to help eradicate poverty. Livelihood diversification project through micro and medium-scale enterprise development for poor women Tearfund (In partnership with River of Life Relief and Development - ROLDD) 46 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This is a livelihood diversification project through micro- and medium-scale enterprise development for poor women in an area where the main livelihood \u2013 agriculture - is frequently hampered by droughts. Local varieties of fruit trees are grafted with hybrid varieties that produce more juice and can withstand drought. The fruits (mangoes, pineapples, lemons and papaya) are then juiced, bottled and sold. Poor women have been mobilized into groups of 15, and linked to a Government of Malawi scheme that provides loans for fruit extracting machines. The goal of the project is to make communities in and around Chididi Village in Nsanje District (southern Malawi) resilient to shocks and disasters, through poverty reduction. The objectives of the project are: \u2022 To diversify household income so that when harvests are insufficient, poor families can have cash to buy food. \u2022 To increase cash income for critical non-food items. \u2022 To aid the asset recovery of beneficiaries who over time have had to sell assets to survive droughts/food insecurity, and have no current means of coping with future disasters. \u2022 To halt the migration trends that exacerbate the incidence of HIV/AIDS in the area. The project began in early 2006, targeting 100 extremely vulnerable households in and around Chididi Village. The households were identified following a thorough disaster risk assessment process, and targeted vulnerable women who were the poorest of the poor, including the elderly and those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. The project is still under way with a view to scaling it up into neighbouring communities. Involved in the project are the following stakeholders: Tearfund\u2019s partner River of Life Relief and Development (ROLDD), the district office of the Malawian Ministry of Agriculture, community development and extension workers, and communities in and around Chididi Village, including women\u2019s groups. The government provided the loan for the juice extraction machines under an existing scheme, and ROLDD facilitates the project and helped organize the community members to access the scheme. Community development extension workers provide recipes for different types of juices.

The community members are confident that they can now deal with shocks, as they now have a coping mechanism. 47 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Chididi Village has been devastated by frequent droughts since the major drought of 2001. The community became dependent on food aid, as chronic food insecurity set in. With each drought year, more and more extreme measures were taken, including selling livestock and household assets to buy food, thereby sinking communities deeper and deeper into the poverty trap. Men started to migrate to neighbouring Mozambique or to towns to find work, and returned home having contracted HIV \u2013 which they then passed on to their wives. This added to the complexity of the issues as with time, due to illness, the main breadwinners could no longer work on- farm or off-farm. Many elderly women have been left to look after their orphaned grandchildren who they marry off early if they cannot afford to keep them in school. These households became dependent on yearly food aid. The area had benefited 20 years earlier from a fruit seedling distribution project, and so those who cared for their seedlings had a variety of fruits available; but these trees had not until now been recognized as a resource that they could exploit to diversify their livelihoods. Furthermore, during drought, fruits are dry and unpalatable. During a Participatory Assessment of Disaster Risk (PADR), poor agricultural productivity resulting from drought and lack of alternative livelihoods were identified as the source of increasing poverty and vulnerability. The causes of inadequate productivity were said to be increased frequency and severity of drought. As part of its risk management plan, the Tearfund project prioritized agricultural strengthening and livelihood diversification through micro and medium enterprise development. Local resources or capacities identified included the fruit trees, among others. The fruit trees were grafted with hybrid varieties that produced more juice even during droughts. In 2006 and 2007, the trees produced an abundance of fruits, and these fruit trees will also be irrigated during seasons of reduced rainfall. The project helps reduce poverty and disaster risk and vulnerability by the following means: \u2022 Households with one or more members in the women\u2019s groups have a cash income to keep children in school, to build permanent houses, to buy new assets, food of their choice and other non-food requirements. The project is taking households out of the poverty trap. Those who, through money raised in the business, bought good quality seeds and fertilizers were able to have bumper harvests in the 2006- 2007 season; which means they did not buy food all year, and were able to sell excess to invest into other areas. If this upward trend continues, the community will no longer be considered poor. The groups involved also want to invest in treadle pumps so that they never rely on rain-fed agriculture again, which they see as the source of their poverty and food insecurity. \u2022 In addition to this, the community members are confident that they can now deal with shocks, as they have recovered assets that they can sell to take them through disaster periods, whilst knowing that they will buy back these assets with money made from the business. This means they have a coping mechanism that they did not have before. \u2022 The resulting empowerment has led community leaders to stop asking for handouts, instead stating that they have capacities to address their own issues \u2013 but just need support where their capacities are exceeded. \u2022 In this case, the starting point was disaster risk reduction. Through risk assessment, it was recognized that poverty was the main source of vulnerability; therefore, to reduce risk, people had to be taken out of poverty. \u2022 The women\u2019s groups are able to sell fruit tree seedlings, graft trees for others for a fee and buy fruits from surrounding communities, positively affecting others who are not direct project beneficiaries. \u2022 Some women have been able to build fortified houses with iron roofing from the proceeds of the business. Others have invested in agriculture, such as in better quality seeds and fertilizers, and have reported bumper harvests that have made them food secure.

It is also a means of developing coping mechanisms for the poor when their livelihoods are frequently affected by hazards. \u2022 A medium-scale enterprise like this that involves groups and provides employment to many, positively affects the community faster than micro- or individual-scale enterprises. Furthermore, it is less likely that such an initiative would fail, as the temptation to eat into capital gains when household level issues arise, is minimized. In micro- and individual-level enterprises, illness or other unexpected needs force entrepreneurs to spend money meant for investment, terminating business. This is unlikely to happen as there is peer accountability in groups. \u2022 Targeting the most vulnerable - poor women - who are affected by chronic food insecurity, is good practice. Disaster hits the poorest hardest. Women and children bear the brunt of the hunger gaps, as men migrate to find work and are not always so affected. \u2022 This particular enterprise is not labour intensive and even the elderly and people living with AIDS can take part. \u2022 Fruit grafting with hybrid varieties provides an alternative food source where previously fruits would have been unpalatable during droughts. \u2022 Not introducing new fruit tree varieties entirely, but using existing drought-resistant varieties and helping them become more productive, ensures prudent environmental stewardship. \u2022 The project was able to identify local capacities and local resources that the community could exploit to increase their resilience to drought. Looking outside the community would have made the project more complex. \u2022 Through propagating fruit seedlings, the project contributes to reforestation in the area, and increases consumption of vitamin-rich fruits. \u2022 The project is addressing both poverty reduction and disaster risk reduction issues, creating resilient communities. The key success factors in the project are: \u2022 New skills are being taught to women\u2019s group members, including new recipes, basic business management skills, leadership skills, and so forth. This has led to financial and social empowerment. \u2022 Having a disposable income means that beneficiaries can buy their preferred food items and are able to buy essential non-food items and assets. Two grandmothers looking after their orphaned grandchildren, say they can now send their three grandchildren to school from the proceeds of the business. \u2022 Working with multiple stakeholders, and linking communities with government schemes for maximum benefit, will ensure sustainability of support beyond the project lifetime. Each stakeholder brings in different expertise and knowledge that holistically build capacity in the community. \u2022 Others are indirectly benefiting with a new market created for their fruits. \u2022 Increased fruit consumption for the people living with AIDS will contribute to healthier lives. \u2022 Local markets are available, including local schools and hospitals, where the juice can be sold \u2013 without travelling long distances to find markets. \u2022 Bank accounts have been opened by the groups, and for many this is their first introduction to the banking system. 49 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: 1. This project has confirmed the importance of thorough risk assessment to highlight the intricate relationship between poverty and vulnerability. 2. Communities often have unexplored resources that they can use to begin micro- or medium-scale enterprises. These businesses, when supported by NGOs, can bring about more transformation at household level than other interventions. Transformation at household level very quickly has a positive affect on the entire community as new opportunities are created for others. 3. Livelihood diversification initiatives must not be done in isolation from other initiatives, but in addition to the strengthening of existing livelihoods. The principle of diversification is that households must not be dependent on only one source of income, so that when one source is destroyed by a hazard, there are alternative incomes to fall back on. 4. One well thought-through enterprise can create work for an entire community. As this initiative grows, the original groups will seek to concentrate on only producing the juice. They will pay others to collect and prepare the fruits \u2013 travelling out to neighbouring communities to buy fruits; those with fruit trees will earn an income from selling their fruits; others will be encouraged to set up micro businesses by buying the bottled", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "359c1e73-0d62-43bf-8e96-36e77c882897": {"__data__": {"id_": "359c1e73-0d62-43bf-8e96-36e77c882897", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc57d4f464c11ad19a297163af576a71d97493d02b56c5c1d15cfe2c6a4ed16f"}}, "hash": "bc57d4f464c11ad19a297163af576a71d97493d02b56c5c1d15cfe2c6a4ed16f", "text": "juice at wholesale prices and taking it to markets outside the vicinity of the community to sell at retail prices; other groups may become the middlemen \u2013 travelling to the city to buy bottles and labels at wholesale price and supplying the groups at a profit. Others still could concentrate on the grafting and raising of seedlings to sell to surrounding villages and beyond. All this can stem from one initiative, and competition need not arise. 5. As far as possible, it is good to work closely with existing government departments and personnel, and link communities with existing government schemes. Involving government staff also provides an opportunity for them to learn new approaches and new ways of thinking that they may not have been exposed to. As a result, NGO interventions can become successful models that government can replicate and scale-up elsewhere. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 The groups have found local markets, but are operating below the capacity of the machines. The abundant availability of fruits means that they can produce more, if other markets at district level are identified. This would require more support from ROLDD and other supporting institutions. \u2022 Bureaucracy at the Malawi Bureau of Standards means that a similar group would find it difficult to gain accreditation. The groups received accreditation through the active facilitation of the Tearfund partner, which was required to make numerous trips and kept waiting for significant lengths of time during each visit to the bureau. If the groups had to travel from such a remote location and spend many days in the city without support, they would have given up. \u2022 Bottles, preservatives and labels have to be ordered from Blantyre, the nearest town; and linking the group members with the supplier has been a challenge. \u2022 The illiteracy of some group members had potential to cause problems, particularly in understanding incoming, expenditure and profit margins as well as labelling information for them to communicate to customers. \u2022 The juice extracting machines have been loaned and these loans need to be repaid over time. Unless productivity is increased and new markets found, this may be a problem in the medium to long term. \u2022 Scale-up of this particular initiative could result in competition, and scarcity of raw materials, that is, fruits. Micro- and medium-level enterprise development therefore needs to be creative in identifying different enterprises for different groups. 50 Good Practices and Lessons Learned For more information, please contact: Ms. Angela Mugore Tearfund E-mail: angela.mugore@tearfund.org Potential for Replication Replicating this project in the country depends on the availability of natural resources existing in the community. In this case it was fruits, but it could be other resources like gum trees that can be injected to produce more gum for sale, or an existing skill that is used to produce unique products. To replicate the project in other countries, government departments have different schemes that communities can be linked to, in order to access credit for different individual household level businesses. However, if as a group they are able to leverage bigger loans, then with support from community groups, they can take on medium-scale enterprises like this which provide employment for many, and quickly have a positive effect on the entire community. Regarding scale-up, there are some economic and political constraints that need to be taken into consideration. These include dependency on outside facilitation at every stage: to apply for the equipment from government, to register with Standards Bureaus, to find markets, and to order materials - in this case, bottles, labels and preservatives. Policies and entitlements may be in place but are often inaccessible to the very people they are supposed to serve, either because of literacy barriers, investments required for start-up (including travel costs) and corruption. To improve similar projects in the future, business skills and literacy training will be provided before the equipment loans are disbursed. This will minimize misunderstandings. Where appropriate, groups will also be encouraged to start saving for at least six months to build group cohesion, and instill money management discipline. However, when dealing with the poorest of the poor, this may not always be possible. 51 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Protecting livelihoods with local warning and response systems Abstract Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and one of the most frequently and worst affected by natural hazards.

In 2000, the heaviest rains in 50 years, combined with four cyclones, led to an unprecedented flood disaster that left some 800 people dead and some 4.5 million affected. This disaster, as well as others in the following years, reinforced the already existing cycle of poverty, and eroded development gains. No warning system was in place, and it is only recently that efforts were made to develop systematic coping mechanisms and strategies. In June 2007, a programme was launched by the country\u2019s National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) to help build disaster-resilient communities, as part of its National Master Plan for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction. The programme seeks to reduce community vulnerabilities through mechanisms such as local disaster management committees and local warning and response systems.

A programme of the National Master Plan for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction InWEnt17 (Capacity Building International) (In partnership with the National Disaster Management Institute of Mozambique - INGC18) 52 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This programme is part of the official 10-year National Master Plan for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction of Mozambique\u2019s National Disaster Management Institute (INGC). It aims to strengthen the population\u2019s ability to protect themselves by providing practical information on disaster risk reduction strategies, while also building up efficient local warning and response systems. A number of the country\u2019s most vulnerable communities were identified and encouraged to form local Disaster Management Committees (DMCs) of 20 to 25 members. Members have specific roles and are trained in different fields of disaster reduction. Some members ensure crucial early warning information reaches the right communities, authorities and relief agencies. Others are trained in evacuation, first aid, shelter and relief. Simulation exercises are carried out on how to prepare for and respond to floods, cyclones and earthquakes. The programme also includes identifying evacuation routes, developing risk maps, designing community emergency plans and approaches that educate community members to better understand and respond to specific threats. A partnership with the Mozambican Ministry of Education has been established to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into school lessons and school infrastructure. After a preparation period, the first activities were rolled out in June 2007 with a series of consultative workshops with authorities, community leaders and other key community members. Developing and setting up DMCs is still underway, with 34 DMCs established and trained so far. The plan is to ensure that all communities exposed to disaster risk are covered by the programme. The programme is implemented nationwide in Mozambique. InWEnt (Capacity Building International), a German organisation focusing on capacity building, supports INGC in six districts of the three northern provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado and Niassa. The six districts - Moma, Mecufi, Nacala, Lago, Aldeia Sassalane and Metanculo - were identified as very poor and particularly vulnerable to disasters such as cyclones, floods and earthquakes. The programme is implemented by INGC with assistance from InWEnt and financial support from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Prior to these programme interventions, the targeted communities had never received information and training on DRR. Some 50 people have now been trained in each of the three provinces in disaster risk reduction, awareness- raising and developing local warning and response systems. It is expected that by November 2008 some 60,000 community members living in high risk areas will have been supported by the programme. InWEnt programme support is guaranteed until November 2008, after which there will be an assessment, and project extension will be considered. Overall, the project helps build stronger community cohesion and increased self-confidence. It also assists local populations to become hands-on activists to protect their communities, in addition to improving disaster preparedness and reducing loss of life, property and livelihoods. 53 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and one of the most frequently and worst affected by natural hazards.

It is only recently that efforts were made to develop systematic coping mechanisms and strategies, minimizing risks and making the population less vulnerable to disasters. In the past, the population was exposed to disaster risks with no strategy to protect themselves and their belongings. Now there are strategies in place to form local DMCs, and develop a warning system to guide the population and inform authorities and relief agencies. These initiatives are building up the capacity of local populations and empowering them to play a proactive role in ensuring the security of their families and livelihoods. Also, a participatory approach has been adopted which not only minimizes disaster risk and vulnerability but also poverty risks. It builds upon best practices learnt from other successful interventions in flood-affected areas in Mozambique, which have been adapted and enhanced for maximum effectiveness. Moreover, as mentioned, the project also results in stronger community cohesion and increased self-confidence, assisting local populations to become hands-on activists in the protection of their communities. This sense of activism and confidence also benefits community life beyond the specifics of disaster mitigation. At this stage, it is still too early to judge the extent of the intended impact of improved disaster preparedness, reduced loss of life, property and livelihoods. The results of this long-term approach will be visible only after a period of time, particularly during the next floods, cyclone or earthquake. The Good Practice The project is good practice because it uses a participatory approach to build upon the capacity of local populations, and empowers them to play a proactive role in ensuring the security of their families and livelihoods. The benefits of the approaches are easily demonstrated to participants, encouraging \u2018buy-in\u2019. It is cost-effective and has been adapted from other effective interventions elsewhere in Mozambique. Furthermore, it is easily transferable and can be adapted to other regions and countries. Interviews with members of local DMCs demonstrated that people were highly motivated to take over the responsibility of protecting themselves wherever possible. This is a precondition of sustainability and one of the key impacts of the programme. Additionally, the simulations of cyclones, floods and earthquakes provided much needed and highly useful opportunities to put theory into practice. More training and simulations have been requested by DMC members. A key success factor of this initiative is the direct involvement of local populations, which are best placed to identify multiple disaster risks. Coupled with the tangible benefits brought to the communities by effective disaster response, this resulted in a highly motivated target group of beneficiaries. Selected participatory approaches ensured that provincial district and community actors were all actively involved in the development of the programme. Furthermore, more training, refresher courses and simulation exercises will be conducted to ensure continuity and sustainability of the knowledge gained. 54 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Communities need to be mobilized to accept and own mitigation activities. \u2022 Involvement and integration of local government officials, elders and community leaders into the process and in the development of risk reduction plans is essential. \u2022 The community itself is a key agent of disaster preparedness. Once involved, people are highly motivated to protect themselves. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 Complex local dynamics. \u2022 Lack of resources. Sustainability means long- term investment and training, which can be costly. \u2022 Poor infrastructure undermines access to and supervision of remote areas. \u2022 Competing priorities within the Mozambican government\u2019s development agenda placed a squeeze on both technical/administrative capacity and on access to resources. \u2022 The country\u2019s size and demographic make-up means that some areas have low population density. Coupled with the accessibility and remoteness issue mentioned above, this means that investing in disaster mitigation and response in such areas is not always perceived as cost effective.

Due to poverty, they are compelled to live at the confluence of two rivers where they are extremely vulnerable to flood and water inundation. Meanwhile, their agriculture is still primarily dependant on seasonal rainfall, meaning hot and dry summers cause massive crop losses through drought. Few coping strategies have been available. In good seasons, when rain was enough for summer crops to be grown, food was stored for the inevitable monsoon floods. In poor seasons, wage labouring was the only option available. In March 2007, Practical Action launched an initiative to increase communities\u2019 social and economic capacity to respond to and cope with drought, through more resilient livelihood options. The initiative focused on establishing shallow tube wells. A shallow tube well is a tube or pipe vertically set into the ground at a depth of six to 18 meters, which suction-lifts water from shallow aquifers. The shallow tube wells have enabled the communities to reduce their vulnerability to drought while increasing their incomes, making them more resilient to other disasters. Nepal A reliable harvest due to improved irrigation Livelihood-centred approaches to disaster risk reduction Practical Action - Nepal (In partnership with MADE/Nepal) 56 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Initiative This initiative was one of the elements of a project called \u2018Livelihood-Centred Approaches to Disaster Risk Reduction\u2019. Its main goal is to increase the social and economic capacity of vulnerable communities to respond to and cope with drought through more resilient livelihood options. The initiative establishes shallow tube wells in drought-prone communities. It started in March 2007 and is still underway in Ward numbers 1 and 2 of Meghauli Village Development Committee (VDC19) in Chitwan District, southern Nepal. A shallow tube well (STW) is a tube or pipe vertically set into the ground at a depth of 20 to 60 feet (6 to 18 metres) to suction-lift water from shallow aquifers. Due to the installation of STWs, the targeted drought-prone communities in the southern Nepal district have been able to increase their incomes while reducing their vulnerability to drought. Using irrigation, farmers are now able to grow profitable crops even during the dry season, on land previously left fallow and unproductive for part of the year. Increased income means that these communities can better withstand the impact of natural hazards. The project activities were implemented through locally-established Project Implementation Committees (PICs), which represent the users of the tube wells. One hundred vulnerable households of Meghauli VDC were targeted, with one tube well for 12 households. The initiative is managed by Practical Action \u2013 Nepal, implemented by a local partner NGO, MADE/Nepal (Multi-Dimensional Agriculture for Development) with funding from the UK government\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID), Conflict and Humanitarian Fund (CHF). 19 VDCs are the smallest units of Nepal government administration. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction The communities, largely comprised of poor Kumal and Tamang tribes, face two major risks: disasters due to lack of water, and disasters due to too much water. Due to their poverty, they are compelled to live at the confluence of two rivers where they are extremely vulnerable to flood and water inundation. Agriculture supplemented by fishing is their main livelihood. In recent years, climate-induced disasters have increased in frequency and severity, affecting their agricultural productivity and threatening their livelihoods. Despite their closeness to the two rivers, their agriculture is primarily dependant on seasonal rainfall. A hot and dry summer causes massive crop losses through drought; heavy rainfall and flood during the rainy season exacerbates their misery. Few strategies have been available to reduce the risk of natural hazards. In good seasons, when adequate rain enabled summer crops to be grown, food was stored for the inevitable monsoon floods.

This small step has significantly increased the confidence level of community members, and brought enormous changes in their way of thinking. Farmers are enthusiastically initiating vegetable growing during the season when they previously had to leave their farms fallow. In the past, farmers often had to sow or transplant their crops with some delay due to the 57 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction late onset of rain, which severely reduced yields. Now farmers discuss in groups and allocate days for each and every family to use the STWs, so that they can plan their crop sowing and transplantation accordingly. Commenting on the ongoing change, Community Leader Min Bahadur Tamang said: \u201cIt was shameful for us to ask for support in irrigation while living in the river delta, but this was our primary need. In one spring in this area, over 50 hectares of maize died after flowering due to prolonged drought. In coming years, however, we can tackle this problem by irrigating our crops and protect them from dying.\u201d The Good Practice The good practice is that this activity is community owned and initiated. Following a vulnerability and needs assessment, the communities themselves identified the small size of their land holdings, their dependence on adequate and timely rain, and the impact of drought as major constraints to both their ability to earn a living, and to survive the impacts of natural hazards such as seasonal flooding. Key to the success of the initiative is the involvement of the communities at all stages, from planning to implementation of the STWs. Irrigation helps by intensifying the agricultural productivity of their limited land, increasing income while contributing to reduced vulnerability and poverty. While the longer-term impacts of the activity are still emerging, farmers have been encouraged to adopt more profitable farming ventures such as vegetable production for marketing locally. Lesson(s) Learned \u2022 The key lesson is to involve the community in the identification, planning and implementation of appropriate activities which reduce their vulnerability while enhancing their income earning capacity. \u2022 The major challenge was to secure community contribution. As Practical Action and the partner NGO were working with the poorest of the poor community, they had nothing to contribute to this initiative in the form of cash. The community did however provide all the unskilled labour for the implementation of the project. \u2022 Similar initiatives can be improved by ensuring that targeted community members are trained to maintain the pumps. For more information, please contact: Mr. Tek B. Sapkota Practical Action - Nepal E-mail: tek.sapkota@practicalaction.org.np Potential for Replication This initiative can be easily replicated in a different context provided that strategies to achieve its goals are appropriate, sustainable and relatively low cost. In particular, it can be replicated in areas where water tables are high, where the majority of the population depends on rain-fed agriculture, and where small-scale irrigation is an appropriate technology. However, since this is a relatively high-input initiative, a larger community contribution should be expected when working with relatively well-off communities. 58 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Integrating disaster risk reduction into post-disaster livelihood rehabilitation Abstract Poverty and the associated lack of preparedness for disasters contributed to major loss of life, severe damage to property, and trauma in a northern Pakistan village of Mansehra District, one of the areas most affected by the 2005 South Asia earthquake. The earthquake depleted human resources and destroyed property and essential infrastructure, increasing dependency, reinforcing chronic poverty among the poorest, and temporarily forcing others into poverty. Limited capacity to cope with future disasters needed to be addressed. In January 2007, Concern Worldwide initiated a livelihood rehabilitation project into which disaster risk reduction was integrated. The project, still under way, has helped restore people\u2019s lives to normal and restart their businesses, as well as reducing their vulnerabilities. Their resilience to disasters has increased, as has the sustainability of their livelihoods. Pakistan One of the affected villages of Mansehra District 20 Concern Worldwide is a non-governmental, international, humanitarian organisation dedicated to the reduction of suffer- ing and working towards the ultimate elimination of extreme poverty in the world\u2019s poorest countries. It seeks to help people living in extreme poverty achieve major improvements in their lives.

The project, which was launched in January 2007, is still underway in Miel Batt Village in Siran Valley Tehsil21 in Mansehra District, one of the areas most affected by the 2005 South Asia earthquake in Pakistan\u2019s North Western Frontier Province (NWFP). The project involves, through a participatory process, the Concern Worldwide Pakistan Programme (CWPP) and the local NGO HAASHAR, as well as the targeted communities. Targeting some 80,000 people affected by the 2005 South Asia earthquake, the project focused on a village of 950 residents. It is implemented by Concern Worldwide and HAASHAR, with funding from the European Commission (EC). The following impacts have been made by the project: \u2022 The lives of people affected by the earthquake have been restored to normal and their businesses restarted \u2022 The vulnerabilities that resulted in people becoming displaced have been reduced. 21 A Tehsil is an administrative unit hierarchically above the city, town or village. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Poverty and the associated lack of preparedness for seismic events contributed to the vulnerability of local communities, resulting in major loss of life, severe damage to property, and trauma. The 2005 South Asia earthquake increased the level of poverty, depleted human resources, and destroyed property and essential infrastructure in the project area. Livelihoods and social life were curtailed, resulting in reduced capacity to cope, and increased dependency. The earthquake reinforced existing chronic poverty among the poorest and temporarily forced others into poverty. Overall, there was limited capacity within the communities to cope with future disasters, and they lacked awareness and preparedness. To help address the situation, the Concern Worldwide project built the disaster risk reduction capacity of the communities through training, establishing community organisations (COs), and advancing structural work such as cut- off drains, protecting walls, placing gabions, building irrigation channels, constructing water supply schemes, protecting water resources, providing agriculture inputs, empowering women through vocational training and tools, and restoring access to markets. The project: \u2022 Promotes action on livelihood diversification as a strategy to reduce vulnerabilities. \u2022 Educates stakeholders and communities on how to integrate disaster risk reduction into livelihood activities. \u2022 Provides sources of income outside high-risk areas. \u2022 Targets the poorest and most vulnerable - women, disabled people, landless, orphans and minorities - to help reduce their vulnerabilities to disasters. Integrating disaster risk reduction into livelihood-related activities has helped protect the poor from displacement, and restart their normal lives. The project also helped restart agriculture, livestock and small enterprises. The communities\u2019 capacity to cope with future disasters increased, along with their resilience and the sustainability of their livelihoods. 60 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Good Practice This project is a good practice because it addresses both vulnerability to disasters and poverty in an integrated manner. It has also helped other communities to have easy access to markets and safe passage. The major success factors in the project are: \u2022 The cut-off drains, which worked well and reduced landslide risk and vulnerability, and brought the communities\u2019 displacement to an end. \u2022 Broad community participation and close coordination with local government authorities and line departments. Lesson(s) Learned The major lesson learned from this project is that integrating disaster risk reduction into rehabilitation efforts can help protect people from disaster risk. Major challenges of this initiative were related to logistics issues such as working in a difficult, high- altitude terrain. These challenges were, however, overcome through community participation and contribution. For more information, please contact: Mr. Syed Sulaiman Concern Worldwide \u2013 Pakistan E-mail: syed.sulaiman@concern.net Potential for Replication It should be relatively easy to replicate this project elsewhere by ensuring a participatory process and utilizing local knowledge and skills.

The main objective of the project is to improve the rural population\u2019s welfare by protecting their livelihoods from climate change and disaster impacts, through training and climate change adaptation strategies including better land management and the introduction of better irrigation techniques. The project, initiated by Practical Action \u2013 Peru, kicked off in March 2006 and it is still under way in western Peru in the populated centre of Coyllur in Huaraz District, Huaraz Province, Ancash Region. Coyllur is located in the upper part of the geographical area of Quillcay Sub- Basin River, Santa River Basin, stretching from 3,200 m to 5,668 m above sea level. Direct project beneficiaries are 40 families in Coyllur; indirect beneficiaries are all the 130 families of the local community. To run the project, coordination has been established with the Mayor, and the chairman and other top leaders of the farmers\u2019 community. The project involves developing irrigation systems in two parcels of community land and with three individual families. The project is being implemented by Practical Action \u2013 Peru, with funding from the UK government\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) Conflict and Humanitarian Fund (CHF). Throughout the development of the project, alliances have been made with several sectors of Huaraz Provincial Government, the Ministry of Agriculture through PRONAMACH (National Watershed Management Programme), and the National University of Santiago which provided advice and support during the training days. Farmers were initially reluctant to change their habits and customs with respect to planting their crops. However, the project has demonstrated that using low-cost irrigation techniques, prepared with minimal resources, help make better use of water, increase production, generate higher returns and reduce conflict with neighbouring communities. The irrigation techniques also help solve problems associated with slope cultivation such as soil erosion, landslides and flooding. Appropriate irrigation techniques have won the support of local authorities and are now being promoted at district and provincial levels for inclusion in the decentralized participatory budget process. 63 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction The local rural population in Coyllur is predominantly agricultural. Farming takes place on steep land. There are few attempts to control erosion, and irrigation, where available, is by flooding with little terracing. Extensive clearance of indigenous vegetation has further destabilized the land. Intense rainfall in the wet season leads to extensive soil erosion, and destabilized slopes exacerbate landslide risk. The dry season is lengthening, impacting on crop yields. There is no local knowledge on steep land cultivation or appropriate irrigation technologies. The project identified the following hazard risks in Coyllur: earthquakes, floods, landslides, thunderstorms, strong winds, weather threats (frosts, heat waves) and mudslides - known in the area as llocllas. These events are a consequence of both inappropriate farming methods and climate variability, impacting directly on the population\u2019s agriculture-based livelihoods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5eeaa7fc-8193-4ead-bac7-f26633943521": {"__data__": {"id_": "5eeaa7fc-8193-4ead-bac7-f26633943521", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f27de8443f46b0e842ca768169143d8d181678ca466a890f304c30d7d62bf4b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "8c7a1e93-e97f-4e76-b0bc-6e07461c5bdf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad81a449f1467045d22e613f71665ea8935351e07ceaa616fd2b2ab06808cf4f"}}, "hash": "1891baabdccc587565c914ceece638343535fbbb7ac16843583677880b3624ae", "text": "In addition, poor housing and plots in high-risk areas led many people to migrate from the countryside to the city, seeking employment.

A few local initiatives that mitigated disaster risk while also reducing poverty were put in place. Participatory workshops identified ways to fight against the effects of climate change, reduce the impact of other hazards, and reduce poverty. The population showed their willingness to work in a participatory manner to improve their situation. Community leaders, officials and ordinary men and women came together to learn techniques of irrigation management, pest control, sustainable shifting cultivation and appropriate systems of water use. As expensive irrigation technology was beyond local resources, the people combined both sophisticated and common, locally available materials to develop appropriate systems. This improved productivity and reduced the people\u2019s vulnerability to disasters. At the same time, the people\u2019s organisational capacity was strengthened, also a key asset in their fight against poverty. A crucial factor in this process was the actual demonstration of different irrigation systems. Demonstration plots showed that appropriate irrigation techniques promoted good water management, helped disease management, preserved soil nutrients, and reduced risks of the soil erosion which used to put their precarious infrastructure at risk. The population became confident that these techniques would generate more income, guarantee crop quality and improve their welfare and safety. The Good Practice The project is a good practice because: \u2022 It tackles water shortage which is a recurrent problem in the area. This is a problem that is exacerbated by poor management and lack of knowledge. \u2022 The new irrigation techniques contribute to reducing both disaster risk and poverty by improving productivity and reducing the community\u2019s vulnerability to disasters. Key success factors in the project are: \u2022 The involvement of the community in activity planning. \u2022 Their recognition of their problems and identification of alternatives. \u2022 Recognition of existing capacities within the community. \u2022 Relations of trust between the community and Practical Action. \u2022 Technical support in implementing the project. \u2022 Strengthening the local leaders\u2019 capacity and legitimizing their leadership during the process. \u2022 A clear vision of a sustainable outcome for the project. 64 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Rural community members are like Saint Thomas Aquinas: for them, \u2018seeing is believing\u2019. Theory needs to be shown to work in practice, otherwise people will not get involved. \u2022 Disaster Risk Management (DRM), as a concept, may not easy for poor communities to fully grasp at first. However, the linkage between DRM, livelihood protection and economic improvement, can be easily understood and accepted. \u2022 Lack of economic resources and the need to keep bread on the family table, means the uptake and implementation of innovative can be slow, and sometimes unsuccessful. \u2022 It is necessary to understand the local realities. Community knowledge, acquired with experience and over time, must be respected. \u2022 Community members are the only ones who really know what their resources are. No outside professional, technical or specialist can fully understand the problems of the community and alone propose viable alternatives. \u2022 Professionals collect, systematize, guide and reinforce the learning of the community members. They do not generate it. \u2022 There was a lot of mistrust of foreign people within the targeted community. They seem to have been misled very often and became suspicious of suggested changes. The major challenges for this project were: \u2022 The community had no financial resource to contribute but was aware that it could contribute natural and organisational resources. Encouraging them to contribute was not an easy task - one had first to be accepted by them and win their trust. \u2022 After accepting and trusting Practical Action, the community placed great expectations on the organisation. It was and is important to manage expectations and trust to avoid frustrations on either side. \u2022 The community is eager to learn and participate as long as the project provides real and meaningful changes. Extra effort has been taken and is being taken to ensure that the project produces changes that are not only real and meaningful to outside observers, but above all felt to be real and meaningful by the communities themselves. To improve similar projects in the future, it is necessary to engage the beneficiaries from the very beginning. Engaging them genuinely means helping them recognize that they are important, that they have duties but also rights, that they are all first-class citizens with the right to live in dignity. 65 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction For more information, please contact: Mr. Pieter van den Ende Practical Action E-mail: Pieter.VanDenEnde@practicalaction.org.uk Potential for Replication The project is easy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4c1548c-8e8b-4bad-b687-8288168cae9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4c1548c-8e8b-4bad-b687-8288168cae9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "198a6f807b540a73467f90bbbd6c644aacd4ff772fb28e9fd2cf94988045a0ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b3de19b-e0ea-4afe-a59e-9cb380555a23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac50284bcf85233af927a98d899daef93574284f1579a5f995c458f2a483a0ba"}}, "hash": "b5239ee2f0b40426a491d26ab530a02cf0e9e085c3b617df975c241dc385b905", "text": "to replicate as long as the starting point is recognition of the local problem affecting the community, followed by a harnessing of community will to improve their living conditions. If the context is different but the problems are similar and the population is dependent on agriculture, then the methodology needs to be modified to suit the new context and perhaps invite greater participation from women and young people. For the sake of more sustainable replication, there is a need to empower the community, incorporate the project into local and regional development plans, and translate the plans into concrete projects that improve the living conditions of the poorest. 66 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Linking income, environmental care and disaster preparedness Abstract Banaba, in the outskirts of Manila, is a village of the urban poor that is plagued by flooding, improper waste disposal, poor sanitation and hygiene, unemployment, and high population growth. Poverty drives many residents and \u2018informal settlers\u2019 to live by an increasingly eroded riverbank and in flood-prone areas. In 2007, Buklod Tao (BT), a local environmental community organisation, embarked on an initiative that linked livelihoods, environmental care and disaster preparedness. BT is involved in disaster preparedness and mitigation in Banaba, as well as in the income-earning production of \u2018Go Bags\u2019 (disaster evacuation bags) and life vests for children at risk. Initiated mainly by mothers who are active members of BT, the initiative involves using recycled and reusable materials to make bags, sun visors, wallets, folders and similar items. BT\u2019s male The Philippines One of the Buklod Tao community members 22 This article has benefited from the inputs of Buklod Tao\u2019s Chairperson, Mr. Manuel Abilinales (noli_ab_2@yahoo.com). Strengthening community resilience: Linking livelihood and environmental management Center for Disaster Preparedness (CDP) (In partnership with Buklod Tao22, Inc.) 67 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction members, partner bodies, children and neighbours also contribute to the initiative in their own capacity. BT now accepts bulk orders from various organisations. The income earned from making the bags and life vests, helps the poor families involved pay for school fees and electricity bills, as well as to meet other basic needs such as food and clothing. A small part of the income goes to the initiative\u2019s operational funds. BT received no aid agency funding for this initiative. As a result, a gradual improvement in environmental care and community safety has been observed. The initiative reduces solid waste, and flood and health risks, while helping to build a culture of safety among adults, youth and children. It is a model of a locally developed, locally led, locally run and locally funded disaster risk and poverty reduction initiative. The Initiative This initiative is an income-generating effort linked to and supporting environmental care and disaster preparedness. It has been under way since 2007 in the flood-prone barangay (village) of Banaba, in the municipality of San Mateo, Rizal Province, northern Philippines. It is implemented by Buklod Tao (BT), a local environmental people\u2019s organisation involved in disaster preparedness and mitigation. After community risk assessment and action planning took place in 2006 with community children, BT members started to sew life vests and \u201cGo Bags\u201d (evacuation bags) for children at risk. A visit by BT women members to a women\u2019s cooperative which was producing bags, slippers and other products from used aluminium juice packs, opened a window of livelihood opportunities linked to environmental care and disaster preparedness. In 2007, BT took orders for bags, sun visors, wallets, folders and the like, using recycled and reusable materials. Now in 2008, it has an order for life vests from fisher folk in the municipality of Infanta in Quezon Province, a municipality which experienced flash flood and landslide disasters in 2004. The disaster preparedness activities have resulted in progressive improvement in community safety and development. There is not much external input provided: BT is able to sustain and add to its community disaster risk reduction activities and, along the way, receives some small amounts of external funding support. Furthermore, BT\u2019s most recent livelihood activities have reinforced its relationships with its partners, and furthered its overall public advocacy goals, through working for disaster preparedness and environmental care in the community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b3de19b-e0ea-4afe-a59e-9cb380555a23": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b3de19b-e0ea-4afe-a59e-9cb380555a23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "198a6f807b540a73467f90bbbd6c644aacd4ff772fb28e9fd2cf94988045a0ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4c1548c-8e8b-4bad-b687-8288168cae9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5239ee2f0b40426a491d26ab530a02cf0e9e085c3b617df975c241dc385b905"}}, "hash": "ac50284bcf85233af927a98d899daef93574284f1579a5f995c458f2a483a0ba", "text": "The goals of the livelihood-related activity linked to environmental care can be summarised as follows: \u2022 To foster awareness, among the community members, of the significance of ensuring a healthy and sound environment to achieve a safe and liveable habitat. \u2022 To enhance the community\u2019s inherent capacities to reduce their vulnerabilities \u2022 To seize opportunities that allow families to protect themselves and the environment from life-threatening conditions and, at the same time, contribute", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdc6f3e1-7a8c-40eb-811b-eb83334e8d16": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdc6f3e1-7a8c-40eb-811b-eb83334e8d16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08eac4be16bdd81621a5a4f5cb00d1577ec33c169c0788370dc730f650450de4"}}, "hash": "08eac4be16bdd81621a5a4f5cb00d1577ec33c169c0788370dc730f650450de4", "text": "to meeting family subsistence needs through income-generating activities. \u2022 To advance environment-friendly initiatives to protect the future of coming generations. The involvement of mothers in producing useful products such as bags and wallets out of used aluminium juice packs and plastic packs (vinegar, soy sauce) actually started in 2005. BT had used this approach as part of its environmental care campaign. Then in 2006, BT was able to improve its production skills to produce life vests, as the community 68 Good Practices and Lessons Learned partner in the implementation of the Child Oriented Participatory Risk Assessment and Planning (COPRAP) research project carried out by the Philippines-based Center for Disaster Preparedness (CDP). Currently, BT has a wide assortment of products from recycled and reusable materials that it can produce based on orders. From \u2018Go bags\u2019 to bags made out of canvas and recycled plastic wallets, it has now added body bags, envelopes, sun visors and backpacks. The BT women also use canvas from used flour bags. All these are displayed in the BT office and members\u2019 homes, easily catching the interest of local and foreign visitors. At present, BT takes bulk orders from different organisations. Even neighbours buy and send them to their relatives abroad. The initiative continues to grow with support from many stakeholders. Aside from the mothers earning additional income, a small part of the proceeds goes to BT operational funds, which helps to increase the organisation\u2019s self- reliance and sustainability. The endeavour was initiated by local people themselves, particularly mothers in the community who are also active members of BT.23 During the early months of the initiative, only a few were involved since production was very limited. As time went by, involvement increased. Now, some 15 women members work collectively to meet consumers\u2019 demand. Six are involved in sewing and the rest are involved in gathering and cleaning empty aluminium and plastic packs, design, marketing and quality control. Children in the community, aside from the sons and daughters of BT members, also contribute actively. They voluntarily collect empty juice packs from their schools and communities, and give it to the mothers. Male members of the organisation also play a vital role in product marketing and delivery, as well as in promotional activities. The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Banaba village has a sizeable population of \u2018informal settlers\u2019. The village is a typical poor urban community setting. Residents live by a riverbank which continues to be eroded. Problems in this community are flooding, narrow roads, clogged canals, improper waste disposal, poor sanitation and hygiene, unemployment, and high population growth. Poverty drives many residents to live by the riverbank and in flood-prone areas. BT continues to mobilize the community to join disaster preparedness activities, since the community is at the juncture of the Marikina and Nangka Rivers. Because of hazard monitoring, rescue boats and teams and an emergency operations centre, flooding has stopped killing people in the village. But riverbank erosion has caused many houses to slide and this now poses a serious threat to the entire community. Disaster risk reduction activities in the community now include work that links improved livelihoods to environmental management. BT members produce evacuation bags, envelopes, wallets, sun visors and other products made with used aluminium juice packs, plastic packs and used flour bags. In addition to the income earned by women, the community has also acquired skills such as designing, sewing and marketing, as a result of these activities. Notably, investments in linking livelihood and environmental management have a promising future \u2013 in terms of natural and built environment protection, as well as in terms of children\u2019s and youth\u2019s involvement in recyclable material collection. The project reduces solid waste in the community, reduces flood and health risks, and contributes to shaping the behaviour of both adults and the younger generation in disaster preparedness, good stewardship of resources, and environmental management. Income derived is still small at this stage, as the initiative started relatively recently, but there have been many positive impacts. There is also a potential for more production activities from recycled materials. Word is spreading and there is increasing recognition of the product. In December 2007, BT even had to refuse some orders because they were placed on short notice. 23 BT has 130 members, more than half of whom are women. 69 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Good Practice This endeavour is a good practice because it links livelihood with environmental and disaster management.

It has made residents strongly aware of the need to practice disaster preparedness and environmental management as part of their daily lives, reducing flood and health risks. BT has been a consistent example in building on local capacities and progressively improving disaster preparedness and community development. It effects change not only through words but also through positive actions by individuals and groups belonging to the academic, religious, youth, senior citizen, business and media sectors. The concept of linking livelihoods to environmental management responds to pressing economic needs of the urban poor. In addition to reducing solid waste materials in the community, the products developed out of recycled materials have provided the urban poor an alternative source of income to support the needs of their families. Additional livelihood skills and options have been provided. Although small at the moment, additional funds generated are contributed to BT\u2019s operational funds. Involving youth and children from the primary and secondary education levels also helps sensitize them to the importance of environmental protection, and of working for community safety and development. The disaster preparedness, livelihood and environmental management activities have fostered closer relationships among members of BT and other stakeholders involved. BT has sustained networking with diverse groups and institutions. The established reputation and the visible accomplishments of BT in Banaba village for over 10 years, was a triggering factor that helped win the trust of their fellow community residents and also the cooperation of different organisations that worked in their area. Multi-stakeholder participation and partnerships have also helped greatly in continuously promoting the work. The youth, women\u2019s, elderly, and business sectors became fundamental channels for mobilizing social, human and material support. There are, however, some constraint factors. Limited support from the government is an issue. BT is trying to influence local government participation while continuing with its disaster risk preparedness, livelihood and environmental care activities. Another constraint is that the mothers are not working on a full-time basis in the livelihood activity. This means that when there are orders on short notice, BT has no other option to refuse them. If more sewing machines were available, more women could be involved in learning how to sew, produce useful recycled products, and improve quality. 70 Good Practices and Lessons Learned Lesson(s) Learned Four key lessons can be learned from this initiative: \u2022 Starting where the people are and building from what they have is a core principle that should be applied in any development work, including the field of disaster risk management. \u2022 Ownership of an endeavour can easily be achieved if community members themselves are the lead actors and are empowered to value and practice self-reliance. \u2022 Innovative thinking works. Coupled with the values of resourcefulness and creativity, the community was able to produce something profitable from scrap materials perceived by others to be useless. \u2022 Gathering the support of groups coming from different disciplines and lines of work provides a more sustainable opportunity to prosper in the development agenda. The community has also faced the following challenges when undertaking the initiative: \u2022 There has been lack of adequate equipment and facilities, particularly additional sewing machines and a production area, which could have helped ensure faster and larger-scale production. BT does not have its own machine for making bags, slippers and wallets. Only two of the women members have their own sewing machines, while others rely on sewing machines borrowed from their neighbours. \u2022 The schedule of the mothers is also an issue. Most of the mothers are not involved full time in the initiative because they also have other duties to attend to, particularly responsibilities at home, such as household chores and childcare. \u2022 Skills enhancement training is seen to be imperative for the people involved in the production. Advanced techniques in sewing and designing will improve their work and allow them to attract more buyers. Since there are only six participants who are experts in sewing, training would help to increase the number of knowledgeable individuals. \u2022 BT\u2019s disaster preparedness, livelihood and environmental management initiatives will be more effective with closer rapport and coordination with the local government. This will provide an avenue for the people and local leaders to complement their efforts towards the advancement of the community.

The presence of a people\u2019s organisation with good reputation would help mobilize support and win the trust of the community and other stakeholders. This said, lack of collaboration between local people and village leaders could be a constraint to scaling-up. Political leaders have to appreciate these community initiatives and take them on for scaling-up to be possible. Local leaders should not look at such initiatives as a threat or competition. 71 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Saving lives and livelihoods through the power of knowledge Abstract Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast25 (GBAO) is an isolated mountain area in eastern Tajikistan, the poorest of all the former Soviet Republics. It often takes days or weeks for disaster assistance and relief to reach local communities in the area. In the event of a mudslide, affected families lose their income, as the breadwinner has to stop working in order to repair the family home. Households are then unable to replace their losses. Lack of support for full disaster recovery forces many of them into a cycle of poverty. To help address the issue, Focus Humanitarian Assistance USA and the Aga Khan Foundation UK developed a Risk Management Strategic Approach in 2003. This is an objective knowledge-based approach that prioritizes those most at risk and seeks to understand the nature and extent of their risks. Tajikistan Construction of a channel to reduce the risk of underground flooding 24 Focus Humanitarian Assistance (FOCUS) is an international emergency response agency providing humanitarian relief and assistance and disaster risk management for vulnerable communities located primarily in the developing world. Affiliated with the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), it has offices in Europe, North America and South and Central Asia. 25 An Oblast is an administrative division in some countries of the former Soviet Union. The word oblast can be translated as \u201cregion\u201d or \u201cdistrict\u201d. Fostering disaster-resilient communities in isolated mountain environments: A risk management strategic approach Focus Humanitarian Assistance24 (FOCUS) \u2013 USA (In partnership with the Aga Khan Foundation - United Kingdom) 72 Good Practices and Lessons Learned A detailed community-based hazard, vulnerability and capacity risk assessment was carried out with local communities. The knowledge gained helped some 135,000 community members to acquire better understanding of their risks. It also led to an increased capacity to respond to hazards and a greater ability to recover from disasters. When one of the FOCUS partner villages was devastated by a series of mudflows on 29 June 2007, the communities were able to relocate quickly to pre-identified safe havens, taking basic items and their livestock with them. They were also able to rebuild their homes and livelihoods within weeks. The Initiative This initiative, called Fostering Disaster-Resilient Communities in Isolated Mountain Environments, has two major objectives: \u2022 To scientifically and measurably identify risks faced by communities in mountain areas of Tajikistan. \u2022 To build the capacity of communities, the government and academics to assess disaster risk, prepare against disasters and respond to natural hazards. Initiated in 2003, the initiative is still under way, targeting 270 communities in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) in the Pamir mountain range in eastern Tajikistan, and involving the following actors: village communities in GBAO, the Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defence (CoES) of the Republic of Tajikistan, the governments of GBAO and its districts, the head of the Tajik Department of Geology, the University of Central Asia, and over 10 other scientific agencies in Tajikistan. The initiative is implemented by Focus Humanitarian Assistance USA (FOCUS USA) and the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) United Kingdom, with funding from FOCUS USA and the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO). The target beneficiaries are over 135,000 community members in GBAO, and 100 specialists and technical staff in disaster response agencies and academia. To date, the initiative has achieved the following: \u2022 Over 135,000 direct beneficiaries have developed a better understanding of the risks they face, have an increased capacity to respond to hazards, and have shown a greater ability to recover from disasters. \u2022 A sustainable public-private-community partnership was established, supporting effective early warning of and response to disasters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90d439e9-6b9b-40ff-be9d-d96b1993d79e": {"__data__": {"id_": "90d439e9-6b9b-40ff-be9d-d96b1993d79e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction: Good Practices and Lessons Learned", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9adb8ff50072e3c15481da2b657543ac1302b9a5f602eb7408953a05c183588f"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7f86a4e-08dd-46de-8426-22717513c1ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/linking-disaster-risk-reduction-and-poverty-reduction-good-practices-and-lessons-learned", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "485df36317faf92cb09bbc6251b4069aea4209f37305a8606deae0d7d53b1c8e"}}, "hash": "dac41e9db49c8c217ddd93e809e60b47cec7092753f340dab29f664f1905731f", "text": "\u2022 Academic experts have greatly enhanced their capacity for replicating these methodologies in other areas. 73 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction The Initiative\u2019s Contribution to Poverty Reduction Banaba village has a sizeable population of \u2018informal Tajikistan is the poorest of all the former Soviet Republics.

As a result, when a mudslide damages a home, affected families tend to lose their income, as the breadwinner has to stop working in order to make repairs. If an adult is injured, children often have to stay at home and care for the family rather than going to school. Households that lose their belongings are not able to replace them. Due to lack of full disaster recovery support, natural hazards force many communities into a cycle of poverty. Given the high number of communities at risk, it was necessary to apply an objective knowledge-based approach to prioritize those most at risk and understand the nature of those risks. In 2003, FOCUS adopted a Risk Management Strategic Approach involving teams composed of local earth scientists, engineers, social mobilizers and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) experts. The teams conducted a detailed community- based hazard, vulnerability and capacity risk assessment (HVCRA) in collaboration with village members. The knowledge gained from the HVCRA produced two essential sets of information for decision making: (1) calculated community risk levels; and (2) community hazard and risk maps. With these two essentials, FOCUS prioritized risks and implemented community- based interventions that measurably reduced risk. These included: \u2022 Identifying appropriate safe haven locations. \u2022 Implementing community-based disaster preparedness programmes. \u2022 Installing wireless communication devices. \u2022 Implementing small-scale structural mitigation measures, which also serve as income generation opportunities for communities. \u2022 Building the capacity of the government and academic staff responsible for hazard assessment and disaster response. The communities now have baseline strength in communal knowledge of disasters, and institutions and systems are in place to better support the communities before, during and after a disaster. A recent example of the entire process is best identified through the events of 29 June 2007 in the GBAO village of Chokhandez. In the middle of the morning, the village was devastated by a series of mudflows. The village was a FOCUS partnership village and had already developed awareness and received training through the FOCUS Risk Management Strategic Approach. Rain had fallen the night before and throughout the morning, and the villagers knew a mudflow was very likely to occur. They learned this based on the results of the assessment they had conducted with FOCUS. The villagers quickly mobilized themselves, took with them basic items from their homes, and relocated to their safe havens. The safe havens had been identified through village training sessions. When the first small mudflow occurred, the mudflow channel built by the community with FOCUS support was able to divert the mudflow through the channel and to the nearby river, causing minimal damage and allowing the villagers to evacuate their belongings and livestock safely. As rain continued, a much larger mudflow occurred, which damaged several homes and blocked the main road. However, by this time, community members had already evacuated with basic items and their livestock. The village also had a radio installed by FOCUS in a safe location identified by the hazard assessment. The community members contacted FOCUS and the CoES, notifying them of the mudslides. A FOCUS disaster response team arrived within hours and was already assisting the community by providing tents and blankets for short-term shelter needs. Government crews were able to re-open the road, and safer reconstruction efforts began within a day with the support of the entire community, FOCUS and the Government of GBAO. Within weeks, the affected households of Chokhandez Village were able to rebuild their homes and economic activities, and normal life resumed. This example demonstrates how a knowledge-based approach to risk reduction helps save lives and livelihoods, and prevents a community from falling further into poverty. The approach allows communities to recover faster when a disaster occurs. 74 Good Practices and Lessons Learned The Good Practice To effectively and measurably reduce risk, and build coping capacity, it is necessary to identify risk levels clearly. FOCUS\u2019 approach to fostering disaster-resilient communities is through a comprehensive Risk Management Strategic Approach, an approach that can be described as good practice. The approach applies a community and knowledge-based HVCRA methodology that enables communities, scientists and disaster managers to clearly understand what risks communities are facing, the levels of those risks, and how to mitigate those levels to an acceptable level. The approach has helped achieve two integral successes: \u2022 Hundreds of communities are now better prepared and are able to respond to disaster situations. \u2022 The CoES and FOCUS can now partner well in emergency response.

Other key success factors include: \u2022 The availability of local scientific specialists capable of learning hazard assessment techniques. \u2022 Strong cooperation between communities and government partners in risk identification and risk reduction processes. \u2022 Commitment from donors to design, develop and test a knowledge-based approach. 75 Linking Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty Reduction Lesson(s) Learned Key lessons learned from the project are: \u2022 Communities can mobilize and support themselves and be a first strong line of defense against hazards. \u2022 Knowledge, when properly applied, is critical in providing direction for successful risk reduction interventions. \u2022 Disasters and poverty are clearly linked, and complicate the obstacles communities face. These obstacles require comprehensive solutions. FOCUS\u2019 Risk Management Strategic Approach is a comprehensive approach that helps reduce disaster risk successfully. The major challenge for this project was: \u2022 How to secure the strong commitment of all stakeholders involved (communities, governments, donors, the private sector and NGOs). To overcome this challenge, FOCUS did its level best to develop a truly enabling environment for all actors. Indeed, measurable and sustainable results would not have been possible without a strong commitment from all the different players involved. For more information, please contact: Mr. Malik Ajani Focus Humanitarian Assistance E-Mail: majani@focushumanitarian.org Potential for Replication This approach has been developed and repeatedly tested in Tajikistan with the hope that it is replicated in other disaster-prone areas of the world. In fact, FOCUS is already applying it to communities in neighbouring Afghanistan. To support the efforts being made in Afghanistan, FOCUS teams in Tajikistan are working in collaboration with FOCUS Afghanistan to effectively transfer the knowledge and experience gained in Tajikistan. Furthermore, FOCUS is also developing a guide detailing the steps and resources needed to implement this approach, so that institutions working in other mountainous regions of the world can learn and adapt the methodology to support disaster risk reduction in their areas.

To provide national and local policy-makers, as well as development partners, with an introduction to ways in which local government systems and institutions can and do interface with climate change (CC) issues. 2. To outline ways forward that may improve the capacity and ability of local gove- ments (LGs) to address CC and leverage their comparative advantage in doing so. 3. To suggest ways for specialist CC institutions and agencies to incorporate LG issues into their work and adjust their framework, strategy, and approach to strengthen CC work at the sub-national level. The Note focuses primarily on LGs in developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The Note tries to identify and articulate in practical terms what has (or has not) been done by LGs in addressing CC, and what can be done to improve outcomes from this interface. The overall conclusion is that while there is much talk about the role of LGs in addressing CC, there is little hard evidence that CC figures prominently on the routine agenda of most LGs in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. There are specific projects and programmes, funded by donors and governments, which try to address CC at the local level, and which sometimes (but not always) work through LGs. If it is assumed that LGs do indeed have a potentially important role to play in addressing CC, then a good deal more needs to be done to realise this potential. The Note tries to understand why LGs appear to be relatively inactive on CC, and provides some entry points and approaches that might contribute towards greater local government involvement. There is a burgeoning literature on CC that examines its interface with local government and local governance1. Much of it focuses on local assessments of the outcomes and risks associated with CC, but pays little attention to what can or might be done by LGs to address such issues, including potential benefits. This Note tries to redress this imbalance by taking a closer look at the instruments available to LGs and how they can be used in dealing with CC2.

The consequences of climate change are numerous \u2013 changes in precipitation (rainfall, snow, etc.), more frequent and severe flooding, rises in temperature and their effects, rising sea levels (and, as a consequence, salinisation), and more intense and prolonged droughts. These outcomes directly affect people (in particular, the poorest), making livelihoods and living conditions more vulnerable. CC issues have traditionally been broken into two basic categories \u2013 those related to mitigation and those related to adaptation. Mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or stabilise GHG emissions; adaptation is about coping and dealing with the consequences of CC. However, there is increasing recognition that there is a continuum between these two areas of work, and that more integrated approaches are needed. The financing opportunities created by carbon markets, if instituted properly at national and sub- national levels, could reduce local vulnerabilities. It is also important to understand that there is a great deal that is not known about CC and its (local) consequences \u2013 for example, how much sea levels will rise, how much rainfall patterns will be affected, and how such changes will affect livelihoods and the natural systems that sustain these livelihoods. Climate projections and scenarios are based on hypotheses (\u201cemissions scenarios\u201d), and are therefore uncertain. Therefore, addressing climate change requires an ability to take into account a range of possible futures. In the water sector, for example, this could mean encouraging service providers to engage in portfolio planning \u2013 which would contain a number of parallel measures that can be ramped up or down according to future cost effectiveness. Such a portfolio might include a mix of building more storage, rainwater harvesting, desalination, use of recycled water, and more effectively matching water use to quality. Each of these approaches could also include measures to increase the efficiency of related energy use (ICLEI 2009a). 6 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 7 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 2.2 Defining \u201clocal governance\u201d and \u201clocal governments\u201d \u201cLocal governance\u201d refers to the ways in which local level decision-making is carried out. The normative term \u201cgood local governance\u201d implies that decision-making in the arena of local public affairs is, to varying degrees, subject to the scrutiny and oversight of citizens, open and transparent, rule-bound, and participatory. Local governments, in that sense, are one dimension (albeit an important one) of local governance as a whole. \u201cLocal governments\u201d are formal institutions, mandated to deliver a variety of public goods3 and services at the local level. They constitute, in a sense, the local state. As local level service delivery units, LGs are largely predicated on the principle of subsidiarity, which stipulates that government functions should be assigned to the lowest level of government that is capable of efficiently undertaking this function. In essence, if a small LG can efficiently provide pre-school services, then (according to the subsidiarity principle) it should be assigned that responsibility. This principle generally results in a situation where, as far as possible, the area where the benefits of a public good or service are felt coincides with the jurisdictional boundaries at each level of government. For instance, since national defence benefits people in the national territory of a country, this expenditure function should be a national affair funded by the central government. However, since the benefits from a local park are mostly felt by local residents, the responsibility for local parks should be placed with LGs. Making judgements about what LGs should do is largely linked to considerations about economies of scale and externalities. LGs vary considerably across a range of dimensions, including: \u25aa Population size; \u25aa Number of tiers in the local government system; \u25aa Urban vs. rural; \u25aa Mandates and functions; \u25aa Human and financial resources; \u25aa Linkages with customary institutions; \u25aa The degree to which they are downwardly accountable and representative; and \u25aa Their financial arrangements. When discussing the role of LGs, it is crucial to take into account the characteristics of the LG in question, as they largely determine the kinds of CC issues it faces and the ways that it does or can respond.

Much of the work on urban CC issues does not distinguish between large metropolitan cities, smaller towns and agglomerations. In order to differentiate, this Note looks at three broad \u201ctypes\u201d of local government \u2013 rural, urban and \u201cprovincial\u201d \u2013 in terms of their actual and potential interface with CC. These are clearly abstractions which necessarily simplify matters, but this classification brings into relief some key differences which have considerable implications for CC issues. The threefold classification is further broken down into sub-categories, based on the approximate population size of the type of local government in question. The following table provides a summary of the salient features of these LG types, along with some examples from the Asia-Pacific region.

It should be stressed that this Note is largely concerned with developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. 6 It should be noted that the LG system in the Maldives is currently undergoing major reforms. 8 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 9 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE There is a world of difference between small, rural LGs (such as Bhutan\u2019s Gewogs) and large metropolitan municipalities (such as Bangladesh\u2019s City Corporations), both in terms of CC issues they face and their ability to deal with them. \u201cProvincial\u201d governments are also particular: often the size of small countries, \u201cprovinces\u201d may include populations of several millions and cover large geographical areas, and are often vested with significant policy making and regulatory powers. 3 National contexts: some constraints Before examining ways in which LGs might address CC, it is useful to look at national- level frameworks and institutional arrangements. As will be seen, these are often far from enabling when seen from the perspective of LGs. 3.1. National frameworks for climate change adaptation In least developed countries (LDCs), National Adaptation Programmes of Action to Climate Change (NAPAs) provide a starting point for identifying national priorities for adaptation to CC. However, they rarely identify the need to work closely with local institutions in implementing priority actions on CC. In addition, all countries signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) produce periodic \u201cNational Communications\u201d on CC which increasingly draw together both mitigation and adaptation issues, but again are not specific in terms of the role of local authorities. More recently, some countries (particularly middle income countries) have moved towards the development of comprehensive national CC strategies with high levels of visibility and political engagement. Examples include Viet Nam\u2019s National Target Programme on Climate Change, India\u2019s National Action Plan on Climate Change and Indonesia\u2019s \u201cYellow Book\u201d. In all cases, the roll out of national initiatives is dependent on significant sub-national engagement and the development of equivalent strategies at province or district level. Much is planned but little has been done as yet, and donors are increasingly being asked to provide their guidance and support. 3.2. Institutional arrangements at the national level In addition to national frameworks and plans, the central government\u2019s arrangements for dealing with CC is another contextual constraint.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5003cb0d-8266-44ac-8702-5fafc3158eae": {"__data__": {"id_": "5003cb0d-8266-44ac-8702-5fafc3158eae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance and Climate Change: A Discussion Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65591f51a58d387d439ea080687c2a0deb94928b38c6613f650e180465212a1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "f41b75a9-57f7-423d-aca5-b6d007cdbe7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edaebc57a090c157734386e484eceab9547d8efae0340ebcb1a2750fa939a265"}}, "hash": "f27eddd8d9d32cfb3895579bcb437cfbd6a7a0ea8b139662a70ff403d4f99384", "text": "In most countries in the Asia-Pacific, the institutions and coordinating structures responsible for CC are fledgling, although the landscape is evolving rapidly.

However, at least five ministries have responsibilities in 7 See UNDP (2009). 10 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 11 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE these sectors \u2013 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology; the Ministry of Environment (which was the principal \u201cauthor\u201d of Cambodia\u2019s NAPA); the Ministry of Rural Development; and the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy. Coordination across these ministries at the national level is complex \u2013 and probably even more so at the sub-national level, where deconcentrated and decentralised units also operate. The same is true of many other countries in the region (e.g. Nepal, Viet Nam and Bangladesh). For LGs that might be tempted to work on CC, these institutional arrangements create formidable transaction costs \u2013 especially when line ministries are weakly accountable to sub-national levels (if at all). Moreover, central ministries responsible for LG often see themselves as \u201coutliers\u201d to debates on CC. In Nepal, for example, the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) does not appear to engage with other line ministries that would normally be expected to be involved in CC. Nor does MLD take a lead in encouraging local bodies to engage at the sub-national level, or in actively facilitating coordination between local bodies and local line departments. Local options and climate change 4 4.1. Why local government? For many LG practitioners in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region, CC is a new and sometimes perplexing issue. The novelty and confusion are understandable, given that much of the popular and policy debate has been pitched at \u201cglobal\u201d levels, rather than in sub-national terms. This, however, is gradually changing as more is understood about what CC means at the local level and how LGs can respond to CC challenges8. Furthermore, real-life examples of the interface between LGs and CC are not common. This is partly because CC (as an issue to be explicitly addressed) is new, but (as will become clear) also because much of the interface is actually a part and parcel of the existing portfolio of local government activities, and therefore often not seen through any specific CC prism. It can not, however, be overlooked that CC is already a part of conservation and broader environmental management processes that LGs are involved with. LGs in the Asia- Pacific region are familiar with the concept of ecosystem services and their importance to livelihoods. It is important to recognize that by continuing to conserve and maintain forests, wetlands and other ecosystems, LGs are not only contributing to global carbon sinks, but also building resilience. These local level natural resource and environmental management issues are discussed in greater detail in a companion publication to this Guidance Note9. Although there may be major national policy obstacles to LGs interfacing with CC, LGs are likely to have some comparative advantages (as well as disadvantages) in doing so. On the \u201cplus\u201d side, it is clear that CC is often a highly localised affair. Areas of close geographical proximity may face very different adaptation challenges, and thus require very different approaches. The necessary responses, then, are often very time- and location-specific. Further, the problems associated with CC are different for women and men, rich and poor, old and young, and differ among the professions and livelihoods. These local variations make CC (in particular, adaptation), a priori, highly suitable to LG action since they require local knowledge to target adaptation or mitigation interventions. In dealing with severe climate-related events (such as floods), LGs may also be assumed to have some comparative advantages, largely based on their greater access to local knowledge and the ability to mobilize local people and resources.

What aspects of climate change are local governments apt to interface with? LGs can engage in both CC mitigation (prevention) and adaptation (vulnerability reduction and opportunity enhancement) actions: \u25aa Adaptation involves helping their constituents to cope with and adjust to any changes in their climate regime or natural resource base. This might involve targeted poverty reduction, asset building, early warning planning and disaster response planning. \u25aa Mitigation involves helping their constituents to reduce their GHG emissions. This might involve forest management or energy conservation interventions. LGs have an aptitude for such interventions due to the specific local knowledge required and the needs for local cooperation in the design and implementation. Adaptation is likely to be their bigger concern, as it is directly related to ensuring the immediate wellbeing of their constituents. Without great ancillary benefits or outside funding, LGs are unlikely to invest in mitigation, since the returns accrue at too large and diffused a scale. Obviously, in situations where adaptation and mitigation are net- positive investments, LGs are much more likely to engage. 4.3. How can local governments interface with climate change? Local governments (like central governments) interface with CC via three main instruments: \u25aa Local planning and regulation, largely in the form of by-laws and land use (or strategic) planning and zoning. Regulation can be used to enable or constrain certain types of activity, with direct, indirect, deliberate or unintended impact on CC issues; \u25aa Delivering goods and services that impact on adaptation to CC or the need to be climate resilient. This refers to the choice of investment, public expenditure management (PEM) and financing, and the process by which expenditures are made and tracked (planning, budgeting, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation); \u25aa Local fiscal revenues, raised in the form of taxes, fees and charges. LG revenues are clearly linked to local PEM (as one set of financial inputs) \u2013 but, more importantly, are also instruments which can provide incentives or disincentives for the ways in which CC issues are managed (or mismanaged); These three instruments can have negative or positive consequences for CC adaptation. Actions can be adaptive or mal-adaptive (for example, when assets are spent to cope with current stresses, leaving people and local governments with insufficient assets to adjust to future climate events). Reaching positive outcomes requires a strong understanding of how present investments shape future options, and an understanding of how and why LGs invest (or don\u2019t invest) in short- and long-term climate remediation. Further discussion of these three instruments is provided below. 4.4. Local planning and regulatory frameworks CC can be addressed through local planning and regulatory frameworks. There are several ways in which LGs can use their planning and regulatory powers, inter alia: \u25aa Land-use planning and zoning that avoids high-risk areas (such as low-lying, flood- prone, areas or steep slopes) in activities such as housing or service facilities; \u25aa Strategic \u201cscenario\u201d planning that examines various hypotheses about CC consequences and then develops contingent, appropriate and variable responses; and \u25aa Revising building and infrastructure standards to make them energy efficient and climate-proof10; Whilst such regulatory options are appealing in conceptualising responses to CC, there are many challenges associated with them: \u25aa Firstly, and a recurring theme, LGs can only plan for CC when they have a reasonably good idea of local risks and opportunities. Without this understanding, LGs are poorly placed to carry out, for example, any climate-sensitive land use zoning. Few LGs (particularly rural ones) have access to this kind of information. \u25aa Secondly, regulatory controls over housing need to carefully balance risk management strategies against equity issues. In many South Asian cities, for example, the majority of the poor live on very climate-vulnerable plots of land. Any residential zoning would require that alternative housing sites could be found for the poor. Given the physically constrained nature of many urban environments, this would be far from simple. \u25aa Thirdly, spatial and strategic planning for small LG jurisdictions (such as VDCs in Nepal or UPs in Bangladesh) fails to capture significant externalities. To make it more meaningful would require these LGs to combine their efforts, although this would increase transaction costs. \u25aa Fourthly, regulatory powers required for land use planning and the like are often not vested in LGs, or are blurred with regulatory powers enjoyed by the centre.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "876dfe90-82b5-4f77-9624-6b794ee19e3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "876dfe90-82b5-4f77-9624-6b794ee19e3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance and Climate Change: A Discussion Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf3c955486a9ee8668e395cb494a83b1d9778cbe07cf7985d759e87c7188c3c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b327b2f-4c4d-4f9c-9c37-0785dd5acbd6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f83d1d4d9199591e3673cd721ee2250c8470b2ffaa5c45f1207d0c33a8e5467"}}, "hash": "80a965eb71dde61e15d40f7773252dc951bda6b17d8be891111d1123257874e8", "text": "VDCs and DDCs in Nepal, for example, do not appear to have such powers, which are instead largely monopolised by central government agencies. \u25aa Fifthly, even when LGs do enjoy such regulatory powers, land use plans, standards and guidelines and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "147d695e-9dc6-478b-9a94-68f303fc9418": {"__data__": {"id_": "147d695e-9dc6-478b-9a94-68f303fc9418", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance and Climate Change: A Discussion Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ced573997e00cb7cefcf730a59d3f520b9f8e9b0803832b27429ad3246510537"}}, "hash": "ced573997e00cb7cefcf730a59d3f520b9f8e9b0803832b27429ad3246510537", "text": "other such approaches require adequate enforcement to be effective. It is by no means clear that many LGs in the region have the ability to enforce such regulations11. 10 For example, Australia implements LG regulation of housing design, in order to make housing less exposed to the risk of increasingly frequent forest fires. 11 In Nepal, for example, sub-metropolitan and metropolitan municipalities (such as Kathmandu) are unable to enforce national building standards aimed at reducing risks associated with earthquakes. 14 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 15 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 4.5. Local delivery of goods and services There are a number of ways in which LG delivery of goods and services can address CC risks and opportunities. These depend on the breadth and scope of LG service delivery mandates, and LG\u2019s understanding of where these risks and opportunities lie. Environmental management Most LGs have some responsibilities for natural resources, such as forest management and fisheries regulation. There are a number of ways in which natural resource management contributes to both CC mitigation and adaptation objectives. For example: \u25aa Forest conservation can reduce carbon emissions; \u25aa Healthy ecosystems can provide services for livelihoods and industries, helping households and businesses build assets that can buffer them against climate stressors (trends or shocks); \u25aa Maintaining healthy forests, pastures and fisheries can provide fallback options during periods of drought or shortfalls in food production. Infrastructure and service delivery Most LGs have certain infrastructure and service delivery (ISD) functions. These include construction of roads and bridges, and provision of water, sanitation, educational and health facilities and services. Adapting these functions to CC can involve a range of options, inter alia: \u25aa Retrofitting existing infrastructure to better handle flooding, increased likelihood of subsidence, etc.; \u25aa Replacing old (un-proofed) infrastructure if the cost of retrofitting is prohibitively high; \u25aa Designing and constructing additional infrastructure and assets (such as roads) that are climate-proof and built with an eye to future adaptation (if needed)12; and \u25aa Improving water and sanitation services in order to reduce water consumption, mitigate against the spread of vector-borne diseases, etc; From information above, it can be seen that that there is generally a high degree of convergence between CC adaptation and provision of basic municipal or LG services. Adaptation, in most LGs in most developing countries, effectively amounts to a nuanced and well-informed expansion of local infrastructure and service delivery, and improved operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. One of the more grounded analyses of the interface between LGs and climate change adaptation puts it this way: \u201cPerhaps the two key messages that will get the attention of [local] governments are: 12 It should be remembered that a good deal is still not known about what CC will entail or the severity of its impacts. 1. The very large overlap between most of the measures needed for adaptation and local development (especially improving and extending provision for piped water, good sanitation and drainage, solid waste collection, garbage disposal, prevention- focused health care and support for upgrading within informal settlements); 2. The very large overlaps between climate-change adaptation and building resil- ience to extreme weather/disasters (regardless of whether the extreme weather or other catalysts for disasters are related to climate change). The key to adaptation in most instances is competent, capable, accountable urban governments that understand how to incorporate adaptation measures into most aspects of their work and departments.\u201d13 In a nutshell, If LGs are to adapt to CC and benefit from its opportunities, a good deal of the required actions will consist of doing what they are already mandated to do (but often do not), with perhaps greater urgency and with a little more forethought. In terms of local PEM, LG CC action is often about better addressing core expenditure areas and assignments \u2013 in other words, business-as-usual \u201c++\u201d \u2013 rather than some radically new way of conducting business. However, this should not detract from the need for LGs to factor CC issues into their planning and budgeting processes. The point is that CC is not a new functional responsibility or expenditure assignment for LGs (like primary health or rural roads), but a new variable that needs to be taken into account in local public expenditure management (albeit sometimes requiring significant increases in investment). In practice, this means that better performing LGs are already adapting to CC by simply providing effective basic services such as drainage, solid waste disposal, water and sanitation, undertaking land use planning, and factoring disaster risk management into their operations \u2013 all of which enhance CC resilience and contribute to local development.

This includes the development of a green business sector, reduction in pollution and the potential to attract carbon financing. For example, some smaller cities \u2013 such as Shimla, India \u2013 are aiming for zero emission and are planning to explore the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) market. Disaster management CC will result in more frequent extreme weather events (such floods), which entail significant human suffering. One of the key adaptive responsibilities for many LGs in developing countries is developing and implementing plans for disaster management14. This, however, is something that current LG PEM and public financial management (PFM) processes may not be very good at, for a variety of reasons: \u25aa Planning and budgeting for the unpredictable is always challenging; \u25aa Financial resources and cash flow are an inevitable constraint; and \u25aa Reactive capacities are often very limited. 13 Emphases added; see Satterthwaite, D. (2007). 14 This also applies to some local governments in developed countries, as illustrated by the poor performance of the City of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 16 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 17 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE However, as a direct consequence of CC, many LGs of the Asia-Pacific region will need to focus more and more on disaster risk management. In Bangladesh, perhaps more than in any other developing country in the region, the role of LGs in CC-related disaster management has been clearly recognised (see textbox below). Disaster management in Bangladesh: the role of local government Bangladesh\u2019s draft National Plan for Disaster Management 2008\u20132015 recognises that \u2018climate change adds a new dimension to community risk and vulnerability. Although the magnitude of these changes may appear to be small, they could substantially increase the frequency and intensity of existing climatic events (floods, droughts, cyclones etc). Current indications are that not only will floods and cyclones become more severe, they will also start to occur outside of their \u201cestablished seasons\u201d. Events, such as drought, may not have previously occurred in some areas and may now be experienced\u2019 (Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh 2008, p.12). The Plan calls for the establishment of Disaster Management Committees at all sub-national levels (Districts, Upazilas, UPs, Pourashavas and City Corporations), charged with developing Disaster Management Plans (DMPs) for their respective jurisdictions. DMPs are expected to include provisions for: (i) reducing and mitigating disasters; (ii) disaster response; (iii) post-disaster recovery; and (iv) costings for each. The nested hierarchy of DMPs is intended to use local knowledge to build a bottom-up approach to disaster mitigation and response and to ensure higher levels of overall coordination at the local levels. Source: Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (2008). Facilitating livelihoods adaptation In addressing longer-term consequences of CC (lower rainfall, sea level rises, higher temperatures), LGs can facilitate livelihoods adaptation, especially in rural areas. A wide range of adaptive responses has been documented \u2013 water-harvesting, increased human mobility, crop diversification, seed selection for drought-resistant cereals, soil and water conservation, flood management structures, etc. Many, if not most, of these adaptations have taken place spontaneously and at the household level. Provided below are three examples of how LGs can facilitate this process and spread the benefits more widely: \u25aa Brokering information flows on different household-level coping measures. This enables households to exchange experience and learn about successful adaptation strategies and techniques. There is some anecdotal evidence that UPs in Bangladesh are already doing this by helping innovators \u201cshowcase\u201d adaptations and bringing them into contact with others15. To expand this role will require that LGs allocate more resources to \u201csoft\u201d investments (communications expenditure, financing peer learning and exchange events). \u25aa Implementing a planned adaptation response. This is a more \u201cproactive\u201d approach, requiring a higher level of human and financial resources. It can include providing households with information on key risks and adaptation measures available, providing state grants, equipment and insurance services. \u25aa Conflict resolution.

Many LGs in the region face highly constrained budgets, already stretched in trying to meet existing priorities. LGs should explore the possibility of attracting additional finances, for example through reduction of GHG emissions. \u25aa Thirdly, LGs often do not have the political incentives to address CC issues through their PEM processes. In Bangladesh, for example, UPs (the councils for which are made up of ward-based representatives) have the political incentive to disaggregate their funding of investments to the lowest representation level (i.e. the ward) and thus \u201cmiss out\u201d on bigger or more strategic items. \u25aa Fourthly, effective LG response to weather-induced disasters requires a greater degree of financial certainty. Only the most fiscally affluent LGs are able to self- finance an adequate response to disasters (through contingency funds); the rest depend on national \u201chand-outs\u201d. Such hand-outs are likely to be rare (for reasons of fiscal scarcity and concerns about fiduciary risk and transparency) and delayed17. \u25aa Fifthly, few LGs have the appropriate mix of powers (including executive, legislative and judicial) and material resources (such as funds and equipment) needed to respond to local needs. Furthermore, they are rarely accountable to the local populations in a manner that would give them the incentives to respond even if they did have these powers and resources. Ironically, they often have powers without downward accountability or downward accountability without powers. Unless these are combined, LGs cannot be representative and are unlikely to be responsive to needs of their constituents. 15 Personal communication, Mark Ellery and Santanu Lahiri, Water and Sanitation Programme (World Bank), Dhaka, November 2009. 16 Personal communication, Neil Webster, UNDP Nepal, October 2010. 17 Indonesia, India, Philippines and Thailand, for example, have established systems for Disaster Risk Management at local level. However, many LGs may find that their most useful role is to act coordinate and facilitate (rather than directly implement) disaster management, as the latter role is sometimes constrained by their mandate and lack of resources to \u201cbring to the table\u201d and co-finance initiatives. 18 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 19 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 4.6. Local revenues and climate change To encourage mitigation and adaptation, LGs can use their own-source revenues to provide incentives for \u201cresponsible\u201d behaviour. They can also sanction behaviours that lead to excessive consumption or increased vulnerability to CC. Examples include tax breaks for climate-proof home improvements (e.g. more solid foundations to protect houses from flooding), and water charges calibrated to real consumption as a way of reducing consumption. However, there is little direct evidence that LGs in the region are using revenues as instruments to promote emissions reductions or climate change adaptation. This is due to the following factors: \u25aa LGs (especially rural ones) tend to gave highly constrained sources of own-revenue, and their revenue assignments often do not include sources that can be directly used to promote CC adaptation. \u25aa Many of revenue sources available to LGs are shared with central government, with the latter exercising rate-setting and collection. Such revenues therefore cannot easily be used by LGs as instruments for shaping behaviour on CC adaptation. \u25aa LGs have not systematically pursued access to carbon markets as a source of revenue. Such efforts would need to be linked to the mitigation efforts illustrated above (for example, carbon market financing for green energy conversions). \u25aa LGs tend to have relatively weak revenue administrations, especially in rural areas. This severely constrains any efforts to use taxes as fiscal instruments. \u25aa It is far from obvious that LGs \u2013 when they are able to levy taxes and charges on the use of natural resources \u2013 see revenue instruments as ways of regulating access and use. \u25aa The use of revenues is often constrained by equity considerations. For example, tax breaks for home improvements are likely to be skewed in favour of the non-poor, and higher water charges may be more costly for the poor than for the non-poor.

It is therefore important to identify key entry points for trying to strengthen LG engagement with CC-related risks and opportunities. National climate change and sub-national governance policies A starting point is establishing clear links between national CC policies and decentralisation/sub-national governance policies. In Cambodia, for example, CC is now laid out as a cross-cutting issue in the new 10-year national programme on decentralization and deconcentration18. However, in most LDCs such linkages are weak at best. This change needs to work in both directions \u2013 on the one hand, NAPA- type processes must explicitly recognise the role of LGs in adaptation strategies and, on the other, decentralisation programmes must build in CC into the regular functions and financing of LGs. Bridging these existing \u201cpolicy divides\u201d appears to be a sensible and practical way forward. This process can be facilitated through support from development agencies, who are often involved in both CC and decentralisation issues. As noted in the introduction, a number of developing countries in the region have already developed national CC strategies and are engaging in the roll out at sub-national level (frequently with donor support). This two-way policy dialogue can also help address some of the challenges and constraints mentioned above (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6). This will provide LGs with an institutional framework that enables them to use their public expenditure, revenue and regulatory instruments more effectively. But dialogue alone is not sufficient. LGs need leverage in the national policy-making process, so that it is relevant to their needs, aspirations, and capabilities. 18 Government of Cambodia (2010). 5 ENTRY POINTS AND PERSPECTIVES 20 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 21 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE Improving local understanding of climate change issues It is essential for LGs to know much more about what CC means for them in concrete and tangible terms. Particularly, they need to be provided with information on the nature of the risks they face. LGs in a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region (Thailand, Philippines and India) have begun various forms of CC assessments and development of strategies; unfortunately, overall there are few examples of this taking place. Information and data on CC needs to be presented in ways that make sense to local decision-makers and that spell out the need for certain types of action19. Such information also needs to be as site-specific as possible: CC and its consequences in the Middle Hills of Nepal require very different adaptive strategies to those required in coastal Bangladesh or Pacific island countries. There is also a need for information on the most CC-vulnerable groups within the LG jurisdiction in question, and reasons for this. In most cases, it is likely to be the poor; however, there may be a need to disaggregate the poor into more clearly defined groups (e.g. natural resource dependent households, women, the elderly and children). It is also important not to allow inaction to be incumbent on uncertainty in data. Local planners will always ask for detailed analysis of where the likely impacts of CC will manifest themselves over a 5\u201310 years timeframe. This would provide the basis for \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario planning. While this information may not be available, many things can be done in the meantime, including: \u25aa \u201cNo regrets\u201d-type activities linked to service delivery; \u25aa Capacity development activities to build a cadre of professional with expertise in assessing climate risks; and \u25aa Policy work to ensure that necessary flexibility to a range of \u201cfutures\u201d is built into new policy making. Where \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios are available and plausible, it may be more appropriate for central level authorities to assume responsibility for providing them as inputs to the local decision-making process. Beyond being better informed about CC, LGs need to be provided with support that enables them to conceptually and geographically map specific vulnerabilities and risks in their jurisdictions. Given that few (if any) LGs will ever be in a position to take on all climate change issues, part of this \u201cmapping\u201d process will entail providing them with methods for prioritising issues. From mapping and prioritisation, LGs will need to work out actionable, affordable and equitable strategies based on the full range of options available to them (financing, planning, ISD, revenues, regulation).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ef5817d-a06d-4af9-91ff-0adae5707f4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ef5817d-a06d-4af9-91ff-0adae5707f4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance and Climate Change: A Discussion Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b21c11e5aa5016774cf371b16e2d2b64db281b08782456a20687f406ccea283c"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc428378-3e2a-47b7-ba4a-634f27125020", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e193ec19cc5ad9233b787664117cbc325b1d135de29a3fc4ffe05dfa40c1dc8"}}, "hash": "497a256c7bc4942386d3ad7c2890c923840f14a711ab6da55cbc23bf5e899c23", "text": "One of the most frequently cited cases of this kind of approach is the city of Durban in South Africa (see textbox below). 19 For example, data on likely rises in sea levels in Bangladesh would make more sense to LG officials if presented as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85da16aa-4f70-4097-b420-198cdaa7b504": {"__data__": {"id_": "85da16aa-4f70-4097-b420-198cdaa7b504", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance and Climate Change: A Discussion Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd75e92bed5660ae4bcc3e7968d9f10e3054da9581644c926466abb124e1e07d"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b478d4b-d664-47a1-a18d-d388ab790183", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "467ce3411911178f2ebd63a512e30aa4a21899b6179a683a1807bf0a449701b0"}}, "hash": "bdab59c8df1ad7f529132881d3cfa6ade6af4fa2afe41a703b45b2e4f751bd87", "text": "maps depicting which areas in their jurisdictions will be flooded, rather than as more abstract quantifications. Durban\u2019s Climate Protection Plan process Durban established an Environmental Management Department in 1994. The Department recognised that municipal officials were unlikely to incorporate CC into their plans if they had little idea of what CC meant for their city. To address this, the Department initiated the development of a Climate Protection Programme in 2004. The roll-out of this programme has occurred in three phases: \u25aa Phase 1 consisted of developing an understanding of CC and its implications for Durban. Key risks identified were: increased temperatures, changes in rainfall distribution, decreased water availability, increased range of water- and vector-borne diseases, sea level rise, and the loss of biodiversity; \u25aa Phase 2 consisted of developing a \u201cClimate Change Adaptation Strategy\u201d, highlighting how various sectors within the municipality should respond to CC. Some responses amounted to extensions of ongoing initiatives, while others were new activities; \u25aa Phase 3 consisted of incorporating climate change into long term city planning. This case study illustrates the need for LG departments to understand what CC means for their work and future investments before any effective adaptation measures can take place. Source: Institute of Development Studies (2008). Financing arrangements for climate change For LGs to play an effective role in climate change, they will need access to fiscal resources, often in addition to those already available. One option is providing LGs with earmarked \u201cclimate change\u201d funding windows, with which they can finance climate- proofing or emissions reductions. Expenditure menus for these kinds of grants will need to be carefully thought through and compliance closely monitored in order to avoid spending on non-CC items. This funding can be provided \u201cacross the board\u201d or on a more targeted or \u201casymmetric\u201d basis, i.e. providing earmarked financing to LGs in areas that are especially vulnerable to CC. UPs in coastal Bangladesh are an example of this kind of approach. Various fiscal incentives can be used to promote LG CC adaptation. These include top- up or block grants tied to demonstrated progress in adapting routine LG activities to CC challenges (for example, by assessing and mapping CC risks and opportunities, and implementing CC strategies). Such measures provide LGs with real incentives to apply CC knowledge and skills acquired through capacity building.20 However, any such 20 See Jackson and Wekwete (forthcoming) and Royal Government of Bhutan and UNCDF (2010) for an example of such a scheme. For an overview of performance-based grant systems for local governments, see Steffensen & Larsen (2005) and Steffensen, J. (2010). 22 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 23 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE incentive scheme would need to ensure that performance measures are not skewed in favour of fiscally affluent LGs. One powerful argument for additional financing for LG CC adaptation is that it overcomes the institutional disincentives to adaptation work. At local level, PEM frameworks typically involve two types of resource allocation channels: development expenditure and recurrent expenditure. Details vary from case to case, but, broadly speaking, LGs tend to allocate development expenditure to new capital investments or projects. Recurrent expenditure, on the other hand, is used for staffing, operations, and maintenance of existing infrastructure and programmes. As discussed above, CC adaption may require LGs to \u201cclimate proof\u201d or even replace existing infrastructure. This will not yield new investments or services and therefore is unlikely to be favoured by the budget process for development expenditure allocation. On the other hand, the cost is likely to be too high for existing recurrent budgets, which in developing countries are often insufficient for the effective operation and maintenance of existing infrastructures, let alone climate proofing. Whatever the specific financing options may be, climate resilient and low carbon development should become part and parcel of regular LG business. It is not, as mentioned earlier, a new functional responsibility per se or a new expenditure assignment. LGs are already mandated to provide public goods and services; more often than not, facing the challenges posed by climate change will amount to a re-orientation or re-prioritisation of routine local government functions (ISD, planning, regulation, revenue management). In this sense, there is no substitute for regular LG capacity development \u2013 institutional, financial and otherwise. \u201cCorruption proofing\u201d CC initiatives at the local level is a matter of great concern.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b478d4b-d664-47a1-a18d-d388ab790183": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b478d4b-d664-47a1-a18d-d388ab790183", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance and Climate Change: A Discussion Note", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd75e92bed5660ae4bcc3e7968d9f10e3054da9581644c926466abb124e1e07d"}, "2": {"node_id": "85da16aa-4f70-4097-b420-198cdaa7b504", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-and-climate-change-discussion-note", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdab59c8df1ad7f529132881d3cfa6ade6af4fa2afe41a703b45b2e4f751bd87"}}, "hash": "467ce3411911178f2ebd63a512e30aa4a21899b6179a683a1807bf0a449701b0", "text": "Possible solutions include information transparency and the ability of community stakeholders to provide oversight to the use of these resources (see further below).

However, LGs have been largely excluded from the process (and, consequently, the funding). NAPAs and related project proposals are drawn up by national governments \u2013often through environment ministries \u2013 and rarely capture the ongoing, practical adaptation and mitigation activities LGs engage or can engage in. National governments generally retain project control, and implementation is done through local ministry offices, project implementation units, CSOs and private bodies, rather that LGs. In fact, rather than offering opportunity for increased funding, climate action funds pose a threat to LGs by encouraging recentralisation of risk management and environmental decision-making, whilst also possibly closing access to natural resources (such as forests) essential for local security. Making local democracy work for the most vulnerable In any LG jurisdiction, it is important to ensure that the needs of the people most vulnerable to CC are properly taken into account. Representative local democracy does not automatically translate into inclusion or responsiveness, and the vulnerable groups are often likely to have the least influence on LG decision-making. Capacity building and provision of incentives for inclusion can help address this issue. However, when entrusting LGs with additional fiscal resources, measures to ensure accountability to the different groups impacted and transparency in decision-making are crucial. The experience from participatory planning processes suggests that these alone rarely translate into decision-making benefiting the most vulnerable. Local media and CSOs play an important role in ensuring that voices and interests of the most vulnerable are raised in CC decision-making processes that affect them. For these and other social accountability mechanisms to function properly, it is equally important that LGs pro-actively disclose and communicate their plans and budgets. Indigenous peoples are among the most vulnerable to impacts of CC, including droughts, prolonged rain seasons, failed harvests, loss of resources and erosion of culture. Mitigation and adaptation policies implemented within indigenous peoples\u2019 territories should include their free prior and informed consent (e.g. REDD programmes targeting rainforest located within indigenous peoples\u2019 territories), and should acknowledge the role of traditional institutions of governance vis-\u00e0-vis formal LG bodies. More broadly, government should involve indigenous peoples in CC decision-making process; adaptation strategies should include the use of indigenous knowledge and innovations. Opportunities for livelihoods diversification may prove to be one of the most effective strategies for building resilience to climate change among the most vulnerable, whether in urban or rural settings. The capacity question A key issue for developing and implementing effective CC policies (both at the national and sub-national levels) is that of institutional, organisational and individual capacity, including the coordination capacity between different government levels. This calls for the setting up of appropriate institutional arrangements, which for the present are either nascent or non-existent in most LDCs. Developing CC capacity of LGs requires a national-level response. One approach could be integrating CC into the curricula of the core local government training programmes and in the \u201ctool box\u201d of national agencies providing technical backstopping and monitoring performance of LGs. Efforts surrounding the NAPA process concentrate capacity on CC issues within a limited group of staff in national (and possibly provincial) institutions. Getting the right knowledge to each LG \u2013 both elected representatives and staff \u2013 will require full integration in national systems. A capacity assessment exercise is a good starting for understanding how well national and sub-national governments are placed to address CC. It is a useful tool for understanding existing capacity and gaps. The exercise should cover the full range of institutions involved in addressing CC, and include assessing policy-setting capacity and delivery of specific services. Using the findings of the capacity assessment, LGs can develop capacity development strategies. 24 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 25 LOCAL GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE However, it is important to remember that capacity follows power. When LGs have the mandate and resources to make decisions on these matters, they are much more likely to invest in experiential capacities needed to design and implement effective CC policies. 5.2. Best bets, different local governments, and different options? In this section, suggestions are made about what the \u201cbest bets\u201d might be for central governments and development agencies in promoting LG engagement with CC. Quick wins? While one needs to be careful in making a distinction between short-term and long- term needs, it is likely that LGs will prioritise more immediate issues (such as disaster management, climate proofing, etc.) over longer term concerns (such as the need for gradual and progressive shifts in livelihoods strategies). Immediate risks are those that citizens prioritise, and are also the risks that LGs are usually better suited to addressing.

Piloting works best where it is seen to respond to a real need; starting out in areas where CC risks are high and self-evident will resonate more with LGs than in places where risks are less obvious. Where are CC issues most urgent? From a regional perspective, Bangladesh is one such country21, particularly its highly vulnerable lower-lying and coastal regions. Some of the small island nations (e.g. the Solomon Islands and the Maldives) are also high risk. There are also likely to be \u201crisk\u201d variations within countries, thus indicating the need for a geographically \u201casymmetric\u201d approach to supporting LGs. Types of local government What types of LGs are most likely or have most need to embrace CC in the ways that they \u201cdo business\u201d? There are a number of perplexing answers to this question: In terms of \u201cresponsiveness\u201d, the more downwardly accountable LGs strive to deliver appropriate services to their constituents, and hence are more likely to factor CC into 21 World Bank (2009a) considers Bangladesh to be one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. their actions. The extent to which LGs are accountable varies across countries and regions. For example, in Lao PDR downward accountability is very weak, in contrast to Cambodia and Bangladesh. In terms of \u201cneed\u201d, and perhaps paradoxically, urban LGs may face the most pressing challenges. Urban jurisdictions in the region include an ever-increasing proportion of the total population and rising numbers of the very poor22. Moreover, the urban poor are highly vulnerable to extreme events, because: (i) they are often heavily concentrated in risk-prone areas (like low-lying slums); (ii) they often depend on livelihoods that are not diversified; and (iii) they often lack the cohesiveness and resilience afforded by rural social capital. When disasters occur in urban areas, their consequences are often more acute than in rural areas \u2013 more poor people are affected, and more poor people face severe recovery problems. In short, the concentration of people in towns and cities that magnifies the consequences of climate change.23 In terms of their \u201cability\u201d to deal with and factor in climate change, urban LGs are also the more likely candidates. Municipalities and cities usually have access to greater fiscal resources and more regulatory powers than do their rural counterparts. Arguably, urban LGs in the region have a greater body of knowledge and experience to draw on (from their counterparts in OECD countries). At the same time, it could be argued that rural LGs face more intractable challenges \u2013 largely linked to their weak resource bases, and the logistical difficulties and costs of responding to the needs of low density populations \u2013 and that piloting climate change actions might therefore be more path-breaking and innovative in rural areas. To face those challenges, however, probably requires a multi-level and holistic approach \u2013 embracing all tiers of the local government system. As with natural resource management and environmental issues, a potentially useful entry point (where this is an option) might be to start at the \u201cprovincial\u201d level and then move downwards to smaller rural jurisdictions. Alternatively, efforts could be made to \u201cagglomerate\u201d small rural jurisdictions (to capture externalities) or try out innovative arrangements whereby small rural LGs identify and prioritise their problems and needs, but through which the financing and implementation of climate change actions are ensured by larger, better-resourced tiers in the intergovernmental system. 22 World Bank (2009b) estimated that urban populations of East Asia & the Pacific and South Asia accounted for 44.1 percent and 29.5 percent of respective total populations in 2008. 23 \u2018Urban centres contain a large proportion of the people most at risk from the effects of climate change. Many urban dwellers face life-threatening risks from the increased intensity of storms, flooding and landslides that climate change is bringing. These and other impacts will also bring the threat of damage to their livelihoods, property, environmental quality and future prosperity.

It gained particular momentum from the recent global financial, energy and food crises, and the growing awareness of poor people\u2019s vulnerability to climate-related disasters. Interest in social protection continues to expand as policymakers strive to secure hard-won human development gains and to tackle increasing levels of territorial and individual inequality, which often threaten social and political stability. This discussion paper conceptualizes social protection as part and parcel of overall public service delivery, and examines the role that local governments can play in implementing social protection related policies. It aims to shed light on two important questions that have not been systematically addressed in the existing literature. First, what added value can local government bring to safety net programmes? Does \u2018going local\u2019 improve or strengthen the effectiveness of social safety net initiatives? Secondly, and, inversely, what can safety net programmes bring to local government? Are there advantages for local governments in being more involved in the management and implementation of safety net programmes? The UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are increasingly focused on sustaining inclusive growth and development. This includes a collective effort to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in a sustainable and equitable manner. Social protection policies and programmes offer potential for fruitful cooperation based on the complementary strengths of the two organizations. This discussion paper is part of UNCDF and UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre\u2019s (APRC) contribution to strengthening the capacity of countries to design and implement effective and efficient social protection initiatives. It endeavours to help countries benefit from knowledge sharing and exchange of experiences from within and outside the Asia-Pacific region. This publication is jointly produced by UNCDF and UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre. We hope it will provide useful knowledge for policymakers and development practitioners, and that it will enrich the debate on the role that local governments can play to foster more inclusive and sustainable growth across the developing world.

It is clear that safety net programmes have much to offer to an overall strategy for reducing poverty and improving the lives of poor and vulnerable people. And it is equally clear that there are functions associated with the delivery of safety net programmes that local governments are well suited to handle, whether on the basis of delegation (with varying degrees of discretion) or very limited devolution. Whether or not they are intrinsically well suited to particular service delivery functions, many local governments either already play a significant role in such services or are mandated to do so. It is, therefore, important to examine ways in which this de facto local-level involvement can be optimized and enhanced, with a view towards improving performance and service delivery outcomes. Social protection, of which safety nets and social assistance are a subset, has become an integral part of the current development \u2018narrative\u2019 \u2013 and for good reasons, given the degree to which safety net and social assistance programmes appear to contribute to poverty reduction and alleviation. However, and despite their considerable potential as a policy instrument for poverty reduction, safety net programmes are not in themselves a panacea for poverty eradication. They do not replace other development activities but rather serve as an essential element in a comprehensive pro-poor strategy, effectively complementing investments in health, education and other sectors; social safety net programmes both reinforce and are strengthened by other interventions and policies. In many ways safety nets strengthen the \u2018demand side\u2019 of the service delivery continuum, either by making benefit payments conditional upon the use of public services or by providing households with income supplements that improve their ability to access services. By working on the demand side, safety nets complement \u2013 but do not replace \u2013 supply-side investments in infrastructure and service delivery in a broad range of sectors. Understanding the interface between the demand and supply side of public services is key to establishing a comprehensive social protection framework in any given country. At the same time, local governments are especially well suited to matching or articulating the supply and demand sides of social protection services since, in many cases, they are explicitly mandated to provide both types of services. Importantly, local governments can straddle both dimensions, in ways that are mutually beneficial. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that the evolving discourse on social assistance has not included much discussion about 2 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable the linkages \u2013 both empirical and conceptual \u2013 between local governance, service delivery and safety net programmes. Moreover, and especially in developing countries, relatively little has been said about safety nets as a public service, on a conceptual par, for example, with education or health.

This publication tries to answer two important questions. First, what added value does (or might) local government bring to safety net programmes? Can \u2018going local\u2019 improve or strengthen the effectiveness of safety nets? Second, what do (or might) safety net programmes bring to local government? Are there advantages for local governments in becoming or being involved in the management and implementation of safety net programmes? Going local: Implications for safety net programmes Local governments are formal institutions, officially mandated to deliver a variety of public goods and services at the local level. The assignment of service delivery responsibilities to local governments is largely predicated on the principle of subsidiarity, which suggests that government functions should be assigned to the lowest level of government that is capable of efficiently undertaking this function. Because local governments are proximate, they can be expected to deliver services that correspond to local priorities and in ways that genuinely meet local needs. Moreover, local governments are institutionally sustainable. It is these two key features of local governments \u2013 their proximity and institutional viability \u2013 that make them so well suited to appropriate and pro-poor service delivery. Depending on circumstances, decentralized services can be delivered in a devolved way, as delegated functions, or through de-concentration, with local governments enjoying varying degrees of discretionary decision-making powers. Local government service delivery responsibilities (such as education or health) need to be unbundled into functions and subfunctions, some of which may be decentralized to a varying degree, others of which will be better kept under central control. It is thus not an \u2018either/or\u2019 issue, but an \u2018and/or\u2019 one. By applying the same logic to the delivery of safety nets one can \u2018unbundle\u2019 their constituent 3 Executive summary functions and subfunctions (e.g. setting policy, defining standards, financing, planning, beneficiary selection, monitoring and evaluation, payments, etc.). In other words, safety net programmes can be \u2018unbundled\u2019 into a range of interrelated but analytically distinct activities, which may be handled by a single institution (such as a ministry), but which may also be assigned to different institutions, organizations and levels of government, depending on their comparative advantage. This publication argues that it is precisely by looking at safety net programmes in terms of their \u2018nuts and bolts\u2019 that the role of local government becomes clearer. Although local governments are unlikely to play a major role in financing safety nets and in setting overall policies and standards, they are potentially well placed to manage a number of key implementation functions (beneficiary selection, payments, monitoring, and grievance/redress). As a second step in defining and distinguishing between subnational and national service delivery functions, it may be analytically useful to categorize different types of safety nets along two dimensions \u2013 focusing on conditionalities (conditional or unconditional) and access (universal or targeted)\u2013of which a combination or mix may have different organizational and institutional implications. This publication argues that as safety net programmes become more targeted and more conditional, they tend to become more complex and their transaction costs rise. This, in turn, may involve more functions and subfunctions than simpler safety nets, thus providing space for more actors (including local government) to become actively involved in their implementation. With the above in mind, it is important to acknowledge that there is no one-size- fits-all formula. Defining an appropriate set of decentralized arrangements or functional assignments for safety net services will vary from country to country, and within countries, will vary from tier to tier of the intergovernmental system. These differences in local government characteristics, structures and systems should guide the thinking about the interface between safety nets and local governments. There are also, of course, significant challenges that need to be addressed in trying to strengthen the role of local government in the delivery of safety net services. Social protection policies or strategies in many developing countries in the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions appear to officially assign either no role or a very limited role to local government in implementing safety net programmes. Another challenge is the sometimes weak capacity of local governments and aptitude of local governments to deliver services in general, and safety nets in particular, as a tool for poverty reduction. However, the real risks associated with local government involvement in the delivery of safety net services are not just about capacity and mandate issues, but also include issues such as local- national coordination, corruption, clientelism and financial management. Care should be exercised when reviewing local government involvement in delivering safety nets. Such care should not lead to avoidance, but should rather trigger a more focused approach, since there", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f182b89f-3045-458e-b13f-5508e449e488": {"__data__": {"id_": "f182b89f-3045-458e-b13f-5508e449e488", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8a604252559480f876b29435eb25ea488870a558521eab0f7fa9a7b9f43d750"}}, "hash": "a8a604252559480f876b29435eb25ea488870a558521eab0f7fa9a7b9f43d750", "text": "is still plenty of room for such involvement. Returning to the original questions, the publication establishes a variety of areas that can guide this work. What can local government bring to safety net programmes? There are a number of local government characteristics that are important when considering local government\u2019s role in implementing safety net programmes. This discussion paper suggests several areas where local governments can add value to the implementation of safety net programmes: \u2022\ufffd Better beneficiary selection (and targeting) processes. Due to their proximity, local accountability and vital registration functions, local governments are potentially well placed to facilitate a better targeting and beneficiary selection process for safety net programmes. This could reduce inclusion and exclusion errors in safety nets. \u2022\ufffd Better grievance and redress processes. Thanks again to their proximity, local governments can provide a framework for more effective grievance and redress mechanisms. This affects not only safety nets, but also overall issues of accountability and transparency. \u2022\ufffd More information availability and greater disclosure. Local governments offer significant opportunities for increased availability of information and improved public disclosure about social protection services, and thus potentially greater transparency and accountability. \u2022\ufffd Monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring of safety net programmes can potentially be strengthened by working through the local government system. Local-level monitoring may be qualitatively better than centrally administered monitoring, if only because local staff and offices may have a greater knowledge of the community and greater incentives to follow up on service delivery performance. \u2022\ufffd Taking into account local conditions and circumstances. Because they are aware of local conditions and circumstances, local governments offer opportunities for tailoring safety net parameters and outputs. As such, they provide an institutional framework for ensuring that safety net programmes are adapted to a range of geographical and socio-economic contexts. \u2022\ufffd Linking supply and demand. To the extent that local governments are responsible for providing infrastructure and service delivery, their active 5 Executive summary involvement in the implementation of safety net programmes provides an opportunity for linking supply and demand. \u2022\ufffd Experimentation and adaptation. Assuming that delegated or devolved safety net programmes allow a degree of local discretion, local governments provide a natural \u2018laboratory\u2019 for experimentation and innovation through heterogeneous implementation arrangements for future scale up if successful. \u2022\ufffd Existing arrangements. Local governments, because they are already on the ground, can potentially reduce the administrative and management costs associated with safety net programmes. What can safety net programmes bring to local government and governance in general? This discussion paper argues that there are several features of safety net programmes that can bring added value to local government and to local governance, and to local service delivery and performance, in particular: \u2022\ufffd Addressing immediate income and human poverty. Most important, safety nets can provide a mechanism through which local government can directly address income/consumption poverty issues. \u2018Regular\u2019 local government infrastructure and service delivery functions, which focus on the supply side of poverty reduction, cannot directly tackle demand-side issues. \u2022\ufffd Strengthening local government capacities. The implementation of safety net programmes can, in and of itself, considerably enhance local government capacities and strengthen existing service delivery functions (such as vital registration). \u2022\ufffd Enhancing accountability. To the extent that locally administered safety nets require regular interaction between local governments and their citizens, they may contribute to enhanced accountability and better local governance. \u2022\ufffd Demand for public services. By generating or maintaining demand for other public services, safety net programmes (especially conditional cash transfers) can help local governments and users identify bottlenecks and other problems. In addition, safety net programmes such as conditional cash transfers may help local governments to meet other sectoral objectives, such as higher enrolment rates in schools and more frequent use of local health clinics. \u2022\ufffd No added fiscal burden. Under most circumstances, involvement in the implementation of safety net programmes should not increase the fiscal burden borne by local governments: the central government should provide the funds for implementation. 6 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd Operations and maintenance issues. Workfare programmes have the potential to help local governments address infrastructure maintenance. \u2022\ufffd Economic development and growth. Safety net programmes may help move people up to a minimum level of income, either through direct employment programmes or through cash transfers, which may increase the potential for a larger part of the population to become economically active. Ways forward Three categories of activities would seem appropriate in understanding better the role of local governments in delivering safety nets and related social services.

This might include further analysis of existing experiences, contrasting centralized and decentralized safety nets in different areas. Unbundling the implementation of different types of safety net programme into a series of functions and subfunctions can help identify those that are best suited to local government. Analytical work can also improve the understanding of how locally administered safety net programmes can be financed, by exploring the pros and cons of different financing and disbursement options. Given that local government often manages vital registration functions, which may be crucial in identifying the recipients of safety net programmes, we should also improve our understanding of local government vital registration functions and how they interface with safety net management. Given the clear linkages between supply and demand in overall linkages between safety net service delivery and other public services (such as education, health and public works), this should also be a key area for further analysis. It is useful to appraise payment and financial management procedures and processes at the local level, focusing on ways to use the banking system and on making manual (un-banked) payments processes more robust and corruption- proof. A particular focus of such analytical work would be further examining the linkages between cash transfers and financial inclusion measures, in addition to the potential of market-based instruments such as savings, remittances and payment services, microinsurance, in addition to broader delivery systems which can further capitalize on transfers to the very poor and often \u201cnon-bankable\u201d groups of the population. Second, a set of complementary piloting activities is needed. This would consist of on-the-ground piloting of different types of safety net programmes in which local governments play a more or less active role, with a view to 7 Executive summary testing out potential improvements, appropriate institutional arrangements and generating evidence-based lessons. Such piloting would focus on the safety net and functional areas where local governments are assumed to have a comparative advantage, but would also provide opportunities to test optimal arrangements for jointly managed safety nets (with responsibilities shared by several governmental tiers). A pilot is already operational in Nepal \u2013 the \u2018Human Development and Social Protection pilot\u2019 \u2013 which focuses on improving access to education and tests innovations and linkages as outlined in the section above. This pilot is a test case for further piloting within the region, which could build knowledge to inform overall policy. Third, the lessons learned from analytical and piloting work should inform policy-level discussions, with a view towards influencing national thinking and policies. This would include activities such as informal advocacy, information dissemination and networking. A key aim would be to provide national policymakers with information that allows them to clarify the role of local government in the implementation of safety net programmes, and ensure that this is reflected in national social protection strategies or policies. UNCDF and UNDP are implementing these recommendations by pursuing piloting and further analytical work to develop knowledge based on practical experience, which will enable appropriate policy advice and national scale up and as a key input to the overall global agenda. UNCDF and UNDP work closely to promote inclusive finance as part of the broader efforts to extend social protection to the poor and vulnerable. Both organizations believe that access to affordable and reliable financial services is essential to poverty reduction, as it enables the poor to build assets, increase incomes and reduce their vulnerability to economic shocks and stress. In addition, an emerging regional initiative called \u2018Connecting the dots: Expanding social protection through social and financial services\u2019, builds on the experience of the Nepal pilot and takes a holistic approach to social protection. Furthermore, local governance and social protection present an opportunity for cross-practice collaboration and joint programming between UNCDF and UNDP, which have complementary strengths in these areas. While UNCDF primarily focus on investing in the least developed countries to accelerate achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), UNDP \u2013 through its region- wide presence \u2013 can leverage the knowledge generated by UNCDF to promote South-South exchange of experience. Close collaboration between UNCDF and UNDP can help connect social protection initiatives to a broader democratic governance agenda to build capable states through effective institutions and systems, while addressing issues of transparency and accountability. 9 Background and purpose Background and purpose In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in, and increased funding of, social safety net (\u2018safety net\u2019) programmes in the developing world.1 Social protection, of which safety nets and social assistance are a subset, has become an integral part of much of the current development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afee2d0c-e348-483f-b7d9-5220c39d0af9": {"__data__": {"id_": "afee2d0c-e348-483f-b7d9-5220c39d0af9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0dcf53a889392a13eac1c85814975b88664b53124d6133151a46e58a0d38c91c"}}, "hash": "0dcf53a889392a13eac1c85814975b88664b53124d6133151a46e58a0d38c91c", "text": "narrative \u2013 and for good reasons, given the degree to which safety net and social assistance programmes appear able to contribute to poverty reduction and alleviation. Social protection interventions, especially safety net programmes, are considered by most development agencies to be key to ensuring pro-poor growth in developing countries2 and as a major contributor to the attainment of the MDGs.3 In April 2009, the United Nations Chief Executive Board launched the Social Protection Floor Initiative (SPF-I) as one of its nine initiatives to cope with the global financial crisis. The SPF-I corresponds to a set of basic social rights, services and facilities that the global citizen should enjoy. It can be seen as a core obligation of ensuring the realization of minimum essential levels of rights embodied in human right treaties. This UN-interagency initiative is firmly committed to promoting the expansion of social protection programmes. The SPF-I is a key pillar in overall poverty reduction strategies and in providing the poor and vulnerable with a cushion against socio-economic downturns and crises.4 It is somewhat surprising that the evolving discourse on social assistance does not include much discussion about the linkages \u2013 both empirical and conceptual \u2013 between local governance, service delivery and safety net programmes. In the literature, there are a few scattered discussions of decentralization and safety net programmes, but most are concerned with developed countries, where local governments often play a significant role in the implementation of safety net 1 A recent issue of The Economist (29 July 2010), for example, featured both an editorial leader and a three-page article on conditional cash transfers. 2 See OECD (2009). 3 See World Bank (2003). 4 The SPF-I consists of two main elements that help to realize these human rights: (i) ensuring the availability, continuity and geographical and financial access to essential services, such as water and sanitation, food and adequate nutrition, health, education, housing and other social services, such as life and asset saving information; and (ii) realizing access by ensuring a basic set of essential social transfers, in cash and in kind, to provide a minimum income and livelihood security for poor and vulnerable populations and to facilitate access to essential services. It includes social transfers (but also information, entitlements and policies) to children, people in active age groups with insufficient income and older persons. See UNDG Issue Brief on Social Protection (2011). 10 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable actions. The World Bank\u2019s recent landmark study on safety nets (\u201cFor Protection and Promotion\u201d, does, however, include an interesting subchapter on safety nets in a decentralized world, and provides useful examples and valuable insights. Moreover, and especially in developing countries, relatively little has been said about safety nets as a public service, on a conceptual par, for example, with education or health. A tendency to see safety nets as implemented through temporary programmes, rather than delivered as public services on a permanent basis, may explain some of the silence surrounding the linkages between local governance/government and safety nets. By conceptualizing safety nets as part and parcel of overall public service delivery (in which local governments can and do play a key role), it may become easier to explore those linkages. This discussion paper tries to fill these apparent gaps and to identify further areas of analytical work and piloting that might help development practitioners better understand the linkages between local governance, service delivery and social safety nets. Written largely from a local governance perspective, this discussion paper targets a wide range of audiences, including central and local government officials in developing countries, the staff of development partners in general and UNCDF and UNDP staff in particular. Fundamentally, this publication tries to shed light on two important questions. First, what added value can local government bring to safety net programmes? Can \u2018going local\u2019 improve or strengthen the effectiveness of safety nets? Second (and inversely), what can safety net programmes bring to local government? Are there advantages for local governments in being involved in the management and implementation of safety net programmes? The purpose of this discussion paper is fivefold: (i) to provide an overview of social protection in general and safety net programmes in particular. This is primarily aimed at local governance practitioners, many of whom may not be familiar with safety nets; (ii) to assess the extent to which such programmes have been (or might be) delivered through and/or with local governments; (iii) to look at some of the ways in which safety nets can or do strengthen local governance; (iv) to outline some of the potential ways forward", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d878f478-5152-4bd7-8411-19471011976e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d878f478-5152-4bd7-8411-19471011976e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a22aa7310b9b66204b2f259919fe05f3bd16ac5a41968cf412e69d174e09edd"}}, "hash": "9a22aa7310b9b66204b2f259919fe05f3bd16ac5a41968cf412e69d174e09edd", "text": "in strengthening linkages between local governance, service delivery and social safety net programmes; and (v) to establish the foundations for a framework for policy-relevant piloting. 11 Background and purpose This discussion paper begins by introducing the concept of social protection and safety net programmes, describing their purpose and main typologies, and highlighting some key issues. Second, the paper offers background information on what is meant by \u2018local government\u2019: what local government does, its service delivery functions and its variants in the Africa and Asia-Pacific regions. Third, the paper includes an analytical section, in which it examines the actual or potential role of local government in financing, managing and implementing safety net programmes. Fourth, this paper provides a general discussion of some of the options for strengthening the links between local governance/government and the delivery of safety net programmes. This includes an overview of the role that can be played by UNCDF and UNDP, including potential entry points for collaboration. 13 Social protection and safety nets Social protection and safety nets This section describes social protection and provides background information on safety net programmes, which are a subset of social protection. The discussion is brief and aimed primarily at those who are relatively unfamiliar with safety net programmes, principles and issues. 3.1. Social protection: Definitions and wider context 3.1.1. What is social protection and what are safety nets? Although different agencies and governments have different definitions of social protection (see Annex for an overview of the most commonly used definitions), this discussion paper defines social protection as public and private interventions to support and enable individuals, households and specific groups in their efforts to prevent, manage and overcome a defined set of risks and vulnerabilities, aimed at reducing extreme and chronic poverty. This broad definition could, however, include actions (such as flood defences or immunization) that are not generally considered social protection. Thus, the definition must be narrowed to delimit social protection as a subset of public actions that help address risk, vulnerability and chronic poverty. These comprise three sets of instruments (although wide-ranging variations are possible):5 \u2022\ufffd Social insurance refers to the pooling of contributions by individuals in state or private organizations so that if they suffer a shock or change in circumstances, they receive financial support; \u2022\ufffd Minimum standards, which are set and enforced to help protect citizens within the workplace; \u2022\ufffd Social safety nets (sometimes referred to as part of social assistance) are non-contributory transfers that are given to targeted individuals on the basis of their vulnerability or level of poverty. 5 See DFID (2006). 14 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable These different forms of social protection are briefly described below. Social insurance Social insurance schemes are contributory programmes in which beneficiaries make regular financial contributions in order to join a scheme that will reduce risk in the event of a shock, or provides them with deferred benefits. Examples include health insurance schemes, pension funds and unemployment insurance. Although many social insurance programmes are seen as too costly (financially and in terms of transaction costs) to be useful to the poor, there are examples of innovative insurance schemes that are probably accessible to the relatively poor (if not to the ultra-poor). Of note here are pro-poor microfinance products such as \u2018index insurance\u2019 schemes, which can, for example, provide farmers and pastoralists with relatively inexpensive insurance-based compensation in the event of crop failures or livestock losses.6 The role of the state in such schemes is not necessarily a primary one. The state ensures the legal framework, and may also subsidize the establishment of social insurance schemes, but may not be involved in the actual operation of the insurance. These insurance schemes may be regional or local, rather than national, and have a close relationship with subnational governments. Workplace or labour market interventions Workplace or labour market interventions are intended to protect or advance the interests of those who are able to work. Such interventions cover the rules that govern working conditions and industrial relations.

In line with the World Bank, the term \u2018safety nets\u2019 refer to \u201cnon- contributory transfer programs targeted in some manner to the poor or vulnerable.\u201d7 Thus safety net programmes are defined here as \u201cinterventions 6 See Hellmuth et al (2009). 7 See World Bank (2009c). 15 Social protection and safety nets that are (i) designed for the most poor and vulnerable poor and (ii) are non\u2010 contributory... by contrast to social insurance schemes, which rely on prior contributions from the recipient.\u201d8 Examples of safety net interventions include unconditional cash (or near cash) transfers (such as pensions, family allowances and certain types of subsidy); income-generating schemes (such workfare, or food and cash for work); and programmes aimed at protecting or promoting human capital (such as conditional cash transfers and fee waivers for core social services). Safety nets focus on providing social assistance to the poor and the vulnerable, and are better suited to integration into local government service delivery mechanisms than social insurance and workplace interventions. 3.1.2. Safety nets in a wider context It is helpful to situate social protection, particularly safety net programmes, within the overall context of poverty reduction, attainment of the MDGs and other development goals. Safety net programmes can play a vital role in assisting the chronically poor and highly vulnerable, and in helping the poor from falling further below the poverty line due to shocks and stresses. Without robust safety nets to bolster their incomes and stabilize their consumption, the poor and the vulnerable are unlikely to build assets and improve their economic livelihoods. Safety nets also help those on the edge of extreme poverty, by providing them with a cushion against shocks and their consequences (e.g. asset depletion). By so doing, safety nets help the poor to access some of the opportunities of economic growth. Importantly, social safety net interventions can also foster economic development. They may \u2013 under the right conditions \u2013 represent an investment in future growth by contributing to the accumulation and protection of human capital, which is a core driver of economic growth. They also have the potential to level out inequality \u2013 a growing problem in many developing economies \u2013 by helping the most disadvantaged to attain a minimum level of social security and well-being. In addition, safety nets can help households \u2018ride\u2019 the shocks and challenges of an unpredictable context, enabling them to plan and strategize, rather than just react. This, in itself, is important to economic development. The particular role of safety net programmes in protecting poor and vulnerable people during periods of economic crisis has been underlined in recent years. Safety nets also contribute to MDG attainment (box 1). 8 Ibid. 16 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Box 1: Safety nets and the MDGs MDG 1: Eradicate extreme poverty \u2022\ufffd Pensions reduce poverty among the old and disabled; \u2022\ufffd Safety nets smooth/raise income, thereby directly affecting poverty; \u2022\ufffd Fee waivers for health and education allow families to obtain services without impoverishing themselves; \u2022\ufffd Transfers targeting children can help reduce current as well as intergenerational transmission of poverty; \u2022\ufffd Public works programmes provide temporary employment especially in times of economic stress and also contribute towards infrastructure development.

For many developing countries, the consequences of climate change are numerous: changes in precipitation; more frequent, unpredictable and severe flooding; rises in temperature and their knock-on effects; rising sea levels (and, as a consequence, salinization); and more intense and prolonged drought. These consequences of climate change directly affect people (particularly the poorest) by intensifying shocks and stresses and making livelihoods more vulnerable. Given safety nets\u2019 ability to help poor people better cope with the consequences of stresses and shocks, it is clear that they can play an important role in adaptation to climate change.10 Despite their considerable potential as a policy instrument for poverty reduction in developing countries, safety net programmes are not in themselves a panacea for poverty eradication. They do not replace other development activities but are instead an essential element of a pro-poor strategy, effectively complementing investments in health, education and other sectors.11 Safety nets strengthen the demand side of the service delivery continuum, either by making benefit payments conditional upon the use of public services or by providing households with income supplements that improve their ability to access services. By working on the demand side, safety nets complement \u2013 but do not replace \u2013 supply-side investments in infrastructure and service delivery in a broad range of sectors. Safety nets cannot substitute for economic growth in general. Social safety net programmes both reinforce and are strengthened by other interventions and policies. Indeed, a broad definition of social protection, such as that used in the UN\u2019s Social Protection Floor Initiative, includes both the supply side (services) and the demand side (transfers), underscoring the way in which safety nets dovetail into a holistic approach to poverty reduction.12 Although safety nets significantly contribute to reducing income/consumption poverty, they are not intended to single-handedly enable poor people to raise their incomes and consumption levels to a point where they become non- vulnerable. Safety nets (as illustrated in the diagram below) act as a floor, helping 9 See OECD (2009). 10 Interestingly, the World Bank\u2019s Social Development Department is intensifying its work on the linkages between climate change resilience, disaster risk reduction, and social protection. This will include reviewing Bank-supported work across this nexus to date, making contributions to the World Bank\u2019s Africa Region strategy for social protection (which is expected to include a stronger focus on these issues), preparing for a major conference in Addis Ababa in 2011 as a forum for South-South learning on the broad topic, and providing specific operational support in several regions (Robin Mearns, personal communication). 11 See EPRI (2006). 12 See UN (2009) [SPFI Fact Sheet]. 18 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable people to better manage risks; seize opportunities (such as microfinance, microinsurance and agricultural extension services); and increase their incomes and build their assets.

Figure 1 can be seen as either: (i) schematically depicting an individual household\u2019s graduation from chronic poverty or extreme vulnerability to reduced vulnerability (by accessing different types of services, from safety nets to extension); or (ii) as a synchronous snapshot of the kinds of intervention appropriate to households of varying degrees of poverty/vulnerability in a particular location. It is, however, important to note that \u2018graduation\u2019 may only apply to certain households; other households may require continued long- term support, like specific vulnerable group such as the elderly and disabled, which one should not expect to graduate.

Kinship-based networks and institutions, for example, assist individuals in times of stress or need. The ancestral halls and other associations established by the Chinese diaspora in South-East Asia are a striking example, often providing their members with an informal social safety net. Likewise, traditionally in Europe, early social protection schemes were either provided by churches, or at least partially motivated by religious movements. In other societies, there are well-entrenched norms about providing community members with assistance in the face of economic or other misfortune. In many parts of South Asia, the regular and significant remittances that migrant labourer send to their extended families can also constitute an important safety net. There are also numerous examples of traditional or socially embedded safety nets in sub-Saharan African societies. However, the effectiveness of socially embedded, or traditional, safety nets in dealing with risks, shocks and chronic poverty is limited. Some traditional mechanisms are not particularly well suited to reducing chronic poverty, which, after all, has been an abiding feature of many Asian and African societies. Indeed, the chronically poor may simply not have access to informal safety net arrangements. Additionally, traditional safety nets may involve costs, such as expectations of reciprocal assistance at a later date or the establishment of patron-client relationships. Informal safety nets may offer short-term relief from shocks or stress, but may \u2013 in the longer term \u2013 reinforce social systems and structures that sustain inequalities and poverty. Finally, while informal safety nets may help in handling \u2018idiosyncratic\u2019 (or household-specific) risks/crises, they are usually inadequate in the face of \u2018co-variant\u2019 (or system-wide) crises, such as major economic downturns, widespread natural disasters or food price 20 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable inflation,13 when very large numbers of people are vulnerable or at risk (and thus unable to help others). These inherent weaknesses in informal, or socially embedded, safety nets support the case for publicly funded social assistance. Nonetheless, public safety net programmes should recognize the existence of informal social assistance mechanisms and avoid undermining them.14 Box 2 provides an illustration of one of the better known traditional safety nets in Africa, as well as a sense of its limitations. Box 2: Habbanae livestock reconstitution among the Wodaabe of Niger The livelihoods of Wodaabe nomadic pastoralists in Niger are largely dependent on livestock assets and production. Livestock provide the Wodaabe with directly consumable products, as well as a source of cash (through livestock sales) with which to purchase other food items and goods. Wodaabe livestock holdings, however, are vulnerable to drought and disease, which can decimate the herds and flocks of individual households. In the event of significant livestock losses, Wodaabe households use a variety of coping mechanisms, of which one of the most important is habbanae. Habbanae is a traditional system through which a household whose livestock holdings have been depleted through drought or disease is able to \u2018borrow\u2019 cattle from other kin for a period equivalent to three calvings, after which the cows are returned to their owners. The recipient household not only benefits from the milk produced by the borrowed cows, but is also entitled to keep the three calves in order to reconstitute its livestock assets. As such, habbanae is a traditional safety net mechanism that helps the transient poor to rebuild assets and, at the same time, meet some of their immediate consumption needs. The habbanae system, however, is more than a safety net: as a system of collective rights and obligations, it also creates and strengthens bonds and linkages between households and clans, and is thus a way of investing in social capital. In this respect, it is worth noting that young people (in most cases, young men) can also use the habbanae system to establish their own herds, prior to inheriting livestock from their parents. Nevertheless, the Habbanae system is limited as a safety net. In the event of catastrophic drought and widespread livestock losses, there are simply fewer animals to be borrowed. The habbanae system is also explicitly based on deferred reciprocity: those who benefit now are expected to reciprocate at a later date.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7db830fd-d25a-4b3c-a35a-96268c55f4e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7db830fd-d25a-4b3c-a35a-96268c55f4e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "160de48ece5f1268b181d89d81b327625ee30a0439ae492dadafb2480f465dd7"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6dee0dd-2f4e-41a8-ba2e-60d0feff39e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "662ef87269860dd2165c486ec167daa346cf4a1b3dcb3b350e4caa5c0f325ee5"}}, "hash": "f115deb27a0b7a7b80aa235bb3b7cdd7d8d9de7d1694e5f21a945efb05ef60d0", "text": "Finally, chronically and ultra poor households may have difficulties in accessing habbanae networks and benefits \u2013 they are typically the weakest links in any networks of social solidarity and may thus be excluded or distanced from existing social networks.

The Alimenta system provided low-interest loans to farmers and subsistence allowances to poor children in Italy. Some of the better known pre-modern safety nets were established in late medieval and early modern England. These safety nets were governed by the Old Poor Law, a series of acts dating back to the Elizabethan era. The Poor Law Act of 1601 made parishes responsible for the care and employment of the poor, the cost of which was to be borne by a form of local taxation known as the \u2018poor rate\u2019. Through the Old Poor Law, some 15,000 English parishes were expected to provide social assistance to the \u2018impotent\u2019 poor (the elderly, disabled, sick) and to provide work for the able-bodied, who were, by law, to be accommodated and fed in \u2018houses of industry\u2019 or \u2018workhouses\u2019. The English Poor Laws had parallels elsewhere in early modern and more recent history, especially in the 20th Century, as \u2018warfare\u2019 states in Europe and North America gradually became \u2018welfare\u2019 states.15 The German Sozialpolitik in the 1880s, under Chancellor Bismarck, laid the foundation for continental European social welfare systems and is considered the most significant role model for such systems worldwide. The socialist movement of the late 19th Century also played an important role in the development of the welfare state. Notably, the initiatives and work of social democratic city governments in Central and Northern Europe in the early 20th Century have become core features of the modern welfare state and is arguably a key reason why social protection came to be seen as a core state function over the past decade. The examples are numerous: the establishment of welfare states in Scandinavia in the mid-1930s; Britain\u2019s post-war welfare reforms, which led, among other things, to the National Health Service; US government interventions, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority during the 1930s and the first US federal food stamp programme, which began in 1939. Most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries established their current social assistance programmes during the inter-war decades of the 20th Century \u2013 often in reaction to the economic shock of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Indeed, the development of modern welfare states in Europe and North America provides many examples of the different rationales underlying social assistance policies and programmes, and of the ways in which particular programmes have evolved into regular and rights-based public services. 15 See Ferguson (2001). 22 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable 3.2.2. Safety nets in general This subsection examines some of the broad features and attributes of safety net programmes. What do safety nets do? Well-designed and effectively implemented safety net programmes can achieve a number of important things. Perhaps most obvious and important, they can immediately and tangibly contribute to the alleviation of extreme and chronic poverty by simply making it easier for the poorest and most vulnerable to survive and to access and use public services that they could not otherwise afford. A poor person in a poor country like Nepal or Uganda struggles to live on less than a dollar a day, and almost any sensible social transfer can make some contribution to alleviating those levels of poverty. In many countries, and especially in agrarian economies, the poor are subject to regular lean seasons, when food stocks are low and food prices are high. In conditions such as these, safety nets provide a degree of security. More specifically, well-designed and properly implemented safety nets can: \u2022\ufffd Help poor people better cope with the consequences of shocks and stresses, and thus ensure that they do not fall further into poverty.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a511b192-c7b2-4bc0-a001-d4095978418b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a511b192-c7b2-4bc0-a001-d4095978418b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e95a35a8cf8437858cf60ab7ccf300ab8e4d46535818249e7831ec88d4d266f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9975555a-92c6-4ed3-91c2-3801bef3924a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d81857fb75f8f392a31adfed3f70d9dca08acbe130c6ec2f38834b6c5cd325b"}}, "hash": "47d87e267c7efaca84ebb18c0b3839e5a0782731f734cff448025b5c4e50479b", "text": "Whether in the form of longer term cash transfers or seasonal public works schemes, safety nets can help protect the poor and the vulnerable against the potentially crippling effects of crises and calamities. \u2022\ufffd Help poor people gradually build up their assets.

Through safety nets and the cash or in-kind benefits that they provide, people become better able to cope with shocks and stresses, as well as more likely to access opportunities for increasing their income. The insurance provided by safety nets can help households avoid ex ante risk management decisions (such as planting low-risk but low-yielding crops) that ultimately lower their incomes. \u2022\ufffd Safety nets also help people avoid recourse to negative coping strategies (such as withdrawing their children from school, cutting back on feeding their children, selling assets such as livestock or seed). By smoothing incomes and consumption levels during periods of stress, safety nets provide poor households with a floor, thus enabling them to maintain their present and future physical and human assets. 23 Social protection and safety nets \u2022\ufffd Help poor people by strengthening their ability to escape from inequitable patron-client relationships. By providing a floor, safety nets can provide poor people with a more secure basis upon which to negotiate the terms of their relationship with others (such as landlords and employers). Who benefits from safety nets? Depending on their design and purpose, safety nets typically benefit: \u2022\ufffd The chronically poor, who have very limited assets. Such people are highly vulnerable to any shock or stress and face enormous challenges in trying to build up their assets. Safety nets provide the chronically poor with income and consumption support, and can reduce their vulnerability and help them to build assets or avoid their recourse to coping strategies that make them poorer. \u2022\ufffd The transient poor, who face regular and/or seasonal lean periods, or who have been pushed into poverty by a sudden shock. Safety nets can provide the transient poor with access to short-term relief, enabling them to survive a lean period without selling their assets or to rebuild their livelihoods iStock 24 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable following calamity or disaster. Safety nets, if appropriately designed, can also help people on the edge of the poverty line avoid falling further into poverty due to shocks and stresses. \u2022\ufffd Vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the disabled, and orphans. Such groups have very limited opportunities to gain an income or maintain their consumption levels, largely because they are unable to work or have very few assets. Safety nets help vulnerable groups by providing them with a floor \u2013 a basic transfer (in cash or in-kind) that enables them to obtain food and other essential items. Safety nets, then, are intended to stop those who are falling downward economically from becoming destitute, and to provide basic assistance or support to the chronically poor. They provide poor and vulnerable people with a cushion against shocks and stresses. One of the key features of most safety net programmes is that they provide direct income and consumption support to the poor and vulnerable. This is what distinguishes them from other publicly funded pro-poor interventions, such as the many programmes that promote income-generating activities16 through microfinance, producer group formation or revolving funds. Such income generation programmes17 are unlikely to reach the poorest and most vulnerable, and often benefit only those who are in a position to seize economic opportunities. Precisely because poor and vulnerable people are typically excluded from group activities and are averse to taking risks by engaging in new activities or taking on credit, they are unlikely to benefit from income-generating activity programmes. Well-designed and properly implemented safety nets, on the other hand, can provide assistance to the poorest people and, over time, help them take modest risks and seize economic opportunities. 3.2.3. Safety net programmes in developing countries: categories and examples This subsection provides a taxonomy of safety net programmes, along with some brief examples from the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions. It uses the basic taxonomy of safety nets that underpins the World Bank\u2019s recent overview of such programmes. Table 1 summarizes that taxonomy and some of the characteristics of each type of safety net. 16 Such income-generating activities should be distinguished from safety nets that generate income or income proxies in the form of wages or in-kind remuneration, such as public works programmes. These types of safety nets are discussed below. 17 See Hobley and Paudyal (2008) for a critical, evidence-based, assessment of income- generating activities in Nepal. 25 Social protection and safety nets Table 1: A typology of safety nets Broad type of safety net Objective Examples Typical beneficiaries Features and attributes Generic Country examples Social transfers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed9a1583-c609-4581-bb73-e959ed81b02e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed9a1583-c609-4581-bb73-e959ed81b02e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca5ba978c2a5bdaee1a58b54d0dbf21735b69bf12f06e77c776ed01aaa47b466"}, "3": {"node_id": "9264424e-c6f3-4819-9821-fa5dc0f0fd38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2154729f9e6027dab9eb42e1e62588bd5cfada87fee9a3ac1eebf673dd1fcd3e"}}, "hash": "007da80c642076c63d6d8c76ddcea754819128996f5165fce81dc17ec2a2da84", "text": "Aimed at boosting the incomes of poor and vulnerable people or providing them with free or subsidized access to food and/or other basic consumption items Cash (or near cash) transfers (non-contributory pensions, food vouchers, disability and child allowances) Nepal \u2013 pensions, child grants, single women\u2019s allowances Disabled Elderly Children \u2022\ufffdUsually categorical and unconditional; not inevitably pro-poor and subject to inclusion of non-poor; rights-based \u2022\ufffdEasy to administer \u2022\ufffdAssume that beneficiaries will spend allowances on food or basic services \u2022\ufffdNot well suited to highly transient poverty \u2022\ufffdRelatively high fiscal burden and low level of benefits per recipient In-kind transfers (school feeding schemes, provision of food supplements) World Food Programme-funded programmes Poor households Children \u2022\ufffdDirect benefits meet basic needs \u2022\ufffdInflexible benefits \u2022\ufffdOrganizationally complex \u2022\ufffdOften include non-poor General subsidies (for food, fuel, housing, utilities) South Africa \u2013 municipal water utility subsidies; Middle Eastern and many Asian countries \u2013 energy and food subsidies Poor households (but also many others since e.g. fuel subsidies will benefit all with a vehicle) \u2022\ufffdOften include non-poor \u2022\ufffdMay not reach the poor (especially fuel and utilities subsidies) \u2022\ufffdMay create market distortions \u2022\ufffdOften politically motivated 26 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Broad type of safety net Objective Examples Typical beneficiaries Features and attributes Generic Country examples Income- generating schemes 1.

Box 3: Non-contributory pensions and other social assistance in Nepal There are relatively few unconditional and universal safety net programmes in the Asia-Pacific region, probably because such schemes are usually assumed to be unaffordable to low-income countries. Despite being one of the poorest countries in the region, Nepal has a publicly funded (non- contributory) old-age pension scheme that is intended to be unconditional and universal19 \u2013 all people over the age of 70 are entitled to receive a monthly pension of NRs 500, or US$ 7 (delivered in three instalments every year), with a lower eligibility age (60) for Dalits throughout the country and all citizens in the Karnali region.20 18 DFID UK (2005). 19 For more detailed descriptions and analyses of Nepal\u2019s old-age pension and other safety net programmes, see Ayala (2009); HelpAge (2009); Holmes and Upadhya (2009); and, World Bank (2004). 20 Dalits are low caste. The five districts that make up the Karnali region are considered the poorest in Nepal. 29 Social protection and safety nets In addition to the old-age pension scheme, Nepal also operates three other unconditional cash transfer programmes: one for all unmarried women over the age of 60 (NRs. 500/month); one for all household members of a number of \u2018endangered\u2019 ethnic groups (NRs 500-1,000/month); and one for the fully and partially disabled (respectively NRs 1,000 and NRs 300 per month). Recently, the Government introduced a child grant of NRs 200/month for a maximum of two children (aged 0-5), for which all households in the Karnali region and all poor Dalit households are eligible. Finally, the Government recently decided to provide cash transfers to all poor single women under the age of 60. These safety net programmes are fully funded from the Government\u2019s budget; the total cost of the old age pension scheme in 2006/07 (before it was significantly expanded by the Government in 2008/09) represented about 0.23 percent of gross domestic product. Nepal\u2019s old age pension scheme is implemented through the local government system, with Village Development Committees (VDCs) being responsible for enrolment, registration and payments. Of the various social assistance schemes, the non-contributory pension is the best documented. A number of aspects of Nepal\u2019s safety net for the elderly can be highlighted: \u2022\ufffd First, it is a relatively rare example of a safety net that is largely administered by local governments. As such, it provides a window through which to assess decentralized safety net implementation. \u2022\ufffd Second, while it is clear that non-contributory pensions do reach the poor, their universal nature and intrinsic characteristics imply that there are large exclusion and inclusion errors. In other words, many of the poor do not benefit and it is not just the poor who do benefit: \u201cThe correlation between poverty and age in Nepal however is not a strong one ... the exclusion rate of the poor [is high] due to the high age limit and low life expectancy of the poor.

VDCs do not always receive enough funds to provide universal coverage and are thus obliged to screen out (or, inversely, target) beneficiaries in non-transparent ways.

This amounts to a form of social transfer. The use of IBTs as a way of subsidizing municipal water supplies for the relatively poor has been criticized on a number of grounds: \u2022\ufffd The IBT subsidy misses its mark, given that many poor households are not linked to the billable water supply system, and rely instead on wells, surface water and other sources for their water needs. The IBT subsidy can, therefore, be seen as redundant. \u2022\ufffd For political economy reasons, the upper limit of the first block is often set at a level that benefits not only the poor (who do not consume much water), but also a good proportion of the middle class (who consume a great deal more water). If that is the case, then IBT systems are subject to a significant inclusion error. \u2022\ufffd Because poor households may have shared connections to the water supply system, with several families using the same metered outlet (thus pushing consumption levels into the second or subsequent tariff blocks), they may actually pay more (per unit) for their water. If several households are sharing a metered connection and an IBT is in effect, water use by the group of households can quickly exceed the volume in the initial block, pushing water use into the higher priced blocks. To the extent that households sharing water connections are more likely to be poor than households with a private, metered connection, the IBT will have precisely the opposite effect from that intended: the poor will pay higher average prices for water than the rich. Municipal IBTs in the water supply sector underline the classic problems associated with all systems of pro-poor subsidization: they may not actually benefit the poor, and \u2013 more often than not \u2013 they also benefit many of the non-poor.

The objectives are typically: (i) to create wage employment and provide cash incomes or in-kind remuneration to workers (focusing on employment creation, unemployment insurance or a minimum level of income guarantee); and (ii) to build or maintain public infrastructure (roads, soil and water conservation measures, flood control bunds, etc.), thus contributing to poverty reduction in the longer term. The importance of these two objectives varies considerably from programme to programme. Some of the salient features of public works programmes are: \u2022\ufffd They are usually self-targeting, in that the wage levels offered are intended to be attractive only to the poor, although there are important exceptions, as noted in box 5. Thus, most public works programmes do not require a parallel targeting process; \u2022\ufffd Public works programmes are typically accessible only to the able-bodied poor, and to poor households that have \u2018spare\u2019 labour. Households headed by women or composed of the elderly or disabled may not be able to benefit from workfare schemes; \u2022\ufffd Public works schemes are relatively costly as instruments for delivering transfers to the poor, both in terms of the costs of non-labour expenditures on construction sites and in terms of planning, supervision, monitoring and the like; \u2022\ufffd There is often an innate tension between the infrastructure delivery purpose of public works schemes and their employment provision purpose. This may lead to two types of compromise: on the one hand, low quality or inappropriate infrastructure (where employment is the overriding consideration); and, on the other, lower levels of labour intensity (and thus less employment) because funds are used on non-labour items in an effort to ensure the quality of infrastructure; \u2022\ufffd Public works schemes can be relatively robust instruments for dealing with transient or seasonal poverty, and also lend themselves to geographical targeting. Boxes 5 and 6 provide examples of public works (or workfare) programmes in Ethiopia and South Asia. 32 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Box 5: Ethiopia\u2019s Productive Safety Net Programme Ethiopia\u2019s national Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) is one of the largest social protection instruments in Africa and one of the biggest programmes of its type in the world.

The programme, which began in 2005, operates in four of Ethiopia\u2019s regions, with pilots in two others. The vast majority of PSNP resources (approximately 85 percent) are provided as payment for participation in public works, with the remainder used to provide direct support to poor households without access to adult labour. The latter category of beneficiaries is effectively provided with an unconditional cash or in-kind transfer. Households receive PSNP benefits (cash, food or a combination) during the lean season, from January to June each year. The public works component of PSNP provides seasonal employment to poor households. The types of public infrastructure that are built or maintained are identified through a bottom-up, community-based planning process. Woredas (or districts) and Kebeles (aggregations of villages) play an important role in facilitating this process: in aggregating community priorities, in design and costing, and in drawing up Woreda-wide plans and budgets. This is an important linkage between PSNP and local government. PSNP workfare is targeted in two ways: \u2022\ufffd To areas that are chronically food insecure (generally the Highlands); \u2022\ufffd Unlike most other workfare programmes (which rely on self-targeting), PSNP actively targets the households that provide labour for public works activities, through a process of community-based identification of the poorest households with able-bodied labour. This targeting process is heavily facilitated by Woredas and Kebeles. The rationale for this is that: (i) in such chronically poor and food-insecure areas, very limited employment opportunities do not discourage people from taking part in public works \u2013 even at a very low wage rate; and (ii) there is a limited potential to lower the wage rate to a point where it would result in self- targeting, since doing so would compromise the objective of meeting the food needs of beneficiary households. The members of targeted households provide five days of labour per month (for each member of the household) and are eligible to receive a transfer equivalent to 15 kilograms of cereals (in cash or as food). Those benefitting from direct support receive the same level of transfer as those who participate in public works activities. The choice of cash or food depends largely on the availability of grain in local markets \u2013 where local markets are unable to deliver food supplies, the food transfer option is used. There is, therefore, flexibility in the use of food/cash as transfers. There are two noteworthy features of PSNP: 33 Social protection and safety nets \u2022\ufffd The programme provides direct support for chronically food-insecure households without labour, such as the disabled or elderly. It therefore combines workfare with cash transfers; \u2022\ufffd PSNP is explicitly linked to the Household Asset Building Programme, which aims to help poor people graduate from extreme poverty. Through the asset building programme, PSNP beneficiaries can access small-scale and low-interest credit (to acquire carts, livestock, extension packages) and training. PSNP beneficiaries are thus able to build household assets, as well as avoid depleting their existing assets.

Box 6: Public works programmes in South Asia Although there are examples of public works programmes throughout the Asia-Pacific region, the best known are in South Asia. India and Bangladesh in particular have long-standing traditions of employment-based safety nets. In India, one of the best known public works programmes is the State of Maharashtra\u2019s Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS), which began in the early 1970s, largely in response to severe drought and the need to provide poor rural labourers with off-season employment. The EGS has been one of the largest employment-based public works programmes in history: \u201cThe Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS) is a massive, long-term, slowly evolving public programme, deeply institutionalised in the politics, public finances and public administration of a state that had a population of 79 million people in 1991.

NREGA (which was strongly influenced by Maharashtra\u2019s EGS) has a number of key features:23 22 See Moore and Jadhav (2006). 23 See the NREGA Operational Guidelines (3rd edition, 2008). 34 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd The Act provides a legal entitlement of 100 days employment (in a financial year) to every household whose adult members volunteer for unskilled manual work.

It is a nationwide programme; \u2022\ufffd Wages paid through NREGA are set at the minimum wage rate and paid either on a piece or daily basis; \u2022\ufffd At least 50 percent of works to be carried out are expected to be implemented by Gram Panchayats (local governments); Panchayats at district, block and gram levels are intended as the \u201cprincipal authorities for planning and implementation\u201d of NREGA-funded works, thus making NREGA the first major public works programme that vests significant resource control at the local government level; \u2022\ufffd The kinds of public works that are to be financed are largely linked to soil and water conservation, afforestation, irrigation and flood control; \u2022\ufffd A 60:40 wage-to-material ratio has to be maintained and contractors/ machinery are not supposed to be used; \u2022\ufffd The central Government is expected to finance all wage costs of unskilled manual labour and 75 percent of any material cost including the wages of skilled and semi-skilled labourers. The sheer scale of NREGA is daunting: in 2008/09, for example, a little over 45.5 million households requested employment and just over 45 million were actually provided with employment. On average, beneficiary households were provided with about 48 days of employment in 2008/09, with some 6.5 million households benefitting from 100 days employment. Expenditure on wages in 2008/09 amounted to roughly US$3.64 billion.24 Bangladesh also operates a number of cash and food-based employment schemes. One of the better known was the Rural Maintenance Programme, which began in 1983 and ran until 2006. On an annual basis, the Rural Maintenance Programme provided some 42,000 poor but able-bodied women with year-round employment, working as Road Maintenance Associations (of 10 women) on 10-kilometre stretches of earth road. Wages were set at the going daily rate for farm labour. Women were selected for inclusion on the basis of specific criteria (e.g. size of landholdings, widowed or separated female heads of households). Union Parishads (local governments) were involved in the planning and management of road maintenance activities.

These programmes were largely pioneered in Latin America, but are on the rise in Asian countries as well. CCTs seek to reduce both immediate income/consumption poverty and inter-generational poverty by promoting household investments in human capital. CCTs almost invariably rely on some kind of targeting to identify beneficiaries. Targeting methods vary from simple geographical targeting (e.g. rural areas only), to community-based targeting, to the use of more sophisticated methods, such as proxy means testing or outright means testing. Typically, cash transfers are made on the condition that targeted households ensure that their children attend school or that household members (especially women and children) regularly use local preventive health care services.

In 1994, FSP became a nationwide programme. The programme aims to: (i) increase school enrolment among secondary-aged girls; (ii) improve the secondary schooling completion rate for girls; and (iii) increase female age at marriage. FSP provides a uniform stipend and tuition subsidy for each girl attending a secondary school in rural areas on condition that they: (i) attend 75 percent of school days; (ii) attain some level of measured academic proficiency (45 percent of class-level test scores); and (iii) remain unmarried. Although not without its critics, FSP is seen as contributing significantly to the enrolment of girls in secondary schools. Recent figures indicate that girls\u2019 enrolment \u2013 primary and secondary \u2013 is now about equal to that of boys. The net 25 And its pilot predecessor, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction scholarship programme for secondary school girls. 26 FSP has evolved over time and is made up of a set of Government and donor-funded projects and components. For details, see World Bank (2006); Raynor and Wesson (2006); and, Khandkeret al (2003). 36 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable secondary gross enrolment rate is 45 percent for boys and 47 percent for girls (as of 2003). In 1991, girls accounted for only 33 percent of total secondary school enrolment; by 2005, girls accounted for 56 percent of total enrolment. FSP (which provides support to well over 2 million girls every year) is a major expenditure item, accounting for more than 60 percent of the country\u2019s secondary school development budget and about 13 percent of the total education sector budget. In Cambodia,27 the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) scholarship programme provided girls from poorer or socially disadvantaged families with cash transfers (for three years) on condition that they made the transition from primary to secondary school, scored passing grades and were not absent from school \u201cwithout good reason\u201d for more than 10 days. The JFPR programme began its activities in 2003, covered 15 percent of Cambodia\u2019s lower secondary schools and provided scholarships to over 4,000 girls. Impact assessments indicate that the programme increased enrolment and attendance rates at eligible schools by roughly 30 percentage points. Moreover (and as a result of the programme\u2019s screening process), scholarship recipients were, on average, of significantly lower socio-economic status than non-recipients. In short, JFPR impacts have been largest among girls who come from poorer households, have parents with less education, and live farther away from a secondary school. The JFPR approach has since been scaled up through Cambodia\u2019s Education Sector Support Programme, one component of which aims to provide girls and boys from poorer households with scholarships for junior secondary school education. Results to date indicate that scholarships have a large impact on attendance rates. Results also show that slightly more generous scholarships (US$60/year) are not as cost effective as standard scholarships ($45/year), but that scholarship recipients were doing no better than non- recipients in terms of learning. There is also evidence that the scholarships are relatively progressive, but that the programme does not appear to consistently reach the poorest and also includes a large number of the non-poor.

Safety nets: three frequently asked questions This subsection looks at some of the questions that are often raised about social assistance in general. Safety net programmes are not without sceptics. Are safety nets affordable in developing countries? Publicly funded safety net programmes cost money. Can low-income, developing countries afford to spend scarce fiscal resources on social assistance? How costly are safety net programmes? Costs vary depending on a range of variables, including coverage and size of transfers. If a safety net programme were to systematically cover all poor households, costs would be high: \u201cFor example, consider the extreme case of Ethiopia, where annual per capita income is about US$100.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6741e57-f594-4faf-9bec-bf3d9ed390d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6741e57-f594-4faf-9bec-bf3d9ed390d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "773e133d7e289b5017502670dbc27b19be68a8c4b7bea236d2fefe64dcc7b303"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa7b15bb-4edf-4ce6-9f3e-9ebdc74be145", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2339ec9850a12a8a5e25617a748ea264fdee3b2d9d63e6269bd33ff6c5615dd1"}}, "hash": "4d342a307328e3c39f0a8b53889d9b06919d7503c1b0218c2a6f210af4a7438d", "text": "To provide adequate food for all the inhabitants whose consumption is below the food poverty line would require an annual expenditure of about US$810 million \u2013 12 percent of GDP, or about one-third of all public spending.\u201d28 In reality, of course, social safety net programmes would not be expected to include all the poor \u2013 but only a proportion of the poor and vulnerable.

The ILO study indicates that a basic social safety net package is, in principle, affordable in low-income developing countries. The key issue, however, is not so much the cost of safety net programmes relative to gross domestic product (GDP), but their cost relative to other public expenditure items. Public spending on safety net programmes is a policy choice, and money spent on safety nets is money that cannot be spent on other public expenditure items. However, this is not a categorical \u2018either/or\u2019 question. Safety nets can be funded as well as other services and investments: the large welfare states in Europe do not fund social protection instead of education or infrastructure, but in addition to them.29 Public funding for safety nets is a question of policy priorities \u2013 and thus very much dependent on the specific political context, although the scale of funding will depend on the overall availability of fiscal and other resources, as well as overall economic stability. 28 World Bank (2009c). 29 Ibid 38 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Box 8: International Labour Organization estimates for social security in low-income developing countries The ILO\u2019s cost estimate30 study for national social security expenditures is based on a social protection floor consisting of the following elements:31 Universal old-age and disability pensions, provided to all people over the age of 65 and all working age people with serious disabilities. Such transfers would amount to 30 percent of annual per capita GDP; Basic child benefits, paid to up to two children (below the age of 14) per mother; with cash or in-kind transfers set at about 15 percent of per capita GDP; Universal access to essential health care, based on the supply-side provision of essential health care services; Social assistance employment scheme, provided to those households that do not receive pensions or child benefits, with payments for 100 days work/ year on the basis of a maximum wage of US$1/day. According to the ILO, the initial annual cost of such a basic social protection package is estimated to be in the range of 3.7 to 10.6 per cent of GDP (at 2010 prices), depending on the country. Of the 12 countries included in the estimates, six (all in Africa) would spend more than 6 percent of GDP. Essential health care constitutes the largest cost component in the total social security package in most of the countries in the study. To put these estimates in perspective, the total public expenditure (as a percentage of GDP) of the countries included in the ILO study range from a low of 14.1 percent (Bangladesh) to a high of 29.8 percent (Viet Nam). Education sector expenditures (as a percentage of GDP) vary from a low of 2.2 percent (Tanzania) to a high of 7.0 percent (Kenya). As such, a \u2018basic\u2019 or \u2018floor\u2019 social security package would cost considerably more than is currently spent on social security by low-income countries, which rarely spend more than 3 percent of GDP on health care and rarely more than 1 percent of GDP on non-health social security measures.

Box 9 summarizes the World Bank\u2019s thinking on the subject of financing safety net programmes. 30 See ILO (2008).

Prime examples of this type of approach are workfare and CCT programs. \u2022\ufffd In very low-income countries, international assistance may be used to finance social assistance. Indeed, there is increasing willingness on the part of donors and countries to use aid in such ways.\u201d Source: World Bank (2009c). There are, however, also important political economy dimensions to be taken into account when discussing the affordability of safety net programmes. These are discussed below. Do safety nets generate perverse incentives? Social safety nets may generate perverse incentives and lead to suboptimal outcomes. The most frequently cited concerns relate to the labour market and population growth. With respect to the labour market, cash transfers may discourage people from seeking wage employment (because they have access to cash transfers and consequently do not need employment income) or may encourage households that are not eligible to work less in order to become eligible for benefits. With respect to population growth, cash transfers may encourage people to have more children to gain more child benefit grants. There are also other potentially perverse incentives that can be generated by safety net programmes, mainly linked to the way in which people might behave as a consequence of them. 40 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Safety nets can be designed to counter these perverse incentives or minimize potentially perverse outcomes. With respect to the labour market and to child benefits, social safety net programmes in developing countries effectively mitigate against perverse incentives in a number of ways, including: \u2022\ufffd By providing modest or limited transfers to beneficiaries. Cash or in-kind transfers thus complement, rather than substitute for, the earnings of able-bodied recipients. \u2022\ufffd By targeting categories of people (the old aged, people with disabilities, etc.) who are unlikely to work anyway. \u2022\ufffd By \u2018capping\u2019 the cash transfer (as in Nepal, where the new child grant is only paid for a maximum of two children per mother). \u2022\ufffd Through workfare programmes, by providing the able-bodied poor with employment opportunities that are made available at below or equivalent to minimum wage levels. \u2022\ufffd By ensuring that receiving benefits from one programme does not disqualify households from eligibility in another programme. \u2022\ufffd By ensuring national standards and norms for levels of benefit so as to mitigate against \u2018welfare migration\u2019 (see below). \u2022\ufffd By providing incentives for households or individuals to graduate from safety net programmes. \u2022\ufffd By being transparent about the objectives of given policies, allowing criticism, funding independent research and remaining attentive to ongoing policy review and improvement. On the other hand, there is little in the way of empirical evidence to demonstrate that cash or in-kind transfers lead to such perverse outcomes. Indeed, evidence from South Africa points to the opposite: that the members of households benefiting from cash transfers (in the form of pensions and child grants) are more active in seeking employment than people in households that do not receive cash transfers.32 Similarly, Mexico\u2019s Oportunidades programme (previously known as Progresa) might be expected to discourage work. Oportunidades provides cash transfers to poor rural families in Mexico, conditional on their participation in health and nutrition programmes, as well as their children\u2019s school attendance. By 2004 the programme reached nearly 5 million families, providing an average (and significant) monthly payment equivalent to 20 percent of household spending on consumption. Although a programme providing such relatively large transfers to so many households might be expected to discourage work, a recent impact evaluation33 shows that the programme has had no significant effect on adults\u2019 choices regarding work, in both eligible and non-eligible households. 32 See Samson (2006). 33 See Skofias and Di Maro (2008). 41 Social protection and safety nets Are safety nets politically acceptable, and if so, in what form? Are safety nets \u2018politically\u2019 or \u2018ideologically\u2019 acceptable and, if so, in what form? Because publicly funded safety nets almost always imply some kind of redistribution between the wealthier and the poorer, they are usually subject to political debates concerning their appropriateness. In some countries, for example, there are deeply entrenched views about the \u2018undeserving able- bodied poor\u2019 and the extent to which the poor can expect to receive \u2018handouts\u2019 from the state. In such cases, there may be political imperatives for restricting safety net programmes such as cash transfers to a small number of the manifestly disadvantaged (the old, orphans, the disabled), to exclude the able-bodied poor,34 or to deliberately target the able-bodied poor on the grounds", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81d333b9-7a2c-4d90-93f5-12dc7aba203e": {"__data__": {"id_": "81d333b9-7a2c-4d90-93f5-12dc7aba203e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3560f52af31ea542a9c519b0d8dade43a7f91049bc00c7b88ec52373ac32d2bc"}}, "hash": "3560f52af31ea542a9c519b0d8dade43a7f91049bc00c7b88ec52373ac32d2bc", "text": "that they are more likely to graduate. In other countries, safety net programmes are often designed on a highly categorical basis (e.g. non-contributory pensions for all people over a certain age, irrespective of their level of poverty or well-being), on the grounds that this is less socially divisive or more politically acceptable than a more targeted approach. Although political economy issues are often set aside in technical discussions about social assistance and specific types of safety nets, they cannot and should not be ignored. 3.2.5. Safety nets: some key issues Experience over recent years has shown that the selection, design and implementation of safety net interventions usually require a good deal of thought about some key issues. A non-exhaustive set of the more important issues is briefly discussed in this subsection. Exclusion and inclusion errors Safety net programmes are subject to exclusion and inclusion errors with respect to the way that they provide the poor (or non-poor) and vulnerable with social assistance. Exclusion can have two dimensions: exclusion resulting from implementation, and exclusion by design. The first concerns the extent to which the people who are intended to benefit from transfers actually do so. A safety net programme that aims to assist poor families with children of a given age but which \u2013 in practice \u2013 only provides transfers to a small proportion of such families, is one with a high exclusion error. CCTs are sometimes thought to have high exclusion errors, partly due to their use of selective targeting mechanisms (which may not identify all the poor) and partly because their use of conditionalities may be \u2018punitive\u2019 for certain poor households. 34 See ODI (2009g). 42 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable A second, and less commonly discussed, dimension of exclusion is the extent to which a given safety net programme excludes large numbers of the poor or vulnerable by design. Public works programmes, because they require people to provide manual labour in exchange for wages, usually exclude poor households that do not have spare, able-bodied labour (e.g. women-headed households, households headed by the disabled). Non-contributory pensions face the same type of exclusion error \u2013 by definition, poor households that do not include the old do not benefit from pension payments. Inclusion errors occur when a given safety net programme provides benefits to the non-poor as well as the poor. Means-tested or targeted safety net programmes are often thought to have an inclusion error due to badly designed or poorly implemented targeting mechanisms \u2013 community-based targeting is sometimes seen as especially prone to inclusion errors. \u2018Universal\u2019 cash transfers are certainly subject to significant inclusion errors. The provision of child grants to all households with children 0-5 years old, for example, will almost inevitably include a good proportion of non-poor households. No safety net programme, whether by design or through implementation, is likely to be free of exclusion or inclusion errors. The challenge, of course, is to find ways of minimizing such errors and in particular, avoid systematic errors. Although the aim would be to minimize both types, it is often difficult to minimize both at the same time, and priorities must then be set. Exclusion errors, for example, can be reduced by introducing robust grievance mechanisms through which the excluded can press their claims for inclusion, or by increasing the number of poor people who would be eligible to receive transfers. Inclusion errors can, in theory, be reduced by some form of targeting or by making eligibility conditions unattractive to the non-poor (as in public works programmes, where wage levels are set low or in apparently universal schemes that require time- consuming registration procedures, such that the transaction costs are high enough to discourage the better-off from applying). Targeted approaches and universalism There has been much debate about the relative virtues and drawbacks of deliberately targeting the poorest. Targeting has the theoretical advantage of providing social assistance benefits to a smaller number of people: when only the poorest quintile of a population receives benefits, there is either a potential for cost savings or a potential to increase the level of transfers (so as to have a greater impact). Targeting is intuitively appealing. However, targeting can be administratively costly and may result in higher transaction costs for potential beneficiaries. Furthermore, targeting is never 100 percent accurate, and may not be socially or politically acceptable. These issues need to be carefully thought through in deciding whether or not to use targeting within a safety net programme.

Effectiveness in reaching the poor can vary greatly with the country context, overall poverty rates and the percentage of the poor that is supposed to be targeted. More effective in excluding the non-poor than categorical or universal targeting. Implementation errors Can become easily politicized and hijacked by local elites. Communities have more accurate information about the characteristics of beneficiaries but they might not be interested in revealing it. Depending on the number and nature of proxies selected, implementation is often challenging and requires well-trained personnel. Community cohesion Can create community consensus and buy-in or lead to community conflicts if decisions are not unanimous and influenced by community leaders. Can upset community cohesion if criteria are too manifold and difficult for beneficiaries to understand. Political acceptance Depends to what extent communities are trusted with this task and how narrowly the programme is targeted. Depends on the political regime and how narrowly the programme is targeted. Very narrow targeting might translate into less political acceptance by the middle class and subsequently lower benefits, while a stronger pro- poor focus might equally reassure the middle class of greater social stability. Perverse incentives Community selection process is not just based on household assets and income that is visible and can therefore be open for other non- neutral criteria for selection. Lower potential as a multitude of criteria cannot be so easily manipulated by beneficiaries. Stigmatization Potentially high if classification is discussed and agreed upon by all community members. Higher than categorical targeting as programme is more narrowly targeted to the poor, but potentially less than with community-based targeting as the poor are not directly selected by fellow community members. Costs Usually chosen because of the lower costs of employing community structures to carry out the targeting exercise instead of a government officer or external person; but costs are often transferred to the community. Depending on the nature of standardization and follow-ups, administration could become more complex and expensive. Depending on the number and nature of proxies selected, administration can become quite complex and expensive. Source: adapted from Sch\u00fcring (2010). 44 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Self-targeting can be a powerful alternative to administrative targeting. Examples of self-targeting include setting wages at a low rate; implementing public works programmes, which are usually attractive only to the poor; and subsidizing particular commodities (such as yellow maize, red sorghum or coarse cereals in some countries), that are likely to be consumed only by the poor. However, the use of this particular method is largely limited to public works programmes and it only works if the market wage is equal to or close to the minimal wage. In contrast to targeting, universal/categorical approaches (which provide social assistance to socio-demographic categories, or categorical targeting within which there are likely to be significant numbers of poor people) are often seen as administratively simpler, less costly to manage, subject to fewer exclusion errors, and in many (but not all) countries more socially and politically palatable. In addition, a commonly used argument in favour of providing the service to all is that the middle class may be more prepared to contribute through taxes if they also will receive part of the benefit. Universal/categorical approaches may, however, be more costly in terms of the overall size of transfers (because of larger numbers of beneficiaries); may result in lower levels of transfer per recipient (in order to reduce the overall fiscal burden); and are subject to greater inclusion errors (everybody within a given socio-demographic category benefits, and not just the poor). Universal/categorical approaches are also subject to exclusion errors because poor people who do not fall into the particular category of eligible beneficiary (e.g. the non-old in the case of pensions) are not eligible. In addition, in some countries, universal and categorical approaches may not correspond to prevalent political views, which may favour targeting as a better way of tackling entrenched economic inequalities. Furthermore, some categorical approaches, such as making cash transfers available to particularly disadvantaged castes or ethnic groups, may not only entrench social identities, but may also actually promote identity politics in ways that can be divisive in the longer term.35 Finally, universal programmes will, by design, provide a higher level of income to all, including the non-poor; hence they are unlikely to reduce the overall gap", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b56b4fed-ccc5-4796-9310-417ccbc35e3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b56b4fed-ccc5-4796-9310-417ccbc35e3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5449007f2bb05fdf3b7c0aedd9872d5562a2e050a2fa7e0a39c2d160ed5f914f"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a53b1b9-94c0-4632-8489-d190272daa9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e799345c53211edba5dc27f56df6d9c3827485405318cb015cfb43b471bdf2d3"}}, "hash": "fe6bd791a52c99aba72fdff7ec6d67fb0b95a3c56d18554535db17ab7bbb07c3", "text": "between different income strata of the society, unless they are combined with a very progressive taxation system. Conditionalities There has been an increased interest in CCT programmes in developing countries over the past 15 years. The role of CCT programmes in social policy varies from country to country and consequently CCT design, coverage and 35 The case of unconditional cash transfers to Dalit households in Nepal is perhaps one example of this (Neil Webster, personal communication). 45 Social protection and safety nets content differ a great deal. The key idea with CCTs is that payments are made to the beneficiary or household on the condition that those households invest in the human capital of their children in certain pre-specified ways usually linked to the use of educational or health services. Some programmes require that households receiving transfers comply only with either health or schooling conditions, while others require that households comply with both in varying forms. CCT programmes usually target their beneficiaries rather narrowly to the poor through a combination of geographic and household targeting (mostly via proxy means testing) and/or community-based targeting. The use of conditionalities in safety net programmes is the subject of much debate. CCTs, in particular, are seen by many as unethical, inequitable, of limited added value and costly to administer and implement. The conditionalities may seem punitive or unethical in a number of respects. It may not be possible for households to comply, for example, with school attendance conditions due to factors that are outside their control, such as distant or non-existent schools or cultural precepts about schooling for girls.36 CCTs tacitly assume that the supply side (accessible schools, proximate health services) is adequate. If, for example, there are no readily accessible schools, a school enrolment and attendance conditionality becomes highly punitive for poor households and effectively excludes them from any cash transfers. Furthermore it could be added that the conditionalities are merely focused on access (attendance) rather than on the quality of the service and actual desired goal, which is children learning something worthwhile. Some would argue that CCTs are generally not appropriate in low-income, developing countries, given that such supply- side constraints are relatively common in such countries. Moreover, is it fair to impose compliance with behavioural conditionalities on the poor? Finally, CCTs can be seen as costly since they require relatively sophisticated monitoring of compliance with conditions. On the other hand, conditionalities may well be a way of encouraging households to invest in the future, rather than focus entirely on current and pressing consumption needs. Although available evidence shows that both unconditional cash transfers and CCTs have a positive impact on human capital outcomes, the outcomes are stronger for the CCTs.37 For example, there is evidence that CCTs contribute to improved school enrolment and attendance rates among the children from recipient households, however, it is difficult to determine whether this is a direct impact of the conditionalities themselves or simply the cash transfer. At the same time, there is not much evidence that CCTs lead to better educational or health-related outcomes. For example, children 36 Workfare, which is a type of conditional cash transfer, is also sometimes seen as unethical: Why make poor people work to access social assistance? 37 World Bank (2009b). 46 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable from families that receive conditional cash transfers do not appear to do better at school than other (non-beneficiary) children.38 The evidence is inconclusive. Finally, in some countries, CCTs may be politically appealing: many observers of CCT programmes believe that the use of conditions has been important in garnering political support and that this has resulted in much larger social assistance budgets than would otherwise have been the case. In discussing CCTs, it is also important to look beyond the overt behavioural conditionalities (e.g. school attendance) and take a more nuanced approach, as illustrated in box 9. Box 9: Dimensions to conditionalities \u201cWhile most conditional cash transfer around the world focus on conditionalities in the area of education and preventive health care services, conditionalities vary considerably in the way they are designed and implemented. Eight broad dimensions can be identified, along which conditionalities differ: 1) the time when they are placed (ex-ante vs. ex-post conditionalities), 2) how explicitly they are mentioned (direct vs. in-direct conditionalities), 3) whether there are any exemptions to the conditionalities (conditionalities for all vs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a53b1b9-94c0-4632-8489-d190272daa9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a53b1b9-94c0-4632-8489-d190272daa9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5449007f2bb05fdf3b7c0aedd9872d5562a2e050a2fa7e0a39c2d160ed5f914f"}, "2": {"node_id": "b56b4fed-ccc5-4796-9310-417ccbc35e3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe6bd791a52c99aba72fdff7ec6d67fb0b95a3c56d18554535db17ab7bbb07c3"}}, "hash": "e799345c53211edba5dc27f56df6d9c3827485405318cb015cfb43b471bdf2d3", "text": "for a sub-group), 4) whether they are tied to output or outcome (activity vs. results-oriented conditionalities), 5) whether they are tied to the entire welfare payment or to a supplementary transfer (conditionalities as a \u2018stick\u2019 vs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7103aab-fba3-43dd-93fe-8a261facf316": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7103aab-fba3-43dd-93fe-8a261facf316", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "006c43ec84b0d15b0175bb2c6ddc4ad5544c7187dae628653039525a7ce32e47"}}, "hash": "006c43ec84b0d15b0175bb2c6ddc4ad5544c7187dae628653039525a7ce32e47", "text": "a \u2018carrot\u2019), 6) how often beneficiaries have to comply with them (regular vs. once-off conditionalities), 7) to what degree they are monitored (regular monitoring vs. spot-checks) and 8) finally enforced (punitive vs. developmental vs. soft conditionalities).\u201d Source: Sch\u00fcring (2010). Cash or in-kind transfers? Over time, safety net programmes have increasingly relied on cash \u2013 rather than in-kind \u2013 transfers. Cash is easier to manage and provides beneficiaries with greater choice in terms of consumption. However, a reliance on cash transfers as a way to bolster consumption assumes that markets function reasonably well and that basic commodities are available and affordable. It also assumes that the cash is spent on items that will improve the overall welfare of the household. This may not always be the case. To counter this, there is an overall trend to provide cash benefits to a female member of the household; by giving control of the cash to a female it is assumed that it is more likely to be spent on items that are in the interest of the child/children and the household as a whole. 38 See World Bank (2008) \u2013 Filmer and Schady (Cambodia ESSP study). 47 Social protection and safety nets In-kind transfers \u2013 typically food \u2013 are generally more costly to manage than cash transfers. Safety nets involving in-kind transfers must handle the logistics and costs of moving bulky commodities, which typically results in a limited number of distribution points (and thus potentially higher transaction costs for beneficiaries). On the other hand, in-kind transfers may be the only option in the case of market failures or in situations where food price inflation is high (thus eroding cash purchasing power). Administrative costs Safety net programmes differ in terms of their administrative costs, and these differences are sometimes used to argue in favour or against particular types of safety nets. The general consensus is that public works programmes are the most costly types of safety net to manage and implement. They usually require expenditures (e.g. equipment, skilled labour) other than wages for manual labour, as well as a good deal of expenditure on planning, design and costing, and technical supervision. Programmes that use in-kind transfers are also likely to be more costly than cash-based transfers since they often involve high transport and distribution costs. Relatively simple, unconditional/categorical cash transfers tend to be the least costly types of safety net programme. CCTs, on the other hand, may require significant up front expenditure during start- up \u2013 but may become more cost-efficient over time, as they are expanded and capture economies of scale. Comprehensive safety nets In a good deal of the readily accessible documentation on safety net programmes, there is a tendency to discuss \u2018options\u2019 in terms of stark binaries, as \u2018either/or\u2019 rather than as \u2018and/or\u2019. This sometimes appears almost ideological and doctrinal. A more balanced approach39 would be to conceptualize an overall safety net made up of several programmes, each of which aims to provide social assistance to specific socio-demographic groups, and each of which, correspondingly, may opt for appropriate (albeit different) approaches to do so. Given the spectrum of poor and vulnerable people \u2013 the chronically poor, the transient poor and the particularly disadvantaged \u2013 a pluralist approach is more than reasonable. 3.3. Summing up and setting the stage Safety net programmes can and do make an invaluable contribution to poverty reduction and the attainment of the MDGs. They should be seen as a major plank in any poverty reduction strategy and as especially appropriate for the very poor 39 This is the perspective in the World Bank\u2019s For Protection and Promotion (2009c), which presents a balanced approach to safety nets. 48 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable and highly vulnerable. But safety net programmes should be seen as a set of inter-linked programmes making up an overall social protection framework in any given country. Safety net programmes should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a wider policy and service delivery system. This discussion paper also argues that each of the three major categories of social safety nets described in this section has its own more or less distinctive objectives and target groups, and the decision to focus on one or the other, or a mix of them, depends on what each country is trying to achieve with its social protection initiatives. Turning to issues related to the delivery of safety nets as public services \u2013 especially defining and distinguishing between subnational and national service delivery functions \u2013 it is analytically helpful to categorize safety nets according to two dimensions,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "920556b9-7a8a-4b4c-a5a7-32b03eef1f94": {"__data__": {"id_": "920556b9-7a8a-4b4c-a5a7-32b03eef1f94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7dc4c053e2d23df8ec125589d27bbcc0c38fd5d5907390cad920689b532e523"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2c07c03-2e1c-43a6-8b1a-a4e3d93f6779", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7c47f14f7cc833ab343ee16d41c3af5c920cef599915015a62fca72f97b20ac"}}, "hash": "a1bbf413b9e1f1760624c60db48678f539ded2083cdeb9ff6f76bc5f72da8006", "text": "focussing on conditionalities and access.40 The combination or mix of these dimensions has different organizational and institutional implications. The two dimensions are: \u2022\ufffd The extent to which safety nets are conditional or unconditional. Virtually all safety net programmes involve some degree of conditionality, but this can vary from simple residency or nationality requirements (the minimum condition for virtually all safety nets) to the more complex conditionalities of CCTs. As conditions become more demanding or more stringent, transaction costs usually increase for both beneficiaries and safety net programmes themselves. The challenge becomes making a reasoned judgement as to whether higher transaction costs (which may translate into higher administration costs) are worthwhile given the added benefits or value- added outcomes resulting from more conditions. \u2022\ufffd The extent to which safety nets are universal or targeted. The universal/ targeted dimension is relative to poverty. A (more or less) universal safety net programme is one that is not administratively targeted at the poorest or poorer, but at a socio-demographic category that may include varying numbers of poor people, but exclude others. Targeted programmes, on the other hand, explicitly focus benefits on poorer households or individuals. Both approaches have their virtues and drawbacks. It is fair to say that the more targeted the approach, the greater the effort needed to implement it \u2013 although the increased effort may pay off in terms of efficiency and poverty reduction gains. Figure 2 tries to capture different safety net programmes in view of both these dimensions. It provides a typological framework within which to compare different programmes and approaches, and is intended to facilitate analysis and discussion. 40 There are clearly other ways to compare safety net programmes. The dual dimensions used in here are nonetheless important for the purposes of highlighting local versus national issues. 49 Social protection and safety nets Figure 2: A two-dimensional typology of safety net programmes As safety net programmes become more targeted and conditional, they tend to become more complex. Hypothetically, transaction costs increase in the same way. More complex programmes with higher transaction costs may involve more functions and subfunctions than simpler safety net programmes. As discussed in section 4, this may mean that they provide more space for more actors (including local government) to become actively involved in implementation. For the purposes of this publication, it is important to note that publicly funded safety net programmes are one among many public services, which \u2013 like all public services \u2013 involve a wide range of functions and subfunctions in their delivery (e.g. setting policy, defining standards, financing, planning, beneficiary selection, monitoring and evaluation, payments, etc.). In other words, safety net programmes can be \u2018unbundled\u2019 into a range of interrelated but analytically distinct activities. These activities may be handled by a single institution (such as a government ministry), but may also be assigned, based on comparative advantage, to different institutions, organizations and levels of government.

Through deconcentration, decision- making authority and financial and management responsibilities are distributed among different levels of the central government. It can shift responsibilities from central government officials in the capital city to those working in regions, provinces or districts. Alternatively, deconcentration can create a strong field administration or local administrative capacity under the supervision of central government ministries. The staff are accountable to the centre and the regional /local administration have no or very limited discretion about how the services are provided, and no independent revenue source. In other words, the regional/ local agencies are seen as service delivery arms of the centre. Delegation is a more extensive form of decentralization. Through delegation, central governments transfer responsibility for decision-making and administration of public functions to semi-autonomous organizations/bodies that are not wholly controlled by the central government but are nonetheless accountable to it. Governments delegate responsibilities when they create public enterprises or corporations, housing authorities, transportation 41 See Tidemand and Steffensen (2010), upon which this paper bases its typology of decentralization. 52 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable authorities, special service districts, semi-autonomous school districts, regional development corporations and special project implementation units. They may also delegate functions to local governments. Usually these organizations have a degree of discretion in decision-making. However, the centre can withdraw and overrule the decisions of the agencies/ local governments/ organizations at any time. Devolution occurs when governments transfer authority for decision-making, finance and management to quasi-autonomous units of local government with corporate status. Devolution usually transfers responsibilities for services to local governments that have elected mayors and councils, raise their own revenues and have independent authority to make investment decisions. In this model, local governments are expected to be accountable to the local electorate. Local governments are given responsibilities and financial means, typically within certain national levels and ceilings, to determine the scope and quality of services to be provided, and the source and the size of funds to finance the delivery of those services. In a devolved system, local governments have clear and legally recognized geographical boundaries over which they exercise authority and within which they deliver public services. In its pure form, this type of decentralization provides local governments with significant autonomy. The following table compares these three forms of decentralized service delivery across a range of aspects.

Local authorities have own staff, but operate under a national framework; considerable discretion in hiring, firing, size of establishment etc. May also use seconded staff of central government, who are treated essentially as local authority staff.

In 54 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable practice, they can often overlap \u2013 particularly with regard to delegation and devolution, where a delegated functional task may be subject to relatively loose central government control and guidance and thus can blur into a more or less limited degree of devolution. Moreover, when service delivery is unbundled into different functions and subfunctions (e.g. financing, planning, setting norms, procurement, payment, etc.), there can be a mix of delegation and devolution, depending on the function or subfunction. In discussing safety net programmes as a service delivery function, these distinctions should be remembered, as seen below. 4.2. Local governance and local governments 4.2.1. Local governance \u2018Local governance\u2019 (as opposed to \u2019local government\u2019) refers to the ways in which local-level decision-making is carried out. The term \u2018good local governance\u2019 is more normative, and implies that decision-making in the arena of local public affairs is \u2013 to varying degrees \u2013 participatory, rule-bound, open and transparent, and subject to scrutiny and oversight by citizens. Local governments are merely one dimension (albeit an important one) to local governance as a whole. 4.2.2. Local governments \u2018Local governments\u2019 are formal institutions, mandated to deliver a variety of public goods42 and services at the local level. In a sense, they constitute the local state. The assignment of service delivery responsibilities to local governments is largely predicated on the principle of subsidiarity, which suggests that government functions should be assigned to the lowest level of government that is capable of efficiently undertaking those functions. In essence, if a small local government can efficiently provide pre-school services, then it should \u2013 according to the subsidiarity principle \u2013 be assigned that responsibility. Application of the subsidiarity principle generally results in a situation where, as far as possible, the area where the benefits of a public good or service are felt coincides with the jurisdictional boundaries at each level of government. For instance, since national defence benefits citizens throughout the national 42 Or \u2018merit goods\u2019, such as education or drinking water. The rationale for public funding of theoretically private goods like drinking water, education or curative health services is that not only do they generate large positive socio-economic externalities that benefit the community and the nation, but they will not be adequately supplied to the poor by the market. Basic health, education, water, infrastructure and services are termed \u2018merit goods\u2019 because they are private goods that society judges to be worthy of subsidizing with public funds. 55 Decentralization and local governance territory of a country, this expenditure function should be a national one, funded by the central government. However, since the benefits from a local park are mostly felt by local residents, the responsibility for local parks should be placed with local governments. Making judgements about what local governments should (and should not) do is largely linked to considerations about economies of scale and externalities. Local governments in the Asia-Pacific and Africa regions vary considerably across a range of dimensions. Recognizing this is fundamentally important when looking at the role of local governments in addressing social protection (and, indeed, any other service delivery) issues. There are a number of ways in which local governments and arrangements for them differ, including: \u2022\ufffd Population size. Local governments can vary greatly in the size of their population. This certainly applies across countries. For example, Vietnamese provinces, with an average population of around 1.5 million, are vastly different from Bhutan\u2019s Gewogs (or blocks), with an average population of about 3,500. Even within a given country, local government units with the same formal status can vary considerably in size. In Nepal, districts in the Terai floodplains often have populations ten (or more) times larger than districts in the mountainous regions. And in multi-tiered systems (see below), different levels of local government are very different in terms of the size of their populations. Ugandan districts, for example, have an average population of around 450,000, as compared to Ugandan subcounties, which average about 30,000. \u2022\ufffd Tiers.

Urban local governments are usually characterized by high population densities, rapidly growing populations, relatively vibrant cash-based economies, and constituencies with relatively high levels of education and access to sometimes considerable own-source revenues. Rural local governments, on the other hand, tend to have low population densities, lower population growth, agrarian economies, lower education levels, and a highly constrained fiscal base.43 43 Some of the differences between rural and urban local governments are discussed in more detail in UNCDF (2004). 56 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd Mandates and functions. The assignment of functional responsibilities to local government also varies significantly, both across countries, between different tiers and within the same tier (urban versus rural municipalities) within the same country. This partly reflects differing population sizes, but also different decentralization policies. Communes in Viet Nam, for example, have very limited mandates compared to the districts and provinces of which they are a part. In Sri Lanka, on the other hand, decentralization policy is such that the \u2018third tier\u2019 of local government (Pradeshiya Sabhas and municipalities) has very few functions or powers compared to line departments or provinces. There are also instances where local governments, by design and on a more or less formal basis, only deal with one issue or function, such as education or watershed management.44 Of particular relevance here is the extent to which local governments are mandated to undertake/administer social protection or related functions (such as vital registration). In some countries (e.g. Nepal), local governments are legally mandated to provide both vital registration and social protection services; in others (e.g. Mali) they may only have an official mandate to provide vital registration services. \u2022\ufffd Resources. The degree to which local governments have access to both human and financial resources is highly variable (partly as a consequence of all of the above). Communes in Cambodia and Union Parishads in Bangladesh, for example, have access to very limited fiscal resources and typically only have one full-time staff member \u2013 in marked contrast, say, to some municipalities and most districts in Nepal. The extent to which local governments are dependent on transfers from the centre, as opposed to own-source revenues, also varies. Urban local governments tend to have access to greater own-source revenue bases than rural local governments, although in almost all cases, urban and rural local governments are largely dependent on intergovernmental fiscal transfers from the centre to finance their service delivery and administrative functions. \u2022\ufffd Downward accountability and devolution. There is another key dimension across which local governments vary considerably: the extent to which they are downwardly accountable and representative. In some cases \u2013 such as provinces and districts in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Zilas in Bangladesh \u2013 downward accountability is extremely weak, largely because there are no elected local bodies at those levels. In other cases, downward accountability can be muted or constrained by the overall political context (as in one-party states such as Viet Nam) or by electoral arrangements (e.g. indirectly elected councils). In others, such as Union Parishads in Bangladesh or communes in Cambodia, there is a greater degree of downward accountability due to the existence of freely elected local councils. But even 44 Especially well-known in North America, where many local governments are single purpose (e.g. school districts, soil and water conservation districts). 57 Decentralization and local governance where formal representational arrangements are in place at the local level, other factors can increase or decrease the degree to which local governments are downwardly accountable. \u2022\ufffd Centre-local relations. A final dimension across which local governments vary is the nature of their relationship with central or national government. In some countries, such as Bangladesh, local governments are subject to robust ex ante controls by the centre; in others, such as the provinces in Vietnam,45 the centre exerts remarkably little real control over local governments and their actions. In yet others, such as Nepal, the centre exerts a degree of control through ex post mechanisms. There is a world of difference, then, between small, rural local governments (such as Bhutan\u2019s Gewogs) and large metropolitan municipalities (such as Bangladesh\u2019s City Corporations), both in terms of the kinds of challenges they face and their ability to deal with them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceb2bcec-3344-4553-b8e0-027f3acbdd3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceb2bcec-3344-4553-b8e0-027f3acbdd3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5261cf28e26a95989fe4f7bdccf89950138e12dde8c86d120962f1d5e428744"}, "2": {"node_id": "12cfbb73-9c63-4166-908f-07dd158e13d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb4a9b52158e37c5371f9b4082264dac88ab962ea6b10c93f9a1109b797a9c97"}}, "hash": "df16db1d58e333f73ce9f815472e08ee2a6c8080649462023102a44d88c09bfa", "text": "Large provincial governments 45 This appears counter-intuitive in a single-party state, but is attested to by an abundant literature on centre-local relations in Viet Nam.

Often the size of small countries, provinces may include populations of several millions and cover large geographical areas. They are often vested with significant policymaking, fiscal and regulatory powers. They also differ significantly in terms of their constitutional status. While some constitutions create de facto or de jure federal systems, which may be more or less decentralized, others institute guarantees for decentralized local autonomy and self-government. Others still create special status areas, such as autonomous provinces, which deserve particular attention if they are politically, ethnically, religiously, socially or geographically distinct from the larger country, but depend nevertheless significantly on central transfers to carry out social policies such as social safety nets. 4.3. Going local: Implications for safety net programmes Why is it important to acknowledge that decentralized service delivery can take different forms and that there are often significant differences between local government structures and systems? Recognizing that service delivery can be decentralized in different ways is important. There is a commonly held view that unless a function is devolved, it is not decentralized. This position presents a very limited view of decentralization, since decentralized services can be deconcentrated or delegated, with local level units enjoying varying degrees of autonomy and discretion. All local government systems include a mixture of various forms of decentralization, even within a given service category (such as education). \u2018Going local\u2019, then, does not always mean devolution. Service delivery responsibilities need to be unbundled into functions and subfunctions, some of which may be decentralized to a varying degree, others of which will be better kept under central control. It is thus not an \u2018either/or\u2019 issue, but an \u2018and/or\u2019 one. In discussing safety net programmes, it is thus crucial to understand that not all aspects of safety net management or delivery are (or should be) decentralized, and that many aspects are (or should be) subject to centralized arrangements. In addition, there is a choice with respect to the kind of decentralized arrangements that can apply to safety net functions, which can best be described as deconcentrated, delegated or devolved, depending on which type of decentralization seems most appropriate. Acknowledging that local government characteristics, structures and systems vary both within any given country and across countries is also important in thinking about the interface between safety nets and local governments. In multi-tiered systems, for example, it might make sense to assign different safety net functions and subfunctions among upper and lower tiers of local government, as well as central government. It should also be clear that some safety net functions can be appropriately assigned or delegated to small 59 Decentralization and local governance local governments while others simply cannot. The same goes for larger local governments, which may be better suited to ensuring some functions, but not others. In short, there is no one-size-fits-all formula. Defining an appropriate set of decentralized arrangements or functional assignments will vary from country to country, and \u2013 within each country \u2013 will vary from tier to tier. Neither decentralization nor local government, then, are one-dimensional. And, as will be discussed in chapter 4, nor are safety net programmes, which need to be unbundled into their constituent functions and subfunctions if they are to be meaningfully and helpfully decentralized. The next section examines the interfaces between local governments and social protection mandates. 61 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets This section discusses the actual and potential interface between safety net programmes and local government/governance. This discussion is the heart of this discussion paper, has the most implications for local governance practitioners, in general, and for UNCDF, in particular. For the purposes of this publication, publicly funded safety net programmes are conceptualized as one among many public services, which, like all public services, involve a wide range of functions and subfunctions. In other words (and very much like other public services) safety net programmes can be unbundled into a range of interrelated but analytically distinct activities that may be handled by a single institution, but may also be assigned to different institutions and organisations, depending on their comparative advantage. It is precisely by looking at safety net programmes in terms of their nuts and bolts that the role of local government in delivering such services becomes clearer. Broadly speaking, this section tries to unbundle safety net service delivery functions into the following broad categories: \u2022\ufffd financing; \u2022\ufffd setting policies, parameters and norms; \u2022\ufffd implementation (i.e. management and administration).

Connecting the dots between the various services that local governments may be responsible for providing can be important in improving social safety net services (for example, by linking an education-focussed CCT to capital investments and recurrent expenditure so as to expand coverage and enhance educational outcomes). Cross-cutting local governments and local- level arrangements are probably better placed than \u2018vertically\u2019 organized central government departments with responsibility for a particular area or location, rather than a sector, and ministries to strengthen and establish such inter- sectoral linkages and complementarities (see section 4.4.). 62 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Looking at safety nets from a service delivery perspective also highlights accountability issues. By conceptualizing the beneficiaries of safety net programmes as the users (or clients) of safety net services, it becomes appropriate to examine the dynamics and nature of their relationship with service providers \u2013 something that is routinely done for all local government service delivery functions. Conceptualizing safety nets as public services also opens up room for a rights-based approach to social assistance, whereby safety net benefits are anchored in the rights of citizens to access public services and are not seen as hand-outs to the needy. This approach underlines the need to establish mechanisms for ensuring accountable public institutions for delivering safety net services. Finally, this section examines whether and how local governments add to the overall architecture of a social protection package (of which safety net programmes are a part), and how their performance as managers of certain aspects of safety net programmes can be incentivized. 5.1. Financing issues 5.1.1. Who can (or should) finance safety net programmes? General considerations Quite clearly, safety net programmes cost money. Can local governments be expected to finance safety net programmes out of their own revenues? How far can and should the local level be involved in financing issues? In general, theory and evidence suggest that central (rather than local) government should bear the preponderant responsibility for funding safety net programmes, whether or not they are implemented locally. In low-income, developing countries, there are at least five good reasons why central government should shoulder most, if not all, of the cost of safety new programmes. First, local government financing of safety nets raises distributional and equity issues. Local governments in the poorest regions of any country are likely to have the most need of safety net programmes, but a very weak revenue base with which to finance them. In contrast, wealthier jurisdictions, where the need for safety nets is less severe, are better able to finance them. Box 10 provides evidence of this disparity from Eastern and Central Europe. Moreover, as Romania shows, it is not just the poorest municipalities that find themselves stretched and unable to deliver safety net services when central government transfers cease. In fact, most municipalities are likely to be affected. 63 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets Box 10: Decentralized financing of social assistance in Central and Eastern Europe \u201cIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, decentralized financing mechanisms have resulted in substantial interregional disparities in coverage, with poorer localities providing the fewest services. In the face of resource constraints, eligibility criteria for most benefits are ad hoc, as local welfare offices use discretion when rationing available resources. These sorts of regional inequalities in social assistance can be particularly troubling when they are linked, as they so often are, to ethnic or other social divisions.\u201d \u201cIn 1995, Romania introduced Social Aid, a last-resort social assistance program. During its first year of implementation, the central government\u2019s budget financed the program, while implementation was decentralized to local governments. The program covered about 10 percent of the population, a figure close to the estimated number of extreme poor. During 1996\u20132001, the responsibility for program financing was transferred to local governments, with no extra resources transferred from the central government budget. The program\u2019s caseload plummeted to 6 percent of the population in 1996 and 2 percent in 2001, with the highest reductions in number of beneficiaries occurring in the poorest municipalities. Two key factors behind the program\u2019s collapse were the inability of the poorest municipalities to pay eligible applicants and unclear legal provisions about the nature of the program. The central government altered and clarified program rules, but the finance problem and poor performance persisted until the program was recentralized in 2003.\u201d Source: World Bank (2007a). Indeed, this has been a problem in many formerly socialist transition countries \u2013 not only in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in Central and East Asia, where central governments have tended to transfer responsibility for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8967ae0d-2008-4c24-8776-871dff27a698": {"__data__": {"id_": "8967ae0d-2008-4c24-8776-871dff27a698", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "272343ded3e4eaef9b94e3349ef8c8564dd21c41f757d6ad0b24403c0d69d132"}}, "hash": "272343ded3e4eaef9b94e3349ef8c8564dd21c41f757d6ad0b24403c0d69d132", "text": "funding and managing sometimes extensive safety net programmes to local governments without providing adequate financing. As a result, the effectiveness and equitability of these programmes has deteriorated in some countries. Second, local governments should not bear a significant share of the burden of financing safety nets because of the problem of \u2018welfare migration\u2019. If local governments are responsible for financing their own safety nets (and in determining levels of benefits), those most in need of benefits may migrate to jurisdictions where benefits are most generous. Although there is little empirical evidence of this, it clearly concerns policymakers and local constituencies \u2013 as box 11 shows. Such perceptions are important and should be taken into consideration during the design. 64 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Box 11: Mitigating \u2018welfare migration\u2019 Brazil\u2019s CCT programmes \u2013 in the beginning... Features of the early, municipally funded, CCT programmes in Brazil underline concerns (whether grounded or not) about welfare migration. The first two CCT programmes were launched in two Brazilian municipalities in January 1995: Bolsa Escola in the Distrito Federal, and the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Program in the Campinas Municipality. These became models that multiplied in many municipalities and states in Brazil. By 2001, over one hundred municipalities and many states were operating local CCT programs in Brazil. Most such programmes included minimum residency requirements (five years) in the municipality or state, out of fear that the lack of a national programme would attract poor migrants to their jurisdictions. Source: World Bank (2007b) Interlinked to the perceived problem of welfare migration is another problem: self-financing by local government may result in a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019. In this scenario, generous local governments, faced with an influx of those in need of safety net services, would have to reduce the levels of benefits to avoid an ever-growing fiscal burden. Under self-financing arrangements, regions with generous safety net schemes would face rising costs and an increasingly narrow financial base, as the poor moved in and the wealthier moved out to avoid footing the fiscal burden associated with financing safety nets. The end result would be a gradual decline in levels of benefits all around.46 There is some empirical evidence in OECD countries for this concern: \u201cThe results of our study confirm that adequate social assistance benefit levels indeed are not attained in countries with entirely decentralised social assistance regimes, but rather in countries with mixed systems or limited forms of devolution. In OECD countries where social assistance programmes are organised entirely at the regional or the local level, guaranteed minimum income is invariably below the poverty line. By contrast, countries where the involvement of local authorities in the administration (Netherlands) and/or funding (Denmark, Germany and Finland) of social assistance is substantial, yet restricted under central legislation or guidelines, the level of basic rates and housing allowances for social assistance recipients is invariably adequate. In Denmark, Germany and Finland, the municipal authorities actually enjoy quite a large degree of autonomy: municipalities are able to adjust social assistance benefit levels to local needs and requirements because they can decide quite independently on 46 See Van Mechelen and De Maesschalck (2007). 65 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets entitlement to and the levels of supplementary benefits towards covering the cost of heating insurance and the like. Yet the national regulation with regard to rate-setting prevents the municipalities from providing the poor with \u2018poor\u2019 benefits.\u201d47 Experience from OECD countries strongly suggests that while some degree of local discretion over and financing of safety nets can be present, central government needs to prescribe minimum levels of benefits if the poor are to be provided with adequate support. Third, safety nets often require \u2018counter-cyclical\u2019 funding \u2013 i.e., increases in safety net expenditures at precisely the time when the overall economy is shrinking and fiscal resources are declining. Local financing of safety nets would be especially vulnerable to this, while central or national financing would generally be better able to cope with counter-cyclical stresses. This is particularly true when economic downturns or crises are localized. Subnational governments in these localities may face a fiscal crunch at critical moments, severely constraining their ability to provide citizens with safety net services when they are most needed. Central government funding, on the other hand, can draw on a larger, nationwide, pool of resources and thus smooth over localized fiscal deficits and funding gaps. Fourth, local governments are not well-placed to finance safety net programmes particularly in low-income developing countries, where most local governments have narrow and weak own-source revenue bases (whether due to economic circumstances", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aeb2e9c2-8fee-4297-b528-176d77d171e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "aeb2e9c2-8fee-4297-b528-176d77d171e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2961b75f1c3e8f1dbd75c3bdcc2b3b181e1cf6c4f7b6e61d6a4efe8100b48a33"}}, "hash": "2961b75f1c3e8f1dbd75c3bdcc2b3b181e1cf6c4f7b6e61d6a4efe8100b48a33", "text": "or by law) and are dependent on intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Under these circumstances, it would be unrealistic to expect local governments to finance safety net programmes out of their own revenues. Given that safety net programmes may be relatively costly as a proportion of total public expenditure and GDP, it would be very unlikely that local governments could afford to cover safety net expenditures out of their own-source revenues. In fact, even in the United States, one of the financing issues facing state governments is the state-local sharing of Medicaid expenditures (medical care for the poor). The federal government sets the minimum conditions but pays only a portion of the costs of this social protection service. During the recession, more families have become eligible for the programme, which has added greatly to states\u2019 fiscal stress. Fifth, central governments should be expected to finance locally managed and locally implemented safety net programmes where local governments are legally mandated to provide such services. In these cases, it is incumbent upon central governments to ensure that safety net services are financed, on the basis of the general principle that mandates should not be unfunded. Among 47 Ibid. 66 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable OECD countries, Norway is a good example of this principle: the local level has essentially full discretion to deliver safety net services within a framework of nationally predetermined parameters, with central government fully funding the services provided. In sum, central government is generally better-suited to finance safety nets. National governments are better able to assume a redistributive fiscal role, can set minimum benefit levels and standards across the country, and have a much more substantial revenue base from which to finance safety net programmes. That said, local governments might be expected to co-fund safety nets with their own revenues as a way of securing local buy-in and increasing overall resource levels (see box 12). To avoid redistributional or equity problems, co-funding should be kept within limits and well regulated. The issue of local co-financing of safety net programmes requires careful thought. If too much latitude is allowed, wealthier jurisdictions would be able to significantly increase either the number of people covered or the size of cash transfers. This might result in the kind of inequitable outcomes and externalities that are associated with pure local financing. Box 12: Local government co-funding of safety net programmes NREGA, India India\u2019s NREGA (a public works programme, see above) takes an interesting approach to local government co-funding. Under NREGA arrangements, central government finances all of the costs associated with the payment of wages to manual labourers, but state and local governments are expected to finance up to 25 percent of the costs of any materials and skilled or semi- skilled labour. In principle, this achieves three important ends: (i) it provides a 100 percent funding guarantee for unskilled labour (which is what the poor would be expected to provide), the wages for which are regulated by the Act; (ii) it ensures that the central government contributes up to 75 percent of other public works expenditures (which are usually needed to add value to unskilled labour); and (iii) it allows local governments to contribute to what might be seen as non-essential expenditures. Source: NREGA (2008) Programme for a Guaranteed Minimum Income in Brazil During the 1990s, in the early phases of CCT experimentation in Brazil, the Programme for a Guaranteed Minimum Income provided co-financing for municipal safety net schemes. This programme was managed by the Ministry of Education and provided transfers to municipalities that were implementing CCT programmes but lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Programme support was to be gradually expanded, prioritizing the poorest municipalities, with the ultimate goal of covering all municipalities 67 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets and the Federal District of Bras\u00edlia. The municipalities had to contribute at least 50 percent of the financing to receive federal support for their cash transfer programmes. As such, the Programme for a Guaranteed Minimum Income was not a CCT programme in and of itself, but rather a mechanism for providing financial support to municipalities to enable them to implement such programmes. It should be emphasized that poorer municipalities were targeted, with programme funds used as \u2018top-up\u2019 grants.

Financing modalities Fiscal transfers Based on both empirical and public finance considerations, the consensus is clear with respect to the financing of public safety net programmes: central government needs to play a preponderant role in funding. This should not be seen as a reason for excluding local governments from any involvement in safety net programmes. Were that the case, local governments in developing countries would not provide very much at all in the way of public goods and services, many of which are routinely financed through fiscal transfers from central government. As long as appropriate intergovernmental fiscal transfer mechanisms are in place (as there often are for funding other local government functions, such as education, infrastructure and health), then local governments can play a role in the management, administration and implementation of safety net programmes, seen as an integral element of their service delivery responsibilities. The issue is not whether local government can finance safety net programmes, but how and under what circumstances locally implemented safety nets are best financed through the fiscal transfer system. 68 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable For the same reasons that local government funding of safety net programmes out of own-source revenues may not yield satisfactory outcomes, entirely discretionary funding of locally implemented and designed safety net services is not a sensible financing option. Unconditional block grants for local governments, financed by central/national governments, would tend to operate in much the same way as own-source revenue financing, and perhaps lead to suboptimal outcomes. Where local governments have access to entirely discretionary resources, they may well have few political (or electoral) incentives to use them to fund safety net programmes in appropriate ways. If local governments were expected to finance safety net services out of their untied block grant allocations, some (perhaps many) would choose not to, but to invest instead in other types of service, such as infrastructure. In some local jurisdictions, addressing issues related to poverty and vulnerability may not be high on the list of political priorities \u2013 whereas public expenditure items such as investments or services that primarily benefit the middle classes might well be. For redistributional and equity purposes, safety nets managed by local governments require some kind of earmarked or ring-fenced financing mechanism. In most countries with multilevel safety net programmes, financing is passed from the national level to subnational units using some form of earmarking. This ensures that the subnational units provide a minimum safety net, which is consistent with the reasons for financing safety nets at the national level. Targeted financing arrangements National policies may target a particular problem in a particular area, and they are often in a better position to channel additional funds to meet these policy objectives. Geographically targeted financing arrangements provide a good example since these allow for financing of locally managed safety net programmes to devote funds to especially poor or vulnerable areas. Although central government financing of local government public works programmes is often geographically targeted (e.g. NREGA in India over its first few years, the Programme for a Guaranteed Minimum Income in Ethiopia, Trabajar in Argentina), other safety net programmes can also be targeted. This is the case in Nepal (see box 3), where the age threshold for non-contributory pensions is 60 in the very poor Karnali region, but 70 elsewhere in the country. Similarly, Nepal\u2019s new child benefit system is geographically skewed in favour of the Karnali region, where all households are eligible for child grants (for up to two children per mother), whereas elsewhere only certain categories of household are eligible for child grants. 69 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets 5.2. Safety net policies and parameters 5.2.1. Overall policy and mandates Given the nature of the problems that safety nets are intended to address, and the general need for central government funding of safety net programmes, it follows that central (rather than local) government will usually play a preponderant role in defining broad social protection policies. This indicates that the decentralization of safety net programmes to local governments should be more of a delegated function, rather than a fully devolved function. Precisely what form such delegation takes is discussed below.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c51d09e5-686b-4424-893e-f9807baceb13": {"__data__": {"id_": "c51d09e5-686b-4424-893e-f9807baceb13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "131a055584887984477b5618dda4dd89ada9b800d77d10a57a579c5ce4ded16d"}}, "hash": "131a055584887984477b5618dda4dd89ada9b800d77d10a57a579c5ce4ded16d", "text": "There is clearly plenty of room for discretion at the local level, regardless of both the way in which safety net programmes are financed and the need for the national level to set overall standards and parameters. In line with section 3 of this discussion paper, this still amounts to decentralization in one form or another. In that respect, safety net programmes are not dramatically different from, say, education or health. Both the education and health sectors can be devolved, and partly financed locally, with local governments playing a major role in deciding the importance to ascribe to these sectors relative to others. Nonetheless, both the education and health sectors are usually subject to some kinds of national standards and financed largely through transfers from central government. As discussed in section 3, there is a fine and sometimes blurred line between devolution and delegation. In the case of safety net programmes, a relatively high degree of homogenization or standardization is needed, hence the general case for their delegation, rather than devolution, to local governments. 5.2.2. National standards and parameters There are good reasons why overall social protection policies and specific safety net parameters need to be centrally defined, and not left entirely to local discretion: \u2022\ufffd First, earmarked safety net transfers should not encourage local governments to become over-generous (at somebody else\u2019s expense) in the ways that they identify and target beneficiaries or set benefit levels. Central government needs to spell out who can benefit, on roughly what conditions, and at what indicative maximum levels. Unless such norms are established, some local governments would be tempted to inflate the numbers of beneficiaries or their benefit levels, secure in the knowledge that central government will foot the bill. \u2022\ufffd Second, and conversely, local governments should not be allowed to become overly stingy, by radically cutting back on benefit levels, systematically underestimating numbers of beneficiaries or applying excessively stringent 70 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable conditionalities. In Mexico, for example, there is evidence that local officials involved in the implementation of the nationally funded Oportunidades CCT programme have imposed additional conditionalities that have led to larger exclusion errors. The same criticism has been made of Peru\u2019s Juntos CCT programme, where some local officials have arbitrarily added conditionalities.48 5.2.3. Local discretion in setting standards and defining parameters That said, there is clearly room for some level of local discretion in setting standards and defining safety net parameters. Indeed, this may be desirable so as to ensure that appropriate safety nets are established. There are several examples of the circumstances under which such local discretion is useful: \u2022\ufffd In the case of public works programmes, local-level discretion is especially suited to: (i) identifying the types of infrastructure to be built; (ii) geographical targeting within given local government jurisdictions; (iii) deciding whether wages are paid in cash or in kind, as market conditions may vary from place to place; and (iv) setting (within limits) wage or transfer levels, so as to take into account local variations in wage rates in the labour market. \u2022\ufffd In the case of CCTs, local discretion may be required to identify locally appropriate conditionalities (within a well-defined menu of options), particularly where supply-side factors vary considerably from one jurisdiction to another. Thus, a local government that has better health services might be allowed to opt for health-related (rather than education-related) conditionalities. \u2022\ufffd In deciding on the types of benefits to be provided, local discretion may also be useful \u2013 in some jurisdictions, for example, it may be more appropriate to provide in-kind, rather than cash, benefits (e.g. providing cash transfers in or near to urban centres but food transfers in isolated communities far from markets, or paying higher benefits to urban residents where living costs are higher. Another important argument in favour of allowing a degree of local discretion is that this can foster experimentation and innovation. Heterogeneous and decentralized safety net implementation arrangements can provide a natural laboratory for new ideas and approaches, as is the case with Bolsa Familia in Brazil, where municipalities have been able to adapt their CCT programme to local service delivery systems (see box 13). The point is not to fully devolve safety net programmes to local governments, but to ensure that programmes do not eliminate the ability or latitude of local governments to try new approaches, 48 See Calder, Kidd and Samson (2010): unpublished manuscript. 71 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets either in entirely innovative ways, or by fine-tuning at the margins through some degree of discretion.

Box 13: Brazil Bolsa Familia \u2013 decentralized implementation as a natural laboratory for innovation \u201cDecentralization of various aspects of program implementation not only results in heterogeneous implementation practices, but it also promotes innovations at the municipal level. Indeed, many municipalities have used the BFP\u2019s [Bolsa Familia Program] role in horizontally integrating social policy (through the conditionalities and by linking BFP beneficiaries to complementary services) and in vertically integrating transfers (merging with sub-national programs, as discussed above) to experiment in the way they deliver the BFP and other services to the poor. In some ways, this decentralized context has created a sort of \u201cnatural laboratory\u201d for experimenting with integrated service delivery, higher benefit levels, additional conditionalities (some municipalities) and different approaches for monitoring and addressing the multidimensional facets of poverty and vulnerability.\u201d Source: World Bank (2007b). Providing local governments with varying degrees of discretion in deciding on safety net standards and parameters underlines the need for nuanced delegation to local governments \u2013 it is not always clear cut and can blur into devolution. This is especially (but not exclusively) true for workfare programmes. 5.3. Safety net management and administrative functions 5.3.1. Unbundling safety net programmes By unbundling or \u2018drilling down\u2019 through safety net programmes, a wide range of service delivery functions and subfunctions can be identified, some of which are best assured by higher tiers of government, others of which may be best managed by lower tiers. In general, when functions are subject to economies of scale, they are probably best allocated to higher tiers (central/federal, state/ province). 72 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable Table 4 provides an example of how safety net programme functions and subfunctions can be viewed at different political and administrative levels. The table illustrates that for a public works programme in India: \u2022\ufffd \u201cupstream\u201d functions (e.g. policy, audit) should be handled by higher levels of government (central, state); \u2022\ufffd \u201cmiddle order\u201d functions (e.g. social audits, awareness raising) are best left to intermediary tiers of the local government system (districts, blocks); and \u2022\ufffd \u201cproximate\u201d functions (e.g. beneficiary selection, identification and supervision of works, accounting and financial management) can be delegated to lower tiers of the local government system (subdistrict, village councils). There is nothing startling in this \u2013 it is fairly intuitive. But what is important to note is that the implementation of any given safety net programme consists of a variety of functions and subfunctions \u2013 and that these can be (and, in many cases, are) assigned to different levels of the intergovernmental system. In looking at the interface between safety net programmes and local government, there is a need to break down discrete functions and identify who is best suited to implement them. This also underlines the importance of intergovernmental understanding of procedures and division of responsibilities, which will make the system function as a whole. 73 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets Table 4: Functional analysis of a safety net programme and determining responsible levels of government \u2013 the Village Full Employment Programme in India Function Activity Responsibility Central State District Block Village council Village meeting Policy design, standards Implementation rules X X Targeting X X Budgeting X X Standards X X Planning Activity prioritization, action plan X X Activity selection X X Asset creation Human capital: Skill development X X Social capital: Information dissemination X Physical capital Public works X Operations Beneficiary selection: Identification of beneficiaries X X Awareness raising X X X Recurring activities: Provision of wages, food grains X Supervision and quality control X Personnel: Hiring and firing X Maintenance: Accounting and financial Management X Repairs X X Monitoring and evaluation Assets: Recording of assets X X X Physical verification of assets Created X Audits: Financial audits X Social audits X Source: World Bank (2009c). 74 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable 5.3.2.

The identification of beneficiaries for such categorical/universal transfers can be facilitated through the use of vital registration information, a service that many local governments routinely provide by mandate. Indeed, there is a clear interface between local government vital registration functions and the identification of beneficiaries for categorically targeted safety net programmes. Moreover, it often seems that the registration of beneficiaries for cash transfers may be easier at the local government level \u2013 especially among the lowest tiers of the local government system, which are highly proximate and with which local people frequently interact. However, this may not be the case for larger urban local governments, although compared to central national government they will still have a comparative advantage. In the case of more complex targeting procedures (e.g. proxy means testing, community-based targeting), local governments also have a role to play. For example, in large, nationwide, CCT programmes like in Brazil, municipalities are largely responsible for targeting poor beneficiary households, using centrally defined guidelines. But local governments may also be involved in both downstream and upstream aspects of any targeting process, as in Ethiopia\u2019s PSNP and as shown in box 14. Box 14: The Productive Safety Net Programme in Ethiopia \u2013 the role of Woredas and Kebeles in beneficiary identification As discussed in box 5, the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia actively targets the beneficiaries of both public works and direct payments. It does so by using a type of community-based targeting method, in which local governments (Woredas and Kebeles) play a significant role. At the Kebele level, the Community Food Security Task Force \u2013 composed of elected and unelected Kebele officials \u2013 is responsible for working with local communities to identify poor households that can participate in public works and poor households without enough labour, which will require direct support. 75 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets Community Food Security Task Forces are also involved in facilitating a participatory planning process aimed at identifying public works and overall monitoring of PSNP activities at the local level. Kebele Cabinets approve the lists of PSNP beneficiaries, on the basis of proposals submitted by the Community Food Security Task Force. Kebele and Woreda Councils and Cabinets provide oversight for the entire process. Source: Government of Ethiopia (2009). For example, in the case of the geographical targeting of public works programmes (identifying where infrastructure is required) and/or where pockets of vulnerability are located within their jurisdictions, local governments are likely to have a better idea than central government. In Ethiopia, this is very clearly one of the PSNP\u2019s operating principles, such that Woredas and Kebeles are almost entirely responsible for the planning of public works activities within their jurisdictions. There are three important (but surmountable) caveats with regard to the role of local governments in targeting and beneficiary selection : \u2022\ufffd First, many government officials and development practitioners are concerned about the possibilities of abuse and elite capture when local government is involved in beneficiary selection. While these concerns are understandable, the staff of line ministries or central agencies are just as likely engage in such abuse. The issue, then, becomes one of establishing sound monitoring and grievance systems (see below). \u2022\ufffd Second, because the funding of safety net programmes is almost certainly going to be the responsibility of central government, local governments may have incentives to \u2018over-identify\u2019 beneficiaries at no cost to themselves. This is less likely in the case of cash transfers that are categorically/universally targeted. There are limits to how far a local government can, for example, overstate the number of old people within its jurisdiction. It is, however, more likely in the case of more sophisticated targeting, which requires judgements to be made about whether certain people or households are eligible. In such cases, it is often assumed that local officials are likely to be more lenient and thus inflate the number of potential beneficiaries: \u201cIndividual social workers usually find it more gratifying to help than to deny assistance to applicants, and local communities will welcome the extra infusion of cash. This is not a case of corruption, but of providers reacting rationally to the incentives designed into the program.\u201d49 But again, there is no reason to suppose that central government officials are going to behave any differently than local government officials in this respect, pointing again to the need robust monitoring systems. 49 See World Bank (2009c). 76 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd Third, in the case of more sophisticated", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b51c42d4-f176-49f7-9864-3ac66abeb050": {"__data__": {"id_": "b51c42d4-f176-49f7-9864-3ac66abeb050", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62531a2c687b91460490416379efc8058d765144cddb1736a6423ed77cf9cec8"}}, "hash": "62531a2c687b91460490416379efc8058d765144cddb1736a6423ed77cf9cec8", "text": "targeting systems, it is often assumed that local governments will lack the capacity to use them properly, thus increasing the likelihood of exclusion and inclusion errors. Although this seems a reasonable concern, it should be clear that capacity is not immutable and that local government capacities can and should be strengthened over time. Enhancing that capacity will, of course, add to the costs. While these incremental costs ought to be covered by the centre, failure to do so will place an additional fiscal burden on the local government. A greater concern may be the lack of personnel attached to local government to absorb the work responsibilities of targeting and will need to be taken into consideration during a design stage. In general, the potential problems associated with local government involvement in the selection of safety net beneficiaries \u2013 while not to be underestimated \u2013 are neither specific to local government nor without solutions. With regard to the latter, a great deal hinges on the quality of monitoring and grievance systems. Moreover, beneficiary selection at the local level has two key advantages over a centrally controlled selection process. First, local government officials (elected or non-elected) are likely to know and be able to communicate with local citizens better, which may lead to more thorough and more accurate beneficiary selection. Second, and more important, citizens may be able to ensure that local government beneficiary selection is done properly simply because they can more easily raise issues with local (rather than national) officials and have those issues addressed. In developing countries, it is usually far easier to interact with local officials than with an anonymous and distant national bureaucracy. In sum, beneficiary identification and targeting can be delegated to local governments within the framework of centrally defined policy parameters. Where such processes are fairly simple (as in categorical/universal cash transfers), delegation to local governments would be relatively weak given that there would be little discretion in beneficiary selection. However, where such processes are more complex (e.g. deciding where to target public works programmes), then delegation would be stronger in the sense that local governments would be making decisions or judgements. 5.3.3. Payments and financial management In the absence of effective and widespread banking or financial services networks, local governments may be one of the few options for making manual cash payments to safety net beneficiaries. In Nepal, for example, VDCs are currently responsible for making all pension payments, as well as other categorical transfer payments. However, such cash payments are clearly not optimal and may result in high rates of leakage. Where possible, safety net payments are better made directly through the banking system or a third 77 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets party in order to minimize leakages or misappropriation. Payments to NREGA beneficiaries in India, for example, are either made through the banking system or through local post offices, rather than by local governments themselves. It is nonetheless important to note that even when a third party is used to deliver cash payments (as in NREGA), the local government remains responsible for identifying the beneficiaries of the scheme, supplying a payroll list to the payment service provider and authorizing payments. In cases where local governments are actively involved in the implementation of safety net programmes, they are also often responsible for financial management and reporting (as well as actual cash management). This is clearly the case in Nepal (where VDCs manually keep all accounts and provide their respective district treasuries with reports on cash transfers); in India (where Gram Panchayats are responsible for managing NREGA funds); and in Ethiopia (where Woredas are expected to manage PSNP funds and report on their use). 5.3.4. Monitoring and evaluation, information management Monitoring and evaluation and information management are key functions in the implementation of safety net programmes. To the extent that local governments are actively involved in safety net management, they will need to regularly monitor implementation (beneficiary identification/targeting, payments, termination, graduation, works, etc.) and, where necessary, provide reports on progress and actions. The Operational Guidelines for NREGA (India), for example, provide for a multi-tiered system of monitoring, with a range of local stakeholders and local governments being responsible for monitoring registration, payments, works and the like. Local governments can also be involved in information management. To facilitate the management of information, a social security management information system (MIS) is normally designed to automate the functions and processes of cash transfer programmes to ensure that they are well managed and delivered in an effective and efficient manner. For a cash transfer MIS to function properly it should meet the following", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61b471ea-8c84-4bf6-bb36-a2ebf7ab5c35": {"__data__": {"id_": "61b471ea-8c84-4bf6-bb36-a2ebf7ab5c35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8090bd18ab8e7318511eb0267f0f97ee9195ab679924f4901cfa79c77dd5e9c6"}}, "hash": "8090bd18ab8e7318511eb0267f0f97ee9195ab679924f4901cfa79c77dd5e9c6", "text": "objectives: \u2022\ufffd It should be linked to a central database or a single registry at the national level. This is a strategic integrated framework approach that acts as a basis for effective and efficient delivery in addition to allowing a country to consolidate information and beneficiary registers of all social cash transfer programmes. Input and data entry can be done at the local level by the local government. For safety net programmes, information management is the automatic capture, processing and reporting of beneficiary information from the point of view of targeting, enrolment, payments and case management. 78 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable \u2022\ufffd It should act as an enabler of accountability and controller of processes. MIS is an effective risk management tool. For example, lack of data cross-checks using common identifiers on vital registration systems could be resolved by putting in place a database that has a unique identifier per individual or common identifier (citizenship number) between the social security database and external providers of information, such as the Department of Citizen Registration. \u2022\ufffd It should build on a vital registration information system and be linked (through common identifiers) to national household surveys, educational MIS, health MIS, and other MIS. Considering their vital registration mandate and proximity to beneficiaries, it is reasonable to entrust local government with the core responsibility of managing the MIS, which ideally should be linked to national or regional databases. Many will argue that there is a lack of capacity at the local level to efficiently manage these systems; however, this is matter of capacity development \u2013 as with many other potential local government functions. Although information generated from the MIS should be used as a management tool at the local level, the overall evaluation of safety net programmes is unlikely to be a function of lower tier local governments, and is best handled by upper tier local governments or by central agencies. 5.3.5. Grievance and redress mechanisms Grievance and redress mechanisms are important to safety net programmes, not only because of the way they can enhance accountability but also because they can contribute to reducing exclusion-inclusion errors. They are also, by their nature, eminently local. Ideally, grievance/redress mechanisms should enable beneficiaries and non- beneficiaries of safety net programmes to bring their complaints to the attention of relevant officials empowered to properly and openly address them. With regard to safety net programmes, potential grievances include targeting (e.g. not being identified as a beneficiary or location of workfare programmes), difficulties associated with registration, issues linked to beneficiary payments, and others. Whether or not local governments are actively involved in the direct management of safety net programmes, they have a role to play (formally or informally) in the grievance/redress process. In Bangladesh, for example, there is anecdotal evidence that Union Parishads are frequently seen as the first level of recourse in any grievance process related to service delivery, even though this is usually informal.50 50 See CAPRi (2009). 79 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets More formally, Ethiopia\u2019s Food Security Programme (of which PSNP is a part) relies on Kebele Appeals Committees to hear and resolve appeals regarding safety net issues. Kebele Appeals Committees, in turn, are expected to inform Woredas of any grievances and how they have been dealt with. The Woreda presumably also acts as a second instance of appeal in the event that a \u2018plaintiff\u2019 feels that his/her Kebele Appeals Committee has not provided an acceptable solution to a grievance regarding PSNP. Woredas are also explicitly responsible for ensuring that the general public is aware of its rights vis-\u00e0-vis PSNP.51 Box 15 shows how the recent design of a social protection pilot in Nepal has incorporated local government into the grievance/redress process. It also shows how upper tiers (districts and the national level) of the intergovernmental system are expected to fit into that process. Box 15: Proposed grievance process for a cash transfer pilot in Nepal When beneficiaries experience problems in the targeting, registration, payment or graduation processes associated with the cash transfer pilot, they are encouraged to first raise the problem with the individual or committee that is in charge of the respective process. The different levels involved in the proposed grievance process are as follows: This proposed hierarchy of instances for any grievance provides dissatisfied \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 with recourse in the event that they feel lower level instances have not been responsive.

Connecting the dots \u2013 managing supply and demand52 As discussed in section 2.1.2, safety net programmes should be seen within the wider context of the supply and demand sides to social protection. Indeed, the UN\u2019s Social Protection Floor (SPF) encompasses both the supply and demand sides: \u201cThe SPF corresponds to a set of essential transfers, services and facilities that all citizens everywhere should enjoy to ensure the realization of the rights embodied in human rights treaties. By working on both supply and demand side measures, the SPF takes a holistic approach to social protection including: 1) Services: Ensuring the availability, continuity, and geographical and financial access to essential services, such as water and sanitation, food and adequate nutrition, health, education, housing, life and asset saving information and other social services. 2) Transfers: Realizing access by ensuring a basic set of essential social transfers, in cash and in kind, to provide a minimum income and livelihood security for poor and vulnerable populations and to facilitate access to essential services. It includes social transfers (but also information, entitlements and policies) to children, people in active age groups with insufficient income and older persons.\u201d (United Nations (2009): Social Protection Floor Initiative) Importantly, local governments can straddle both dimensions, in ways that are mutually beneficial. For example, if the aim is to establish a CCT for education but there are no schools in one area, the local government may be able to provide capital to build the school and cover its recurrent costs, rather than simply exclude that area from the CCT scheme. Indeed, many of the Brazilian municipalities that manage Bolsa Familia have deliberately used the latter to leverage innovations in their service delivery activities by adapting their health and education service delivery functions to the demand generated through the CCT. 52 Although demand-side issues are high on the pro-poor agenda, it is clear that there are different understandings of what they mean. This often stems from different disciplinary and institutional perspectives. Sector-centred studies focus on demand-side interventions in terms of creating better service outcomes, while people concerned with governance issues tend to focus on participation in decision-making and improved accountability. Rights-based approaches, on the other hand, stress citizenship and the entitlements that flow from it. 81 Decentralization, local governance and social safety nets Local governments are especially well-suited to match or articulate the supply and demand of social protection services. In many cases, they are explicitly mandated to provide both supply-side and demand-side services. Where this is the case, competent local planning and budgeting are required. But even where local governments may not have broad service provision mandates, they are usually expected to provide a framework within which coordination takes place. 5.5. Local accountability 5.5.1. Downward accountability \u2013 elections and local oversight Elected local governments are downwardly accountable through the ballot box, and most observers assume that local electorates will judge their political representatives on the basis of their performance, among other things. At the local level, the performance of elected officials is likely to be assessed in terms of the quality and effectiveness of service delivery. When safety nets are partly the responsibility of local government, citizens may factor the performance and quality of safety net services into their electoral decisions. There is robust empirical evidence from Brazil that mayors who preside over effective municipal safety net services are more likely to be rewarded by re-election: \u201c.. while, on average across [Brazilian] municipalities, the [Bolsa Escola CCT] program reduced dropout rates during the school year by 8 percentage points, there was considerable variation across municipalities. Municipalities governed by a first-term mayor eligible for re-election had an estimated 36 percent higher program performance compared to municipalities governed by a second-term mayor who is, by constitutional law, not eligible for re-election. This difference persists when comparing second-term mayors to first-term mayors that got re-elected in the subsequent election, thus controlling for revealed ability, and to mayors with a comparable level of political experience....first-term mayors had reason to care about good program performance. The probability of re-election was 28 percent higher for mayors who were in the top quartile of program impacts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc044b45-5f92-40c4-8d96-56a8efd9cf6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc044b45-5f92-40c4-8d96-56a8efd9cf6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1f22ef04922ca8e12c218acad413f9a65d9f3640f098edee3a76181754fd89a"}, "2": {"node_id": "50de73de-2776-4c67-97a1-734a9b0d18d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c625f6eb009c96974cb236940d7b84273219261beb30e11d7810841d2a8a610"}}, "hash": "a4ea03d943528ebf210b3fe9018c676ba3f30510d31ab56ba7f8eb6429dd9c49", "text": "Mayors with no public denouncements of inclusion errors were also rewarded with a 26 percent higher probability of re-election.[A] number of good management practices related to transparency that affect program performance were more frequently associated with first", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cdf86ef-6441-48eb-b152-51d337174222": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cdf86ef-6441-48eb-b152-51d337174222", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Government and Social Protection: Making Service Delivery Available for the Most Vulnerable", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-government-and-social-protection-making-service-delivery-available-most-vulnerable", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01c1823cf2fd37d5eef9e81b0af4e97ace3c792da5f48cef2608bf449a2819be"}}, "hash": "01c1823cf2fd37d5eef9e81b0af4e97ace3c792da5f48cef2608bf449a2819be", "text": "than second-term mayors ...\u201d53 Local electoral incentives can, then, result in better safety net service delivery. Clearly, many factors (such as public awareness of performance and outcomes) 53 See de Janvry, A., Finan, F. and Sadoulet, E. (2009) for detailed findings on the relationship between electoral incentives and the performance of decentralized safety net services in Brazilian municipalities. 82 Local Government and Social Protection: Making service delivery available for the most vulnerable are at play, but the key point is that local governments provide built in electoral incentives for politicians to be held accountable for service delivery. That said, all elections are periodic and (as in the case of Brazilian municipalities) may only affect politicians who are legally eligible to stand for further terms. Electoral accountability can be complemented by other mechanisms for downward accountability, such as social audits54 and grievance mechanisms, through which citizens can hold local officials accountable for performance and service delivery outcomes. Such mechanisms tend to be far more meaningful and manageable at the local (rather than central) level, with significant implications for downward accountability and performance. 5.5.2. Performance-based funding and service delivery In delegating or partly devolving the management of safety net programmes to local governments, central governments face the problem of how to ensure that the quality and scope of such services are sustained. This challenge is not unique to safety net programmes; it is a concern for virtually any local government service that is either fully
