We used multiple research methods and instruments to investigate the cultural, cognitive, and behavioral factors that shape HIV and STI transmission risks in Fiji. For the sake of brevity, we did not include here research protocols and instruments, letters of introduction and research clearance, statements of informed consent, and the like, but they can be obtained upon request to UNDP. Part One contains an Executive Summary of the data we collected in Suva in July, August and September of 2010. We also discuss the five-weeks-long workshop in qualitative research methods that was led by Lawrence Hammar, the Principal Investigator (PI), a cultural-medical anthropologist who has ties of longstanding to and in the insular Pacific. The workshop was attended by eight Fijians: Tura Lewai, Tuberi Cati, Vilisi Gadolo, Jone Gucake, Verenaisi Turagaiviu, Sesenieli Bui, Rachana Kumari, and Elenani Naikini Sotia. Their general and specific accomplishments show what a bright future there is for qualitative research in Fiji. Part Two presents the findings that emerged from research we conducted with members of six \u201ctarget groups\u201d\u20141) gays, lesbians, and transgenders; 2) taxi- cab drivers; 3) health care workers; 4) university students; 5) Christian pastors; and 6) people in sex work\u2014and their Intimate Partners.

The drawing that graces the title page of this report, for example, depicts a participant\u2019s response to our request of everyone that they draw \u201cMe, My Intimate Partner, and HIV.\u201d We also asked participants privately to draw \u201cHow I Try to Prevent HIV Transmission\u201d and in a focus group setting to draw \u201cRisky Persons,\u201d \u201cRisky Behaviours,\u201d and \u201cRisky Settings.\u201d We also conducted 21 Key Informant interviews with Suva-based Fijian experts in these issues. In Part Three we discuss our findings in greater detail. We digitally recorded formal interviews and we continue to transcribe, code and analyze the transcriptions we made of them. We used multiple data points and sources to summarize the contours of 37 intimate relationships. We have condensed those into summaries of intimate relationships, Target Group-by-Target Group. We coded and analyzed and discuss here the various concept maps our respondents drew. We also present in less structured, narrative form the statements our respondents made about their knowledge of STI signs and symptoms and the beliefs they hold regarding the ability of non-standard practices and substances (\u201cherbal medicine,\u201d prayer, etc.) to prevent if not also cure HIV infection. Our focus was consistently upon finding evidence of factors that might heighten risk of transmission of HIV and STIs in the context especially of intimate relationships. Those included ongoing, untreated STIs; patterns of sexual networking and frequencies of \u201drelationship infidelities\u201d; knowledge of STI signs and symptoms; inconsistent or altogether absent condom use; and beliefs and practices regarding treatment of HIV infection. We found that our 74 Fijian respondents have internalized and easily express public health messages about abstaining from sex, being \u201dfaithful\u201d sexually, and getting tested for HIV antibody (HIVab). Nevertheless, they also and accordingly externalize their own HIV transmission risks, away from Self and Intimate Partner toward Other, especially strangers and sex workers. Moreover, they exaggerated the risks of HIV transmission via renegade men wielding syringes (as pictured below), sports injuries, and blood transfusion and donation. This example is one of many, many that could be cited. In the final sections we discuss why and how it is that we think that our respondents did not exhibit much specific knowledge of the signs and symptoms of STIs or match their considerable expression of rhetoric about condom use with their actual use. Specific knowledge of causes, signs and symptoms of STIs was limited to instances of discharge, captured by the \u201ccovering term\u201d in the Fijian lexicon: tona. Many participants believe in the power of faith and prayer to treat or cure HIV infection. Various forms of \u201cFijian medicine\u201d and faith healing were resorted to instead of or to augment pharmaceutical cures for STIs or treatments for HIV. Instead of perceiving the HIV and STI transmission risks of sexual intercourse per se (and avoiding sex or using condoms accordingly), respondents constructed risk in terms of renegade syringe injectors, blood transfusions, accidental blood contact, tattoo needles, and sex with strangers and especially sex workers. Even the Intimate Partners of sex workers located risk in the persons and actions of sex workers but denied their own risks accordingly. Just like other respondents, and instead of using condoms, the Intimate Partners stressed the importance of \u201csticking to one partner,\u201d of \u201ctrust,\u201d and of \u201cbeing faithful.\u201d Of course, neither they nor their sex worker wives and girlfriends do or can do any of those things. Moreover, three of those Intimate Partners reported higher numbers of sexual partners in the past 12 months than did their sex worker wives and girlfriends. 10 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 11 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks Abbreviations and Acronyms Used AIDS Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS, is a surveillance definition that means a syndrome of opportunistic infections and diseases that can develop as immunosuppression deepens along the continuum of HIV infection from primary infection to death.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88b2dc60-3528-4315-92c0-d6c1ccf83fee": {"__data__": {"id_": "88b2dc60-3528-4315-92c0-d6c1ccf83fee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1c8c7f638a6ded5f4cd3cf03d857dbcd8cf08de62d23adfd40892cf3ed66367"}, "2": {"node_id": "6bf0a9eb-3fa4-4a67-8594-13bde5612fe9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0df82e4f2c33e72ff5519888e2cc98f26bbe1c1ebecc319e5eeacc7344d96aa5"}}, "hash": "cc7c64363280c87825df1c42a658bcefbc8e7d14773de3c000f25ab650920c8b", "text": "Often greatly misunderstood and contested, it is collection of signs (such as prolonged weight and hair loss), markers (lowered CD4 cell counts, HIVab sero-reactivity), and symptoms (productive cough, persistent diarrhea). \u201cAIDS diagnoses\u201d are highly correlated with these symptoms and usually (but not always) an HIVab+ blood-test result.

In summary, we are convinced that Fijians currently face a terrible dilemma without benefit of critical, open discussion of the individual and public health consequences of sexual ethics. Fijians can avoid infections by having sex that is better protected (by condoms), and perhaps even with a larger number of persons, with consent, communication, and mutuality of pleasure, or they can adhere to cultural and religious rules to have sex only with a legal spouse of the opposite sex but without condoms. The first option is safer in terms of HIV and STI transmission risks, but the risks of social and religious approbation are higher, especially so if she be a female. The second option heightens transmissive risks because social and religious codes are adhered to, and those codes tend to protect (heterosexual) male privilege. Accordingly, the gender-neutral tenor of public health campaigns and messages, we feel, thus needs to change. \u201cStay Faithful,\u201d \u201cStick to One Partner,\u201d \u201cWait Until Marriage,\u201d and the like, don\u2019t seem to match the realities of sexual desire and sexual practice in Fiji.

Introduction Roughly 837,000 people live in Fiji, mostly on Viti Levu or Vanua Levu, two of the 100 or so inhabited islands. About one-fifth of them live in the nation\u2019s capital of Suva. About (54%) of all Fijians are ethnic Fijians, also called \u201ci-Taukei,\u201d and most of those profess Christianity. Fijians of Ethnic Indian descent (Indo-Fijians), most of whom are Hindu or Muslim, comprise another 39%. The remaining 7% or so of Fijians are other Pacific islanders, for example, from the Solomon and Cook Islands, and expatriates from various European and Asian countries (WHO 2006: 30). In US$, Fijian Gross Domestic Product per capita ($3,514) is greater than twice the figure for Vanuatu and more than five times greater than the figures for Papua New Guinea and the Solomons (Schoeffel 2009: 4, Table 1). In terms of the number of live births in hospitals, the average life expectancy, the number of health facilities and people\u2019s access to them, Fijians are a healthy, vibrant population, especially by comparison to other countries in the Pacific, for example, Papua New Guinea (Hammar 2010a). Unfortunately, the incidence (new cases of) and prevalence (existing caseload) of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), whether genital ulcer diseases (GUDs) such as genital herpes and syphilis, or genital discharge diseases (GDD) such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, pose serious and growing health problems in Fijians and other insular Pacific islanders. The prevalence of genital herpes and other STIs in females attending antenatal clinics (ANC) in Vanuatu, for example, is extremely high in itself (Haddow et al. 2007; Zenner and Russell 2005), but infection with such also heightens the risks of sexual transmission of HIV (and other STIs).

Indeed, the burden of infection with chlamydia that is shouldered by pregnant females in the Pacific is among the heaviest in the entire world (SPC 2010). Fijian females were reported by the Ministry of Health in September of 2010 to \u201ctop the list\u201d in the Pacific (Rina 2010). The WHO-sponsored Second Generation Survey (SGS) conducted in 2004-2005 and again in 2008 in Fiji and five other Pacific countries found that 29% of a large cohort of antenatal clinic (ANC) attendees had been infected with chlamydia, another 1.7% with gonorrhea, and another 2.6% with syphilis (UNGASS 2010). Chlamydia prevalence in Fiji\u2019s ANC attendees even who reported that they had had only a single sexual partner in the previous 12 months was still greater than one in five (29/134\u201421.6%; UNGASS 2010: 7). Chlamydia prevalence in those 25 years of age or younger was 37.5% (Fiji Ministry of Health 2010: 5), suggesting that this STI is hyperendemic. Researchers of all stripes now accept that HIV and STI transmission risks are also about gender relations and gender- based violence, however, not just the properties of viruses, parasites and bacteria (see Lepani 2004; Hammar 2010a, b, c; Sladden 2005). Although it has taken two decades or more for many organizations to recognize the consistent findings of social scientists along these lines, virtually all of them now affirm the centrality of gender relations in HIV and STI transmission, prevention and treatment (cf. UNAIDS 1999, 2000a, b, c; UNAIDS and KIT 2005; UNDAW 2004; WHO 2001, 2003, 2004a, b, 2010). In Fiji as elsewhere throughout the Pacific (Schoeffel 2009), rape, wife-bashing, incest, sexual molestation, and other forms of sexual violence are common and underreported (Chaudhary 2003- 2004; George 2008; Kaitani 2003; Tora 2006). A research study conducted by the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre (located in Suva) involving 1,575 Fijians sampled randomly and interviewed by scheduled interview found that 80% had witnessed domestic violence in their homes. About 95% of the cases had been perpetrated by males against females, and male family members were the perpetrators \u201cmost of the time.\u201d Nevertheless, regarding rape and incest, a remarkably small fraction of even the cases reported to the police or in the pages of the Fiji Times were reported to them (only 420 cases in 25 years; see http:// www.fijiwomen.com). \u201cConvoy\u201d sex, known euphemistically as \u201cserial sexual intercourse\u201d and known in Papua New Guinea as lainap or singol fael, is in Fiji, according to Kaitani (2003: 226), \u201ca common practice of young men [although boys] do not see it as rape.\u201d The text box recounts two of the instances thereof that our respondents related (see above). In some ways, the coming of HIV and AIDS to Fiji has heightened interest in other, related, public health matters and sharpened the focus upon gender relations. Manual search of every issue and the turning of every page of the Fiji Times newspaper for 2000-2009 showed that media coverage in Fiji of these problems has increased public awareness of (and outcry against) them.

Such discussions of cultural and specifically religious taboos are surely increasing. Other conversations are taking place in Fiji about widespread changes that have occurred to patterns and outcomes of sexual networking and the transmission of STIs and HIV. As never before, Fijians are now saying \u201cno\u201d to sexual violence, questioning heterosexual male privilege, and beginning to confront the longstanding cultural and religious taboos that prevent open, frank discussion of these and other sexual matters (Sturrock 2007; Tora 2006). The quote in the text box above (text box 2) represents similar conclusions to which Ugandan women came when faced with the steady increase in deaths of friends and loved ones. Even though Fiji remains a \u201clow prevalence\u201d country, high levels of movement, literacy shortfalls, proximity to countries that have high HIV prevalence, and high rates of STI transmission mean that this is not the time in Fiji to remain complacent, as Tim Sladden wisely reminded us (2005). The Burnet Institute concluded in 2009 that \u201cFiji\u2019s location and function as a regional hub, together with anecdotal reports of STIs being acquired in Fiji by nationals of neighbouring [Pacific Island Countries and Territories] and subsequently imported to their countries of origin, suggest that control of HIV in Fiji may have a considerable impact on controlling spread in the wider Pacific\u201d (Coghlan et al. 2009: 61). The cumulative number HIV cases, the increasing recognition that STIs are endemic in Fiji, the ongoing problems related to commercial sexual networking, and the increasing sexualization of Fijian culture have led some to conclude that Fijian communities are \u201cat great risk for the introduction and rapid spread of HIV infection\u201d (Cliffe, Wang and Sullivan 2006: 28). HIV infection trend data in Fiji suggest, say McMillan and Worth (2010: 4), \u201cthe potential for a rapid spread and negative social and economic impacts, should numbers of HIV infections reach a critical mass.\u201d Whatever \u201ccritical mass\u201d may mean, it took 15 years (from 1989 to 2004) for the first 182 HIVab+ cases to be reported to the Fiji Ministry of Health, but only six years (2005-2010) for the next 182 to be reported. Most (87%) of those 364 cases involve ethnic Fijians, and only one case each has been attributed to intravenous drug use and blood transfusion. While males still account for 53% of the total since 1989, the male:female ratio was reported in 2009 to be 45:55 (Fiji Ministry of Health 2010: 3). These shifts appear to be following trends reported elsewhere in the Pacific (Hammar 2010a), leading many to talk of the \u201cfeminizing\u201d of the epidemic. But what to make of even this seeming trend, much less the seeming trend of increasing HIV transmission, is far from clear. In Fiji as elsewhere, most HIVab testing is done on pregnant females, there is no equivalent male clinic population matched for age and relationship status, and females who attend ANC have by definition been having unprotected sexual intercourse. Because qualitative sexuality and health services research are not yet well developed in Fiji, it is difficult to say how representative those figures are. Given the low number of HIVab tests conducted since 1989 and their non-random character (most tests are done in ANC or in STI clinics), there aren\u2019t sufficient data yet to define the epidemiology of HIV clearly. What is clearer, however, is that when national HIV and AIDS responses are not guided by sufficient empirical data and social-scientific principles, those responses suffer. This has been demonstrated in Thailand (Fordham 2005), Nepal (Pigg 2001), Indonesia (Butt, Munro and Wong 2004), and South Africa (Epstein 2007), to mention just a few examples.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44de90cf-f0ed-4025-9f9d-a7144425e567": {"__data__": {"id_": "44de90cf-f0ed-4025-9f9d-a7144425e567", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "826ab9f7fee1680f5e056e6f78c49bcd936c2d2bc2a30109d92f060a693a3bfd"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c12721b-88be-4e5c-a591-f88ca76bfc0a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75a63c2057c93801781c91cc13cbb8c7ddbd1df7476caac259b8edfb5f6f7201"}}, "hash": "3ed010d624409bc270f56fa7a7abd988c8f6118c703b6588569ae51fbf8f631b", "text": "Hammar (2007, 2008, 2010a, b), Lepani (2004), Reid (2009) and many others have critiqued the questionable assumptions that have blunted the efficacy of the response in Papua New Guinea to HIV and AIDS.

The research crew used multiple methods in multiple settings to collect and interpret multiple kinds of data from members of multiple Target Groups and their Intimate Partners. As for the research methods and instruments, in-depth, one-on-one style interviews were conducted. Respondents were engaged in concept-mapping exercises. The team conducted focus group discussions about topics including community, sexual and reproductive health and wrote fieldnotes based upon the participant-observation in which team members engaged around town. In the pages below we explore cognitive patterns and behavioral dynamics that emerged from the study. Many data points and sources suggest a great degree of cognitive dissonance in Fijian self-assessments of HIV and STI transmission risk. We found that Fijians have internalized public health messages to \u201cabstain from sex\u201d or, failing that, to \u201cstick to one partner\u201d or, failing that, to use condoms, but that are contradicted by their actual sexual practices. Each of the text box 3 quotes (below) about abstinence and fidelity, for example, comes from the mouths of people who are sexually active with many, many more than their Intimate Partners; the first is someone who recounted 34 in the past year, the next two are from men who are the frequent clients of sex workers, and the final five are from five sex workers.

I [am] faithful to all my partners.\u201d 22 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 23 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks Indeed, we discuss in greater detail below the fact that the 74 respondents about whose risk assessments we learned projected HIV and STI transmission risk in markedly but complexly contradictory fashion. For example, risk was projected onto sex workers, even if the respondent was one herself or married to or had sex with one himself (or herself). Many respondents who were not involved in commercial sexual transactions still felt their risks to lie there. Many respondents singled out the special risks of attending night-clubs and of consuming alcohol even if they frequently did just that (and never used condoms) or if they abstained from both (and so weren\u2019t thereby at risk). The text box 4 quote here captures these cognitive dynamics nicely. This 29 year-old taxi-cab driver is afraid of \u201cforeigners\u201d but yet is in a long-term (13 years) relationship with one and doesn\u2019t use condoms with him.

The first part was the HIV social research methods training workshop held in Suva, Fiji from 23 June to 28 July, 2010.

The five who were retained through the data-collection phase were then paid $F70.00 daily, and three were retained later to help in audiotape transcription. During the training workshop, each day was broken into two morning and two afternoon sessions. Attendees read about and then eventually put into practice their knowledge of 1) HIV, AIDS, and STIs in the insular Pacific; 2) sexual behaviours and transmission risks; and 3) specific research methods. Attendees made compelling observations, interviewed people, and wrote detailed fieldnotes. On one occasion workshop attendees jumped into taxi-cabs in dyads and interviewed cab drivers who, after providing their informed consent, spoke of the sexual encounters they facilitated and/or participated in. 24 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 25 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks Methods and Rationale Sample \u201cI will not want to come to town knowing that HIV is mostly transmitted only in town. I believe by eating good food and being physically engaged in activities such as gardening and so on will prevent me from getting HIV\u201d (Fijian taxi-cab driver). The project was designed to help strengthen Fiji\u2019s response to HIV and AIDS and respond to a methodological problem that frequently affects HIV research. Usually only one side of the sexual ledger is studied. Studies of prostitution usually ignore customers, and studies that employ methods of sexual diary-keeping typically record only the sexual acts of the keepers, not of the keepers\u2019 partners. For example, Ghuman et al.\u2019s (2006) study of changing sexual networking styles in Vietnam notes that tallies of sexual activities engaged in by girlfriends and wives ought to tally with those of the boyfriends and husbands (but don\u2019t), that memories of ease of reaching orgasm or types and outcomes of use of family planning methods ought to square (but rarely do so).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d2d2d7-8c46-4810-8bde-e2783fe8455c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d2d2d7-8c46-4810-8bde-e2783fe8455c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74790a3b7aaf3a18b8ea1ea6e6e6a7da487bff6697a918cfe4f67184d911a8e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "63c0f23f-40f0-482e-8f04-36ca17fd36fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e301298133bed73134ec45651f857070cfe4187983863a4558d142d2620800da"}}, "hash": "a4aaea9584b3a5aa810ce4c10fe6bdaa12fbb375cefe05066e3085c930a9d76c", "text": "They found (2006: 172) that Vietnamese women \u201cwere about half as likely as men to report that they had had sex with their future spouse before marriage,\u201d that Vietnamese men were 50% more likely \u201cto report having had sex with their spouse before marriage\u201d and that Vietnamese women considerably underreported their own premarital sexual activities.

The initial contact we had with study participants was at the outset of the focus group interviews we conducted at three different venues. Many were held at Our Place, where FJN+ is housed, but four focus group interviews were held in the private flat of the PI and at another venue rented by the project owing to the better acoustics and closer proximity to respondents they afforded. All focus group interviews were digitally recorded for later transcription, coding and analysis. Facilitators conducted the interviews that followed the reading and discussion of the informed consent form. Process Observers met and greeted the arriving participants, handled supplies, took notes on non-verbal communications, and provided compensation. Following conduct of the focus group interviews, appropriate field staff used a standardized interview schedule usually within 48 hours to inquire of 1) sociodemographic variables and issues regarding age and sex, education and work; 2) knowledge of HIV and AIDS; 3) past and present genital health and sexual hygiene; 4) sexual practice, consensual and not; and 5) personal risk assessments.

So, it\u2019s almost like when you are seen with, one in my community from where I am at now, when you are seen with condoms, you\u2019re known straightaway that you are a person who is a sex-worker\u201d (Intimate Partner of a sex worker). Findings from studies conducted around the world have demonstrated clearly and fairly consistently the HIV and STI transmission risks of companionate relationships (see Clark 2004; Moodie 2000; Carpenter et al. 1999; Schoepf 2003; Hammar 1998, 2004b, c, 2006a, b, 2008, 2010a, b; Wardlow 2002, 2004, 2007, 2008; Hughes 2002). Whether or not the relationship is between heterosexuals, whether it is in marriage or on the way to it, a long and growing list of qualitative and quantitative studies demonstrates the operation of important cognitive factors and behavioral dynamics at work that imperil people sexually in their intimate relationships. Intimate partnerships can heighten HIV and STI transmission risk because the frequency of unprotected intercourse tends to go up as condom use goes out the window. \u201cCustomers\u201d turn into \u201cboyfriends\u201d (and boyfriends into husbands) by the foregoing of condom use. Couples desire children, too, and that requires unprotected sex. Moreover, HIVab prevalence is often higher in the older men who are more likely to become the husbands of younger females than in the younger males who might otherwise have become their boyfriends. Telescoping the perspectives and findings of the studies cited above and many score more (e.g., Bolton 1992; Hammar 1999a, b, 2006), the truism for especially heterosexual women is that HIV and STI transmission risks can go up as number of sexual partners and frequency of sexual partner change go down. This is due primarily to decreased levels of condom usage between Intimate Partners and the high prevalence of infection therein. The opposite, of course, is communicated to people by means of public health and other, religious and secular messages, that marriage is (relatively) safe. The salience of these messages for Fijians could not be clearer, and it emerged no matter what research instrument was used on which Target Group member. For example, an Indo- Fijian health worker concluded: \u201cas we all know that AIDS or HIV, there is no barrier, anyone can get it, which means they should screen themselves and then be, stay faithful to one partner and not have multiple partners.\u201d An Indo- Fijian husband commented: \u201cI would be faithful to my wife, that, only my partner for the life, same thing as having sex with my wife only.\u201d An ethnic Fijian male health care worker summarized it this way: \u201cOkay . . . when I look at it as myself, as how I try to prevent HIV transmission, is being faithful to my wife, meaning only one sex partner, eh?, not to commit adultery and not to have any other sexual partner apart from my wife.\u201d A Fijian gay male explained his drawing this way: \u201c[What] I noted down is being faithful; I believe if people be faithful then they don\u2019t need to worry about anything, not even HIV . . . because they know they are being faithful to his partner or her partner.\u201d The Indo-Fijian wife of an Indo-Fijian taxi-cab driver explained a comment that she drew on her panel, \u201cSay No to the Polygamous Society,\u201d by saying, \u201clike, married with multiple partners; through this kind of marriage the disease is transmitted to and fro.\u201d For brevity\u2019s sake, we have here summarized and analyzed relationships, target group-by-target group, beginning with the Orange group\u2014gays, lesbians, and transgender persons\u2014and their Intimate Partners. Almost without exception, our data suggest the complete externalization of risk, a projection outward and away from Self and Intimate Partner toward Other and toward other settings, behaviors and persons.

For example, nine of the 11 self-assessed their HIV and STI transmission risks as \u201clow,\u201d but nine of 11 also wanted to have an STI and an HIVab test because of fear, curiosity, and anxiety. Neither half of one couple reported ever having had sex with a female, but their drawings of persons and settings they considered risky to them are filled with depictions of (presumably) heterosexual females flagging down drivers, enticing men sexually with tight clothing and then being raped by a group of men. One person who claims to be a transgender female claims never to have had had vaginal intercourse. Another person says that he lost his virginity to an older male, a \u201csame-sex\u201d male, but claims also never to have had oral or anal sex. The drawing here is by a lesbian who says that she\u2019s in a monogamous relationship but she is currently suffering from several signs and symptoms of STIs. She depicts her risk as pertaining to heterosexuals cavorting on a beach. In a relationship between two self-identified gay males, one of them is HIVab+ but has probably not yet disclosed his status to his Intimate Partner. In several settings the issue came up awkwardly insofar as they don\u2019t always use condoms (or with each other). When they don\u2019t with each other, the other partner says, it\u2019s because they are \u201cfaithful\u201d to each other, even though he recounted at least four other sexual partners in the past year and even though he claims also never to have had oral or anal sex. He says he\u2019s at \u201chigh-risk\u201d because he doesn\u2019t always know his sexual partners personally. His HIVab+ partner, however, says he\u2019s at \u201clow risk\u201d of HIV transmission because he \u201cbelieves so much in condoms every time I have sex.\u201d In terms of sexual practices and risks, similar inconsistencies were reported. For example, the transgendered health care worker who is married to a woman but who enrolled in the study alongside his Intimate Partner, a single, unemployed, bisexual male, asked at the outset of the interview, \u201cCan HIV spread by having sex with a member of the same sex?\u201d That respondent then reported 34 non-intimate sexual partners in the last 12 months, while the Intimate Partner reported three non-intimate sexual partners in the last 12 months and no condom use with any sexual partners. Two gay males intimately involved with each other both self-assessed their STI and HIV risk as \u201clow\u201d even though they are frequently tested for STIs and wish now also to be treated again (because they don\u2019t always use condoms). One\u2019s \u201cRisky Person\u201d drawing was not of another gay male or himself or his own Intimate Partner, but rather, of an infected woman who is a stranger, \u201cthe person that you don\u2019t know . . .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dae02b67-e9d6-4a0c-a676-467ad8ee377e": {"__data__": {"id_": "dae02b67-e9d6-4a0c-a676-467ad8ee377e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "901b4c90a2dba5d7d959ef909fb66c39b0a4b715d7eb3bcb7bc12102ad95a74d"}, "2": {"node_id": "67a35111-0a85-4b36-96f8-c7fd675c105c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddc86f58f322acdb188bc0895709e6127774b9f774a866839a5961e42f1e88d9"}}, "hash": "685649b1eff60de032214f1394663ccc57d3065ee8cb1c71872c8d7859e21623", "text": ". .

Several Intimate Partners of each other did not agree as to whether they were single or married and whether or not their partners had other Intimate Partners. Two Intimate Partners of the sex workers were shoe-shine \u201cboys\u201d and another two had been or were members of the disciplinary forces. The average age at loss of virginity for the male members of this cohort was lower than that of their wives and girlfriends. One man was six years old when he lost his virginity to a \u201cmuch older woman,\u201d another was 11, still another was 13 (with an older female cousin, \u201cwhile watching blue movies with her\u201d), and yet another was 10 (again, with a grown woman). All 12 claimed never to have engaged in anal intercourse. Six of the 12 were suffering from STI signs and symptoms, but it required application of several research methods to establish so. Both halves of a lesbian couple reported former and current, multiple symptoms of an STI. In another couple, the husband reports no STI symptoms, but the wife reports several. In yet another relationship the wife reports having suffered several bouts of several symptoms that she attributes to \u201chaving multiple partners,\u201d to clients who have \u201cbig dick,\u201d and to clients who have inserted marbles into their penes. Her shoe-shine \u201cboy\u201d husband reports several STI symptoms that he blames on a loss of semen and poor sexual hygiene. Another sex worker has suffered vaginal sores, pain during urination, pain during intercourse, lower abdominal pain that does not go away, and problems with pregnancy, and she currently experiences genital itchiness. Yet another couple has suffered from and continues to suffer several STI signs and symptoms but are mostly self-treating them. This cohort\u2019s members varied greatly in their reporting of sexual behaviors. For completely understandable reasons, some sex workers and their Intimate Partners underestimated sexual behaviors (as did members of other Target Groups) and at least two Intimate Partners overestimated them. One sex worker claimed 15 partners in the past 12 months (but more, elsewhere), while her husband, a member of the disciplinary forces, said his number was \u201cuncountable\u201d but then settled on \u201c50+.\u201d They have sex several times each week with each other, unprotected. Another sex worker states that she has had eight sexual contacts in the last 12 months, and her Intimate Partner has had two; they have sex with each other \u201cseveral times each week,\u201d unprotected.

Nevertheless, 7/12 and 8/12 wanted to be tested for STIs and for HIV, respectively. One sex worker says that she is at \u201chigh-risk\u201d for STI and HIV transmission owing to her lack of certainty about the fidelity of her husband. He says that he is at \u201clow risk\u201d because \u201cI have only one partner\u201d (which isn\u2019t true), albeit a sex worker; he confessed: \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about my partner, whether she is honest to me or not.\u201d One sex worker says that she\u2019s at \u201clow risk\u201d because she was just tested last year, but still wants an STI test and an HIVab test \u201cto know myself if I\u2019m clean or not,\u201d to \u201cknow if I don\u2019t have HIV.\u201d Her Intimate Partner says he\u2019s at \u201chigh-risk\u201d owing to the extent of his unprotected sexual encounters (but not those with his Intimate Partner). Another sex worker states that she is at \u201clow risk\u201d because she is \u201cfaithful\u201d to her partner, and he, too, says that he is \u201clow risk,\u201d also because he is \u201csteady with my partner, been faithful to her, and she is the only one.\u201d She, of course, is a sex worker, so she can\u2019t be \u201csteady\u201d with anyone, and the PI later found the husband attempting to solicit Asian fishermen customers for her.

A fifth sex worker says she is at \u201clow risk\u201d \u201cbecause at the moment my partner has only me,\u201d even though that is false, but wants both an HIV antibody and an STI test \u201cto know my status and for my health.\u201d Condom use patterns in this cohort are similarly inconsistent.

Another husband says they only \u201csometimes\u201d use condoms, and didn\u2019t at last sex because \u201cwe are faithful to each other\u201d (even though neither is). A sex worker says that her husband \u201cnever\u201d uses condoms, because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like the feeling,\u201d but she \u201calways\u201d uses them with at least two of her other sexual contacts. Another sex worker says that she and her Intimate Partner \u201calways\u201d use condoms during sex, but he says that they \u201cnever\u201d do so, because they are \u201cfaithful to each other\u201d (though neither is).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9db3efbd-bc01-45cf-be7f-613331782300": {"__data__": {"id_": "9db3efbd-bc01-45cf-be7f-613331782300", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afad1f3b61e49a28037ea9dd7eaf023cc22739ba3f75b1e82ab7888738d489b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "f48a2865-c356-4756-b633-165354174721", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6c4cde7cdcbac861c6057b6b056beaef6051987f881603fa505cb79e9df8a68"}}, "hash": "bee0be5953858f9145cf6197e853a3672134abfb613bb1f28cfa53713776be47", "text": "The \u201cRisky Setting\u201d drawn by one sex worker is of a client in a car but with whom she is adamant about using condoms; her husband, however, who is exceedingly active sexually, doesn\u2019t figure in either of her Text box 8: \u201cit\u2019s the police [to laughter] because they are policemen, and most of us trust them, and some of the policemen fix the girls, they want to escort [sex workers] to the bush . . . and they have sex with them, because we trust the police, eh?

Maybe he wants everyone to have HIV with him.\u201d Several of the sex workers told compelling, horrible stories of having experienced sexual molestation when younger and sexual violence and harassment while on the job, whether by policemen or religious officials or politicians or customers. One sex worker said that her mother used to send her to a shop and \u201cthis guy\u201d used to force her to have sex and that she felt \u201chelpless\u201d; she is still in great pain over her experiences. Another\u2019s grim story of suffering of incest (perpetrated by a grandfather) came out during a concept-mapping exercise. The story in the text-box quote told by a sex worker about police harassment was confirmed in duplicate by other sex workers. This cohort was recruited in two waves and, like the taxi-cab drivers, were interviewed in four, not two focus group discussions. Two respondents were married to each other, the remaining self-identified as single. Two couples were difficult to enroll regarding a participation criterion. The female in one initially adamantly proclaimed her virginity, but it eventually came out that, because of the trouble she\u2019d experienced in the relationship, she had been engaging in anal intercourse with her Intimate Partner, without protection of condoms, so as to protect her \u201cvirginity.\u201d Her Intimate Partner initially said that he has never forced anyone into sex, but by study\u2019s end she showed up with a huge knot over her eyebrow, where he had head-butted her, she said, because she had refused to have sex with him. The female half of another couple said initially that she was at \u201clow\u201d risk for HIV and STI transmission because she\u2019s \u201cnot having sex,\u201d but then indicated in several other ways later that she was.

A 21 year-old Fijian female university student complains of painful intercourse but doesn\u2019t know how to explain it; her 22 year-old Fijian student boyfriend attributes all of his symptoms to having gotten drunk and had unprotected sex with an infected girl, but he says that he went immediately to a hospital for treatment. 40 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 41 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks Many members of this cohort had had additional partners in the past year. In two relationships, the boyfriend reported a single sexual partner in addition to his Intimate Partner.

He was seven years old when he had oral sex for the first time with a relative, and 14 when he had vaginal intercourse, in this case, with a closely related female cousin. Members of this cohort drew the most colorful, complete and detailed drawings. In a three-panel representation, a married 20 year-old Fijian male drew 1) four HIVab+ people (three women and one man) who are standing outside a night-club waiting to get in and who will later infect the patrons they take home later; 2) an HIVab+ woman who is soliciting two men on a street-corner, and two more women who are HIVab+ (each with a red dot over their heads) who are waiting outside a club to get inside and infect two unsuspecting men; and 3) a four-part story in which a man asks his \u201cBro\u201d to \u201cfix him a gal\u201d and who does, introducing \u201cSarah\u201d to him, whereupon they meet, hook-up, and in the dead of night, are depicted as having sex on a bed indoors.

Brief mentions were made above of themes depicted by various Target Group members and their Intimate Partners while engaged in various concept-mapping exercises. At the conclusion of each focus group discussion we served participants light snacks and refreshments and allowed them to catch their breath, stretch their legs, and retrieve telephone messages. When we reassembled the participants they were each provided with three A4 cards and some markers to draw with and asked to think about HIV transmission risks and then draw 1) a Risky Person; 2) a Risky Behaviour; and 3) a Risky Setting, again, all in terms of HIV transmission. They were told that after they are done they will explain their drawings in their own words. After they completed their drawings the team recorded their explanations by digital recorder.

Health care worker and Christian pastor wife drawings supported the use of condoms, but they themselves did not use them. A taxi-cab driver depicted villagers growing healthy food, fishermen catching fish, and students playing rugby. Yet others took the opportunity almost to deliver a lecture, as with this example from a university student. In real life, however, the artist hasn\u2019t been tested for STIs and HIVab, has been unfaithful to an Intimate Partner several times, does not use condoms consistently, has not \u201cwait[ed] until marriage\u201d to lose virginity, has never been counseled regarding sexual matters, and sufficiently distrusts her Intimate Partner as to be frightened about the likely outcome of test results. She is one of only few who depicted herself, in this case, while attempting to get home from the bus-stop. The PI devised the following method to analyze and code the concept maps. Each concept-map was posted on the wall in a university classroom, color code-by-color code, Target Group member-by-Target Group Member, and Intimate Partner-by-Intimate Partner. Thus, for example, on one wall hung all of the Red color code drawings, those of the Christian pastors hanging atop, while those of their Intimate Partners hanging underneath. Two research assistants were assigned to each color. Manual counts were made of each message, object, person, act, and setting depicted. Those totals were affirmed by each dyad and confirmed by the PI.

Public Health Messages were depicted 203 times out of 563 (36% of the overall total). People Depicted constituted 108 of the total (19%). Social Settings were drawn 99 times (18%). Relationship Figures and Symbols were rendered 52 times (9%). Healthcare Settings and Symbols were represented 41 times (7%). HIV Treatments and Cures were mentioned 19 times (3%). Various Objects and Practices were drawn 40 times (7%). Religious Figures and Symbols were depicted 42 times (7%). Various Sex Acts were drawn 27 times (5%). We will discuss first the Public Health Messages that our participants drew. Those 203 drawings featured permutations of the \u201cABC\u201d message. Only four depictions were of the \u201cA\u201d in \u201cABC\u201d: \u201cabstinence,\u201d but because each and every respondent was sexually active, that probably makes sense. The \u201cB\u201d in \u201cBe Faithful\u201d\u2014\u201cBe Faithful,\u201d \u201cStick to One Partner,\u201d and the like\u2014were depicted far more frequently (57/203). Few respondents have ever used a female condom, but they were mentioned 30 times. Male condoms were depicted 47 times, and condoms generally, 65 times. Although only 25% of our respondents had used a condom at last sexual intercourse (13 of those 18 respondents being university students), 62% depicted them. Social Settings were depicted 99 times (18% of the total), as follows: \u201cstreets\u201d (bus-stops, street- corners, busy roadways), 36%; bars, night-clubs, music and dancing, 23%; settings of knowledge and learning, 21%; bedrooms and motels, 7%; television and other media, 5%; bush areas, parks and the seawall, 4%; village, 2%; and sports stadiums, 1%.

Tona.\u201d Respondent #2: \u201cThat\u2019s it, tona. That\u2019s the Fijian word for it\u201d [lots of nervous laughter and chatter]. Respondent #4: \u201cMyself, I can\u2019t really explain anything because I don\u2019t know what it is all about\u201d (four Christian pastors). Talking about sexuality or alluding to sex is indeed highly regulated in the indigenous Fijian community\u201d (2010: 15). Second, specific rules prevent improper speech and behavior between specific kinds of people. Reference to \u201csexuality or to anything that might remind one of it (alluding to sexual parts or underwear, for example) is strictly prohibited amongst other categories of people\u201d (2010: 15). (For what it\u2019s worth, two members of our research team are aunt/niece, and they could not ask or answer such questions of each other while practicing interviewing strategies.) Carmen White worked in Fijian secondary schools on the intersections of race, gender, class, and nationalism (especially 2005) and points to several gender-specific outcomes of these dynamics. \u201c[N] otions of Fijian authenticity intersect with gender,\u201d she notes, \u201cto the extent that compliance with standards in behavior marked as authentically Fijian is bifurcated by distinctions between what is normative for Fijian males and Fijian females\u201d (2005: 317). She discusses especially the different ways that male versus female movement is linked to social ideals of proper gender behaviors. \u201cFijian girls who roam the streets in recreational pursuits akin to male groups,\u201d she notes, \u201cmay have aspersions cast on their sexual virtue\u201d (2005: 318). In several publications, Nicole George (especially 2008) has theorized the fact in Fiji that talk about sensitive matters (whether they are about sexual health, masculinity, or women\u2019s status) predictably results in great hue and cry, a backlash perhaps against speaking publicly about what ought to be \u201cprivate\u201d matters. She notes, for example, that public discussions about the legal status of gay males and lesbians \u201chave provoked a volatile and frequently hysterical style of public debate that, ironically, appears to have intensified homophobic sentiment rather than promoted tolerance of homosexuality in Fiji\u201d (2008: 166). Even the Family Planning Association of Fiji expressed homophobic sentiments in trying to explain fast-rising levels of STIs in Fiji (Fiji Times 1996a, b). Perhaps talking about sex (as opposed to having it or doing it) takes all the fun out of it (Schoeffel 2009: 17). Given this cultural backdrop, it is hardly surprising that discussion of sexual matters relevant to addressing STIs forthrightly is brought to a standstill.

During several years\u2019 relevant clinical work, Arvin Chaudhary (2003-2004: 35) encountered strong belief amongst Fijians in a set of myths about HIV that are relevant to our discussion below of Fijian understandings of STI and HIV transmission and risk factors. We mention and respond briefly to each of them. \u2022 \u201cOnly gays and prostitutes have HIV.\u201d Probably no one would agree with the only, but yet most of our respondents did externalize their HIV transmission risks and often singled out women in prostitution and gay males in doing so. \u2022 \u201cInsects like mosquitoes may transmit HIV.\u201d We encountered this only once.

Fijians don\u2019t appear to be misinformed about the tensile strength of condoms so much as about that of their intimate relationships. \u2022\ufffd \u201cHIV and AIDS [are] same thing.\u201d Yes, there is considerable confusion among our respondents, but if Fijians believe this, it is partly only because public health authorities, politicians, researchers, NGO representatives and newspaper editors use phrases such as \u201cHIV/AIDS,\u201d \u201cHIV/AIDS virus,\u201d \u201cHIV/AIDS infection,\u201d \u201cAIDS transmission,\u201d and the like, all the time. The Burnet Institute report, for example, collates figures obtained from studies in which members of allegedly \u201chigh-risk\u201d citizens of five insular Pacific countries were ranked and ordered in terms of \u201cNo incorrect beliefs about AIDS transmission\u201d (2009: 81, Table 33 of Appendix 1). The phrase, of course, is nonsensical: it is physically impossible for a disease syndrome to be transmitted. Hundreds more examples could be amassed from the titles and content of the sources in the bibliography of the present report. \u2022 \u201cOne can tell by looking at someone who has HIV.\u201d Quite a few claim, and rightly, to be able to do this, but perhaps it would be better phrased in the negative: \u201cone cannot necessarily tell by looking that someone has HIV.\u201d \u2022 \u201cEveryday contact can transmit the virus.\u201d We found that respondents exaggerate the HIV transmission risks of car crashes, breast-feeding, rugby matches, blood-giving and blood-receiving, and many believe that sex with \u201cstrangers\u201d and those in prostitution are more unsafe per se than is sex with one\u2019s Intimate Partner. \u2022 \u201cPretty/Cute and clean looking people are safe.\u201d This is the same as assuming that one\u2019s Intimate Partner is by definition safe. \u2022 \u201cEjaculating outside (after unprotected penetrative anal or vaginal intercourse) will not transmit HIV.\u201d Several respondents had been \u201ctaught\u201d that \u201cwithdrawal\u201d is \u201cthe safest method\u201d of HIV prevention. Others believe that injections of vitamin-C, faith, consumption of cold-pressed, extra-virgin coconut oil, and fervent prayer can cure HIV. Only two respondents (both gay males) reported their knowledge of the existence of pre-ejaculate. No one mentioned viral load. Now that we have discussed some of the ideas that Chaudhary encountered throughout Fiji and during clinical practice, we want in the section below to present data from the focus group interviews we conducted about what respondents seem to know about STIs. The text-box quotes at the outset of this section from Christian pastors suggest that knowledge of STIs seems to begin and end with tona, meaning, usually, discharge, probably gonorrhea. When we asked the spouses of taxi-cab drivers the same question, and even though we conducted the discussion slowly, gently, and in Fijian, only one answered, by saying, \u201cTona . . . Yeah, definitely, tona waice is \u2018dripping water\u2019 [laughing] . . . [and] umm, syphilis [laughing] . . . Um, samuna [skin rash]. That\u2019s the only name I know. Yes, and samuna.\u201d These two groups of respondents mentioned only discharge as \u201cthe\u201d signs and symptoms of STIs. Their answers to questions about the causes (in the strict sense) of STIs included mentions of unprotected sex per se, but the bulk of their attributions were to immorality and alleged promiscuity, on being the kind of person who would have multiple partners. Groups of university students mentioned a few more names: Interviewer: Thank you . . . Um, we\u2019ll begin with how many STIs you can name, sexually transmitted infections. Respondent #6: Syphilis.

Respondent #3: //These diseases [are] transmitted through sexual intercourse, like AIDS. HIV. Respondent #1: No, AIDS is different from STIs. The results were extremely interesting. The 21 respondents made a total of 60 attributions. Males made 31 of those, females made 24, and a transgender person made five more. Of those 60 attributions, only 12 were specifically to sex. Eight of them were made to sitting on \u201ccold\u201d cement or being infected by \u201cthe cold\u201d or draft. Females mentioned causes that males in general didn\u2019t, for example, menses, childbirth, rape, and drinking hot liquids, and others that heterosexual males specifically didn\u2019t: penises that were over-large or that had had marbles inserted in them (see Norton 1993; Patel, Ali and Taoi 2009). Males cited the wearing of warm clothes, drinking too much alcohol or yaqona, dehydration, and several other reasons. (To clarify, interviewers stressed lower abdominal pains that didn\u2019t go away; reports of genitals traumatized by childbirth didn\u2019t qualify as an STI.)

Increases in the number of cases of congenital syphilis have been reported, too (Fiji Ministry of Health 2010: 30).

Religious beliefs and discourses are a fundamental part of the social, cultural, economic and political landscape in Fiji. Since 1989, when HIV was first reported in Fiji, Christian churches in Fiji have provided spiritual support to those infected with HIV and/or diagnosed with AIDS, just as they have in Papua New Guinea (Hammar 2009b). Christian churches and officials in Fiji have helped to mobilize people and communities and strengthen Fiji\u2019s national response to HIV and AIDS. Ministry of Education representatives and initiatives, for example, have had to rely upon church leaders and members to deliver messages of a sexual nature insofar as sexual matters are difficult to discuss openly and in public. Chaudhary (2003-2004: 56) noted that a huge shift had occurred quickly; \u201cFive years back the churches would not tolerate any issue on HIV or sex to be discusse[d] in their congregations,\u201d he notes, though now \u201cit has somehow opened its doors for the followers to learn about HIV issues by holding discussions in the churches and youth forums with the help of medical staff.\u201d To its great credit, the Methodist Church of Fiji now observes National not World AIDS Day on the first Sunday of December, not on the first day of December overall. In Fiji, religious settings, figures and practices are the lenses through which matters of sexual health and behavior are understood and acted upon. Some Fijians adhere to religious dictates (or say they believe in them), for example, in stressing the A or the B of ABC. Some Fijians specifically oppose them (or say they do so), for example, in being lesbian or having sex as a man with another man or supporting gay-, lesbian-, and transgender-friendly causes. Some Fijians profess belief systems that mandate one thing while their actual behaviors are otherwise. Many devout Catholics yet use condoms to prevent pregnancies or STI transmission. In any event, introduced religious edicts and pre-European contact mores guide (sexual) morality in Fiji. Nevertheless, those same edicts and mores are also highly flammable zones of contestation (Kaitani 2003; Tora 2006; George 2008; White 2005). For these and other reasons, relationships between religion and AIDS, religious beliefs and HIV transmission, and faithful and empirical treatment of HIV infection are extremely tangled. Moreover, HIV and AIDS and neo- Pentecostal movements around the world have each emerged and spread in the same settings and contexts, for example, of globalization, poverty, women\u2019s oppression, and structural adjustment policies (see Dilger 2007: 64). Religious discourses can fan the flames of transmission and stigma instead of putting them out (Takyi 2003). Roura 70 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 71 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks et al. (2010) showed that one-third of all Tanzanians believe that prayer can cure HIV because its transmission was \u201cthe work of Satan.\u201d Many studies conducted in African countries found that local populations believed fervently that HIV transmission was a form of punishment from God, expressed a high degree of fatalism about its prevention, indicated that fervent prayer and strong faith can cure HIV infection, and accounted for transmission in terms of beliefs in demonic forces and sin (for a partial sampling, see Zou et al. 2009; Wanyama et al. 2007; Lagard et al. 2000; Deribe et al. 2008; Mshana et al. 2006; Hess and McKinney 2007; Dilger 2007; Adogame 2007; Adogame 2007; Roura et al. 2010; Odimegwu 2005; Nweneka 2007; Wilkens 2009). Religious figures and discourses have been shown in many studies conducted in the Pacific to enable unprotected sex, to misinform and disinform about prevention methods, to induce stigma, and to reinscribe masculine authority in the home and as regards sexual practice (Hammar 1998, 2007, 2008, 2010b, c; Wardlow 2008; McPherson 2008; Eves 2008, 2010). In Fiji, gays, lesbians and transgendered persons are stigmatized for their non-heterosexual identities and behaviors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bcdc495-45fd-4d56-a314-449bff43fa24": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bcdc495-45fd-4d56-a314-449bff43fa24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d35fd0ce6e3f70a872e4f1c299f78b5ef44757de660d4f1615483082b8ff5f44"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7f392bb-cdce-4ef4-8d76-cc36004e002c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35309869cd40e1bdc87af912e58fa85db969e71240b476d42e7f341cb674ba55"}}, "hash": "8182590477550ef37e18edd73f67f6bf4ad23503ca881554b7d563198df4d470", "text": "Some fundamentalist Christian interpretations of sexual identities and comportment have demonized same-sex relationships \u201cas the perceived harbinger of HIV-AIDS.

Of our respondents who voiced opinions on the matter, most expressed belief that most other Fijians believe in the efficacy of religious faith, herbal medicines, laying on of hands, Christian prayer and other means of treating if not also curing HIV. During our focus group discussions with health care workers, for example, we asked them \u201cAre people going in for faith healing or prayer [to cure HIV]?\u201d and three respondents said \u201cYes!\u201d in unison. One of them said \u201cYes, I came across a pastor who prayed, uh, I mean, uh, a patient, and then later found out that the patient became negative. And he was a positive case and then after, chain prayers and groups praying for him, you know, praying for him, it disappeared.\u201d Another told a very personal story: \u201cI gave birth to my son in 2004, 2003, eh, and he was tested positive. Uh, we prayed for him, we fast for him. Uh, they have a final blood test for him that\u2019s, uh, one year, six months, 18 months, so for first six months he was tested positive and we kept on praying for him. Turns out he was negative.\u201d When we asked for other, seemingly specific examples, a health care worker reported that \u201cAt home, I mean, at the church, we are Seven Days [Seventh Day Adventists]. We had one youth, uh, he\u2019s a positive, like, uh, every two weeks, every two Sundays, we have to prayer, make a special chain prayer for this [HIVab+ person].\u201d When we asked whether or not it cured the person, the speaker indicated that such prayer worked to the extent to which the person attended church. \u201cSometimes, sometimes he doesn\u2019t attend church,\u201d said one health care worker, while another one added \u201cIt\u2019s basically, the principle is, as a Christian, people believe that, by the stripe of Jesus Christ we are healed. There is a scripture quotation.\u201d Yet another two health workers agreed with the earlier story of prayer having led to the seroconversion of an HIVab+ infant: \u201cJust adding on to your sister, over here, I think medical miracles will happen, but it will only happen if you are identified at early stage, [faith cures of HIV], so from my point of view, in this case, those two people were identified very early stages\u201d; \u201cI would disagree with that [i.e., prayer can cure HIV at any \u201cstage\u201d], because [the man] who got it in \u201998 was a bit towards the end of it. So, it was just a miracle thing that happened that day. Because even the relative couldn\u2019t go close to him, because he was getting, you know, smelling, smell, which, sores, on his body which didn\u2019t heal, and then, but the pastor kept on going. These health care workers, despite our repeated probing, did not, however, believe that coconut oil, \u201cFiji medicine,\u201d and Noni juice could cure HIV (although others did). When we asked about the purported curing of an HIVab+ person by the Greece-born, U.S.-based televangelist Benny Hinn, in Suva, in 2008, they were adamant that, as one put it, \u201cThey have to have faith.\u201d When asked whether cures of the non-believing could be effected, they replied, in unison, \u201cNo,\u201d and then one added: \u201cFor, to have, to be effective in prayer, if the patient is on the wheel chair, he has to have faith, if it\u2019s, if that\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s not only the pastor.\u201d When we asked, hypothetically, \u201cOkay, and let\u2019s say if all seven of us in this room are HIV+ and we go and we have 110% faith, trust that this is going to work . . .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee7c91f9-6601-4ac9-a101-9dd798abdd1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee7c91f9-6601-4ac9-a101-9dd798abdd1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e48e2015a14ac336a6134392ccd44d4970bb6845b2f3a401a3d078a42bf765e"}, "2": {"node_id": "79518bc7-236c-44ea-8af2-4fa8e67da6e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77ac21417aca8a97d6396a71115f3a64ed82b18bc3135539ebce83c1905551bb"}}, "hash": "083969ee14deee0d54f41fb65a3cf3f53b9549a7d4d3fc10b61dea6030f6eba0", "text": ". . ,\u201c again, in unison, they answered \u201cYes.\u201d Taxi-cab drivers and their Intimate Partners expressed many of the same opinions in both focus group and individual interviews.

He was diagnosed with HIV some years ago and after taking medicine for sometimes, her condition deteriorated and he decided to become a devoted Christian [and] from then, he became well and till today he is free from HIV. 72 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 73 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks During his concept map interview conducted a few days later, this woman\u2019s husband, a taxi-cab driver, clarified that \u201cHIV is transmitted through sexual intercourse, but if you drink a lot of herbal medicine you can protect yourself from it,\u201d and that he was currently taking it: \u201cYes, I have tried it myself; [it cures] all kinds of diseases . . . Yes. HIV and any other sickness.\u201d One of his compatriots said during his interview, \u201cAlso, as we may have heard or known about traditional medicine, Fijian medicine, that is, plants and herbs, like, many have used as a cure [emphasized] and it has also been proven to be an effective method of prevention. Because many people believe that, when they drink, it cures [emphasized] their sexually transmitted infections completely.\u201d A third taxi-cab driver said \u201cand also try drinking a lot of traditional medicine or Fijian medicine because there\u2019s plenty around and it\u2019s available in abundance,\u201d but also, to prevent infection in the first place, \u201ctry, be, stay at home and have only one partner . . . He should go to the hospital first for the sake of confirming his/her HIV status. Once confirmed positive, then [he] should go to church for faith healing, and only if person believe from his heart that he could be healed from HIV through the power of God [will he be healed].\u201d One spouse of a Christian pastor, a woman who learned that her husband was taking HIV medications [though he had not disclosed such to her], said \u201cIn some cases, spiritually, healers [gasping], if you have that HIV and he seek spiritually for priest and if you, if you have the, if you fully, fully have faith, in God, it will definitely cure, yeah. I\u2019ve heard that case, I\u2019ve seen it and I believe in it, too. Yeah.\u201d Her compatriot then added, \u201cIf you have faith in God, [then] obviously you can be cured.\u201d When we asked then about any other treatments for HIV she knew, one wife said \u201cthere are some traditional medical healers,\u201d those who use Noni juice to treat HIV: \u201cNoni, in Fijian that\u2019s kura.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acc0208b-07d3-47ac-9a92-0ada52570cb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "acc0208b-07d3-47ac-9a92-0ada52570cb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5207cc91fb4aa9fd98b608f40c4690d4c1ffa13e2efbc4001434450e3e4bf864"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba1d226b-91c5-48a0-bd6a-593ba3f9ee4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4433004f0847f8c4481029c5ba5d0f970bb6cf00e610fe4173e12f34f6fe3141"}}, "hash": "09596a406ae55596e5e84719b0e0617df858ad0a0fdd085e6fb22a130fd12906", "text": "The fruit from the tree, you squash it and then you boil it and then you strain it and you drink the juice, from that Noni juice.\u201d Another participant, gesturing in the direction of the first speaker whose husband was on HIV medications, also said \u201cThey are using [Noni juice] for other things, but that\u2019s what she said about her husband.\u201d We then asked the wives specifically about the efficacy of prayer and faith healing in treating HIV.

Another husband then mentioned a concentrated form of \u201cgrog\u201d (yaqona) that, when drunk in this concentrated form, could cure just about anything, including the symptoms of AIDS, but not HIV itself: \u201cIt will cure the disease but we do not know the virus is still inside.\u201d It can also be used to treat tona, he said. Summary discussion of important contextual issues \u201cTo me, whenever one of the partner cross the fence and have extramarital sex with another partner he or she can get infected with the disease HIV, can further developed into AIDS and following that is death.

The models of HIV and STI risk they have developed, including ideas about with whom they should and with whom they do not need to use condoms, have become so deeply internalized as to be almost invisible. Our study found that Fijian self-assessments of HIV and STI transmission risks are externalized, away from intimate partners and encounters, such that boyfriends don\u2019t for the most part think they need to use condoms with girlfriends, nor husbands with wives. Wives and girlfriends may want to use condoms, and they seem more suspicious of their husbands and boyfriends than are their husbands and boyfriends suspicious about them. Nevertheless, they tend to hold back from pressing for safer sex and greater communication about these issues in favor of relying on \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201clove\u201d and \u201cfaith\u201d in a partner\u2019s fidelity and uninfectedness. Sex workers showed no lesser desire to attempt to promote and project intimacy by non-use of condoms with Intimate Partners than did Christian pastors. University students appear to believe in the efficacy of trust and love and hand-holding in much 76 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 77 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks the same way as do the wives of taxi-cab drivers. The boyfriends and husbands of sex workers\u2014even in the face of contrary evidence, lots of it\u2014want just as badly to believe in the fidelity of their sex worker girlfriends and wives as do the boyfriends of other gay males\u2014again, despite evidence to the contrary. Kaitani found also that Fijian male youths had received poor sexual health education, but we found the same deficits at work amongst Fijian women and girls, too. Her finding that Christian male youths commenced their sexual lives earlier than had non-believers and that they exhibited greater numbers of sexual partners, lifetime, and a higher frequency of sexual partner change, too, than non-believers (2003: 183) may strike some as counter- intuitive. Our study shows that, whatever \u201ctraditional\u201d ideals of masculinity and femininity may be and have been (see especially White 2005; George 2008; Kaitani 2003), Intimate Partner transmission of HIV is in Fiji as elsewhere a real and perhaps growing risk. Fijians have obviously, deeply, and sincerely internalized mainstream public health messages\u2014including the tenets of the ABC platform\u2014just as surely as they have externalized their STI and HIV transmission risks. We conclude from our various experiences and preliminary analysis of our data that \u201cawareness\u201d campaigns and public health messages and workshop and seminar participation has not led to the deep and nuanced self- assessments of HIV and STI transmission risk that are grounded in the cognitive and behavioral realities of intimate partnerships. Our (quite reasonable) prediction prior to beginning the field research component of the project was that Fijians, just like Americans, have not been led more deeply and critically to develop their knowledge bases beyond the level of posters and pamphlets, slogans and catch-phrases. The internalized message seems to be that if one can avoid sex with strangers, avoid having multiple partners, can \u201ctrust\u201d in one\u2019s partner, can have faith in God, and so on, one will prevent HIV transmission. Moreover, even if per chance HIV transmission should occur, a large number of our respondents believe deeply that there are many faith, herbal, aqueous and other medicines available. Recommendations 1. Fijians can and must be challenged not to externalize their HIV and STI transmission risks, away from Self, away from Intimate Partner, away even from one\u2019s family, faith, and community. This requires earnest and meaningful revamping of public health posters, policies, and messages that do not yet include the relational terms of wife and husband, boyfriend and girlfriend. We believe that great benefit would ensue were special posters to be designed and disseminated that said, in effect, \u201cThis is your husband. He is the one most likely to infect you if you have sex without condoms or if he is forcing you to have sex\u201d or \u201cthis sex worker, because she uses condoms with her client, is lowering the risk of transmission; it\u2019s too bad that she doesn\u2019t use them with her husband.\u201d 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9762308d-3a77-4046-8da1-d22178697453": {"__data__": {"id_": "9762308d-3a77-4046-8da1-d22178697453", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66f8386c732ea833f5e088351a023eba0654cfe9c05adb81b20a3b148d9d4016"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ae1787d-e818-4c24-bdd1-63f7fb492a33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7c22c86cc50286cc091401c9eadf3ced15d918bfc260e77f8599011440fb594"}}, "hash": "7d1acfb79ab23830312fc4a2e0efc689e4fd1c18bb277c2771349ba725bafa17", "text": "Condom use must be constructed as an effective means of preventing unwanted pregnancies and HIV and STI, not as something that one uses only in a commercial sexual encounter or with a stranger.

As is the case in Thailand (Fordham 2005) and Papua New Guinea (Hammar 2006, 2010a), there is a sincere desire among Fijians that non-standard HIV medications can be shown to \u201cwork,\u201d that herbal medicines, faith healing, Kura juice, prayer, injections of Vitamin C, coconut oil, \u201cdeep seawater,\u201d taking \u201ctreatment breaks,\u201d and the like, will work in preventing HIV transmission and curing HIV infection. Belief in the efficacy of such was shared by the HIVab- and the HIVab+ alike. The Fiji Ministry of Health recognized that even members of some HIV advocacy organizations share these beliefs. We think this is not just a \u201cone off problem that has since been addressed\u201d (2010: 27), but is instead a real problem that is likely to become the more so. We recommend that the Fiji Ministry of Health take the leading role in monitoring and responding quickly and firmly if it appears that such beliefs are delaying or blunting the effectiveness of HIV medications and their roll-out. Because the \u201cHub Centres\u201d seem to be spoken of quite highly in terms of access, services, and personnel, we think that they make natural allies in this fight, but to do so, the work will need to be done also outside the clinic, not just in it. Additionally, formative research might be undertaken in those clinics and other healthcare settings, with those clinicians and other health professionals, regarding their beliefs and belief systems. Considerable research efforts in Papua New Guinea, to take just one country in the Pacific (e.g., Hammar 2010a; Dundon 2007; Wardlow 2008), shows that there really aren\u2019t (m)any purely secular, \u201cscientific\u201d settings of healthcare provision. 4. We recommend that HIV social research be expanded in Fiji, beginning with exploration of this very issue. \u201cFiji medicine,\u201d prayer, and extra-virgin, cold-pressed coconut oil will undoubtedly become even more preferable to Fijians as treatment or prophylaxis. They afford relative anonymity. They cost relatively little. Most Fijians have easy access to them. Qualitative research is needed to explore whether Fijians desire \u201cFiji medicine,\u201d \u201cPure Spring Water\u201d and \u201cdeep seawater\u201d because they are created in Fiji by Fijians. Graham Fordham 78 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks 79 Me, My Intimate Par tner, and HIV: Fijian self-assessments of transmission risks notes that Thai people prefer Thai \u201cbush medicines\u201d for their reputed authenticity (2005: 112-117). The new \u201ctraditional healers\u201d in Papua New Guinea, too, claim similarly to have found the source of their bush medicines \u201cdeep in the forest,\u201d and this appeals to Papua New Guineans. \u201cDeep seawater,\u201d \u201cpure Fiji spring water,\u201d \u201cFiji medicine,\u201d and the like, are lauded in Suva for probably some of the same reasons, and so are claims made by faith healers about the efficacy of prayer and laying on of hands. Public health authorities and religious leaders alike, lay persons no less than specialists, should take these emerging issues extremely seriously. They will surely hamper a more effective roll-out of antiretroviral medications should such soon become necessary. In doing so, they should look for guidance to the extraordinarily well developed qualitative, ethnographic literature about these topics. 5. We recommend strengthening the national capacity in qualitative HIV social research. This project has proved that it is cost-effective and life affirming to engage \u201dnon-specialist\u201d community members in such endeavor. We suggest that the training workshop we have developed should be extended in several directions and that each such holding of a workshop must be linked to specific, relevant and feasible, if modest, research studies. The holding of such workshops would build research capacities in said organizations, thus lessening dependence on foreign dollars, sponsors and consultants. Also, and perhaps more importantly, it would increase the likelihood of the uptake of such qualitative findings as emerge in ways that benefit those organizations. 6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68a45430-f533-4122-beac-083da3b7d6f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "68a45430-f533-4122-beac-083da3b7d6f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e11b917c618a6c3d16247c4fa2ffa5de28c6ec6e6bc4636d342dd99f291c365f"}, "2": {"node_id": "857ddee7-bb37-4378-8fcc-476ed8ea80c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9a3bc0325564bf7c23e8fee2384fab0e80559868bf82e60eb3ee45e91b0da40"}}, "hash": "92b3a763a5d43fc1d1872e8fac65568ee9df239bcb7dc0ab859314ed6122cbee", "text": "6.

Another two were terminated for unprofessional conduct. 3 After extensive deliberation and in keeping with the mandate of the Research Ethics Committee request (whom we again thank for their good work in helping to clarify research aims and goals), we decided upon $10 for participation in each leg of the study, and then also $5 (more in some cases) for those who needed to take a taxi to us. No one complained at the amount of the reimbursement and there is no evidence of anyone feeling overly coerced to participate. 4 Fabienne Labb\u00e9 noted that most of her HIVab+ key informants were indigenous Fijians and that \u201cNot one of Indo-Fijians living with HIV was available to participate in the study\u201d (2010: 5). Her sample consisted of 25/28 ethnic Fijians and three persons of \u201cmixed\u201d origins, including one who was \u201cpart European\u201d and two who traced ancestry also to the Solomon islands (2010: 8). 5 Labb\u00e9\u2019s report (2010) also notes that two of 10 men learned of their Intimate Partner\u2019s HIVab+ serostatus as a result of that partner\u2019s pregnancy, their partners themselves learning of their serostatus as a result of receiving antenatal services. Thirteen people found out about their seroconversion after they or their partner had begun to experience signs and symptoms of HIV infection. This is to say that people may learn of their serostatus relatively late but not necessarily because their partner is/partners are purposely choosing not to disclose such to them. From her special vantage point as Research Officer of the Pacific Islands AIDS Foundation (PIAF), Hilary Gorman noted (in a personal communication) that PIAF has started to conduct \u201cRights and Responsibilities\u201d workshops for both people living with HIV and AIDS and those who provide HIVab testing and counseling services. Rumor has it that their programs will shortly be offered to Fiji School of Medicine students.

These medicines are administered in multiple ways, including having been prayed over. Labb\u00e9 says that such medicines used allegedly to cure HIV are \u201cof two types,\u201d that is, \u201cFijian\u201d herbs, liquid, tree bark and other plant materials, and then \u201chybrids,\u201d which combine these \u201cFijian\u201d substances and concoctions with spiritual prayer, for example, \u201ccoconut oil on which words of blessing are uttered and which is afterwards drunk according to Fijian medicine conventions\u201d (2010: 33). 7 Yaqona is the Fijian name for Piper methysticum, also known as kava. It is primary a crop cultivated and consumed in many Pacific Islands cultures. The roots of the plant are pounded or ground and mixed with water to produce a drink with mild anaesthetic and sedative properties. 8 According to the 2007 census cited by the Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics (consulted online): 837, 271. http:// www.statsfiji.gov.fj/Social/popn_summary.htm . 9 Stewart, Mulipola-Lui, and Laidlaw\u2019s study of Fijian concepts of \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d (1980) might be relevant here; they concluded that, when compared to Indo-Fijian and European adolescents, there was a marked tendency of Fijian adolescents to trust people perceived as being close to them (mostly extended family members and co-villagers). 10 Although each of the females self-identified as \u201csex workers,\u201d it is also possible that neither they nor their Intimate Partners identified them as \u201cprostitutes.\u201d Labb\u00e9 made this good point (in a private communication with the author): it is possible that these Fijian females see themselves as \u201csex workers\u201d but the Indo-Fijian females who solicit from in front of the post office and artifact and curio malls identify themselves as \u201cprostitutes.\u201d It is possible, also, that our boyfriend and husband informants draw this distinction, however real or false it may be empirically. It is worth noting that the UNAIDS guide to proper terminology to use in writing documents for UNAIDS sponsors warns against using \u201cprostitute\u201d (unless in case of juveniles being involved) and enjoins the use of \u201csex worker\u201d instead (2008: 5). 11 Reading a preliminary draft of this report, Labb\u00e9 recounted (in a private communication) having heard versions of this story \u201cover and over again, the \u2018injector\u2019 usually being a woman\u201d and including versions in which Suva market-sellers who were HIVab+ were thought purposely to be infecting juices sold thereat. She added further that many of her HIVab+ informants appeared to believe in the truth of these stories, confirming what the author has many, many times heard also in Papua New Guinea. 12 In a private communication, Labb\u00e9 has suggested a different interpretation altogether, however, in essence, that respondents were not so much parroting public health admonitions regarding HIV transmission risk amplification as echoing the social truth that \u201calcohol consumption is considered to be the only circumstance in which women can lose sight of their social obligation to confine sexuality to the context of marital bonds.\u201d Labb\u00e9\u2019s female HIVab+ respondents \u201call said they had sex because they were drunk,\u201d perhaps, she suggests, because females do not yet feel comfortable expressing their own sexual desire per se.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9724a98-35ae-40c9-a388-9e26c1829897": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9724a98-35ae-40c9-a388-9e26c1829897", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Me,My Intimate Partner and HIV: Fijian Self Assessment of Transmission Risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02cf8db3bbe81048b7e16d07181f991f59a3c533023a8facde0d183515d7b2a4"}, "2": {"node_id": "204297f2-3012-491a-8fee-816df6c1f4bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/memy-intimate-partner-and-hiv-fijian-self-assessment-transmission-risk", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9182d95204c2ee4b197ccaf8a213938b2e04c3bcc4370ce88ed629ce04ad38a0"}}, "hash": "c2271496ab7f6cef0e984378858d9181965907825512aa94637e24f19039d358", "text": "There is much merit in Labb\u00e9\u2019s argument here, although the stylized nature of three of the drawings (done in isolation in each case) warrants perhaps an additional explanation, for example, in terms of what respondents had \u201clearned\u201d in workshop settings. 13 Katherine Lepani\u2019s work in the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea on the culture-bound syndrome there known as sovasova (2007) is instructive here.

The Commission on AIDS in Asia predicts that by 2020 the majority of new cases of HIV in Asia will be among MSM and transgender persons. Alarmingly, this is already the case in some of the cities included in this MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative. It is timely that the focus of this Initiative is on cities where large numbers of people are moving for work and education and where anonymity enables more open expression of sexuality and gender identity. We know that the mounting epidemics of HIV among MSM and transgender persons in Asia are most acute in urban settings. The Multi-City HIV Initiative has provided an invaluable mechanism to bring together city officials, leaders from MSM and transgender communities and the private sector to share experiences and strategies across borders. This is exactly the kind of forum that can turn guidance and ideas into real action to reduce new HIV infections, reduce stigma and discrimination towards MSM and transgender persons, and increase access to treatment for those living with HIV. By focusing our efforts in this way we can make a great impact. In building a more effective response to HIV epidemics among MSM and transgender persons we have huge challenges on our hands, but we can build on our successes. There are a diverse range of MSM and transgender persons, including those \u2018hidden\u2019 populations who are not reached by existing, traditional behavioral interventions. Effective public health is about reaching people where they live, work, socialize and study. We need to develop our capacity to be creative by thinking outside the box in developing and delivering behavior change messaging that will reach a significantly greater number of MSM and transgender persons. In our approach to behavior change we need to think about both reducing risk behavior and improving health seeking behavior. The MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative provides an important opportunity for promoting better links between public health prevention programs and care, support and treatment services, while increasing coordination with community programs and private sector health services. MSM and transgender persons will continue to underuse health services if they do not feel safe because of concerns over confidentiality and stigma and discrimination.

Collectively these challenges serve as barriers to innovation and hamper scale up of HIV prevention and care efforts. This tells us that the challenge of preventing HIV infection among MSM and transgender persons is not just a technical problem but also a political problem. The enabling environment is a critical element of an effective response. In the words of the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, \u201ceffective national programs do not punish people; they protect them\u201d. The MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative has enabled the development of new partnerships and the strengthening of existing ones at the city level, working together to ensure impact and stronger results. To scale up the response we will need to continue to work together with an emphasis on equal partnerships and staying the course. It is also important to remember that programs must be inclusive of communities and those living with HIV. MSM and transgender persons, including those living with HIV, must be involved in the design, implementation and monitoring of programs from start to finish. Regional fora such as the Hong Kong Action Planning Meeting provide an excellent opportunity to share our experiences, learn what is working, identify gaps, catalyze innovation and start to foster a new generation of leaders. This MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative provides a vital opportunity to build on the momentum for an effective response to HIV among MSM and transgender persons in Asia. vii Aye Aye Thwin Director, Offi ce of Public Health United States Agency for International Development Regional Development Mission Asia Nicholas Rosellini Deputy Assistant Administrator and Deputy Regional Director Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacifi c United Nations Development Programme Steve Kraus Director, Regional Support Team Asia and the Pacifi c Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS Dr Samlee Plianbangchang Regional Director South East Asia Region World Health Organization Dr Shin Young-soo Regional Director Western Pacifi c Region World Health Organization Dr PY Lam Director of Health Hong Kong, China Shivananda Khan OBE Chair Asia Pacifi c Coalition on Male Sexual Health Shiba Phurailatpam Director Asia Pacifi c Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS viii Acronyms AI appreciative inquiry APCOM Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health APN+ Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS APTN Asia Pacific Transgender Network ART anti-retroviral treatment ASEAN Association of South East Asian Nations BCC behavior change communication BMA Bangkok Metropolitan Administration BRO Bangkok Rainbow Organization CBO community based organization EE entertainment establishments GFATM Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria GLBT gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people GWL-INA Indonesian National Network of Gay, Waria and Lelaki HCPI HIV Corporation Program for Indonesia HTC HIV testing and counseling IBBS integrated bio-behavioral survey ICT information communication technology IEC information, education and communication MAPRs most at risk populations M&E monitoring and evaluation MNMN Myanmar National MSM Network MSM men who have sex with men NGO non-government organization PITC provider initiated testing and counseling PLHIV people living with HIV PNAC Philippines National AIDS Council POZ POZ Home Center PSN Purple Sky Network RETA Resource Estimation Tool for Advocacy RSAT Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand STI sexually transmitted infection SWING Service Workers in Group Foundation TG transgender persons UNAIDS Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS UNDP United Nations Development Programme USAID United States Agency for International Development USAID HPI United States Agency for International Development Health Policy Initiative VCT voluntary counseling and testing WHO/WPRO World Health Organization/Western Pacific Regional Office WHO/SEARO World Health Organization/South East Asia Regional Office ix Definition of men who have sex with men and transgender persons The term \u2018men who have sex with men\u2019 (MSM) has been used in a variety of contexts with different meanings.

The overall goal of the Initiative is to contribute to the scale up of effective, comprehensive and rights-based HIV responses for MSM and transgender persons in the six cities: Bangkok (Thailand), Chengdu (China), Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (Viet Nam), Jakarta (Indonesia), Manila (Philippines) and Yangon (Myanmar). The focus on these large cities recognizes that it is in urban locations where HIV infection among MSM and transgender persons is concentrated. Implementation of the MSM and TG Multi-City Initiative is made up of five phases: 1. Developing the methodology for the city scans and training of local consultants. 2. Scanning and analyzing the response to HIV in MSM and transgender persons in each of the six cities, with a focus on identifying promising practices and strategies. 3. Synthesizing lessons learned and promising strategies from the city scans. 4. Bringing the six cities together in December 2010 in a regional Action Planning Meeting where each of the cities developed their own action plan, building upon the learning from the scans. 5. Implementing the action plans in 2011. This report provides an outline of the rationale and approach taken by the MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative, including key issues and lessons emerging from the city scans and a summary of the key inputs at the Action Planning Meeting in Hong Kong. Most importantly, the report contains the action plans developed by each of the cities and details of how regional partners will support implementation of these plans. Hong Kong and Singapore took on the role of resource cities during the Action Planning Meeting by sharing critical success factors in their responses to HIV among MSM and transgender persons. Key features of the response by both these cities were strong collaboration between city governments, NGOs, MSM and transgender communities and the private sector, the development of innovative approaches to prevention and the promotion of HIV testing, linked to care and treatment. A key conclusion arising from the meeting is that strengthening the ability of health systems to respond effectively to concentrated epidemics in stigmatized and marginalized populations requires public, private and community sector engagement to address fears or unwillingness to use government services. An inspiring feature of the Action Planning Meeting was the willingness of the cities to learn from both the resource cities and each other.

And throughout the meeting there was sharing of experience and advice given on how to implement innovative activities and offers of ongoing technical assistance following the meeting. The action plans indicate that city delegations were mindful of the comprehensive package of services needed for an effective response. This is reflected in the development of activities tailored to addressing the priority needs for each city. Strategic information has been used well by the cities in identifying priorities upon which actions are based. For example, a number of plans identified reaching young MSM and transgender persons as a priority in response to incidence data showing high rates of infection. Actions are also based on previously identified issues, confirmed by the city scans, such as the need to significantly increase MSM and transgender person\u2019s uptake of HIV counseling and testing and STI services. The city action plans are focused on concrete steps to build on existing programs. Indeed, not all actions are new activities. This reflects a practical and realistic approach which increases the likelihood of successful implementation. The action plans reflect a logical foundation in that one activity leads to the next. For example, Yangon planned to finalize the formation of the National MSM Network. Following this, Network members will receive advocacy training which will in turn be used in relationship building with local government and the public health sector. All of the plans addressed technical assistance needs with a particular focus on skills development. A feature of the plans is smart use of existing resources. For example, in Chengdu, the staff of the STI clinic will be used to provide outreach services at the sauna. Similarly, all city plans considered existing services and resources available to support their actions. xiii Actions are mainly evidence based, with some innovation. For example, in Chengdu a pilot of rapid oral testing for HIV is planned to be conducted by a CBO. There is also recognition of the need to modernize aspects of the response. For example, the HCMC, Jakarta and Manila action plans focused on how to better use information communication technologies (ICT) such as internet-based platforms as part of a reinvigorated approach to enhance the scale and scope of behavior change communication initiatives. Communication and use of social networking and ICT features highly in the action plans. There is a commitment to communicating more effectively, including to those currently not being reached by programs. It has been recognized that communication is a complex area that requires its own specialized technical support. The action plans have a strong focus on comprehensive and integrated approaches to prevention which signal a move away from a disease-centric to a person-centric and more holistic approach. Overall the plans have a stronger emphasis on HIV testing and a comparatively lesser emphasis on care and treatment. This perhaps reflects the key role testing plays as the entry point to care and treatment. However, with high HIV prevalence rates, increasing numbers of HIV positive MSM and transgender persons will need to access care and treatment services and cities need to be prepared for this. A number of the activities are specifically about improving collaboration and coordination and all activities involve enhanced coordination and collaboration, often between a wide range of partners, and especially with city governments. The need for improved collaboration with police was a strong feature of city scans and presentations at the Action Planning Meeting. Actions in this area have been planned by a number of cities. The central involvement of MSM and transgender communities in owning and delivering the response to HIV is evident in all plans. Good examples of this are the active engagement of Bangkok MSM and transgender person\u2019s organizations in the development of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration\u2019s next AIDS strategy and the development of the Myanmar National MSM Network. A recurring theme of the Action Planning Meeting was that coverage and intensity of effort are essential for impact, coupled with targeting of those most at risk in venues and places where risk activities most commonly occur. To do this successfully, close collaboration between national and city governments, MSM, CBOs, transgender CBOs, and the private sector is needed. Implementation of the city action plans will significantly strengthen the response of each city and help to contain the HIV epidemics among MSM and transgender persons which are currently out of control. 1 Section 1: Outline of the MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative Epidemiology of HIV infection among MSM and transgender persons in Asia1 HIV is now widespread among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender (TG) persons", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85d1a089-3b83-44f8-9785-fba2b44db4ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "85d1a089-3b83-44f8-9785-fba2b44db4ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men who have sex with men and transgender populations: Multi-City Initiative - City Scans and Action Planning Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6732a2cdf9035b172e92de5cd10cae819a6e0531e86507e7196961b773d0291"}, "3": {"node_id": "86ba765c-fd42-43b7-ab8e-dd2a76ee7172", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe8b7e3efc6e5be732e9f207ee8daaaa5c2aa32d667569114736bd15abd98f16"}}, "hash": "74272cdbdc52c1399f82b724ff7c5dbdefe205b2971b3c1e4de01ca97cf57f57", "text": "throughout Asia. (Defi nitions of MSM and transgender persons are on page vi.) The most recently available data from the six cities shows alarmingly high rates of HIV: \u2022 Yangon: in 2007 HIV prevalence among MSM in the HSS survey was 23.5%. In the 2009 survey, prevalence was 12.5%. A wider sample of MSM was surveyed in 2009 which may explain the lower prevalence. Intensifying prevention eff orts needs to be continued. \u2022 Jakarta: HIV prevalence among MSM in Jakarta increased four-fold from 2% in 2003 to 8.1% in 2007. Over the same period, HIV prevalence among transgender persons increased from 25% to 34%. \u2022 Bangkok: HIV prevalence in cross-sectional surveys of MSM increased rapidly from 17% in 2003 to 31% in 2010. HIV prevalence among MSM attending the Silom Community Clinic increased from 25% in 2005 to 35% in 2010. HIV incidence in the MSM Cohort Study averaged 6% over the last four years. Incidence was highest among young MSM aged 18-21, with 30% becoming HIV infected over 4 years. \u2022 Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC): HIV prevalence among MSM almost tripled between 2006 and 2009, rising from 5.3% to 14.8%. Over the same period HIV prevalence among Hanoi MSM increased from 9.4% to 17.3%. These rapid increases in HIV prevalence are similar to the Bangkok pattern. \u2022 Chengdu: in 2007 HIV prevalence among MSM in Chengdu was 9.1%. The Chinese data confi rms the experiences in other cities that shows that HIV epidemics among MSM can grow very quickly. \u2022 Philippines: reported cases of HIV among MSM have been skyrocketing. Newly reported HIV and AIDS cases among MSM more than quadrupled between 2006 and 2009. MSM accounted for approximately 70% of all new HIV case reports in 2008-2009. Developed Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan): following rapid increases in newly diagnosed HIV infection among MSM, commencing in the early 2000\u2019s, there has been a leveling-off in new HIV case reports in recent years. In Asia, the odds of MSM having HIV infection is 18.7 times that of someone in the general population. The Asian Epidemic Model projects that unless eff ective prevention measures are intensifi ed, by 2020 around half (46%) of new infections in Asia will be among MSM, up from 13% in 2008. Advances in bio-medical research Bio-medical prevention trials are showing promising results. The CAPRISA vaginal microbicide gel study found that HIV infection was 39% lower in women who used tenofi vir gel during sexual intercourse.2 Money needs to be invested in the development and testing of rectal microbicide gels. The iPrEx trial demonstrated that Truvada\u2122, combined with a comprehensive package of prevention services, had an effi cacy of 44% in preventing HIV infection among MSM, although adherence to the medication was a concern.3 For participants who adhered to daily dosing, effi cacy was much higher. Additional research is needed on intermittent dosing, use of diff erent ARVs, combination use of oral and topical products, and biological and behavioral safety. Guidance is needed on how to operationalize the fi ndings from this research. The strengthened regional response A notable feature of the response to HIV in Asia in recent years has been a signifi cant strengthening of regional collaboration to address the alarming HIV epidemics among MSM and transgender persons. 1 This sub-section is based on a presentation at the Action Planning Meeting by Dr Frits van Griensven, Thailand Ministry of Public Health \u2013 US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Collaboration. 2 www.sciencexpress.org 20 July, 2010. 3 New England Journal of Medicine, online November 23, 2010. 2 Regional and sub-regional networks The Asia Pacifi c Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) was formed in 2007 as a direct outcome of the Consultation on Male Sexual Health and HIV in Asia and the Pacifi c, also known as Risks and Responsibilities, held in New Delhi in 2006.

Sub-regional MSM and transgender networks now cover all parts of east and south east Asia in which the MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative is operating. They are the Purple Sky Network, (covering the greater Mekong sub- region), the Insular Southeast Asia Network, the China Male Tongzhi Sexual Health Forum and the Developed Asia Network. Regional fora and publications In early 2009, the World Health Organization\u2019s Western Pacifi c Regional Offi ce (WHO/WPRO) led a regional consultation in Hong Kong on Health Sector Responses to HIV among MSM in collaboration with UNDP and the Hong Kong Department of Health. The consultation reached consensus on the role of the health sector and identifi ed areas where its response needed to be strengthened. In mid-2009 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), in partnership with other agencies, convened a regional consultation in Bangkok tasked with defi ning a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among MSM and TG Populations in Asia and the Pacifi c. This regional framework covers the continuum of prevention, treatment and care services, supported by an enabling environment and informed by strategic information. Based on the comprehensive framework, WHO developed guidance detailing the Priority HIV and Sexual Health Interventions in the Health Sector for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in the Asia-Pacifi c Region (2010). This ground- breaking publication defi nes the HIV and STI-related health sector interventions needed by MSM and transgender persons in the areas of prevention, care support and treatment. In late 2009, USAID and UNDP, in collaboration with a broad range of partners, convened a regional Consultation on MSM HIV Care and Support. The meeting was held in recognition of the need to scale up HIV care, support and treatment services for MSM and transgender persons. The meeting provided valuable technical and programmatic guidance on the delivery of an integrated continuum of services from prevention interventions to care and treatment for MSM and transgender persons living with HIV. In May 2010, UNDP and APCOM, in collaboration with the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, hosted a High level dialogue on punitive laws, human rights and HIV prevention among men who have sex with men in the Asia Pacifi c Region. The meeting and publication of the same name drew high level policy attention to the impact of punitive laws and human rights abuses on eff ective HIV responses among MSM and transgender persons. Subsequently, in July 2010, UNDP released the publication Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacifi c: An agenda for action, detailing how punitive laws, policies and practices negatively impact on comprehensive HIV responses. In late 2010, WHO\u2019s South-East Asia Regional Offi ce (SEARO) issued the publication HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men and transgender populations in South East Asia. The current situation and national responses. This is an important advocacy document for the nine countries surveyed. The regional work of the UN, USAID and APCOM and the regional consultations outlined above have brought together a broad range of partners to develop policy and programmatic guidance, share experiences and lessons learned and to strengthen advocacy for urgently needed scale up. The MSM and TG Multi-City Initiative was the next signifi cant regional collaboration eff ort. 3 Rationale for the MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative This Initiative brings together six cities across Asia to consider their current capacities and potential for scaling up HIV responses for MSM and transgender persons. The Initiative supports the six cities in interpreting and applying the Comprehensive Package of Services framework, endorsed by the 2009 Bangkok regional consultation, at the local implementation level of the city. The overall goal of the Initiative is to contribute to the scale up of eff ective, comprehensive and rights-based HIV responses for MSM and transgender persons in the six cities and in other parts of Asia. The objectives of the Initiative are to: 1. Explore city level HIV prevention eff orts, available resources, epidemiological data and MSM and transgender population size estimations. 2. Use the available data to assess gaps in the HIV response in each city using the comprehensive package of services for MSM and transgender persons. 3. Inform and facilitate strategic planning for each city during the Hong Kong Action Planning Meeting.

These cities were selected based on a combination of city population size, trends in HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender persons, availability of existing resources and/or the existence of a response involving government working with civil society. These cities represent a spectrum of HIV prevalence among MSM, diff erent types of HIV responses, and variation in the size and visibility of the MSM and transgender populations. Why focus on cities? In those countries where cross-sectional studies of HIV prevalence amongst MSM have been conducted in multiple locations, there has been signifi cant variation in HIV prevalence between sites. HIV prevalence has generally been higher in the largest cities in the country. This demonstrates that there is no one single HIV epidemic among MSM across the country, but rather a number of localized epidemics which are likely to be linked. Increased mobility within countries may result in HIV transmission spreading from MSM in one city (especially a country\u2019s largest city) to MSM in other cities. All of the above points to the need to accord high priority to combating HIV epidemics among MSM in large cities with established HIV epidemics and where the risk of HIV transmission is highest. It is also possible that travel by MSM within the region is a factor contributing to the spread of HIV. For example, it is known that signifi cant numbers of MSM visit major cities in the region for business and leisure and have sex with male sex workers and non-commercial male partners. In addition, the needs of cities are often overlooked by national planning bodies. However, with the trend towards decentralization, cities often have the authority to plan and fund localized responses, consistent with national strategies. A focus on HIV prevention including behavior change communication In order to address the alarming rise in HIV cases among MSM and transgender persons it is necessary to focus on both risk reduction and improving health seeking behavior. A key focus of the city scans and analysis and subsequent action planning was HIV prevention, including behavior change communication (BCC) programming. BCC encompasses a range of strategies that include health messaging using mass media, targeted media and conversations carried out by peer educators or other behavior change agents. BCC strategies using mass and targeted media have the potential to reach large numbers of MSM and transgender persons by utilizing media such as billboards, television, radio, print, and information communications technology, including the internet and mobile telephony. However, most BCC work in the region is restricted to small group and one-to-one peer education and targeting of more visible MSM and transgender persons. Reducing HIV transmission among MSM and transgender populations requires reaching much higher numbers and will require multiple methods including use of mass and targeted media to reach a broader range of MSM and TG. 4 A view among HIV practitioners is that a key barrier to scaling up work in this area is lack of knowledge and experience by local health authorities and implementation partners in utilizing mass media for BCC. However, there are a number of examples at provincial and national levels of utilization of broader health promotion social marketing campaigns and health messaging to extend the reach of HIV prevention services to MSM and transgender persons.4 These examples provide potential case studies that can assist local leaders and practitioners in large cities to better understand how to scale up through coordination with a range of systems and sectors. Key steps for the MSM and TG Multi-City HIV Initiative The fi rst phase of the Initiative consisted of four key activities: 1. Developing the methodology for the city scans and recruiting and training local consultants to conduct the scans. 2. Scanning and analyzing the response to HIV in MSM and transgender populations in each of the six cities. 3. Synthesizing of the city scans to identify lessons learned and promising strategies. 4. Bringing the six cities together in a regional meeting to develop an action plan for each city. Six city scans and analysis To ensure practical and actionable outcomes from the Action Planning Meeting, scans were undertaken in each of the six cities before the Hong Kong meeting to gather information, identify promising practices, organizations and individuals and assist local leaders to identify next steps for city scale up of HIV-related responses for MSM and transgender persons. The objectives of the city scans were to: 1. Document the potential within each of the six cities for the scale up of a comprehensive, rights-based HIV response among MSM and transgender persons using the key", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32457d91-6036-4d04-9ae3-c209e2fa428f": {"__data__": {"id_": "32457d91-6036-4d04-9ae3-c209e2fa428f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men who have sex with men and transgender populations: Multi-City Initiative - City Scans and Action Planning Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74da64e5187a7da34619becadb821e18b5399b173bf90a1f26db0d788403122e"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a8c5064-2896-4320-a66d-2ef59f1de8e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9698e3448bc5565ffdff17c52946a5217439b60652ebdd6ed7de909eb2278e6b"}}, "hash": "e923bd028a7f49db55c33bbe7dd1b8ee84f1d6d80f30419777af941aba52721d", "text": "components of the Comprehensive Response to HIV Services for MSM and Transgender Persons in Asia Pacifi c \u2013 (a) prevention, (b) care, support and treatment, (c) enabling environment and (d) strategic information. 2.

Provide an opportunity to describe good and innovative practices to key leaders in the region and to consider their implications in the local context. 6. Facilitate local action plans for scale up of HIV responses among MSM and transgender persons in the six cities. The scans were conducted by local consultants working in close collaboration with a core group of stakeholders, including national AIDS programs, municipal governments, MSM and transgender networks and working groups, CBOs, the private sector, donors, UN agencies, INGOs and other technical assistance agencies. A standard methodology for how to conduct the scans was developed and the local consultant from each city attended a two-day training session in Bangkok on how to apply the methodology. This promoted consistency in the way each city scan was conducted. The methodology included a desk review of information detailing the local response and meetings of key stakeholders to identify previous and current HIV interventions for MSM and transgender persons, using an appreciative inquiry approach. Limitations for the city scans identifi ed by the local consultants were the time available in which to conduct the scan (generally one week), lack of availability of some stakeholders and the local political context. The city scans took place in September and October, 2010. 4 See the following internet pages for examples of these types of campaigns: http://regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th/practices/hivaids/Publications.html http://www.fhi.org/en/CountryProfi les/Indonesia/res_ItsMyLife_MSM_Indonesia.htm http://www.fhi.org/en/CountryProfi les/Thailand/res_msmthailand.htm 5 Data from the city scans was compiled and analyzed in city-specifi c reports which served as working documents for city delegations at the Hong Kong Action Planning Meeting. For more details on the methodology used for the city scans see Annex 5. Synthesis of city scans The city reports were summarized into a six-page analytical document which identifi ed lessons learned and promising strategies. This document was distributed to all city delegates prior to the Action Planning Meeting in Hong Kong and informed the city level planning undertaken at that meeting. The synthesis report is in Annex 6. Action Planning Meeting Key stakeholders identifi ed through the city-level scans and the local consultants were invited to participate in the Action Planning Meeting, held in early December, 2010 in Hong Kong. The objectives of the meeting were to: 1. Review the results of the city scans. 2. Identify successful strategies that have been implemented for HIV prevention, care, support and treatment for MSM and transgender persons and the extent to which they have been successful. (Successful strategies were defi ned by their impact on perception of risk and actual behavior change. This was measured by an increase in condom use, changes in risky behavior, use of key services - for example, VCT, STI, care and support and ART services - and stabilizing new cases of HIV and slowing of HIV prevalence.) 3. Reach consensus on strategic behavior change strategies and prioritize common actions for inclusion in each of the six city action plans. 4. Develop 12 month action plans for each of the six cities. Emphasis was placed on development of realistic and achievable action plans to complement and build upon existing city and/or national plans rather than the development of parallel work plans. This means that the action plans developed as part of this Initiative were not intended to be comprehensive.

Hong Kong\u2019s experience: Critical success factors in the HIV response Dr Francis Wong, Hong Kong Department of Health Chun-yam Chau, The Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Clubs Association of Hong Kong David, owner of gay saunas Background In 2005, HIV case report data indicated a rising HIV epidemic among MSM in Hong Kong. At that time, relatively little was known about HIV among MSM in Hong Kong. However, it was known that MSM were made up by diverse sub-populations and that condom use and HIV testing rates were both low. There were only two NGOs conducting HIV programs for MSM and there was no designated funding. The need for an enhanced prevention eff ort targeting MSM was clear. Both the government and NGOs considered close collaboration with MSM in developing and implementing a response as essential. Concerted e\ufb00 orts: Government Lobbying for policy support for an enhanced response to HIV and MSM was undertaken internally within government and by NGOs. Data analysis in Tim Brown\u2019s 2006 consultancy report, Living on the Edge, informed the recommendation of the government\u2019s Advisory Council on AIDS to make HIV prevention among MSM Hong Kong\u2019s top HIV priority. Seroprevalence and behavioral surveillance among MSM was enhanced through regular surveys. Strategic funding for MSM programs was made available through the AIDS Trust, which is Hong Kong\u2019s major funder of HIV work by small NGOs. Capacity building of government and NGO staff was undertaken to ensure all services were MSM sensitive and gay friendly. Collaboration between NGOs and MSM was strengthened and a MSM Working Group was formed with representatives from government, NGOs and MSM communities. HIV prevention initiatives have included a designated MSM hotline, a designated gay website and social marketing campaigns through saunas, bars and gay-friendly venues. Concerted e\ufb00 orts: NGOs Hong Kong\u2019s NGOs play a bridging role between the government and communities. Governments need NGOs to understand what is happening within communities and to undertake programs, while NGOs need the technical, policy and fi nancial support of government. Hong Kong NGOs see themselves as not just service providers but also as proactive advocates for eff ective responses, based on their understanding of community needs. Collaboration has gone beyond the usual top down model where governments lead and NGOs follow to a more equal and dynamic partnership. The NGO response took-off in 2007 as a result of special project funding that was made available to support the development of a response by small NGOs. The Hong Kong response has recognized the multiple and diverse identities among MSM. Currently, Hong Kong has eight NGOs working with diff erent MSM groupings or \u2018communities\u2019. There has been a good record of coordination and collaboration between these NGOs. Hong Kong NGOs are providing a platform for all to work together to create a gay positive enabling environment for healthy and vibrant communities. 7 Concerted e\ufb00 orts: Sauna owner The sauna owner stated that the mission of gay sauna owners is to provide a safe and clean environment for men to have enjoyable sex.

From this perspective sauna owners share with the government and NGOs the common objective of preventing HIV transmission. From a business perspective, customers must come fi rst. Business owners need to be concerned about the sensitivities and vulnerabilities of gay customers, especially in relation to how they view governments. Free condoms and lubricant provided by the Health Department are made easily available in all parts of the sauna. This is accompanied by posters promoting safer sex. An NGO provides anonymous HIV and STI testing. Surveillance and research activities are conducted with sauna customers. Overall, government, NGOs and gay businesses are working in harmony on HIV prevention as part of a win-win situation. Singapore\u2019s experience: Critical success factors in the HIV response Laurindo Garcia, Fridae.com Donovan Lo, Action for AIDS Roy Ngerng, Health Promotion Board Enabling environments In 2007, a study tour by government and MSM organizations to Sydney, Australia found that cooperation between NGOs and health authorities was the key to their success in prevention of HIV among MSM. This learning helped foster a coordinated response by government and MSM communities in Singapore. The annual Pink Dot \u2013 \u2018supporting the freedom to love\u2019 event - http://pinkdotsg.blogspot.com/ - is a community led initiative addressing discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people (GLBT). It brings together large numbers of pink clad GLBT, their friends and families in a park to form one big pink dot. Social media is used extensively to promote the event, which also attracts the attention of mainstream media. The non- confrontational nature of Pink Dot makes it suitable for Singapore and other Asian cities. The event has proved popular, with participation increasing from 2,500 in 2009 (the fi rst year) to over 4,000 in 2010. Developing relationships and building a coordinated response The Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Board work closely with NGOs in the development of HIV programs for MSM. Collective leadership is in evidence through the MSM Working Committee which includes representatives from government and NGOs. The Committee developed a fi ve-year framework (2008-2012) to coordinate programs to reduce HIV among MSM. MSM Program Planning Think Tanks are conducted every quarter to: \u2022 use evidence to inform program planning; \u2022 develop collaborative MSM programs; and \u2022 forge and strengthen partnerships. Innovative prevention Program development is based on a health promotion approach. MSM programs were re-oriented away from a disease-centric approach to a person-centric approach. A life cycle approach is taken, focusing gay men on key events common in their lives such as coming out, fi rst sex, fi rst boyfriend and new sex partner. Messaging is focused on issues unique to each of the key events in the life cycle and is positive, accepting and non- judgmental. All programs are targeted and address issues relevant to the needs of MSM with diverse identities, using the life cycle approach and through activities that resonate with the lives of MSM. 8 Evidence is gathered through surveys such as the condom use survey in saunas and surveys and observation studies in gay pubs and nightclubs. A coordinated approach is taken to prevention programming, with all stakeholders on-board. A feature of Singapore\u2019s approach has been the building of relationships between NGOs and gay business owners in a respectful and coordinated manner, rather than in a top-down way. Awareness and education programming includes outreach to nightspots, sex on premises venues and working through the media. A feature of outreach is partnership with venues. For example, clubs and pubs place their logos on condom packets to give them ownership. Fridae.com has successfully piloted free distribution of branded condoms and lubricant using the internet. HIV testing is available in venues and is promoted through an annual three month HIV testing project starting in November, an annual HIV testing day in June and other testing campaigns involving business owners and a well- known model. Fridae.com\u2019s \u2018know your status\u2019 profi le for its social network users also encourages HIV testing. Psychosocial support for GLBT people is provided by a CBO which integrates safer sex education into its broader work on sexual identity, self-esteem and mental health.

Key issues in planning e\ufb00 ective city responses An interactive discussion was held between meeting participants and a panel of experts on how to plan for eff ective HIV responses for MSM and transgender persons. Panel members were: \u2022 Addy Chen, APN+ \u2022 Elden Chamberlain,USAID\u2019s AIDSTAR-Two project; International HIV/AIDS Alliance \u2022 Habib Rahman, PSI Myanmar \u2022 Loretta Wong, AIDS Concern, Hong Kong \u2022 Siroat (Ken) Jittjang, FHI Asia Pacifi c Regional O\ufb03 ce Key points made during the discussion were: Coordination and relationships HIV prevention programs for MSM and transgender persons will only be successful if they can be scaled up to reach signifi cantly greater numbers than is currently the case. This will only be achieved with the full and active involvement of national and city governments. Forums that bring governments and MSM CBOs together are essential. CBOs need to establish productive and sustainable relationships with governments through good communication, using both formal and informal channels. Be strategic in your approach. Know who is sitting in which positions; what are their functions; what they can and cannot do; what they are willing to do and are not prepared to do? Be persistent. Keep talking. The relationship between governments and CBOs needs to be seen as a collaboration, with each learning from the other. This can be facilitated by creating a friendly environment between governments and CBOs where each sees the other as friends, rather than always taking an advocacy approach which can be seen as adversarial. 9 Innovative prevention There is a need to frame messages so that they resonate with the broader interests and lives of diff erent groups of MSM and transgender persons. This means dealing with their whole lives rather than taking a narrow approach. Given the diversity among MSM and transgender persons, a range of prevention messages are needed. Targeting identity can be too rigid and limiting. Targeting behaviors is a broader and more fl exible approach. However, behavioral messaging need to be sensitive to the needs of diff erent identities (for example, transgender sensitive). Involvement of HIV positive MSM and transgender persons in all aspects of programming, including prevention programming, is essential. More activities targeting positive MSM and transgender persons are needed. Testing linked to care and treatment There is no one single model of service delivery suitable for all MSM. Some will want to use services that specialize in meeting the needs of MSM and/or transgender persons while others will want to use mainstream services. Mainstream services have the advantage of being available on a more widespread geographic basis. Feeling safe is key to whether MSM and transgender persons will use services. In Myanmar, experience has demonstrated that where there are MSM doctors the uptake rate for STI and HIV testing is signifi cantly higher. This includes the appropriate screening, diagnosis and treatment of anal STIs which is often ignored by mainstream services. Eff orts need to be made to fi nd local doctors who are MSM and MSM friendly. Many MSM are more comfortable talking with peer MSM counselors rather than professional counselors. Use of peer counselors will result in a higher HIV testing uptake rate. Integration of CBO programs and clinical services in the one site removes the need for referral and overcomes the problem of loss to follow-up. Integration can be promoted by bringing together CBOs and clinical service providers at the planning stage. Enabling environment The most important factor in ensuring a program\u2019s success is that it be run and managed by the community. The community needs to be involved in all aspects of the program and programs need to be comprehensive. Leadership training for MSM and transgender persons is needed. Empowerment of positive MSM and transgender leaders can be advanced by use of role models and pairing with a mentor. There is a lack of services for and visibility of MSM and transgender persons living with HIV. The lack of visibility refl ects the stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV (PLHIV). Strategic information To deal with the crisis of HIV among MSM and transgender persons, better advocacy by NGOs and CBOS is needed, based on evidence of what interventions work. World Caf\u00e9 small groups The Action Planning Meeting divided into small groups, each with a mix of participants from diff erent cities. The small groups answered three questions as a foundation for developing city action plans: 1. What causes the rapid rise in HIV infection among MSM and transgender persons? 2.

World Caf\u00e9 methodology was used to encourage experience sharing between cities in small groups and to empower less dominant individuals to participate more fully and express their thoughts comfortably. The methodology for the World Caf\u00e9 small groups is outlined in Annex 7. 10 The following is an overview of the responses by all small groups. What causes the rapid rise in HIV among MSM and transgender persons? Factors increasing risk or vulnerability \u2022 Lack of knowledge by MSM, especially young MSM, about personal risk and the severity of HIV epidemics among MSM, which is related to low program coverage levels. \u2022 An increased number of sex partners and a low level of condom use. \u2022 Use of the internet makes it much easier for MSM to meet and have sex more often. \u2022 Rapid economic development and the growth in mass media is associated with more liberal attitudes towards sex and sexuality. \u2022 Misconceptions among some MSM about eff ective prevention methods. \u2022 Condoms are seen as getting in the way of intimacy and relationship building. \u2022 Lack of condom use because of power imbalances in relationships. \u2022 Use of condoms by sex workers with non-paying customers is low. \u2022 Poor self-esteem increases risk behavior. \u2022 Recreational drug use reduces capacity to negotiate safe sex and increases risk behavior. Programmatic limitations \u2022 Insuffi cient coverage and intensity of HIV services to make an impact. \u2022 Message fatigue means MSM and transgender persons are not listening. \u2022 HIV prevention services are often generic rather than being tailored to the needs and interests of MSM and transgender persons. \u2022 Programs in the wrong place where prevalence and risk is not high. \u2022 Sex workers in some cities do not have good access to condoms and are not empowered to negotiate condom use with clients. \u2022 The quality of HIV and sex education in schools is poor. Testing linked to care and treatment \u2022 Low utilization rates for STI and VCT services. Many people who are infected do not know their status so may be transmitting HIV. \u2022 STI services are often clinically inappropriate for MSM and not always comprehensive (e.g. condoms not available). \u2022 A limited number of public sector services sensitized to the needs of MSM and transgender persons. Enabling environment \u2022 Stigma and discrimination drives MSM and transgender persons underground making them more diffi cult to reach. \u2022 The needs of MSM and transgender persons receive insuffi cient attention from governments and are accorded lesser priority than other populations. \u2022 Possession of condoms can be used by police as evidence of sex work or the existence of a sex establishment. \u2022 Social exclusion of transgender persons pushes them into sex work where they are subject to coercion and violence, with limited bargaining power on condom use. 11 What are the needs of MSM and transgender persons living with HIV? Innovative prevention \u2022 Positive health programs. Testing linked to care and treatment \u2022 A comprehensive range of linked services to meet varying care, support and treatment needs over time. \u2022 More services specializing in meeting the care, support and treatment needs of MSM and transgender persons living with HIV. \u2022 The need to feel safe when accessing services \u2013 more MSM and transgender friendly mainstream care, support and treatment services \u2022 One common CD4 eligibility criteria for ART within cities with more than one government. \u2022 Suffi cient ART to meet demand. \u2022 Advice for transgender PLHIV on the interaction of hormones and ART. \u2022 Psychosocial support for PLHIV and their partners and families. Enabling environment \u2022 Greater involvement of MSM in all aspects of program design, delivery, monitoring and evaluation. \u2022 Help in dealing with double or triple stigma (for example, being MSM, HIV positive and a sex worker). \u2022 Better social protection in areas such as livelihood development, access to insurance, housing, health care costs, employment and economic support. \u2022 Capacity building in life skills and income generation. Which strategy from the other cities is the most promising for your city? Coordination and relationships \u2022 Achieving an eff ective partnership between governments and CBOs is the key to achieving scale. \u2022 Collaboration between governments, NGOs and the private sector as in Hong Kong and Singapore. \u2022 The Hong Kong Government\u2019s support for building civil society coalitions \u2022 Good working relationships between public health and law enforcement offi cials. \u2022 Development of public-private partnerships for service delivery. \u2022 MSM national networks.

Peak activities are examples of interesting practice that can be used to \u2018breathe new life\u2019 into HIV responses or which bring to light eff ective or innovative approaches and partnerships. Peak activities include those for which there are surprising results, exceeding expectations. During city scans stakeholders also reached consensus on \u2018provocative statements\u2019 which are visions that are diffi cult to achieve but that would add value to a city\u2019s response. Provocative statements are intended to challenge more eff ective responses. Delegations from each of the six cities were encouraged to learn from the peak activities and provocative statements developed by other cities and take account of these in their action planning. This section of the report contains the peak activities and provocative statements for each of the six cities. The methodology used in the city scans is described in Annex 5. The reports of each of the city scans were analyzed for lessons learned and a short synthesis report produced to inform planning at the Hong Kong meeting.

Implementation of the action plans will take place during 2011. Technical assistance to support implementation will be provided by regional partners. Reporting on progress will take place using national monitoring and evaluation systems and at regional fora such as ICAAP 10. Consideration will be given to expanding the Initiative, if successful, to additional cities in Asia. Also, following the Action Planning Meeting, UNDP and USAID will carry out an in-depth analysis of the six city scan reports. This analysis will identify areas for advocacy and action planning support. While acknowledging the signifi cant progress made and positive fi ndings from this innovative regional initiative to foster collective eff orts for HIV interventions among MSM and transgender persons, there were also limitations in the process. During the six city scan exercise, the methodology used was able to quickly identify the positive and innovative practices in each of the six cities. However, the overall challenges or gaps in the current responses may not have been fully identifi ed. The action plans developed by the six cities for the next twelve months are prioritized based on local needs, while city wide responses will need to be guided by more strategic information at a later stage. Additional advocacy eff orts will need to be in place in order to operationalize the action plans, with full participation by city government offi cials, including representatives from the police. 19 Annexes Annex 1: Overview of city action plans Bangkok Action 1: Active engagement of MSM and transgender communities in the development of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration\u2019s Strategic AIDS Plan 2012-2016.

To ensure practical and actionable outcomes from the Hong Kong Action Planning Meeting, scans were undertaken in each of the six cities (Bangkok, Chengdu, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Manila and Yangon) before the meeting. Aim of the city scans The aim of the city scans was to increase leadership commitment to the scaling up of MSM and transgender persons HIV programming by reporting on HIV initiatives and examining the goals and challenges of MSM and transgender persons. Objectives of the city scans The objectives of the city scans were to: 1. Document the potential within each of the six cities for the scale up of a comprehensive, rights-based HIV response among MSM and transgender persons using the key components of the Comprehensive Response to HIV Services for MSM and Transgender Persons in Asia Pacifi c \u2013 (a) prevention, (b) care, support and treatment, (c) enabling environment and (d) strategic information. 2. Identify the policy and political contexts and potential and existing multi-sector collaborations, along with human capacity - knowledge and skills - available in each city. 3. Document local ideas for overcoming challenges and barriers within the six cities for the scale up of rights- based responses. Highlight examples of innovative HIV-related services for MSM and transgender persons, those involving partnerships between government departments and civil society associations and institutions and those involving collaboration with the private sector. 4. Provide an opportunity to describe good and innovative practices to key leaders in the region and to consider their implications in the local context. 5. Facilitate local action plans for scale up of HIV responses among MSM and transgender persons in the six cities. Who conducted the city scans? The scans were conducted by local consultants working in close collaboration with a core group of stakeholders, including national AIDS programs, city governments, MSM and transgender networks and working groups, CBOs, the private sector, UN agencies and other technical assistance agencies. The city scans took place in September and October 2010. Overview of the city scan process There were fi ve key processes in conducting the city scans: 1. Development of the methodology for the city scans followed by the development of an Implementation Guide and tools for use by local consultants in conducting the city scans. 2. Recruitment of a local consultant in each city and training them in how to conduct the scan. 3. Field support for the local consultants in the conduct of the city scan. 4. Written reports detailing the results of each city scan. 5. Analysis of each of the city reports to identify lessons learned and promising strategies. The standard methodology and the two-day training session in Bangkok for the local consultants on how to apply the methodology promoted consistency in the way each city scan was conducted. The scan was not formal research, rapid assessment or an attempt to evaluate the eff ectiveness of HIV services at the city level. Nor was it an attempt to comprehensively document everything happening in each city relating HIV programming for MSM and transgender persons. The goal was to stimulate discussion among key stakeholders 38 about what they thought was working well and how to scale up promising practices. Through appreciative inquiry a set of \u2018peak activities\u2019 were identifi ed in each city. Peak activities are examples of interesting practice that can be used to \u2018breathe new life\u2019 into HIV responses or which bring to light eff ective and/ or innovative approaches and partnerships. Peak activities include those for which there are surprising results, exceeding expectations. Stakeholders also reached consensus on \u2018provocative statements\u2019 which are intended to challenge more eff ective programmatic responses. Provocative statements are commitments that are diffi cult to achieve but that would add value to a city\u2019s response. In the majority of cities the time available to undertake each city scan was equivalent to fi ve-days work. Appreciative inquiry A conceptual framework applied in the scans was appreciative inquiry (AI). AI was used for the development of questions for key informants on previous and current HIV interventions for MSM and transgender persons. AI promotes the idea that the way questions are asked is centrally important to determining the answers gained.

They ask questions that seek to fi nd promising practices, no matter how small and informal they may be. AI focuses participants on how to apply these positive experiences in the future through replication, possibly on a larger scale. AI attempts to gain access to the ideas that key informants have about what type of world would be best. AI does not preclude engaging with criticism or problem identifi cation, but avoids \u2018negative\u2019 criticism. \u2018Positive\u2019 criticism is, however, promoted by encouraging participants to identify strategies that could help resolve gaps and diffi culties in the future. The AI approach contends that a problem-oriented focus of review and inquiry reduces the possibility of generating new images of social reality that might help transcend current social forms. In other words, this approach recreates the \u2018problem\u2019 it purports to be attempting to solve. \u2022 The city scans used the EnCompass Model of AI which articulates four conceptual steps in the investigation process including: \u2022 inquiry (determining the best of what is); \u2022 imagining (a process of dialogue about the possibilities for a positive vision); \u2022 innovating (determining how things \u2018should\u2019 be); and \u2022 designing (determining implications for implementing innovation). Conducting the city scans \u2013 step 1: Orientation meeting A city level orientation meeting was held in each of the six cities as the fi rst signifi cant activity in the scan. In these meetings the city consultant sought information about the local HIV context for MSM and transgender persons and support for and participation in the scan from important partners. The orientation meetings also identifi ed peak activities for follow-up investigation by the city consultant at step 2. The meetings were convened by UNAIDS or the designated United Nations MSM focal point. Participants usually included city governments, the national AIDS program, civil society organizations, the private sector, health services, MSM and transgender networks and individual MSM and transgender persons. Conducting the city scans \u2013 step 2: Field interviews Individual fi eld interviews and site visits were the second signifi cant step in the city scans. This step was designed to gather information on peak activities identifi ed at the orientation meeting and to search for other innovative, interesting or promising activities, skilled people and evidence of eff ectiveness to assist the city\u2019s HIV partners to plan for scale up. 39 Conducting the city scans \u2013 step 3: Vision meeting The vision meeting was the third step for each of the city scans. It brought together people who had participated in steps one and two of the scan to begin thinking together about how best to scale up HIV responses for and with MSM and transgender persons in each city. Participants at the vision meeting developed and agreed upon the provocative statements which challenged them to respond more eff ectively. Key stakeholders and technical advisors \u2022 Technical coordination of the six city scan: Scott Berry from the AIDS Project Management Group Asia Pacifi c was the Technical Coordinator for the six city scan, under contract to UNDP. He was responsible for overall coordination of the city scans, including training and technical support for the local city consultants. Technical leadership was provided by Edmund Settle, HIV Policy Specialist in UNDP\u2019s Asia Pacifi c Regional Center, Bangkok. \u2022 Local city consultants: were responsible for undertaking the city scans and producing the written report of the scan for their city. \u2022 UNAIDS or UNDP country o\ufb03 ce focal points: assisted with coordination of city interviews and meetings. \u2022 City or national government focal points: ensured the involvement of government offi cials and agencies in the scan and at the Hong Kong action planning meeting.

This is not a stand-alone document. It is a working document designed to feedback key themes and fi ndings from the fi rst phase of this program to all of the 6 city delegations who will attend the Action Planning Meeting in Hong Kong on 7-9 December 2010. This report describes the consistencies between what is being done in each city, some examples for all to aspire to, and some pitfalls to avoid. The delegates from each of the six cities will draw conclusions and develop recommendations in that meeting. 1. Coordination and Relationships The City Scans indicate that HIV is best addressed when there is good coordination at a city level. There are benefi ts in having the health, community, administration, police and legal sectors all working together. Some cities report that this is diffi cult, but improvements are occurring. Working together across sectors is reported to be a new experience for most people. Some report that eff ective National AIDS Councils or Committees, National Strategic Plans on HIV and national policies can help. However, much policy making and health budgeting is now devolved to provinces or districts. Hence, there is a need to bring to life the policy making groups at a city level, help them to understand the national strategies and policies, and take multi-sectoral decisions together. Some City Scans note that encouragement has come from national policy makers in all sectors, education sessions run by city based community groups, and assistance with compiling and analyzing strategic information. International NGOs have often helped to start the process, either with technical support, advocacy or some funding. Local community groups report that they value city government support, especially in capacity building: \u201cThe government agencies have played an important role with their supportive attitude, and have been helpful with their supervision and advice\u201d. Some cities have developed their own city plans for men who have sex with men. The City Scans demonstrate that city policy makers are most helpful when they play a role of coordination, not control. Coordination works best when there are good personal relationships, not just committee meetings. There are problems to solve, not rivalries to overcome. Formal policies are less important over time than personal relationships, though one may lead to the other. Listening to other sectors is as important as advocating to them. Some cities reported that situations had improved following capacity building for communication across sectors. It is relatively new for police to talk with gay organizations, or for health administrators to talk with police. Networks and representation Sometimes there are representatives of men who have sex with men on National AIDS Councils, Global Fund Country Coordinating Mechanisms or National Treatment Working Groups. Some countries have national MSM Networks, Consultation Meetings, Sexual Transmission Working Groups or Technical Groups. Charismatic individuals City Scans note that particular individuals have often helped to improve situations and promote discussion. These \u201cChampions of HIV prevention\u201d diff er in each city. They include health policy makers, community sector advocates, health services staff and celebrities. Some high ranking government or health offi cials have attended community functions. This helps the rest of the community to understand the importance of work with men who have sex with men and transgender populations. 41 2. Innovative Prevention All cities are using many methods of prevention. No cities report using all methods outlined in the Comprehensive Package. None reach all men who have sex with men. A balance between serious and fun messaging and interaction Published materials often include catchy wording to engage readers, high quality visual material, and a mix of information about HIV and other health and personal matters. This is consistent with what is now known about health promotion. Many education events include diff erent components to engage audiences. But sometimes what is \u201cfun\u201d for men who have sex with men is \u201coff ensive\u201d to others. There needs to be a balance between fun and serious messaging and interaction. Policy makers, police and mass media need help to understand this. Some cities have moved from initial tensions around this issue to clear resolutions. Yangon now has clear rules of engagement. Ho Chi Minh City and Chengdu health leaders help explain to others how health promotion works. Some programs use positive role models who promote dignity and respect for men who have sex with men. They do this to counter the stigma in other public discussions about male to male sex.

Some cities provide outreach workers with identity cards signed by senior police, to show to local police when they are questioned about their activities. Information and interactive education Cities use mobile theatre, going to where men meet, and street theatre at large community events. Many programs use storytelling, drama or songs. Some of these folk arts have come from rural cultures to the cities as people move. Some cities have fi lm nights and fi lm festivals with associated HIV education. Events are sometimes called \u201cedutainment\u201d, and are often followed by serious interactive discussions. Community groups invite medical staff or people living with HIV to follow performances with question and answer sessions. Others use song competitions, game shows, quizzes, meetings with local actors, exhibitions, debates, comic books, and distribution of raincoats, key chains, clocks or shirts as prizes. No cities indicate how often these occur or how many men they reach. Phone hotlines are used to provide counseling and referrals. They provide advice about HIV, legal issues or more general issues. Internet There are many examples of use of the internet. No two cities are doing the same things. Use of the internet has grown quickly (e.g. Yangon describes \u201cPlanting a seed which grows into a big shady tree\u201d). Diff erent cities report the internet\u2019s advantages. It can reach many people who other programs cannot reach; include relevant issues on sex between men as part of websites targeting broader populations; provide participants with social contact as well as information and referrals about HIV; include HIV content on other websites; involve experts from community and health sectors to provide advice. Internet counseling and advice can be one-off or long term depending on resources available. Manila has counseling by trained \u201cchatters\u201d. Some cities have chat rooms for men who are HIV positive. Websites are linked to fashion contests, fi lm festivals and community education. They also link HIV with other issues such as legal and human rights. Bangkok has used the internet to screen television dramas which are interactive with fan clubs, focus groups and community input. No cities yet report attempts to reach the many people who now use hand held devices and use these for very private and confi dential access to all sorts of personal networks and information. 42 Condoms in prevention HIV prevention requires distribution and discussion of condoms. Some cities have linked entertainment venues with condom companies to enable purchase or distribution of low priced condoms and lubricant, or to set up revolving funds. In many places condoms are not on sale at night and lubricants are hard to fi nd. Many people will not buy condoms from pharmacies because they are embarrassed to do so, but they will buy them from bars when they are on sale. Linking education with counseling and testing Some community or health sector groups provide voluntary counseling or testing on site at places where outreach takes place or in venues such as saunas. This can occur late at night or on Sundays, when most clinics are closed. Linking education needs of HIV positive and HIV negative men Many examples of this were reported. Many men will never know that they are HIV positive until they seek a test. Education can assist with motivation and information about testing. Some cities have \u201cPositive prevention\u201d workshops, \u201cGender and HIV workshops\u201d or health camps. Diverse programs attract men who don\u2019t identify as gay, transgender people and women whose male partners have sex with other men. Transgender programs limited by stigma and discrimination The City Scans show that prevention for transgender populations is severely hindered by stigma and discrimination. Some cities don\u2019t report on any successful prevention or treatment programs for transgender people. Others note that these programs must address wider issues and help create safe spaces for transgender people to meet and support one another. Use of mass media to back up focused community events Some cities report that mass media can be hostile to men who have sex with men. No cities report discussion of safe sex in the mass media, yet this is the only way to reach all men. Community criticism The City Scans indicate that initiatives for men who have sex with men sometimes attract the interest of police, the media or religious groups which are hostile to sex between men.

Men in detention The City Scans noted that there are still challenges in working on prevention of HIV for men who have sex with men in prisons and rehabilitation centers. 43 3. Testing Linked to Care and Treatment All six cities report innovation in testing linked to care and treatment. Every city has something useful to share. Continuum Cities report linking of communities with clinics, using \u201coutreach\u201d and \u201cin-reach\u201d activities. Community groups promote counseling and testing. These are sometimes provided in public settings, sometimes using mobile vans. Clinics can provide ongoing counseling and regular contact. Specialized clinics are sometimes run by community groups. Drop in centers are sometimes run by health departments. Specialized clinics for HIV have had to learn about the special needs of risk groups. Some provide internships for staff of other clinics. Community groups come to clinics to provide information sessions, extended training, or community counselors. Initiatives to make clinics friendlier include discussion sessions with people living with HIV, links with internet sites or theatre, and community programs to let people know that the clinics are friendly places. The \u201cCompanion van\u201d in Ho Chi Minh City has this name to emphasize that it is a safe space. Good relationships between service providers and community groups have helped. Cross referrals take place between hospitals and community organizations. One partnership between an HIV Positive support group and a local government has led to provision of treatment at low cost. Overcoming problems with sta\ufb00 attitudes Some people avoid attending clinics because they fear negative attitudes of staff . Some staff are now well trained and understand the needs of client groups, but the client groups don\u2019t always know this. The concepts of \u201cvoluntary\u201d, \u201cprivate\u201d and \u201cconfi dential\u201d are new for many people who are potential clients. Education and promotion can explain these terms and build confi dence in services. Community groups are involved in training of health sector staff . They report that this requires support and direction from district health authorities. The Life Centre community group in Ho Chi Minh City trained health workers to become \u201cChampions of the Life Centre\u201d. Di\ufb00 erent needs for di\ufb00 erent types of men who have sex with men Some clinics, for example in Yangon, say that \u201cBuilding a sense of belonging\u201d is important. They use the term \u201cSafe space\u201d to talk about what they provide for a client group often stigmatized elsewhere. Some services for this \u201crisk group\u201d have learnt from the experience of services for other \u201crisk groups\u201d. One specialized clinic has now after eight years been integrated into a more general clinic. There are no evaluations of the diff erent outcomes of specialized or general clinics. Outreach services are improved when there is planned cooperation and \u201chands off \u201d agreements with police. These must be negotiated locally. Personal relationships and personal support In Bangkok, \u201cexperienced people with HIV\u201d have strong relationships with service providers, become involved in services and help new clients. A community group in Chengdu provides counseling and testing in non-medical venues, with approval of the city\u2019s Centre for Disease Control. Some clinics aim to meet the broader sexual health concerns of men who have sex with men and transgender people. Special needs of people who are HIV Positive For those who receive HIV positive test results, new needs arise. Some programs aim to support men immediately from when they receive an HIV positive result. This often involves community sector staff or volunteers being invited into the clinics as partners in support. For most clients the news that they are infected with HIV is unexpected, and their understanding is minimal. Some programs support clients to understand their results, trust the care providers, and maintain contact with the services. Volunteers provide weekend support, drop in centers, cultural events and other services. Some accompany clients attending clinics for the fi rst time. 44 One community project in Ho Chi Minh City ensures that clients understand what will happen in a clinic. They explain the services, confi dentiality, how diagnosis occurs, what results mean, and how support will be provided. In a clinic in Bangkok, an HIV positive result triggers a session with a Clinical Nurse Coordinator. They provide support with partner notifi cation, seeking social security support, and how to talk with families.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c6c848f-89d9-4fff-9ab8-930991f11952": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c6c848f-89d9-4fff-9ab8-930991f11952", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Men who have sex with men and transgender populations: Multi-City Initiative - City Scans and Action Planning Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c27b866a6db26246435e253e60b87aff3c9d635236724244fb7b530213837607"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a25e2b0-0487-49e3-b8bb-3929b5fc7324", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-populations-multi-city-initiative-city-scans-and-action-planning-meeting-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f214a3a0e051de8a87a364992cde22a637a6cfc408dcc37531ddb59a6c2a5a1"}}, "hash": "e7d6d05f7124642d314a3d6224e05d93f0e7dbc52134b57a140daa2e3250a809", "text": "They will take phone calls from families if requested.

Clinics associated with community groups report huge improvements in client follow-up. 4. Enabling Environment Stigma and discrimination City Scans show that educators and service providers need to have permission, time and resources to address stigma and discrimination, which prevent public discussion of HIV. They aff ect individuals\u2019 self-esteem and their ability to speak openly to health service providers or even peer educators. Transgender initiatives in all Six City Scans report far more problems with stigma, discrimination and human rights abuses. They report that transgender people have few places to turn to for assistance and may be turned away from mainstream welfare, medical, legal and other services. People with HIV also experience stigma and discrimination. Bangkok noted that stigma results in people with HIV \u201cbeing afraid to disclose their HIV status among friends and sexual networks\u201d. Rejection, isolation and loneliness are the result. There is a \u201csilence\u201d about living with HIV. Some reports are more optimistic. Chengdu reports that the media is supportive, the local government adopts \u201ca friendly attitude towards gays\u201d, the general public is more accepting of gays, and the self-acceptance level of gays is higher. A legal support group in Jakarta suggests the need for \u201cMale sexual diversity education\u201d and \u201cGender education\u201d for health services staff . Laws and Police Practices Every one of the City Scans noted problems arising from laws and police practices. The most common example is that condoms are used as \u201cevidence that sex work is taking place\u201d or \u201cevidence that this venue allows people to have sex\u201d. This was not reported in Yangon or Chengdu, so other cities may want to ask them how this was changed. Many laws about other issues are used to stop prevention of HIV. These include laws about sex between men, which is legal in fi ve of the six cities, but not always approved by local police. Laws about sex work are often vague, so police consider that all male to male sex is a form of sex work, or say the presence of condoms means that sex work is happening. Laws and regulations on \u201cpubic scandals\u201d, \u201csocial evils\u201d or \u201csocial order\u201d are used to stop HIV education. Pornography laws are used to prohibit the distribution of educational materials. Laws about vagrancy and loitering are used as a way of forcing people to provide money or sexual favors to police. The lack of safe spaces for men to meet in some cities means they have to meet in lanes or parks. Four questions for all six cities to consider 1. Is it legal to use condoms anywhere other than at home? 2. Is it legal to produce and disseminate explicit information on how safe sex can occur between men? 3. Are there safe places where men can go to meet, or to have safe sex outside their homes but away from the public gaze? 4. Are the city police aware of the answers to these questions and are their policing practices consistent with supportive laws which enable HIV prevention? If the answer to any single one of these questions is \u201cNo\u201d then HIV prevention will fail. 45 How do changes come about? Building an enabling environment for prevention and treatment requires developing supportive law enforcement practice. There have been discussion sessions with police, training sessions for police on HIV, health and welfare, police invitations to community meetings, and a toolkit on HIV for police. Understanding sometimes grows from allowing space for the police to talk about issues from their perspective. Laws against discrimination There are laws in some countries to stop discrimination against people on the basis of whether they have HIV, or appear to be in a risk group. Some cities promote discussion about these laws amongst police and city offi cials, to ensure they are well understood. Devolution of laws to local administrations In some cities, decisions on laws about sex work or public morality are taken at a city level. Some local policies were reported to be out of line with national laws, constitutions or AIDS strategies. Funding, and involvement of the private sector All six cities report programs funded in diff erent ways. No city reported the use of a single budgeting or costing forum, or a monitoring system that includes information about all sources of funding, where the money is spent and what gaps remain. Some initiatives are funded entirely by the private sector or community groups, with HIV included as an add-on to existing internet sites, entertainment events or radio programs. Many initiatives involve volunteers.

Strategic Information The City Scans reported very little about how strategic information is collected or used. This may be because the City Scans did not aim to focus on research. Cities have expanded surveillance, but there were few reports of Operational Research to improve program reach, quality or relevance. Even cities that have multi-sectoral governance forums, such as Provincial AIDS Committees, did not report discussions in which monitoring and evaluation results were considered in making new policies or developing new programs. Knowledge alone doesn\u2019t change behavior. However, some reports indicate that many men don\u2019t even have basic knowledge about HIV and sex between men. There were some reports on the size of diff erent sub-populations. These are essential to estimate the extent of program reach, yet there is no consistent way in which cities are doing this. Some people expressed concern that their own programs are only reaching men of a certain class or education. No cities evaluate exactly what men are reached. Only one city, Manila, mentioned concern about men who identify as heterosexual. Next Steps This synthesis report of the city scans off ers the strategic directions for each of the cities\u2019 delegations to use in action planning at the \u201cAction Planning Meeting of MSM and Transgender Populations Multi-City HIV Initiative\u201d in Hong Kong. Each city delegation will consider these themes in the context of their specifi c needs and environment as they draw conclusions and develop recommendations for action. Over the ensuing 12 months, implementation of the action plans will be reported upon and consideration given to expanding the program, if successful, in additional cities in Asia and the Pacifi c. Following the Hong Kong Action Planning Meeting, UNDP and USAID will carry out a comprehensive analysis of the 6 City Scan Reports. This analysis will be utilized to develop an in-depth analyses if municipal responses and identify areas for advocacy and action planning support. 46 Annex 7: World Caf\u00e9 methodology Objective To encourage small group discussion among delegates who may not normally talk with each other in order to share experiences between the six cities. Format A total of 10 tables, each with a facilitator and a note taker and about six city delegates (from 2-3 cities at each table), will discuss the following three questions in three 20-minute rounds: \u2022 Round 1 \u2013 \u201cWhat causes the rapid rise in HIV among MSM and transgender persons?\u201d \u2022 Round 2 \u2013 \u201cWhat are the needs of MSM and transgender persons living with HIV?\u201d \u2022 Round 3 \u2013 \u201cWhich strategy from the other cities is the most promising for your city? Why? City delegates are free to choose tables and are encouraged to mix with delegates from other cities. Each table is limited to only 10 participants, including facilitator, note taker and 2-3 language assistants. After each round, delegates are asked to move to another table. To maximize mixing between cities, delegates from one table should move to a number of diff erent tables. Language English will be used. For non-English speaking city delegates, language assistants who are non-city delegates with bi/multi-lingual abilities will be assigned to accompany these delegates to provide translation as they do the three rounds of discussion. Roles and Responsibilities Role Responsibilities Facilitator \u2022 Encourage city delegates to share their thoughts \u2022 Ensure discussion stays focused on the question for each of the three rounds \u2022 Do NOT express your own opinion \u2022 Keep track of time (20 minutes for each session) \u2022 Ensure all cities at the table get a chance to provide input. If some delegates are not feeling comfortable expressing their opinion in public they can write down their thoughts in English on f ip chart paper provided on the table. \u2022 Be sensitive to non-English speaking delegates who will need time for translation \u2022 Report back to the plenary (5 minutes) Note taker \u2022 Capture key issues, comments and questions expressed by each city delegate, (include which city said what), using the notes template \u2013 see next page \u2022 Do NOT participate in the discussion \u2022 Pass notes to the meeting facilitator Language assistant \u2022 Accompany city delegates as they go around the tables during each round \u2022 Provide two-way translation for the city delegates \u2022 Do NOT express your own opinion 47 World Caf\u00e9 table notes template (to be \ufb01 lled in by the table note-taker) (1) What causes the rapid rise in HIV among MSM and transgender persons?

National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 5 Executive Summary of Recommendations This report presents the key findings and recommendations of the review of Myanmar\u2019s legal framework and its impact on access to health and HIV prevention and treatment services for people living with HIV and key populations. This review was conducted through a partnership of UNAIDS, UNDP and Pyoe Pin in the period August \u2013 December 2013, in consultation with the National AIDS Programme. The review involved the following steps: \uf0b7 Literature review; \uf0b7 Consultation meetings with NGOs, people living with HIV and key populations; \uf0b7 A National Legal Review Meeting, convened in Naypyitaw on 25\u201326 November 2013; \uf0b7 Analysis of all inputs to define key recommendations; \uf0b7 Finalization of the report. The literature review, consultations and National Legal Review Meeting identified key areas requiring action, including in relation to: \uf0b7 Law and policy reform priorities; \uf0b7 Police practices; \uf0b7 Access to legal aid services, legal literacy and legal empowerment programmes; and \uf0b7 Capacity building. It is recognised that law reform is a long-term strategy and that much can be achieved in advance of law reform, for example through policy innovation, capacity building and partnerships between organizations representing key populations and law enforcement bodies to promote a shared understanding of HIV prevention objectives and approaches. Recommendations To support a more enabling legal and policy environment for HIV responses, it is recommended that the Government of Myanmar in partnership with key populations, donors, United Nations partners including UNAIDS and its cosponsors consider the following actions. 1. People living with HIV The Government of Myanmar should: 1. Introduce a law and supporting policies prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of HIV status in health care, employment, and the provision of education and other services, and providing accessible complaints procedures and meaningful remedies such as compensation, admission to school, reinstatement of employment, and disciplinary sanctions for violations. 2. Allocate a specific budget and monitoring and evaluation framework for stigma and discrimination interventions in the National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS (2011- 2016). 6 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report Health care 3. Establish a legal right for all people to access the means of protection from HIV including prevention information, condoms and clean needles and syringes. 4. Introduce provisions prohibiting non-consensual HIV testing and providing confidentiality protections for people living with HIV (this can be inserted in the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law 1995 or a new HIV law). 5. Remove AIDS from the category of Principal Epidemic Disease in the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law 1995 (Section 14 of this Law gives MoH discretion to quarantine people with a Principal Epidemic Disease which is defined to include AIDS as well as plague) 6. Ensure people living with HIV have access to complaints procedures for breach of confidentiality, non-consensual testing or other problems in delivery of health care services. 7. Strengthen the legal and policy framework for provision of care, support, treatment and impact mitigation services: a. Provide access to a minimum package of HIV services under a comprehensive continuum of care framework. b. Implement monitoring and evaluation systems that include community feedback on service quality. A responsive mechanism should be established for feedback on quality of services implemented by public, private and NGO sectors and that provides a process for people to seek redress for any violation of rights or malpractice. 8. Quality standards/Standard Operating Procedures should address HIV-related health service provision in both public and private sectors, including police jails, prisons, and detention/rehabilitation centres. Employment 9. Require public and private sector workplaces to develop workplace policies on HIV that address non-discrimination and confidentiality, prohibit mandatory HIV testing of employees or applicants for employment and dismissal on the grounds of HIV status, and provide access or referral to VCCT and other health services. Where workplace HIV policies have been introduced, a system for monitoring and evaluation of compliance with non-discrimination requirements and other obligations should be implemented.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daab505c-9b24-49c8-8cde-1b4ae30a2f6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "daab505c-9b24-49c8-8cde-1b4ae30a2f6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f485ade0e9b8a2e7dba14550acd9ad399f53ce130765d2ac0cbb39312e3a609"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ec7ab83-6fa9-48fb-a8d5-c6b6efdf7243", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d89fc059d81d9db83af6b161ce2860f2b48c2a6340854c097ad75a3057d22a1"}}, "hash": "66e8157053834300533b6e91d33de493ef061f64eea58e6d605a1230b7f62696", "text": "Prisoners living with HIV 10.

Training and capacity building on HIV, harm reduction and human rights should be conducted for personnel responsible for the welfare and health of prisoners. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 7 2. Sex workers The Government should review the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949. This review should consider the international evidence of the public health benefits of alternative legislative approaches to sex work, including models of health and safety regulation and decriminalization. To ensure sex workers are not driven underground and away from health services, legislative models should avoid punitive or compulsory measures such as compulsory testing and compulsory rehabilitation. The Government should consider the following amendments: 1. The Act should be re-titled to remove reference to \u2018suppression of prostitution\u2019 and instead emphasise \u2018protection of the rights of sex workers\u2019, including violence protection, and access to condoms and confidential health services for HIV and STI prevention, testing and treatment. 2. Include in the Act a supportive framework for implementation of the 100% Targeted Condom Programme to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and other STIs. 3. Include in the Act violence protection provisions for sex workers. 4. Remove penalties for soliciting (Section 3). If a penalty is to be imposed for sex work, this should be a fine rather than a custodial sentence. 5. Remove the offence of \u2018reputation\u2019 (kyawzaw) (Section 7). 6. End the practice of detaining sex workers in rehabilitation centres. Attendance at rehabilitation or vocational training centres should be voluntary rather than compulsory. In advance of the review of the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949, the following measures should be taken: Police instructions 7. The Directive to police to not use condoms as evidence of prostitution offences should be revised, updated and widely disseminated. In addition to not using condoms as evidence in court, police should be directed to not search for condoms when arresting sex workers and not harass sex workers, accuse sex workers of offences or arrest sex workers based only on the finding of condoms on their person or premises. 8. The Directive should be promoted and enforced to ensure police comply with instructions prohibiting the use of condoms as evidence for prosecution or as a basis of arrest or harassment. 9. Police instructions should prohibit use of the \u2018reputation\u2019 offence (kyawzaw) and public order offences (such as loitering at night) against sex workers unless exceptional circumstances exist, and should prohibit the police practice of entrapment of sex workers using people who pretend to be clients. Police responsibilities 10. Collaboration between MoH and the MoHA/Myanmar Police Force should be strengthened to support effective implementation of HIV prevention among sex workers including 100% targeted condom promotion. 11. If antiretroviral (ARV) drugs or OI medicines are found on a detained sex worker during a police search, these medicines should be returned to the sex worker 8 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report and police should help the sex worker to inform a peer educator, family member or service provider to arrange continuation of treatment. Police should be trained to recognize ARV and OI medicines, and to understand the role of these medicines in treatment and prevention. Vocational training 12. The existing VTW Centres should be remodelled as voluntary centres that provide trainings for skills that are marketable and relevant to running a small business. There should be creation of employment opportunities for sex workers who want to find alternative viable livelihoods. Legal aid 13. Legal aid services should be available to sex workers for representation in violence protection cases and complaints against police or health care services. Health and HIV services 14. Health service policies should support non-discriminatory services that respect the human right to health of everyone including sex workers and ensure provision of sex worker-friendly health services including HIV, STI and reproductive health and family planning services to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. 15.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf470464-5316-4423-b327-b255d2dbb59e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf470464-5316-4423-b327-b255d2dbb59e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "171f70fc2d8fc754a8b4865353ae3d1c99e08a1befcbb9fd35f68fad8032b679"}, "2": {"node_id": "95e3c019-65b4-4b5c-ab01-f63a08eade03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2cb96cb65e44efb3c86596e755fa5f7f6a7fb71a2fcd93b3fd4c6baaafb3912c"}}, "hash": "3ea5ebfca922a7122da966f7b482d1d124706d0a978e89a5846c14ae2bebcc3a", "text": "15.

The Excise Act should be amended to provide exceptions for distribution and possession of needles and syringes for harm reduction purposes. 2. Partnerships between the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), Myanmar Police Force, MoH, NGOs, and community networks to support harm reduction service provision need to be revitalized and local arrangements between police, NGOs and PWID communities need to be established to facilitate needle and syringe programmes. 3. The Directive by Police Headquarters (2001) not to arrest people for possession of needles and syringes should be promoted to police at all levels and strictly followed. 4. The MoHA/Myanmar Police Force should issue updated directives or police instructions prohibiting the use of needles and syringes as evidence for prosecution or as a basis of arrest or harassment. Police instructions should also prohibit police harassment of PWID attending or in the vicinity of drop-in centres or other sources of clean needles and syringes. Law enforcement efforts should focus on drug manufacturing, sale and supply, not use. 5. The Narcotics Law should be amended to include specific provisions on harm reduction services including MMT, needle and syringe programmes, and peer education and outreach. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 9 6. Harm reduction should be a standard part of the police curriculum. Sensitization and advocacy should aim to educate police of the public health reasons for providing clean needles and syringes, peer education and MMT to PWID. Registration of drug users 7. The system of compulsory registration of drug users should be phased out because it is stigmatizing, drives PWID away from services and fails to effectively address relapse. Instead, voluntary community-based treatment options should be provided. 8. While the current drug registration system remains in place, the law should treat registered drug users who are undergoing treatment leniently if they have a relapse during treatment. Police should take a health-oriented view to encourage more drug users to come forward to access counselling and treatment for drug use, VCCT and HIV prevention information. Police instructions should direct that a registered drug user not be charged with a criminal offence due to relapse. 9. If the registration system continues, registration for drug treatment should only be under the MoH and the personal information should be confidential and used solely for the purpose of treatment, not for police monitoring or criminal prosecution. This will encourage people who use drugs to register early for treatment and receive VCCT and HIV prevention education and services. Prisons and detention centres 10. A prison MMT programme should be established. Procedures should ensure continued access to MMT for people in police detention or prison. 11. Treatment and rehabilitation services should be offered to people convicted of drug use or possession offences so as to divert people who use drugs from the prison system. 12. Rehabilitation centres for drug users should be offered as a voluntary option and include effective evidence-based services for drug treatment and counselling in addition to physical, psychosocial and livelihood rehabilitation. Health care services 13. Community-based voluntary drug treatment services should be expanded. The National MMT Guideline should be fully implemented. Access to MMT and quality drug treatment counselling services should be expanded. 14. PWID should not be denied access to ART only on the grounds that they have not registered as drug users or undergone MMT initiation. 15. Drug use should be taken out of the criminal context and a new law and national policy for drug use should be developed that promotes harm reduction and treats drug dependence as a health condition. 16. Procedures and import restrictions under the National Drug Law 1992 and Narcotics Law require urgent revision to allow expanded access to effective pain relief drugs for people undergoing withdrawal from drugs. 10 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 4. MSM and transgender people Criminal offences and police abuses 1. Section 377 of the Penal Code should be repealed or amended as it violates human rights to privacy and equality, fuels stigma and discrimination against MSM and transgender people, encourages abuses by the police and impedes HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Section 377 should not apply to consensual sexual conduct between adults in private. 2. The police should be trained on the harmful impacts of law enforcement practices that interfere with HIV prevention. Police should support health promotion efforts to promote condom use instead of harassing MSM and transgender people for possession of condoms when they are searched during investigation or arrest. 3. Police instructions should direct police not to enforce public order offences (e.g. loitering after dark) against MSM and transgender people", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f38c87ea-87cf-4075-a4a8-b1f4eb271257": {"__data__": {"id_": "f38c87ea-87cf-4075-a4a8-b1f4eb271257", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2aaf8dc5aad12d3bcf963bf098a0c89040b5640f8c67c4067cff5d3b7560fa4d"}}, "hash": "2aaf8dc5aad12d3bcf963bf098a0c89040b5640f8c67c4067cff5d3b7560fa4d", "text": "unless they are implicated in genuine criminal activities. Protective laws and policies 4. Laws and policies should prohibit stigma and discrimination against MSM and transgender people in health care, education and employment. Disciplinary action should be taken against persons who commit acts of discrimination. 5. The law should enable transgender people to change their legal gender on identity and registration documents. One option is to enable transgender people to identify as a \u2018third gender\u2019 on legal documents, with equal rights as enjoyed by other citizens. Capacity building and inclusion in NSP II 6. NSP II should recognize the sexual orientation and gender identity rights of MSM and transgender people as a fundamental principle of effective HIV prevention. 7. MSM and transgender voices should be heard though representation at national health coordinating and decision-making bodies to ensure interventions are tailored to their specific needs. 8. NSP II should support comprehensive responses to the needs of MSM and transgender people including action against stigma and discrimination in delivery of health services, and sensitization and training of health personnel to increase access to VCCT and sexual health services. Health care workers should be sensitized to the needs and human rights of MSM and transgender people. 5. Women and girls 1. Violence protection laws and policies should address the needs of women and girls to be protected from violence in domestic and non-domestic contexts (e.g. sex workers). Marital rape should be criminalized. 2. Laws and policies should prohibit discrimination on the grounds of gender in the delivery of health and HIV services. 3. Policies should ensure gender-sensitive HIV services including the right of HIV- positive women to PMCT services, family planning and reproductive health services. Women and girls should have the right to decide on their family planning and reproductive health choices without any coercion. Health care workers should receive training on the reproductive rights of women and girls living with HIV. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 11 4. Widows should be provided with access to information about their legal rights to inheritance and legal aid services so that inheritance rights can be enforced. 5. Social protection policies should addresses the specific needs of women and girls living with and affected by HIV, female sex workers, females who use drugs or who are in prisons or detention centres. 6. Children and young people 1. The Child Law 1993 should be updated to ensure compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and enforced to ensure orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) have access to protection, guardianship, care and support. Orphans, street children and other vulnerable children should be cared for by the State in an appropriate setting (either community or institution based) and educated to their full potential. Regulations and guidelines should be established on procedures for HIV-positive children and children from HIV-affected households including orphans to access health, education, protection and care including shelter. 2. Children should be provided with education about their rights so that they can demand fulfilment of their rights including the right to health, and the voices of children and young people should be heard in policy-making processes. 3. The Government should ensure systems are in place to support all OVC including children in HIV-affected households to have birth registration, household registration and a National Registration Card. 4. The MoH should issue Guidance confirming that sexual and reproductive health services including HIV and STI testing can be provided to young people who are 12 years or older without parental consent, if they are assessed by the health care provider to be sufficiently mature. 5. Policies on HIV prevention, care and support should include specific provisions for young key affected populations including young MSM and transgender people, young female sex workers and young people who use drugs, as well as young internal and foreign migrants. 6. The Ministry of Education should issue a policy prohibiting discrimination against children living with HIV by public or private schools. 7. The MoH should revise the ART eligibility criteria to remove the requirement that an HIV-negative adult is available to provide treatment adherence support to the child. An HIV-positive parent should be sufficient to provide adherence support to the child. MoH policy should guarantee the uninterrupted supply of ARVs in child formulations to ensure treatment efficacy and prevent unwanted side effects. 7. Patents law and access to medicines The Government of Myanmar should: 1. Ensure that TRIPS flexibilities including compulsory licensing and parallel importing are fully addressed in the new patents law so that access to medicines is not restricted when Myanmar commences recognition of pharmaceutical patents; 2.

Not agree to enter trade or investment agreements that impose \u2018TRIPS-plus\u2019 requirements that could restrict future access to generic medicines. 8. Cross-cutting priorities 1. Capacity building is required to strengthen the role of lawyers, police, judges, health-care workers and parliamentarians in supporting human rights-based HIV responses. Each of these actors needs to understand the public health and human rights rationale for developing protective legal frameworks for people living with HIV and key populations. It is particularly important to provide training for police on HIV and human rights to address police abuses and to ensure that police act to protect and promote the rights of key populations. 2. The Government and donors should support community legal empowerment and \u2018access to justice\u2019 programmes that provide key populations with expanded access to free legal information, advice and representation,paralegal services, legal and human rights education, legal advice hotlines and access to rapid response teams to address incidents of violence or other serious rights violations. Key populations should be made aware of their rights and responsibilities and empowered to demand justice if their rights are violated. 3. Key populations should have access to independent and confidential complaints procedures if they experience harassment, extortion, unfair treatment or violence from the police, prison guards or other law enforcement officials. 4. The capacity of the National Human Rights Commission to address HIV-related complaints should be strengthened.
