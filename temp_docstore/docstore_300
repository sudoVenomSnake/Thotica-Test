Women in Timor-Leste continue to experience high levels of domestic violence and sexual assault at all levels of society. This not only affects women\u2019s immediate physical health but also their long-term physical, emotional and physiological well-being. The effects of these high rates of GBV are sometimes exacerbated by the reluctance of the formal justice system to respond aggressively to cases of alleged violence. In Timor-Leste, victims of crime seeking justice can ideally access two different systems: traditional law (adat), or the formal legal system. The victim may also utilize a combination of the two systems in resolving their problem. Timor-Leste\u2019s formal legal system derives from a variety of different written sources and dynamic institutions. For GBV, the Indonesian Penal Code is the relevant substantive law, in addition to some UNTAET Regulations and interna- tional law applicable under the constitution. The Timor-Leste Criminal Procedure Code is the applicable procedural law. There is currently no Timor-Leste law for domestic violence; however a draft was developed in 2003 and is still under parliamentary debate. The main factor hindering this is the delay in the introduction of the Timor-Leste Penal Code, which needs to be approved before the Domestic Violence Legislation can be approved. The formal justice system is a critical sector for promoting an end to violence against women. Not only does this system deal directly with those who suffer and perpetrate GBV, it is also public and able to significantly influence community attitudes and behaviours. Over the last few years, WJU has observed an increase in the number of GBV cases being dealt with by the formal justice system. But it is very difficult to gauge whether the number of women experiencing GBV in Timor-Leste has increased, whether community attitudes to domestic violence have changed or whether women\u2019s attitudes to the formal justice system have changed. WJU has identified the following areas of continuing concern for women who take GBV cases through the formal justice system, as referenced in the JSMP texts noted below: \ufffd Some women still do not consider GBV to be a serious crime requiring resolution by the formal court system. \ufffd When women do lodge complaints with police and wish to proceed through the courts, factors, including the cur- rent backlog of cases, make it difficult for them to have their cases processed and finalised in a satisfactory man- ner. (WJU notes that some matters which occurred in 2003 are only just being determined by the courts). \ufffd Cases continue to be postponed, primarily because victims and suspects do not attend. However, there have been instances where the court actors themselves have not attended, causing women to be frustrated and dissatisfied with the formal justice system. \ufffd The majority of court actors are male. \ufffd There are language inconsistencies for court hearings. Although the national languages of Timor-Leste are Portu- guese and Tetum, the majority of people speak Tetum, Bahasa or a local dialect. However, international judges are more likely to use Portuguese as they cannot speak Tetum or Bahasa. Little consideration appears to be given to the language ability of the victim and defendant, who may speak Bahasa or a local dialect. \ufffd Victims of domestic violence and sexual assault continue to be unwilling to give evidence in court, revealing a need for better security for witnesses and victims. \ufffd There is confusion in the application of the relevant law and international law is rarely considered despite being part of the domestic law. \ufffd The judiciary appears to focus on the credibility and the history of the victim rather than the facts of the assault (either domestic violence or sexual assault). This demonstrates a lack of understanding of GBV crimes and cul- tural issues. \ufffd Lack of evidence of physical injury is sometimes being taken as evidence of consent or lack of force, contrary to the legal provisions which define force as including threats and other forms of coercion that leave no physical mark. \ufffd Judges do not know whether to recognise traditional reconciliation measures as a sentencing factor. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity \ufffd The majority of sentences do not adequately reflect the serious nature of the crimes. \ufffd Many women feel that justice does not get delivered, deterring them from future use of the formal justice system.

Anuradha Rajivan wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Anuradha Rajivan discusses affirmative action as a tool to promote gender-equity in politi- cal power. She highlights the issue of possible backlash by those nudged out. Four key questions are also raised for consideration. Dear Network Members, Crafting Quotas, Advancing Inclusion Affirmative action or positive discrimination through quotas or reservations implies taking special steps to encourage participation by setting aside a share for disadvantaged groups, generally through policy or practice. Women are perhaps the largest disadvantaged group who might gain from quotas fixed in their favour. However, these comments apply more generally to other disadvantaged groups as well. To what extent can such tools be effective in promoting gender-equity in political power? Quotas invite direct and up-front attention to the issue of under-representation of a particular population group (for example, based on sex, income, ethnicity, religion, language, geography, or any other criteria that marks systematic disadvantage). Under-representation can be in access to political power - in political party membership, in party tickets, in seats in the parliament and sub-national levels, in trade or labour unions, etc. It can also be in education, employment and access to finance which inhibits equity in entrepreneurship, assets and self-employment. Quotas aim to provide a \u2018quick-fix\u2019 to counter historical disadvantage as they can fill up numbers in a relatively short time by fiat, without wait- ing for the slower process of mindset or social change. However, by itself, reservation of seats may not be adequate. Persons with little experience, capacity, or orientation may get selected, at least in the early stages. This can lead to complaints and unsavoury comments, especially by those excluded from the quotas. It can also lead to under-confidence and under-performance among the \u2018quota candidates\u2019 due to being under-prepared. Quotas therefore need to be supplemented by capacity building, wide publicity and ongoing support over a significant period of time. How can quotas be made more acceptable to those nudged out? How best can possible backlash be handled? One should expect some resistance in the early stages as formerly advantaged groups (e.g., men, elite) or more capable persons are nudged out. No one likes to give up an existing advantage, more so if they have worked hard for it. That said, there are six concrete steps which can help: \ufffd Explain clearly the justification and the need to compensate for different starting points - often the only basis for exclusion is an accident of birth. \ufffd Recognise explicitly that there is a difference between current advantage vis-a-vis dynamic advantage which can be built over time through fairer opportunities. \ufffd Have a logical basis to build criteria for selection of individual beneficiaries and the extent of reservation. \ufffd Institutionalise transparent systems to identify beneficiaries of quotas, minimising errors of including the ineli- gible or excluding the eligible. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity \ufffd Institute clear entry as well as exit criteria; exit criteria help in \u2018graduation\u2019 of those who are ready to face open competition (for example, second or third generation beneficiaries, or income tax assesses, or any other criteria applicable locally) so that the next batch of persons from the same group (for example, rural women or remotely located) can benefit rather than the same family benefiting generation after generation. \ufffd Build capacity of the beneficiaries to minimise complaints of lower standards. Four questions for consideration \ufffd How can elite capture be minimised? It will be seen as undeserving and undermine the legitimacy of quotas. Here, having logical entry and exit criteria may be critical. \ufffd Should quotas be the exception rather than the rule? That is, should quotas exceed 50 percent? The answer would depend upon local circumstances. \ufffd Should quotas be permanent or temporary? If the latter, how long is \u2018temporary\u2019? This would depend upon which type of inequality was being addressed and the local circumstances. \ufffd Do quotas compromise merit?

Dear Network Members, Women and Electoral Politics in Indonesia I would like to share some interesting experiences and studies I have had here in Indonesia in the area of women and electoral politics. I would like to start by asking the basic question of \"What exactly are we seeking to achieve\"? By this I mean to focus on the fact that measures like quotas are tools or means. They are not ends. This I ask to open the thinking to other tools or means that might achieve an appropriate end - that is, vastly increased participation and leadership by women in the public domain. I ask this as I have studied the Indonesian elections of 2004 in considerable detail.

But on the aggregate they achieved the target. However, only about 11 percent of elected MPs were women. We can all guess why 30 percent candidates did not become 30 percent MPs - women were placed at the bottom of the lists and as number one in regions where the party had no hope of winning. Clearly the machinations within the parties were disadvantageous to women being elected. For the study I reconfigured all the actual candidate lists applying three different mechanisms designed to \"promote\" women. The first was a 50-50 candidate list. The second was the zipper system. The third was my own creation which, for want of a better term, I have named the \"Adam and Eve\" system (explained below). In applying these systems I used the same number of candidates as each party actually used in each district. I applied the principle of \"minimum compliance\" by the parties to each of the three alternatives being tested. Minimum compliance to each regulation was deemed as follows: \ufffd 50-50: In every party list all men are listed above all the women (that is women are placed at the bottom). This system still complied with 50 percent women candidates. \ufffd Zipper: Every party list was led by a man and the last candidate was also a man. \ufffd \"Adam and Eve\": Under this system it is only the leadership of the candidate list that is of concern. Leadership here is defined as candidates 1 and 2 (like a president and vice-president ticket). Under this approach a party may not have two men at the top and it may not have two women at the top. Thus each party's candidate list is led by one man and one woman, hence (for those familiar with the Ibrahamic traditions), Adam and Eve. Minimum compliance here meant that every list was led by a man and no list contained any other women except the one placed at position two. The results were as follows: \ufffd 50-50: Sadly it was actually possible for there to be 50 percent women candidates and yet not one woman elected. \ufffd Zipper: Under this system some 20 percent of candidates elected were women, although they comprised 30 per- cent of all candidates. \ufffd Adam and Eve: Under this system some 19 per cent of candidates elected were women. The percentage of candi- dates who were women was 20 per cent. The result showed that in practical terms the zipper and the Adam and Eve system were equally effective in seeing women elected. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity The most interesting point from this exercise, however, was that the \"transfer\" rate from candidate to winner was much better in the case of the Adam and Eve system. In practical political terms, the number of men who had to be excluded to \"make room\" for women was much less using the Adam and Eve system, than in the case of the zipper and certainly in the case of the 50-50 systems. Additionally, given that this Adam and Eve system does not purport to be a quota system (for example it was very fea- sible to have less than 10 percent women candidates on the lists in the large districts), this system has some chance of not getting bogged down in the ideological tussles of the \"fairness\" or \"equity\" of quota systems. So to make an extraordinarily long winded point, this Adam and Eve approach can actually deflate some of the heat from the \"quota\" debates and simultaneously actually dramatically reduce the stress that emerges as parties are forced to \"exclude\" some candidates to let in women in order to comply with quotas. I recognise that my use of a very \"folksy\" term such as Adam and Eve may seem odd and against a \"technocratic\" or even \"professional\" grain. However, my experience has shown that using a form of lexicon that is familiar and even symbolically powerful reduces the capacity of potential opposition to mobilise against an idea. It also provides a familiar notion that is easier for people to connect with. Very often they come to grips with the essential \"values\" and principles being promoted. In the case of this Adam and Eve I have found many Indonesians who ordinarily would be expected to be very opposed to a quota system being confronted by a concept and a picture that they have difficulty", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb44a26d-d618-4067-b3f0-7fb20c95dd8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb44a26d-d618-4067-b3f0-7fb20c95dd8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b3e3f23223c69161588f24a8e28058b5274c60faca63fff1ecbd629784530fa"}}, "hash": "5b3e3f23223c69161588f24a8e28058b5274c60faca63fff1ecbd629784530fa", "text": "a priori reject- ing, even if the application of this principle may indeed make their own personal/professional positions more tenuous. In addition to looking at the Indonesian House of Representatives, I also studied the results of the newly constituted up- per house, the House of Regions. This is a fully elected house, but excludes parties - only individuals may be candidates. They are elected by a single non-transferrable vote - with four MPs elected by voters, with each province constituting a four member constituency. Notably given the absence of party lists, it is best to see this system as \"Four past the post\". Overall there were over 900 candidates to the House of Regions. Across the nation, only 9 percent of the House of Regions candidates were women, yet 21 percent of MPs elected were women. Indeed, in about 25 percent of provinces, women were the top elected candidate. Key issues of interest: No quotas applied, yet results achieved are vastly better than those achieved in the House of Representatives. Also how come voters manage to disproportionately vote women into office? It was no doubt an ironic help that there were so few women candidates, thus allowing for an aggregation of \"the wom- en's vote\" around one or two candidates in a province, but this seems insufficient to explain the extent of the discrepancy. At any rate it would also appear reasonably clear that collectively, the voters do not seem to have any great resistance to voting for women candidates. As important to me is to question as to why were there only 9 percent women candidates. It is not possible to \"blame\" the parties here. They were of no real consequence to the electoral processes for this house. Here I think we come up against issues that are less amenable to cure than quotas. My theory - or more aptly, specula- tion - here is that a core point of resistance to women candidacy may actually come from those closest to them, that is their family, close and extended, as well as local community. I have a strong view that in addition to some of the \"institutional\" approaches such as quotas, there is much work, argu- ably even greater work, to be done in working at cultural and even psychological levels to reduce resistance to women being active in public life - starting with those closest to them. This would include equipping potential women leaders with strategies and approaches for dealing with the inevitable social questions that arise, especially given that politics - is certainly at the party activist level - very much a night time (out of office hours) calling. Here I suspect sharing and mutual learning from those women who have pioneered the moves forward should be mobi- lised to inform those potential women leaders. Such sharing could well take place in a cross-partisan way.

Dear Network Members, The Subordinate Role of Indonesian Women and Capacity Development Progress towards gender equality in Indonesia has been mixed. Despite many changes and gains, women remain under- represented in the political arena. Kevin Evans notes that much work remains to be done to promote acceptance of women being active in public life. It could be fruitful to consider the origins of this resistance. To a large extent this can be traced to the discourse of kodrat wanita \u2013 the traditional subordinate role of women. This still dominates media representation and political rhetoric, despite the fact that in the new millennium Indonesian women are on average older and much better educated when they marry than at any other time in the past (Jones 2001). As Robinson (2000:141) demonstrates, Suharto\u2019s New Order policies governing civil life were emphatically gendered. The diversity, often flexibility, of indigenous gender orders throughout the archipelago was homogenised into a pigeon pair of nationally-promoted, circumscribed ideal male and female roles (kodrat pria and kodrat wanita). This state- sanctioned binary was integral to the project of nation-building and to the cultural construction of the imagined com- munity of Indonesia (Anderson 1990).

Smoothing out regional and cultural gender variations in acceptable maleness and femaleness was part of this nationalis- ing process. In some developing countries, it is the case that low levels of female education mean that women cannot play an impor- tant role in politics. I would argue that this is not the situation in Indonesia. However, even the premise of that argument rests on shaky ground to some extent because there is a lack of reliable, baseline sex-disaggregated data at national and sub-national levels. Sex-disaggregated data \u2013 where available - is used mainly for reporting on global commitments like MDGs 2 and 3 and rarely for regional comparisons or internal policy formulation and strategy development. Women are certainly under-represented in elected leadership and executive positions. In government, they currently hold less than 15 percent of national parliament seats and less than 10 percent of district level seats, despite a policy of \u2018soft quotas\u2019 in political party lists. Out of 220 million Indonesians, more than 112 million are women. In the political world, Indonesia has only four female ministers and one female governor\u2019 (The Jakarta Post 2007). As Blackburn (2001) points out it has never been easy for women in Indonesia to enter workplaces and fields of em- ployment traditionally dominated by men because such transgression threatens the established gender order in both the material and the non-material realms. Not only did twentieth century Indonesia enshrine the patriarchal ideology of Ba- pakism \u2013 literally \u2018rule by the father\u2019 \u2013 but when Megawati Sukarnoputri was nominated for president in 1999, a major objection from the Islamists was that a woman could not \u2013 by definition \u2013 lead (Sen 2002; Robinson 2004). That Megawati did eventually become president has much to do with the fact that she is the daughter of first President Suharto, like other female politicians in the region who have risen to prominence in public life because they were daugh- ters, wives or relatives of famous male politicians - for example, Cory Aquino, Benazir Bhutto and Sonia Gandhi. One of the few women to have risen to political leadership on her own merits has been Rustriningsih. She was elected as Mayor of Kebumen in 1999 for Megawati\u2019s PDIP party and proved very popular (Vickers 2005: 222). In 2008 she was the running mate of Bibit for Governor of Central Java. Their win meant that Rustriningsih became the Vice-Governor of one of the most important parts of the country. Rustriningsih was very active on the campaign trail in 2007/2008, constantly travelling and speaking all over the re- gency. This is not in keeping with the traditional role of an Indonesian wife and mother (she is both), and the opposition campaign emphasised her absence from home and apparent neglect of her family duties. There is a prevailing gendered moral discourse that respectable Indonesian women (especially married women) do not work beyond daytime hours, particularly not in situations where they must be out at night, or working irregular hours in teams of men \u2013 all of which are typical of the working life of female politicians and law-makers. Female politicians like Rustriningsih are forging a new path which might suggest to the younger generation that a viable political career is possible for them, yet the weight of history bears upon this innovation. The Ordinance on Measures Limiting Child Labour and Nightwork for Women created in 1925 specified that women were prohibited from performing nightwork from 10.00 p.m. through to 6.00 a.m. It was only amended in 2003. UURI Asia Pacific Human Development Network 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity 13 \u2013 2003, Article 76 (1) on women\u2019s employment now states that women less than the age of 18 are prohibited from performing night work from 11.00 p.m. through to 7.00 a.m., unless otherwise specified by a licence issued by the De- partment of Manpower. So it is only very recently that a married woman over 18 no longer required permission from her husband to work at night. This 1925 law was set up to protect women, but, upto 2003, it actually gave employers grounds for discriminating against women in appointment and employment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0017a6eb-7d38-46e7-bdc2-0974b7dc3f37": {"__data__": {"id_": "0017a6eb-7d38-46e7-bdc2-0974b7dc3f37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab817a1c46b5d2f0214708f99aca7d62e55b57bd77fe6877d7204f880d643aee"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9a082ac-9fe6-408e-a570-82444bc208ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95b64a143a999da7bf1e4537140372a0f9ec93bde675f696dd5d5d40d7e9781d"}}, "hash": "d5252c972847f3debae0b322b7f857da9db36f11815e1c6744f976bd30e2361d", "text": "This discourse is fortified by the cultural Islamisation of Indonesia, where Shari\u2019a courts may regard a wife undertaking night work as contributing to grounds for divorce by the husband.

This has two aspects: on the one hand, women can seek representation in local government, and some women such as Rustriningsih have succeeded very well at this. On the other hand, women can \u2013 in theory - use accountability mechanisms at the local level to address gender inequalities in education, health and delivery of basic services. However, the new deregulations also allow elected local governments to implement hard-line Islamic by-laws that inhibit the freedom and rights of women, including their right to work beyond daylight hours, or to move about alone. If Indonesian women are under-represented in the political arena, then they do little better in the field of senior manage- ment. Few women hold senior executive or managerial positions. For example, although they constitute 38 percent of the civil service, a mere 14 percent of senior civil service jobs are held by women, primarily in the traditional fields of teaching and health. This brief discussion has suggested some reasons why Indonesian women seem to be marginalised in the political arena. It is not because of low levels of education as such, which clearly is a significant factor in a country like Papua. Educa- tion remains a factor, however, because at present, schooling tends to reinforce traditional gender stereotypes rather than challenge them. The fact remains that the 1974 Indonesian Marriage Law does not properly recognise women as legitimate workers in the public domain.

How long will it take? To what extent can legislation effectively assist with the transition?

Perhaps early mind-unclogging, early education is crucial, for biology is not destiny, although it is important. In thinking about these questions, we will have to be careful not to fall into a \"cultural trap,\" a generalised cultural expla- nation of gender inequality. Of course, it is recognized that there may be many cultures in a given country but cultures that co-exist in space and time do share a common core. So if all cultures share a common core, which is more important for gender equality: the core or non-core? This common core is important, especially in post-colonial contexts when kastom (culture) and particularly local knowl- edge systems are inordinately valued, if often properly so, given their role as an important buffer against harmful ele- ments of introduced traditions. Equally, the diversity within cultures is of real consequence. This can be explained by drawing on the text of the draft HDR for Bougainville in Papua New Guinea (PNG): \u201c\u2026..culture is not monolithic; i.e. a 'cultural imperative' doesn't characterise a whole society. Communities are diverse; e.g. there is a faction with its foot more in kastom/culture than in modernity, and vice versa. The evidence is that a sector or even cultural majority of the population accord women high respect. But this doesn't deny the report\u2019s finding of a cultural imperative against wom- en's advancement, e.g. particularly in public decision-making and negotiation in post-conflict society; rather, it clearly speaks of competing cultural interest groups. And while contested ideas are the norm, there is no place for ambivalence regarding equity and women's choices.\" This diverse quality of culture/kastom is missing in the otherwise interesting comments of the PNG Chief Minister in his recent remarks at the opening of a two day sub-regional workshop on special measures for advancing women\u2019s representation in legislatures in Port Moresby: \"We can no longer argue that custom stops us from recognising women as equal partners in our development when our aspirations are to embrace many western ideals and concepts.\" (Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat 2008). What is missing in the Chief Minister\u2019s remarks is that different groupings in his coun- try aspire to a diverse range of things - sometimes including western ideals - but sensibly, often not. However, he did not elaborate on behavioural changes, how much time is needed to make this happen, the role of men in such events \u2013 and even the petrified state of their attitudes. He said: \"I realise that not all my colleagues are keen to positively discriminate in favour of women or to even recognise the value that both genders can add to the development process. Sadly there are some whose minds are already made up on the rightful place of women in our Pacific Island societies. But I am confident that with the new generation of leadership in the region today and persistent lobbying and awareness, we can overcome some of these hurdles. As members of the legislature we [predominantly men] too have our part to play in increasing the representation of women in our parliaments.\" (Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat 2008). Whatever the solution, gender equality is a long-term issue; something that cannot be achieved quickly. This needs to be said upfront to dampen unreasonable expectations. It also needs to be recognized that culture is not the only explana- tion for gender inequality; biology is also important. And the two \u2013 nature and nurture - acting together may be more important than either.

Were we able to do that, things can work out better for men and women. Gandhi showed the power of femininity when confronting the macho authority of the British Raj. His tactics were all feminine - passive resistance, fasting, etc., and they stumped the bulldog Brits. India's best sportsmen too have been at their best when they drew upon their femininity - Ranjitsinhji invented the delicate strokes in cricket - the leg glance and the late cut - and Sunil Gavaskar, who now has the record for the highest number of runs in Test cricket, could be a woman at the crease. And Ramanathan Krishnan and Anand Amritraj did not have a powerful serve, only the deft, aesthetic angle and touch to the ball. India's hockey was at its best when it displayed the ability to dribble the ball along the edge line, and delicately direct it into the goal post.

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity CEDAW, legislative indicators and legal reviews CEDAW offers us a good framework for reviewing legislation vis-\u00e0-vis a rights-based and gendered lens. This is be- cause CEDAW: \ufffd is a human rights treaty that provides a comprehensive guarantee of equality in the enjoyment of human rights in all fields - civil, political, economic, social, cultural and other fields. \ufffd strongly advances a rights-based approach to claiming rights. \ufffd has a conceptual framework that takes into account the social construction of gender. \ufffd espouses a framework of equality that examines not only equality of opportunities, but also equality of benefits and results (substantive equality). \ufffd provides for a framework of discrimination that addresses all forms of discrimination, especially indirect discrimination. \ufffd focuses on the state as the primary holder of obligations to enable enjoyment of women\u2019s human rights and equal- ity, hence enabling more comprehensive reforms. Furthermore, CEDAW sees legislation as one of the key measures to ensuring gender equality. It obligates states to em- body the principle of equality in legislation and ensure, through law and other means, its practical realisation. It requires the state to establish legal protection of women, to adopt legislative measures to prohibit discrimination, and to modify and abolish existing laws that are discriminatory against women. CEDAW also mandates putting into place legislation in all fields, whether political, social, economic, and cultural, for the full development and advancement of women to guarantee their equal enjoyment of human rights. Some examples Some examples of recent work to review legislation using CEDAW as the main framework and analytical tool are on- going in Viet Nam, Indonesia and Cambodia (*).

To assist the government review, a comprehensive legal review entitled \u2018CEDAW and the Law: A Gendered and Rights-based Review of Vietnamese Legal Documents through the Lens of CEDAW\u2019 has been published (Chiongson 2009). This review covers a total of 117 indicators and 34 sub-indicators (**) and is divided into specific fields or areas identified in Articles 1-16 of CEDAW. The fields/areas of the review, covering Articles. 1-16 of CEDAW, are as follows: (a) guarantee of equality and discrimination; (b) prohibition of discrimination; (c) legal protection of women; (d) institutions for implementation and monitoring; (e) incorporation and application of treaties; (f) gender based violence; (g) temporary special measures; (h) social and cultural patterns of conduct; (i) trafficking and exploita- tion of prostitution; (j) political and public life; (k) nationality; (l) education; (m) employment; (n) health; (o) economic and social life; (p) rural women; (q) equality before the law; and (r) marriage and family. A review of laws relating to marriage: Indonesia A legal review of the Marriage Law (Law No. 1 of 1974) of Indonesia is presently being undertaken by the CEDAW Working Group Indonesia (CWGI). Prior to this, the Marriage Law had been subjected to many calls for reform. How- ever, the initiative to undertake the present legal review using CEDAW as the framework gained impetus from the recently concluded constructive dialogue in 2007 between Indonesia and the CEDAW Committee, wherein the latter recommended amendments of specific legal provisions to enable women\u2019s enjoyment of rights within the family and marriage, including polygamy, inability to transmit citizenship, family consent before engaging in night work, husband\u2019s consent in sterilization and abortion, minimum age of marriage of 16 for girls, identifying men as heads of households and women as housekeepers amongst others. The review identified a set of CEDAW legislative indicators, provided recommendations for reform and proposed alternative texts to the Marriage Law. The review will be used as a platform for advocacy for the amendment of the Marriage Law or for the drafting of a new one (***). Asia Pacific Human Development Network 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity A review of laws relating to domestic violence, trafficking, domestic workers and marriage: Cambodia Cambodia is also undertaking a legal review of selected laws to ensure compliance with its obligation under CEDAW. In the CEDAW Concluding Comments on Cambodia, the CEDAW Committee, expressed that Cambodia must take advantage of the ongoing legal reform process to achieve full compatibility and compliance of its laws with the provi- sions of CEDAW. The CEDAW Committee also provided recommendations for revisions to specific legislation, such as including a definition of discrimination against women in its laws, provision of sanctions in civil and criminal codes for acts of discrimination against women, legal provisions on temporary special measures, and raising the minimum age of marriage to 18 amongst others. To ensure the state\u2019s compliance with its obligations under CEDAW, the Ministry of Justice of Cambodia (****) is spearheading the initiative to undertake a legal review of selected legislations relating to domestic violence, trafficking, domestic workers and marriage. It foresees this initial review as a first step to a review of other laws in the future. Presently, CEDAW legislative indicators are yet to be identified to begin the process of as- sessing the selected laws. I hope this information is useful to many of you. Please do let me know if you wish for further information on these matters. I will be happy to reply.

Dear Network Members, Politically at the Margin in Sri Lanka: The Reasons for Women\u2019s Low Participation Women\u2019s political participation in parliament and other local bodies is lowest in Sri Lanka. But the physical quality of life of women in Sri Lanka is much higher than in neighbouring countries in the region. Women are marginalized in the political system in my country. All parties are rather reluctant to select women as candi- dates in the election. There are incidents where women are promised a candidacy and asked to carry out election cam- paigns. Women carry out campaigns, spending their hard earn money only to find out on the day of signing the nomina- tion that their names are omitted from the list. When such incidents take place, women are reluctant to take legal action on the grounds of breach of promise or violation of human rights. The backlash that will follow will be a threat to their life and also, women get depressed after such incidents. The Ministry of Child Development and Women's Empowerment has taken action to introduce a quota system to elect women to parliament. Popular thinking is that women should contest elections on par with other parliamentarians and get elected, but not otherwise. The 'Mahinda Chintanaya' policy document of the present government indicates an allocation of a 25 percent quota to select women candidates in provincial and other local government elections. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity Charisma has been a main cause for women to win in an election. Women in general are very active as voters but they shy away from contesting elections. Political violence, assassination of character and family obligations have kept women away from the active political arena. Most discriminatory laws have been amended and women friendly laws have been introduced. The Penal Code was amended in 1994 and grave punishment could be meted out to offences concerning violence against women. The num- ber of women lawyers exceeds men. But the number of women in powerful positions of the judiciary is comparatively low. Attitudinal change is needed to address negative attitudes towards women in society. It is the main reason why wom- en get suppressed in the political arena. A massive public campaign has to be launched to educate the masses. With best regards, Manel Chandrasekera Research Officer Ministry of Child Development and Women's Empowerment Government of Sri Lanka Ranjani Murthy wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Ranjani Murthy points to the need for country monitoring of conventions and optional protocols. Ef- fects of distinct policies/ legislations that have the potential for collision between rights of different marginalised groups are also an area of concern. Personal laws in South Asia can be a barrier to gender equality. She suggests adoption of common laws for gender equity drawing from the best aspects of different personal laws, consistent with CEDAW. Dear Network Members, Gender in the Justice Systems in Asia-Pacific My contribution is on gender in justice systems, partly touching upon issues of political participation. Gender in justice systems cannot be looked at in isolation from rights to development in justice systems; that is right to livelihood, right to housing, right to education, right to water and sanitation levels and right to civil and political rights. It is a concern that in the Asia-Pacific region, a number of countries are party to ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) through ratification/accession/succession (*) and to ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) is lower than to the CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women). Twenty-four out of forty-one countries in the region are party to ICESCR and twenty- one out of forty-one countries to ICCPR through ratification/accession/succession as of 26th September 2008 (**). In the case of CEDAW the comparative figure is thirty-six out of forty-one countries (***) (as of 1st February, 2008; http:// www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/8.htm).

At the national level, there are few countries in the region which have passed legislations on rights to health, rights to livelihood, right to housing etc. The Indonesian Government passed Health Laws in 1992 on right to health, which makes it easy for women to demand rights to abortion and sexual and reproductive health services (ARROW, 2006). The Indian Government guarantees right to primary education (but not secondary education) and employment for 100 days under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (2005) (Government of India, 2008). Thus one realistic indicator for monitoring is what economic and social rights are guaranteed at the national level. Gender equity in justice systems If one directly examined the issue of gender equity in justice systems, thirty-six out of forty-one Asia-Pacific govern- ments have ratified/acceded/succeeded to the CEDAW, but only twelve have signed the optional protocol (Annexure III), which makes it difficult for civil society actors to hold the governments to account when they fail to adhere to the articles in CEDAW. The Indian Government, for example, is yet to sign the optional protocol of CEDAW as of 5th March 2008. The absence of a human rights commission or court at the Asia-Pacific level (unlike the Inter-American Commis- sion court of justice where Latin American women seek redress) poses a problem. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity An important barrier to gender equity in justice systems at the national level is the presence of separate personal laws for each religion in several South Asian countries. Any move to have uniform laws has led to an attempt to use the personal laws of dominant communities as a base, which has led to backlash (as in the case of India). The degree of attention to various aspects of gender equity varies across personal laws governing inheritance, marriage, custody of child etc. There is hence a need for common laws on gender equity which adopt the best in different personal laws, and beyond to ensure consistency with CEDAW. Women of different faiths could have the choice as to whether they would like to follow the personal or common laws. There are gaps in legislation pertaining to areas that do not fall under the \u2018personal laws\u2019. For example, there is no legislation to value women's unpaid work in the household in the region, or any mechanism to ensure that half of the husbands' wages or salaries goes to the women in lieu of the unpaid work their wives do at home. Such a legislation is a must, especially in the context where women\u2019s engagement in paid work is low. In South Asia, there is no reservation for women in parliament in India, unlike Pakistan, Afghanistan or as proposed in Nepal (UNICEF 2006). Laws on child sexual abuse are weak in India. Laws on abortion are weak in Pakistan and Sri Lanka in South Asia. With the exception of Nepal, homosexuality is a crime in other South Asian countries. Here again the system of public interest litigation was used by groups representing lesbians, gays, transgender and inter-sexed people to press for decriminalisation of ho- mosexuality, pointing to the need for accountable legislation and independent judiciary for women to demand changes in legislation. Hence it is important to monitor consistency between national legislation and CEDAW, ICESCR and commitments made at 1994 ICPD and 1995 World Conference on Women and rights accorded to women and LGBTIs in each country. Conflict between rights of women and rights of other marginalised groups A last issue is the question of conflict of interests between rights of different groups. Child rights groups have lobbied in Sri Lanka for preventing women with young children from working overseas. In India, girl-child rights activists, who have campaigned against sex selective abortion, have been accused of allying themselves with pro-life lobbyists, thus restricting in practice (not legally) women\u2019s access to legal abortion. Rights to confidentiality of HIV positive clashes, with young women\u2019s rights to know the HIV status of to-be-spouses in arranged marriages. Hence, there is a need to monitor the impact of policies and legislations governing other marginalised groups from a gender lens, as well as hold dialogue between people working on rights of different groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b218a9bd-b7c4-4dd4-a779-94ded3f4f1b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b218a9bd-b7c4-4dd4-a779-94ded3f4f1b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ce87f255a1d43aa7d2764127098a72f8932e7614f33d84b9d16a38ab4c0ca3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1229321-eb3f-43c5-a746-1a9291660c00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "057bfe4df740ae01b976e34bdaefd498a92bacc256b26dca38bea9217890711f"}}, "hash": "fcc1e4ab2c805d506c852f6f1df6755fa0866f0d7e28f4d9f77178aa0a295d32", "text": "With best regards, Ranjani Murthy Programme Advisory Committee Member Asia-Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (ARROW) Kuala Lumpur Notes (*) For a glossary of terms related to Treaty actions please refer to http://untreaty.un.org/English/guide.asp#treaties (last accessed on 28 October 2008).

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity R. Sudarshan wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: R. Sudarshan reflects on the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace and shares some relevant resources on legal rulings and public litigation in India. He draws attention to a recent ruling by the Bombay High Court on a case of sexual harassment against a private sector company. This ruling is of crucial importance as it states that \u201cthe right to gender equality is intrinsic to the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution\u201d. Dear Network Members, Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: Serious Situations As mentioned in Geeta Ramaseshan\u2019s contribution (of 15th October), sexual harassment in the workplace is an area of concern, where the absence of legal interventions has impeded the advancement of women. A recent ruling by the Bom- bay High Court on a case of sexual harassment against a private sector company, however, gives us hope. The two-judge bench made observations that would encourage women who face such problems to talk about them. As reported in an article by Kalpana Sharma (2008) the Bombay High Court\u2019s ruling is important as it reminds us that: \ufffd \u201cThe law of the land requires that work places where women are employed must institute a committee headed by a woman and consisting of at least 50 percent of women members and a civil society representative to look into such complaints. In this instance, the company did not comply with this and instead appointed a single person to inquire into the matter\u201d. \ufffd Women\u2019s commissions can play an important role in such cases. \u201cWomen are often afraid to go directly to court. The women\u2019s commission is often the first step. If the woman had not gone to the women\u2019s commission, perhaps her case would never have reached the court. A woman who suffers sexual harassment is in a very lonely place. She is afraid to speak out for fear of losing her job. And if she does, she faces the additional problem of not being employable as other companies might see her as some kind of \u2018trouble-maker\u2019. As a result, most women silently bear harassment and sometimes voluntarily opt out of jobs or positions where they are harassed. The silence en- sures that more of this kind of harassment continues.\u201d It is important to note that in Vishaka and Others vs. State of Rajasthan (1997), the judgment of the Supreme Court laid down guidelines on what constitutes sexual harassment, and how complaints related to it ought to be pursued. In the case reported by Kalpana Sharma from the Bombay High Court, the court held that an inquiry by a lawyer appointed by the company was not in accordance with Vishakha guidelines. It ordered that a complaints committee be constituted and a fresh inquiry be held. The quote below is a part of the ruling in the case. It is important as it highlights women\u2019s rights and the fact that gender equality is a fundamental right. \u201cThe right to gender equality is intrinsic to the right to life under Article 21 of the constitution. The right to life com- prehends the right to live with dignity. An affront to or the invasion of gender is destructive of the right of every woman to live with dignity. Article 15 of the constitution, which contains a prohibition inter alia against discrimination by the state on the ground of sex is an emanation of that right. The provisions of the constitution recognise gender equality as a fundamental right. Gender equality in all its dimensions is a basic human right which is recognised by and embodied in the provisions of the constitution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c36626f-d586-482b-9287-1805390d899d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c36626f-d586-482b-9287-1805390d899d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fbb471c601c61b9bb6aa4fd8978d748c592f171d48df3d0ab9c4cf4e8032a19"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c21f270-5454-4899-85aa-7e71d1dc49bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9444b9f4c71618f0bc803b3e387657e4e90c98da81225c4f528fb39deb32b2ca"}}, "hash": "4e4d300f4abd5e0805f68e4cc266cec9d0ff4654a73964f849f6332f14f4edb4", "text": "The broad sweep of the human right to gender equality traverses every facet of the position of a woman in society.

Dear Network Members, A Snapshot of Women\u2019s Political Participation in Asia-Pacific My contribution to the APHDR network will focus on women\u2019s political participation in Asia-Pacific countries. Women\u2019s historic exclusion from political structures and processes is believed to be the result of multiple structural, functional and personal factors that vary in different social contexts across countries. In Asia-Pacific, there is a general lack of laws enacted for electoral processes and in countries where there are laws, the lack of implementation of these laws hampers women\u2019s participation in politics. Five of the seven countries in the world with no female representation in national parliaments belong to the Pacific region ( Pacific Islands Forum Sec- retariat 2008). An incredible amount of social transformation is impacting on women inequitably in all parts of Asia- Pacific. Losses in women parliamentary representation in newly independent states in Central Asia is pronounced due to changes from a socialist to a capitalist system. Drastic changes in political leadership and governance, such as that witnessed after coups, also hinders women\u2019s participation in politics.

A refreshing concept of a Parliamentary Gender Caucus that cuts across ethnic and party politics to address issues that curtail women\u2019s participation in politics has been put forward by Malaysian groups (APWLD n.d.). At present, Asia and the Pacific regions have fewer levels of female political participation, especially in parliament. As a successful development strategy, more needs to be done to address this issue.

However real change entails interventions at family level, and Gurpreet suggests some steps. Dear All, Politico-Legal Equity: Changes Required at the Family Level The situation in India is not very different from other countries and we remain a male dominated society culturally, socially and politically. There have been recent attempts in the politico-legal field to change the situation, but it remains difficult. Our parliament has attempted to provide reservation for women in national and state legislatures but has not been able to do so for over a decade despite an agreement in principle that this is necessary. At the lowest level, in panchayats, similar rights have been given but the majority of elected representatives are proxy candidates for men who are close relatives/family members. Wherever women have attempted to break free, they have encountered resistance from society at large. As per Section 8 (a) and 15 (a) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, females have equal inheritance rights to their parents\u2019 property. But some of its provisions were discriminatory towards women. However, there have been some positive de- velopments. In fact, the Hindu Succession (Amendment Act), 2005, addresses some of the gender inequalities in the old law. For instance it confers: a) equal rights to women in all agricultural land (right denied under old law) by repealing Section 4 (2) of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956; b) grants birth rights to daughters in Mitakshara Coparcenary property (joint family property) by amending Section 6 of the old law. But overall, the politico-legal reality is reflective of the socio-cultural bias which exists in spite of economic and demo- cratic progress of the nation. So I would suggest that unless we simultaneously attempt to correct biases at the family level, the situation is unlikely to change.

Furthermore, the non-democratic structure of political parties is another obstacle which impedes women\u2019s chances of being nominated for a political post. Even committed women political workers and activists have slim chances of selection by their party leadership. The election campaign process is exposed to politically-motivated violence and character assassination of candidates - a factor which Sri Lankan women find demotivating for active political participation. Additionally, interested women candidates lack the financial resources to run effective election campaigns. This undermines women\u2019s interests in active politics. The stereotyped education system also contributes to limit women\u2019s political participation. Even educated women are reluctant to enter politics as they consider it a \u2018dirty game\u2019. The education system promotes the traditional and distinct role of men and women. The school curriculum is devised in a way to project women in a subservient role to men. Some women politicians have capitalized on their political connection. Their fathers, husbands or close relatives have been involved in active politics. They do not have to face the challenges which other women clamouring for political power have to face. Male prejudices have also prevented women from becoming ministers of more powerful ministries such as defence or finance. It is evident that Sri Lankan women face numerous hurdles in terms of their active political participation. Every step of the way - as party workers, candidates and elected members of the assemblies - women are at a disadvantage. For greater women political participation, the political structures of the state should provide a level-ground for women. This will ensure their equal involvement and participation in active politics.

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity Dear Colleagues, Dignity of Living of Migrant Maids: Regressing or Progressing I would like to say few things about the socio-economic and political status of female migrant workers. In newly de- veloped countries like Malaysia, more than 3.5 million both legal and illegal migrant workers are employed in various sectors (Kuppusamy 2008). Of this total, as per official reporting, women migrant domestic workers, mostly domestic maids, represent a substantial portion - not less than a quarter million (Human Rights Watch 2004). Almost all domestic maids are brought into the country legally after going through tedious immigration and health procedures. The potential employers comply with the law, primarily because they are afraid of facing a fine or jail term for harbouring illegal entrants in the country. Most of the domestic maids are from neighbouring countries, mainly from Indonesia and the Philippines and of late, a small number from other friendly nations such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Cambodia. Despite legal entry into the country, the plight of the maids is unheeded in many ways due to a lack of proper legal and political perspective. First of all, it is deplorable to note that contemporary immigration practices lack form and structure in comparison to immigration of labourers who were brought in large numbers during the colonial era. During the colonial periods, both sending and receiving nations had laws in place for guiding immigration activities. In particular, The Indian Emigration Act of 1922 of 5th March 1922 (No. VII of 1922) was passed by the Indian Central Legislature to help and protect Indian emigrants abroad (INTISARI, Vol. III No.4, September, 1970). Similarly, on 24th April, 1952 the Federation of Malaya and the Singapore Governments passed the Immigration Ordinance, 1952, that came into effect on 1st August 1953. It controlled the entry of unwarranted immigrants, who it was feared would jeopardize employment opportunities, wage conditions, cause congestion in schools and medical institutions and create pressure on social facilities as well as cause deterioration in the standard of living of the local population. Consequently, the living conditions and welfare of both the immigrant and local populations in terms of remuneration, passage, accommodation, establishment of institutions and representatives, Tamil Immigration Fund to facilitate return migration etc. came into effect.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b13526db-51e2-4dee-8642-ac7a7b9c6985": {"__data__": {"id_": "b13526db-51e2-4dee-8642-ac7a7b9c6985", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a72b9e6501926b9522c0e6186cbf3f1fe322f6755daf56fbc3384dc7ce1e1a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "30faadf3-65d4-4455-b486-e7c5c7219802", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95f64c8ebf1f036bf5d56a0434b6ad20d1bc472e4cd2c7d3bedef0ad9c1ddf61"}}, "hash": "338ff4e109401bcc3c9c21b10dd23fc0369a4f73fbcb8439fd70a5a70e586810", "text": "came into effect.

Secondly, the domestic maids are poorly paid, ranging from RM450 for inexperienced maids to RM800 for well-trained maids, who mostly come from the Philippines. Very few in number are reasonably paid. On the other hand, the bulk of the employers -constituting wage earning middle-class families - cannot afford to pay more, despite both the husband and wife working. But the irony is that the maids are compelled to work throughout the day in comparison to workers in the formal sector, who are subject to an eight-hours-a-day working life. For additional hours of employment, the workers in formal sectors are paid over-time wages, which is lacking for home-maids. The workers in the formal sec- tors are subject to tasks that they are recruited for, but maids are required to do additional tasks such as washing cars, felling plants and trees in the gardens, painting the house during festival occasions etc., even though they are recruited to manage the basic cleanliness of the house and minding babies. In such cases, the maids lack appropriate institutions or channels to voice their employment conditions. Even their recruiting agents are in a helpless situation to render any help and in most instances display a \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019 attitude once they have collected their dues for services rendered from both parties. Such a poor and disparate employment condition is indeed an utter violation of basic human rights and dignity of living. Thirdly, the domestic maids are prone to various forms of abuse and quite often, sexual assault, by their employers. There are no exact statistics on this. The number of incidences that come to light via police records or the media are very few. Many do not report incidences for fear of unwarranted social repercussions. As acknowledged, such victims live in fear, subject to low self-esteem and psychologically suffer in silence. Again, they lack appropriate and adequate institutions - especially of the non-governmental type - to address their concerns. Being female, poor and less educated, the domestic maids lack courage to form their own interest groups. On the other hand, high-handed organizations do not give priority to resolving their plights. For instance, the harrowing experiences of Nirmala Bonat, an Indonesian maid burnt with iron and scalded with boiling water when she was 19 years old in 2004, has still not been resolved amicably, despite making headlines in the media (BBC News 2004). Indeed, this is only the tip of the iceberg. According to Ms. Fernandez, Executive Director of TENAGANITA, \"45 Indonesian workers have died in Malaysia so far this year from a variety of causes, including torture by abusive employers; more than 1,050 human rights violations ranging from rape to physical abuse occurred over the last two years (Le Fevre 2007; CARAM Asia 2007). Without the foreign labour we would not have been able to develop so rapidly. We cannot just use and discard them as we like. There is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive policy that is respectful and humanitarian with payment of adequate retrenchment and other benefits.\u201d On another note, \"It's time for Malaysia to clean up its own house by extending labour protections to domestic workers,\" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, Women's Rights Director at Human Rights Watch (Hu- Asia Pacific Human Development Network 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity man Rights Watch n.d.). Though the citations were made by making due reference to Malaysia, the story line is still the same in other countries like Singapore and the Middle-East, where a large number of domestics helpers are imported. Indeed, it is a growing global concern as more countries are joining the modern and developed country ranks, requiring the import of domestic services through proper legal and humanistic frameworks.

Dear Network Members, Protective Laws and Women in the Public Sphere In understanding gender equity in the public sphere of life, I see four factors are largely responsible: \ufffd laws surrounding women\u2019s rights to work. \ufffd gendered impacts of technology use. \ufffd the neglect of women workers\u2019 issues by most trade unions. \ufffd discriminatory policies corporations practice such as gender selective recruitment and the use of instruments such as Voluntary Retirement Schemes to retire women. These factors operate in most areas of women\u2019s work and represent women purely as reproductive agents as against economic citizens of a country. Biology is crucial to the identity of women and in shaping their rights to and at work. But biology is also culturally sanctified.Both women and men are prevented legally from performing certain actions or receiving certain benefits, not on grounds of proven ability or inability, but because they are women or men. Protective legislation performs precisely this role; we enjoy such protection in all aspects of life: for example, in reserved seats in trains and buses to reserved seats in electoral bodies to workplaces. Some of these legislations were developed in view of poor working conditions that existed in early industries and no doubt had good intentions behind them. But in many countries that experienced Equal Employment and Opportunity legislation, such protective legislations have been withdrawn. In India for example, there are laws around night and underground work by women; in Indonesia women are entitled to enjoy two days of paid leave every month upon proving that they are menstruating. Again, technological E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity improvements that make the labour process less arduous, safer and increase productivity usually push women out of jobs and represent women as unable to handle machines to legitimise men as the typical labourer whose interests supersede those of women workers. Globally, the earliest forms of protectionist legislation were bans on night work, relating to moral protection of women. One of the first international conventions from the ILO was the 1919 Night Work (women) Convention, later revised as the C89 Night Work (women) Convention (revised), prohibiting women from working in industrial undertakings at night. Most ILO Conventions have been revised several times since; the one on night work was revised in 1934, 1948, and in 1990, introducing a clause for women to work at night \u2018in specific activities or occupations\u2019 (but not around childbirth, when pregnant, or when would endanger health). A 2001 ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) produced a general survey on night work conventions and concluded that although there was a need to protect the conditions of all night-workers, and that differential protection of women was not generally needed. Others include Maternity Protection Convention of 1919, Equal Remuneration of 1951, and Discrimination Convention of 1958. The original Maternity Protection Convention stated that women shall not be permitted to work for six weeks after confinement, and have the right to leave work six weeks prior to confinement, and be paid maintenance while away from work. It was revised in 1952 and 2000, indicating changes in the definition of maternity. These laws keeping women from perceived dangerous work in certain places and times can be said to have given rise to a \u2018protective maternalism\u2019 in the context of women\u2019s work, which is often described as the \u2018maternal wall\u2019.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "663cd0e9-d9e1-42b6-bba2-714b21a0a9d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "663cd0e9-d9e1-42b6-bba2-714b21a0a9d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11469e657b52c188b030be56091a117f16c5ebdc178072b25a660266360bdfed"}, "2": {"node_id": "60c222d6-5a35-4e98-8ebe-15b8f84b1ba9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c24cd3380ab928e2a9303c46396009b3da1c057b520843acab491e39bfc8b16a"}}, "hash": "3e9924fdec388051754d57a54544c0542b29ef6bd13d5eb9975b8cbdd30a3d46", "text": "By predominantly defining women as subjects to be protected, the legislation characterises women\u2019s citizenship in terms of maternal duties, and comprises the primary reason from which the three other factors follow.

Indeed, there have been moves within the ILO to try and address the inconsistency between protective conventions and anti- discrimination conventions. However, member states have been slow to recognise that conventions such as C89 Night Work (women) Convention (Revised) and C45 Underground Work (Women) Convention discriminate against women in a way that is not justified on the basis of women\u2019s special reproductive functions. In 1975, the International Labour Conference passed a motion that \u2018women should be protected \u201con the same basis and with the same standards of protec- tion as men\u201d\u2019 (ILO 2001, para 60). In 1985, the Conference passed a resolution calling all member states to \u2018review all protective legislation applying to women in the light of up-to-date scientific knowledge \u2026 and to revise, supplement \u2026 or repeal such legislation\u2019 (Politakis 2001: 406; ILO 2001, para 60). A 2002 Working Party on Policy regarding the Revision of Standards of the ILO Governing Body decided to encourage the denunciation of the C45 Underground Work (women) Convention and instead encourage states to sign C176 Safety and Health in Mines Convention (ILO 2002, para 13). Although bodies within the ILO have made some efforts towards encouraging states to denounce the protective conventions, their efforts have largely failed because of a commitment to ongoing protection for women by a bloc of states. For example, Sri Lanka has denounced the protective conventions, but India is in league with a long list of Asian countries that have not: China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore and Viet Nam. This state resistance to denounce protective legislation has received support from trade unions that fear \u2018losing the ground already gained\u2019. This ambiguity is evident amongst the feminists themselves who have keenly debated legal protectionism, raising the question whether women need protection or equality, and whether women should be seen primarily as \u2018women\u2019 or as \u2018workers\u2019. Kessler-Hariss et al. (1995) describe protective legislation as the \u2018central tension\u2019 around women\u2019s productive work outside of the home: \u2018In different forms, they occupy a pivotal position in the debates of every industrial country, pitting the demand for equality in the workplace against the well-intentioned efforts of men and women to protect family life.\u2019 This debate hinges upon the \u2018difference/equality\u2019 question. Are women to be protected generally? As recently as in 1991, Russian women faced the dilemma of choosing between the \u2018double day\u2019 for the promise of a husband supporting the family. In the same year, the Court of Justice of the European Communities decreed that national provision forbidding night work for women contradicted the Communities\u2019 regulations mandating equal opportunities for women and men. Both France and Italy had restrictions on women\u2019s night work, and whilst the laws were never rigidly applied, it was argued that women are more exposed to risks of violence or sexual assault at night. In India, we are now experiencing a similar wave of sentiment against the relaxation of night work for call centre girls. It is resented by citing the valid argument of rape and sexual harassment of young girls from call centres in Bangalore or other metropolitan centres. Is that not equivalent of discrimination? But do not all women enjoy some protection? The most widely known protective legislation is maternity leave that women lay claim to by virtue of their sex. Over 120 countries in the world now provide paid maternity leave. Maternity leave, according to Kessler-Harris, et al. (1995: 23) is intended to combine a woman\u2019s motherhood and related roles with productive roles in the workplace, making sure that women\u2019s reproductive labour is acknowledged in the workplace, providing an environment in which women can work and still bear and rear Asia Pacific Human Development Network 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity children with a sense of security that women\u2019s childbearing capacity does not become a source of discrimination in the labour market. However, other forms of protection legislation focus on breastfeeding needs, also explicitly tied to women\u2019s maternal roles to valorise women\u2019s biological specificity, and \u2018menstruation leave\u2019 in some Asian countries such as Indonesia, Japan and Korea.

Kessler-Harris, et al. have widely discussed the feminist leader Clara Zetkin\u2019s view of legal protectionism for women, and feel that \u2018When applied to women only, protective legislation was directed less at their welfare than at reconciling the competing needs of women and families to meet a broader set of social purposes, including sustaining the family wage male breadwinner ideology; supporting a sexually segregated labour market; and enhancing the possibilities of survival for future generations of workers\u2019 (1995: 23). Because of its broad reach, the terms of legislation were frequently contested and, applied to all workers, it seemed an unwarranted intervention in the free market. Legal protectionism is divisive for the feminist cause of equality for women and men in opportunities. When it is applied to women, protection tends to create special categories of workers.

She explains why schooled gender stereotyping entrenches the submissive role long expected of women in private domains. Thus, good progress towards gender parity in education does not necessarily result in workplace inequalities and non-representativeness in public roles. Dear Network Members, Gender Equity in Education and the Under-Representation of Women in Indonesian Public Life My contribution is focused on gender and education in Indonesia. There are quite a few developing countries where levels of female literacy and participation in education are high, but the status of women remains low \u2013 Indonesia and Fiji, for example (Nilan 2009). This means that the notable inequalities that persist in women\u2019s access to health, economic and political participation cannot be attributed solely or even largely to a gender gap in education at the present time. In Indonesia, progress towards gender equality has been mixed. Gains have been made in education, but inequalities in access and outcomes for male and female students persist. Overall, Indonesians from all ethnic groups and religious faiths favour education for both sexes. It has been claimed that where it exists, virilocality \u2013 daughters marrying out of the family - does not influence investments in daughters in Indonesia (Kevane and Levine 2003: 4). Like the other \u2018Asian Tigers,\u2019 Indonesia saw an increased age at marriage (Jones 2005) and significant improvements in educational attainment occurring simultaneously with strong economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century. Indonesia has made a commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the Elimi- nation of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Education For All (EFA), and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These conventions have specific policies to promote gender equality in education, includ- ing building the capacity of educational institutions to manage and promote gender sensitive education. Achieved or increasing gender parity at all levels of education indicates that good progress is being made towards targets being met. However, as indicated above, high levels of female literacy and participation in education do not necessarily guarantee that there will be equality in labour market status and income, nor that women will be well-represented in the public life of a country. Changes favouring gender equity in the public domain often take decades to influence change in the private domain of marriage and the family, where the submissive role of women is deeply entrenched. While the case may be made that women and men in Indonesia are becoming more equal (Sen 2002; Smith-Hefner 2005), in many fields including education, marriage and sexuality, there still remain \u2018zones of conflict as women seek new roles and men continue to pursue old practices\u2019 (Utomo 2005: 122). In the new millennium, Indonesian women are Asia Pacific Human Development Network 76 TABLE OF CONTENTS Education and Gender Equity on average older and much better educated when they marry than at any other time in the past (Jones 2001), yet the dis- course of kodrat wanita - the traditional subordinate role of women - still dominates media representation and political rhetoric. We must remember that \u2018laws that institute basic equal rights (\u2026) often are not enough to eliminate persistent gender inequalities embedded in a country\u2019s institutional foundation\u2019 (World Bank 2001:108).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ce0f7e2-40dd-428f-bbc4-e6285e5becc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ce0f7e2-40dd-428f-bbc4-e6285e5becc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0c328675ec83292b42c233bc54193c48189ba1187e68e2c4b0351a3189e1327"}, "2": {"node_id": "3657a32c-a00f-47fa-9217-6848dc186fb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1085b20d5da8a389d14a87a668ff0866eba9f1f4791340d84439f4c6d5a7be01"}}, "hash": "cb43d906db7fe9af64c1b45ceb96a088b8d61bde9d99cf2f826a2c3086a33229", "text": "Specific gains In Indonesia, an order mandating a compulsory nine years of basic education was implemented in 1994.

The socio-economic status factor is also important. In 2002 for the poorest 20 percent of the population, only 49.9 percent of children enrolled in junior high school, while for the richest 20 percent of the population, the percentage was 72.2 (UNICEF 2002). Male and female pupils proceed from primary to junior secondary school in roughly equal numbers. However, there is a gender gap in transition rates from junior secondary to senior secondary school (73 percent of males and 69 percent of females). There is also a significant gender gap in school dropout rates, both at primary and junior secondary levels. Girls are more likely to drop out. In 2002, at primary and junior high school level, for every ten children who dropped out, six were girls and four were boys. At senior secondary school level, seven girls dropped out for every three boys). However, once again this has to be considered relative to rural-urban differences \u2018for senior secondary education, rural- urban differentials outweigh gender ones\u2019 (DFID 2007). Literacy rates were even at 99.8 percent in 2002 (UNICEF 2002). Over the last decade the number of females has come to equal the number of males in higher education. The current enrolment rate is about 15 percent of the eligible cohort (DFID 2007). In summary, even while acknowledging that access to education becomes increasingly more limited as children proceed to higher levels of education, Indonesia has achieved good overall progress towards gender parity in the net enrolment ratio both at the primary and junior secondary levels (UNICEF 2002). Unequal outcomes from schooling However, despite the laudable gains in education, significant barriers to achieving gender equitable outcomes from schooling include: gender biased teaching and classroom practices; sexual harassment; lack of safety in some areas for girls going to and from school; and the continued wide use of textbooks that reinforce gender stereotypes. For example, males are depicted far more often and in more active and authoritative roles than females. The names of prominent men are cited more often. Gender stereotyping still prevails in choice of subjects and study strands at secondary school, leading to different labour market incomes that inhibit the involvement of women in high profile public life. National policies certainly exist to promote gender equitable outcomes from education, but they encounter many obstacles, not least of which are old-fashioned thinking, religious conservatism, inertia and corruption. The message for girls still tends to be that while their educational achievements remain on par with boys at school, their main purpose in life after education is to marry and be the helpmate of their husband, raising his children and meeting his needs. This is not an ideal scenario from which to build a life trajectory that includes a high profile in public life. Public gains, private status quo Moreover, despite gender mainstreaming - the concept is not well-understood \u2013 there is a significant problem in schools of inadequate contextualization of gender equity initiatives within existing Indonesian socio-cultural and religious be- liefs and traditions. For example, early marriage is one of the key issues identified in some rural regions of Indonesia that still affect female access to and participation in education. Young women everywhere still tend to see their paid work and income as supplementary to that of their future husbands. This returns us to considering the important private domains of marriage and the family where gender roles still tend to be prescribed. Paragraph one of the Indonesian Marriage Act (UURI 1 - 1974) states that the rights and status of the wife is equal to that of the husband, both in their married life and in society. However, Paragraph three states that the husband is the head of the household and the wife is a housewife, reflecting conventional patriarchal family structure (Ariani and Nilan 1998: 63; Mariyah 1995). This impacts upon the perceived legitimacy of married women\u2019s careers. A late 1990s CE- DAW report on Indonesia expressed concern on this issue \u2013 \u2018the predominant view appears to be that married women might provide supplemental income for a family, but that there is very little emphasis on the right of women to develop a career of their own\u2019 (1998).

Conclusion This discussion has suggested some education-related reasons why Indonesian women seem to be marginalised in public life. It is not because of low levels of education as such, but because at present, schooling tends to reinforce traditional gender stereotypes rather than challenge them.

It is difficult to dispute the fact that education enhances lives and combats generational cycles of poverty and disease. Millennium Development Goal 2 calls for children everywhere, boys and girls alike, to be able to complete a full course of primary schooling by the year 2015. The world has come a long way in increasing access to education, and is on track to meet the 2015 deadline. However, this discussion is not about universal access to education, but rather about the more complicated goal of equal access to a quality education. I do not intend to diminish the great strides humanity has taken to ensure more children in every part of the world are granted access to a much-needed education. In fact, I shall reiterate the 2008 MDG Progress Report, which states that \u201cnet [primary school] enrolment in almost all regions exceeded 90 percent, and many countries are close to achieving universal primary enrolment\u201d (United Nations 2008). However, these figures do not necessarily indi- cate or forecast signs of enhanced female participation in the economy, in politics or in the household, simply because of the inequities that confront females even after they gain educational access. In the rush to achieve universal education, increased access to schooling can be achieved at the expense of the quality of education being offered, especially for young girls.

A few days ago, fifteen high school girls were on their way to class when assailants surprised them and threw acid in their faces. It is believed that the attack was most likely carried out by those opposed to the education of women (BBC News 2008). In a country that has recently granted access to education to its female citizens, this gruesome attack is an illustra- tion of the discriminatory and in this case, violent, treatment girls may receive even after they have accessed educational opportunities. While this is an extreme case, it is a harsh reminder of the social pressures and inequalities forced upon females that may affect the quality of their education and their ambition to succeed - even if it is readily available to both boys and girls - and thus prevent their later success and constructive participation in society. Too often, girls who are given the chance to gain an education are not given the concomitant chance in schools to thrive and reach their full potential. For instance, communities may still give priority to boys when it comes to paying for a quality education. In these communities, boys are expected to move on to secondary education, get good jobs and thus provide for their families. Girls are more often expected to contribute to household work or to watch younger siblings. In other instances, girls may be prevented from receiving the same level of education because of religious reasons. These social pressures contribute to unequal educational quality that constrain the choices and voices of women, and thus limit their opportunities. True gender equity means that education programmes must be gender-sensitive. This means that learning environments must promote equal participation and empowerment. In schools, women must be equally represented in teaching, ad- ministrative and leadership roles. Furthermore, girls must be granted the same educational options as boys to pursue mathematics, science and language. It is absolutely necessary that girls are provided with the same technical training as boys, in a bid to expand their range of choices. Girls must be given the same level of encouragement and preparation as boys to excel in primary levels and then move on to secondary levels. This point is crucial, as boys may receive more or different training and skills to move on to more advanced levels of education to pursue professional careers, while women are expected to work in the household. This is not a problem of the developing world alone, but is prevalent in many classrooms in the developed world. (In the United States for example, while access is not as much of an issue, quality and equity often at times can be worse than in the developing world.) A quality education is as important as enrolment and access. Human development and the eradication of poverty can only be achieved by providing a quality education for all. If girls receive inadequate education, they are more likely to become women that are illiterate, impoverished, unhealthy, and pass on this cycle of despair to their children. Instead, girls must be empowered to realize and learn that they can help contribute to transforming societies, and become a coun- terforce to the attitudes and behaviours that limit women\u2019s roles, participation and ambition.

More than a third of the world\u2019s girls who are out of school are in South Asia, and the vast majority of these in three countries \u2013 India, Afghanistan and Pakistan (DFID 2005). By contrast, East and South-East Asian girls, as well as those living in many countries in the Pacific, have a far greater likelihood of attending school. There are three main reasons why these regional disparities matter. First, women\u2019s education matters for growth. A seminal 1993 World Bank study demonstrated that high performing economies in East Asia such as Indonesia, Malay- sia, Republic of Korea, Singapore and Thailand had been much more successful and quicker than others in eliminating gender gaps in school enrolment. Moreover Klasen (1999 and 2002) and others (e.g. Lagerl\u00f6f 2003) have subsequently found a high correlation between the increase in the number of years the average girl spends in school and the growth per capita GDP at a regional level. Secondly, perhaps more than growth in itself, women\u2019s inclusion in the education system matters for development, in- cluding the attainment of many of the Millennium Development Goals. For example, South Asian women tend to have more children, at a younger age, and closer together, than their East Asian counterparts. As a result of this, combined with poor child nutrition practices, South Asia\u2019s child malnutrition rate is alarmingly high. In fact, according to India\u2019s National Family Health Survey (as cited by Saxena 2008), this figure barely changed in India between 1998-9 and 2005-6, and now stands at a shocking 46 percent for children under three. These challenges can be tackled through edu- cation. Not only can education directly teach women better and safer childcare practices, it can also have even greater impacts on child health simply through offering women more choice and power. According to the UK\u2019s Department For International Development (DFID) (2005), Asian women with seven or more years of schooling have two to three fewer children than those who have less than three years of schooling. Moreover, educated women are 50 percent more likely than uneducated women to get their children immunized (ibid). Thirdly, at least in theory, girls\u2019 attendance at school should ensure that they achieve greater voice and power on a va- riety of levels: greater economic power, through participation in skilled and semi-skilled labour; and greater political power, through gaining the skills to participate in decision making at a variety of levels. And yet, these benefits are not always automatically realized. For example, Sri Lanka, unlike much of South Asia, has long enjoyed gender equality in terms of education. However, Sri Lanka\u2019s women have one of the lowest shares of seats of any Asia-Pacific National Asia Pacific Human Development Network 80 TABLE OF CONTENTS Education and Gender Equity Parliament (4.9 percent at 2007, source: Inter-Parliamentary Union, as cited by UNDP 2008). In fact, policies such as reservation systems seem to be far more significant in ensuring women\u2019s participation in national level politics than gender parity in education. That is not to say that the latter is unimportant, either in informing women\u2019s decisions to participate, or ensuring the quality of candidates. However education in itself may not be sufficient. This may be in part due to the quality of education \u2013 does it challenge or reinforce traditional patriarchal and heteronormative expectations? (Pamela Nilan in her contribution to the AP-HDNet suggests that in Indonesia it may be the latter) \u2013 but it may also be a function of broader societal expectations and pressures. Identifying and eliminating these broader pressures is critical to achieving true equality for women in South Asia, and I would very much welcome suggestions from the community on possible answers. For example, Bangladesh has recently undergone a revolution in the way it approaches female education: it now educates almost the same number of girls as boys at primary and secondary level, thanks to an ambitious series of reforms since 1992 which included massive re- cruitment of female teachers, school feeding programmes and school stipends for girls (see e.g. Das 2008). But how can the full range of benefits from this approach be realized \u2013 for all Bangladesh\u2019s women and girls, boys and men?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa0af54c-dcec-40c4-add2-ceeb116a797e": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa0af54c-dcec-40c4-add2-ceeb116a797e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c271322ca084744c6d9eb6b2662bdcea38466ecfbed70119e4ca6facfd7de98a"}, "2": {"node_id": "22f205d3-fdfe-446f-84ac-ebe24ab69afd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "026c8da4116dc51984e8b9fa149d47d00e07843ac04f1ed0e4cbebd8e189ff2f"}}, "hash": "8b4b6c81a0fea215d5b52732a3514d9c28c4e2cc57a90658196b55bba0d11e87", "text": "With best regards, Kirsty Hayes Hunger Campaign Consultant UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific Colombo Office References Das, M.B. 2008.

The importance of quality education has been rec- ognized internationally. In 1990, the World Declaration on Education for All identified quality as a prerequisite for achieving the fundamental goal of equity. The Dakar Framework for Action (2000) expressed the commitment to \u201cim- proving all aspects of the quality of education and ensuring excellence of all so that recognized and measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all, especially in literacy, numeracy and essential life skills\u201d (World Education Forum 2000: 8). This was also reconfirmed in the Asia-Pacific regional framework for action adopted by the Asia-Pacific Conference on EFA 2000 Assessment. Curriculum reforms that work towards eliminating the gender stereotyping in schools (teaching about women\u2019s contri- butions in history class, eliminating sex stereotypes in textbooks, etc.) are important steps in promoting quality educa- tion and gender equality. In the region, there are very few of such interventions. For example, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand have taken measures to review gender bias and sex stereotyping in school materials (Corazon 1998). The Equal Opportunities Commission of Hong Kong, China (SAR) has done research on gender stereotyping in education, not only on content analysis of text books and teaching materials with regard to gender stereotypes, but also did a baseline survey of students\u2019 attitudes towards gender stereotypes (Equal Opportunities Commission 2002).

In Japan, for example, representatives from vari- ous women\u2019s groups sought the cooperation of publishers in eliminating gender stereotyping in text books. As a result, over the years, textbooks have been more likely to include illustrations and pictures of fathers grocery shopping or pre- paring meals (Atsuko 1995). But perhaps enough is not done. Because when the League of Japanese Lawyers conducted a study in 1989 to examine the extent to which gender discrimination had been eliminated in the books, it found that over the previous ten years not much had changed (Owaki 1991, cited in Atsuko 1995). Eliminating gender stereotyping in education and greater gender equality in education can be instrumental in reduc- ing violence against women and girls.

No doubt, girls and women are taking advantages of education. Education delivers knowledge and skills that make women more informed and render them the capacity to meet their needs and achieve their benefits, not only for them- selves, but also for their children. Worldwide empirical evidence shows us that the schooling of women is strongly associated with more participation in the economy, low child mortality, lower fertility rate, better nutrition, and more education for the next generation. While the investment in primary education fueled the economic take-off in East Asia, more women were involved in the labour market and increased their income in combination with higher education levels. The World Bank Report on The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy stated that high per- forming Asian economies closed the gender gap in education much earlier than other countries with the same level of per capita income. Although it is universal education without a specific focus on girls, the benefits for girls and women are significant (World Bank 1993: 47). However, higher education attainment did not result in closing the gender gap in many fields. It is easy to find a bunch of studies which revealed a \u201cKuznets effect\u201d between human capital, in terms of education and income (Winegarden 1979; Gregorio and Lee 2002). They show us that inequality in education actually widens the income gap while advancement in education attainment increases the general income level.

For example, the second national survey of Women Status of China in 2000 reported a greater gap in income between the two sexes and between rural and urban women, despite the fact that the average schooling years increased in all of these groups. Compared with 1990, the average schooling years of women in 2000 went up by 1.4 years, to 6.1 years, while average schooling of men went up from 6.7 to 7.6 years. The gap between two sexes in school- ing was reduced by 0.4 years. Meanwhile, during 10 years, the income gap of the two sexes increased by 7.4 percent (ACWF and National Bureau of Statistics 2001). More cases could be given. The glass-ceiling is still discouraging women with higher education. Domestic violence is pervasive in all the races, cultures and classes, whatever income and education background they have. The gender in- equality in family, school, workplace and other social settings are perpetuated by bias, social norms, law, culture, public policies and exacerbated by other institutional factors. Education attainment is leading the way to gender equality. How- ever, barriers coming from institutions, ideology and social bias are slowing progress and we need strategies and inter- ventions integrating other empowerment approaches. In particular, we need to be aware of the gender inequality rooted in the education system itself. Education, like other social settings, is constructing and reinforcing the gender bias and discrimination. For example - the biased textbook and curriculum, gender-blinded school policies, gender stereotypes in classrooms are propagating gender inequality through education.

Dear Network Members, Re-looking at Quality of Education from a Gender Lens Previous discussions on this network have emphasised the instrumental aspect of education. Increasing access and better quality of education have been raised as key to expanding individual capabilities in the economic, social and political spheres. No doubt these approaches are useful towards achieving tangible outcomes in narrowing the gender gaps in these fields. However they do little to explain what causes gender inequities in these fields (even when progress on edu- cation indicators is gender equitable) and how these inequities are perpetuated across generations. Identifying reasons to explain the why and how becomes especially important when we consider that the Asia-Pacific region has a wide performance record on education indicators. While in South Asia the gender gap in primary education enrolment remains a problem, in many countries of East Asia and the Pacific, indicators related to gender equitable ac- cess to primary education and secondary education show favourable progress. Despite this progress, gender gaps in the political, legal and economic realms remain wide. For example take the case of Fiji, raised in an earlier contribution (Pamela Nilan in the politico-legal discussion). Fa- vourable gender indicators in education in Fiji do not show a straightforward relationship with greater gender equity.

For a human development approach to improving \u2018Quality\u2019 in education and by extension narrowing the gender gap, it could be instructive to move beyond a \u2018pure\u2019 instrumentalist view. In practical terms this would require cross-fertilising concepts and ideas considered by educationists and psychologists; for example, examining inter-disciplinary learnings on how gender stereotypes are perpetuated at an early stage in the class-room as well as the playground in early social- ization stages. This entry-point could provide a deeper understanding of the why and how reasons, and more importantly what can be done? For instance, the consideration of the ideas in works such as Paula Friere\u2019s classic on Pedagogy of the Oppressed, and others can be an entry point. This body of work emphasizes how a critical pedagogic approach can be of help to students to question and challenge traditional beliefs and practices that dominate. Investments in teacher-training in active learn- ing approaches using these and other recent ideas could result in more innovative methods for catalysing the role of edu- cation in transforming gender relations. Therefore, investments beyond standard curriculum and text-book reform led thinking may need to be applied. Other \u2018extra-curricular\u2019 investment areas that are critical to building self-confidence and participation, such as sport, could be considered for greater policy level attention.

A picture of gender equality in education With economic development in the Republic of Korea, women have been the most likely beneficiaries from the expan- sion of public education. As shown in Table 1, the promotion rates of female students up to secondary education in Korea indicate that female students are no longer a minority group in terms of equal opportunity in education compared to their male counterparts. Even though a compulsory education is provided just up to middle school, Koreans place a lot of value on education. This has had a positive impact on women\u2019s access to education.

Since then, the Ministry of Education and Human Resources (MOEHR)* and the Ministry of Gender Equality (MOGE) have been the main policy delivery mechanisms that are responsible for gender equality in education. There are three laws supporting the establishment and the implementation of a gender policy in education and training. These are: \ufffd The Basic Education Act enacted in 1997 (Article 4: the prohibition of sex discrimination in education was in- cluded). This act was modified in 2000 (Article 17: the promotion of gender equality in education) and in 2004 (the existing articles were reinforced and the committee for gender equality education was established under the MOEHR) \ufffd The Women\u2019s Development Act enacted in 1995 (Article 20: the expansion of education opportunity for females and the promotion of gender equality in education) \ufffd The Elimination of Sex Discrimination Act formulated in 1999, which also stipulated the need for the enhance- ment of gender equality in education Further, both the establishment and the implementation of the gender policies in education are also firmly grounded in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW, Article 10: education) that has had a legal force since 1985 in the Republic of Korea. On the basis of the acts mentioned above, significant progress towards gender equality in education has been recorded, especially since a Gender Focal Point (GFP) of the MOEHR was created. The Gender Focal Point was established as a special mechanism to accomplish gender equality in the six ministries of the government (including MOEHR) in 1998. The gender focal point of the MOEHR, which was called the Women\u2019s Education Policy Division, had, until 2005, emphasized three dimensions in making and implementing policies regarding gender equality in education: (1) the full development and utilization of female human resources (2) the construction of a female-friendly environment in a for- mal educational setting to achieve gender equality and (3) the intensification of sex education and prevention education of sexual harassment. Each of these three areas fully addresses its importance in making gender policies, especially at a secondary level of education. However, in 2005 September, the GFP, once placed in the Planning and Administration Bureau, was re-positioned in the Lifelong Education Department, which means that GFP was moved to a smaller unit. Given that the GFP was in the Lifelong Education Department, some people were concerned that its main focus could change from school education to adult education. Further, after the restructuring of the ministries by a new government (**) this year, both the position and functions of the GFP literally disappeared in the organization, since issues of gender equality are not an important agenda as upheld by the former administration. Therefore, it seems that in spite of many achievements that we have accomplished thus far, we do not have a bright future under the new government, both in the field of education in specific and in other areas of society in general. This reminds us that it is political will that is required to recognize that gender inequalities still exist in every corner and every layer of our daily life. In the end, strong leadership and the value placed upon effective and accountable policy discourse made in gender equality are essential prerequisites for achieving gender equality. With best regards, Hyunjoo Song Professor Korean Institute for Gender Equality Promotion and Education (KIGEPE) Republic of Korea Notes (*) Due to the restructuring of government organizations in the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Education and Human Resource was merged with the Ministry of Science Technology. Thus, its name has changed to Ministry of Edu- cation, Science and Technology (MEST). (**) Korea had a presidential election in December 2007.

At least two key research implications have emerged. First, in South Asia, the problem of school access and attainment persists with an inference that girls\u2019 education is not as important as boys\u2019 education. Second, in Indonesia and many other parts of the region, much- improved girls\u2019 school attainments have not reduced socio-economic gender disparities.

Members showed this in terms of women\u2019s under-representation in leadership roles, probing the reasons, and described how this adversely affected both women and men. Members described the multi-faceted nature of education\u2019s role in gender equality, and how people\u2019s long-held habits and behaviours often obscure this. In part, we have seen how shifts in formal education could address this. In this vein, members underscored the instrumental value of education: the importance of attending to quality (textbook content, teacher training/ pedagogy). A recurring thread is that education can be instrumental in reducing violence against women and girls. Focus on the institutionalisation of education and its practices have shown how education is fundamental in shaping modern societies and its effects on people\u2019s abilities to make use of opportunities. Members have made frequent references to how school subjects are designed, organised and examined, often in stereotypical and constraining ways. In other words, the quality of education is a vital issue in terms of its technological, inter-generational impacts (the kinds of books, language/ stereotypes used, staffing ratios, policy objectives, etc.). Members emphasised the importance of international recognition of causal links between education quality and gen- der equality. It may be of interest to note that the Asia and Pacific launch of the 2009 Education For All (EFA) Global Monitoring Report took place on the 24th of March 2009 in Bangkok (http://www.unescobkk.org/index. php?id=5862&tx_ttnews[pS]=1224750709&tx_ttnews[pointer]=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=1219&tx_ttnews). Subsequently, members stressed the further value of education as an end goal. Beyond instrumentality, they urged us to grasp the intrinsic value of education in the context of bringing about gender equality. A key implication is the significance of the capability perspective in which education enables people to be active agents in the evolving social consciousness or resources that humans piece together. For this approach, inherent value surrounds an educated individual whose recogni- tion of the social situations she is born into has stimulated her powers of agency. Such conditions stimulate her to act as a member of a group, emerging from original narrow perception to active self-identity in terms of the wellbeing of her social grouping. For strategic interventions, the key implication is the integrated or comprehensive nature of interventions required. Beyond schools, the fuller social picture is largely an unconscious education that shapes what societies expect of people. A girl in- herits the whole human intellectual and moral resources of civilization, including its disorientations like gender inequality. Almost from birth, this process continually shapes individuals\u2019 powers, flooding consciousness, forming habits, disciplining ideas, and motivating feelings and emotions. For strategic interventions, formal education could strive to organise this general process, taking as its foundation the prem- ise of human motivation. Integrated with informal education, interventions could tap into aspirations, enable people to take command of themselves so that they have full and willing use of all their capabilities, using their own powers, values, and interests. In this way, they could continuously act to remedy disoriented messages so that their judgment could be up to the task of tackling the social conditions they face.

Gender equality is the goal of gender mainstreaming. Mainstreaming requires the integration of gender equality con- cerns into every aspect of the development process, including the functioning of institutions of governance and develop- ment agencies. The starting point for mainstreaming is gender analysis, i.e. an assessment of the differences in the ways that women and men are likely to experience a particular project, programme, policy or law. This analysis provides the basis for reshap- ing institutions and redesigning interventions in ways that enhance gender equality.

However in practice, the strategy of gender mainstreaming has fallen short of achieving social and institutional change. Instead, typical outcomes include significant portions such as gender policies, gender awareness workshops, gender staffing ratios, etc. These are necessary but insufficient milestones towards gender equality.

Herein lies a big challenge: to view gender mainstreaming as a fundamental part of the architecture requires considerable and a concerted effort to understand the context and power structures that are involved. Dear Network Members, Mainstreaming Gender: A Challenging Process Gender mainstreaming is a means and not an end in itself. It allows for the integration of gender equality concerns into every aspect of the development process, thereby contributing to gender equality. However, this approach has often failed to work, and is perceived by many as the burden of the \u2018mainstreaming fatigue\u2019, and in the process focus on the goal of gender equality is lost. The concept of gender mainstreaming is perceived by some as being on the periphery, or just an \u2018add on\u2019 rather than being \u201cvalue added\u2019.

The last thing one wants, should it happen, is to pull back on resources and expertise for work on this issue. Gender equality raises some of the most fundamental and sensitive problems. Several issues such as unequal wages for men and women, high maternal mortality rates, feminization of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, gender-based violence etc., can be traced back to the legacy of unequal power relations between men and women, and the lower status accorded to women in society. With such a complex issue at hand, riddled with cultural, political and social intricacies, we cannot relegate working on gender equality to an either-or situation of gender mainstreaming or a separate specialized func- tion, programme and/or unit. As the problem is so grave, all our efforts put together can only hope to make a small contribution. With best regards, Radhika Behuria Programme Analyst Asia-Pacific Gender Programme UNDP Regional Centre Bangkok Roohi Metcalfe wrote: Facilitator's note: Roohi Metcalfe outlines pragmatic means that could ensure gender mainstreaming endures. As an entry point to political participation, this includes quotas for women. More broadly, successful strategies demonstrate the importance of extensive consultation (a \u201cConcept Note\u201d or similar assessment of stakeholders\u2019 gender sensitivity), followed-up by an action plan that encompasses a comprehensive set of gender-specific indicators for all goals and targets. Dear Network Members, Gender Equality: Part of the Equation! \u201cGender mainstreaming makes a gender dimension explicit in all policy sectors. Gender equality is no longer viewed as a \u2018separate question,\u2019 but becomes a concern for all policies and programmes\u201d (UNDP 2005: 5). Based on observations and findings it is clear that effective strategies that address gender mainstreaming are formulated to establish mechanisms for ensuring that gender concerns are mainstreamed during project and programme concep- tualization and design; and that the strategies are pursued with the cooperation of key stakeholders and partners. For example, strategies promoting quotas for women both at the legislative and local level in many countries have provided women with a strategic opportunity to set and implement local government agendas and given a boost to women in terms of political participation. Effective strategies need to be followed by time-bound action plans with clear budgets and gender-specific indicators, limited not just to r the gender goal, but a comprehensive set of indicators for all the goals and targets. Given specific country situations and the availability of sex-disaggregated data and qualitative information, effective strategies for gender mainstreaming act as a practical entry point to address the political, social and economic status of women. The scope and mechanism of gender mainstreaming programmes, projects and innovative initiatives for successful implementation and impact require extensive consultation between governments, donors and stakeholders which in- cludes civil society, women\u2019s groups and the marginalized. Without the strong \u201cownership\u201d of the government and the stakeholder \u201cbuy in\u201d the best of strategies, programmes and projects do not achieve the desired results. Some good ex- amples and clear methods followed to acquire stakeholder \u201cbuy in\u201d and get policy makers on board are when a \u201cConcept Note\u201d is prepared for an intervention, and this is followed by feedback, and a dialogue, conducted to solicit ownership and interest in taking the intervention forward. Another key step that has been found to be useful is to gauge the gender sensitivity of the partners and the implementers.

Dear Network Members, Institutional Mechanism for Gender Budgeting: Prior Evidence from India There is a growing recognition of gender budgeting as a significant socio-economic tool to mainstreaming gender at the macropolicy level. Given that gender budgeting is neither making separate budgets for women nor an analysis of the earmarking of funds for programmes exclusively targeted for women in budgets, a few compelling hypotheses firm up in my mind at this point on mainstreaming gender into fiscal policy making. First, mandatory earmarking of a certain percentage of budgetary allocation for women could, at best, be only a second principle of gender budgeting. Second, homogeneous \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 gender budgeting policies set at the national level (top-down approach to gender bud- geting) cannot ensure gender equity in a heterogeneous nation. Thirdl increasing feminization of governance can make variations in the public expenditure decisions corresponding more to the revealed preferences (\u2018voice\u2019) of women. Fourth, the advent of fiscal decentralization provides a logical entry point to introduce spatial mapping of gender needs, which is a step ahead from homogeneous \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 budgetary policies set at the national level. Empirical evidence on gender budgeting reveals that worldwide, India is taking the lead in the process of creating a sustainable institutional mechanism for gender budgeting (Commonwealth Secretariat 2005: 2). I have been part of the team since the start of the process in 2000, initially at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP is an autonomous research institute of Ministry of Finance, Government of India; the pioneer institute in the country on gender budgeting) and later with the Ministry of Finance.

The Committee prepared various analytical matrices to examine the gender intensity of existing budgetary allocations and also suggested plausible institutional mechanisms to integrate gender budgeting into the budgetary process in India. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 92 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming In the 2004 Union Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance stated that the Government of India would examine the Ex- pert Group\u2019s recommendations in this regard, and he hoped it would be possible for him to implement some of them in the Budget for 2005-2006. The historic moment in the process was the inclusion of a separate \u2018Statement on Gender Budgeting\u2019 in the 2005-2006 Union Budget which included the gender sensitivities of budgetary allocations under ten demands for grants. It also required all departments to present gender budget statements. Within three consecutive years, the gender budgeting statement increased to include more than thirty-three demands for grants in 2008-09, contributed by twenty-seven ministries/departments and five Union Territories. The number of ministries/departments with Gender Budgeting Cells (GBC) increased to fifty-four. The Statement on Gender Budgeting has also dichotomized the gender sensitive allocations into specifically targeted programmes for women and mainstream public expenditure with pro- women allocations (****). The early success story of gender budgeting in India inspired other nations in the region to conduct gender budgeting within the MoF. A gender budgeting study was carried out in Sri Lanka with special reference to non-interest expenditures in 2003, which has been translated into the vernacular language by the Government of Sri Lanka and disseminated across governmental agencies (Chakraborty 2003). Subsequent to this study, in the budgetary policies of 2004, there are two specific announcements related to gender. One was that Ministry of Women's Affairs has prepared a set of guidelines on allocation and disbursement of funds to women under various sector development projects. The other related to ministries allocating ten percent of expenditure in their budgets towards programmes for improving the status of women (http:// www.eureka.lk/fpea/pdf/2004/English/Budget%20Speech%20-%20Parts%20I-III%20-%20Final.pdf - Budget Speech 2004, Part II, page 15, Ministry of Finance, Government of Sri Lanka). These are just examples of a good beginning. The challenges ahead are multifold, especially with the advent of fiscal decentralisation. Fiscally decentralised gender budgeting initiatives within governments are rare across the globe. One successful initia- tive to institutionalise gender budgeting was in Kerala.in 2008. The state budget in Kerala -, one of the states in India -, where the human development indicators are good compared to the low level of per capita income of the state, which is widely referred to as the \u2018Kerala Model\u2019 of development in development economic literature. Against the backdrop of budgetary announcements in 2006 to initiate gender budgeting in the state, a report was prepared by an academic institution in the region and submitted to the Finance Minister on February 2008 (Chakraborty, Lekha 2008). This CDS Report not only attempts an ex-post gender analysis of the Kerala State Budget 2007-08, but also provides a roadmap for institutionalizing gender budgeting within the Department of Finance, Government of Kerala, thereby introducing a Statement on Gender Budgeting in the budget documents. Subsequent to the recommendations in the report, a signifi- cant move in this direction has begun in Kerala, with the announcement by the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech 2008 that from next year onwards a special Statement on Gender would be submitted to the legislature along with the budget as is done at the central government,level along with other policy announcements for institutional mechanisms. However, the initiatives in terms of the Women Component Plan (10 percent of total State Plan Outlay) began in Kerala in the early nineties at the third tier. Despite the growing recognition of fiscal decentralisation in gender development and its growing prevalence in public policy making, there have been relatively few attempts to empirically analyse these initiatives of fiscally decentralised gender budgeting. The few related attempts one could find were a series of studies done in NIPFP in coordination with UNIFEM-EU initiative on local level gender budgeting (*****), in Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines, South Africa and in India which involved a series of studies done in NIPFP in co-ordination with UNIFEM-EU initiative on local level gender budgeting (*****).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e6df478-7643-4532-8c9b-498aa0935258": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e6df478-7643-4532-8c9b-498aa0935258", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59356047c6401c09f1dd57c7c1e5d28289f780ad298404a39edc702b65b3d279"}, "2": {"node_id": "2577802e-64fa-469a-9706-22fde4eff22f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24791a92378c18bd654a765db848d98f75a16ee0021da107b3e83bdb720769e6"}}, "hash": "2aa4e3b8e4356771e5eb3c5221692b42179b641044555115b278de8f1a08c6bd", "text": "The overall message that comes through from these studies is that if gender concerns are to be attended to effectively through the budget process, there must be decentralization in its true form i.e., with adequate powers and functions for the local bodies and with adequate representations of women in running them.

Sara Ahmed wrote: Facilitator's note: Sara Ahmed describes the strategies and challenges facing the Gender and Water Alliance in working globally towards the goal of gender mainstreaming. She explores their next steps, focusing on awareness-building and, what is needed to improve the limited progress made thus far. Dear Network Members, How do Networks Mainstream Gender? Learning from the Experience of the Gender and Water Alliance I would like to share with you my thoughts on gender mainstreaming and the challenge for water policy and practice. Created at the Second World Water Forum (The Hague 2000), the Gender and Water Alliance (GWA) is a global network that aims to promote women's and men's equitable access to and management of safe and adequate water for domestic supply, sanitation, food security and environmental sustainability (www.genderandwater.org). Today the GWA has more than 1000 members from 104 countries, including organisations and individuals from NGOs, donor agencies, govern- ment water bureaucracies and grassroots groups. It is coordinated by a small secretariat based in the Netherlands, gov- erned by an elected, regionally representative steering committee and funded by a range of donors as well as through partnerships with strategic actors in different regions. Gender mainstreaming is a strategic objective for the GWA and it works towards this goal through communication and networking, capacity building, knowledge dissemination and informed policy advocacy. However, despite the growing body of evidence on the benefits of mainstreaming gender in water policy and practice (efficiency, effectiveness, equity, sustainability) and various international commitments on facilitating women\u2019s participation in decision-making on wa- ter governance, progress has been limited. Why? I believe that change happens from both from the bottom-up and the top-down approaches. Therefore while we need institutional space to facilitate the articulation of voice by marginalised women and men (for example, through quotas for women in local government and village water committees), capacity building on gender as a concept and operation- alising gender analysis skills are equally important. For the past three years, I have been involved in GWA\u2019s capacity building initiatives in South Asia, both in Training of Trainers (ToTs) and in workshops on gender perspectives and skill building with other regional partners (NGOs, research/teaching institutes).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b187332c-2164-4dbb-bf6b-0eedd880e48c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b187332c-2164-4dbb-bf6b-0eedd880e48c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7db77de170deef28c2e106b514576d1e9b9837dfce730ecad70d7e7f006743c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b6bbebc-7cb4-4c67-862f-ec3e9f478a57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8a4b437a4ed0a8f978590e995087bd9164947bd7a6ea63bee33f6b7dfaeb3ae"}}, "hash": "b21d263992e06fcb998314b09539c9dc3bd1d5ec5072cc75f74e34349ff5873e", "text": "Certainly, the feedback has been tremendous and encouraging, but it has been very difficult for us to monitor the translation of learning into practice.

In January 2007, as part of its regionalisation strategy, the GWA held its first South Asia strategic planning workshop in Kathmandu to build a collective vision and action plan for strategizing gender mainstreaming in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) in the regions. Here we discussed the development of a cascading gender sensitisation strategy with need-based training at different levels: from the grassroots to the meso-level of NGOs and other social change catalysts to macro-policy. However, implementing such a strategy across different organisational interests or diverse socio-economic contexts requires strong leadership by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df371c5d-1d0c-47f9-ae6d-1805d0fee9f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "df371c5d-1d0c-47f9-ae6d-1805d0fee9f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3444bdbd0c83b1db540e87dd215a5cd78c083d8c90abcfc5cb94dbcb6850e65a"}}, "hash": "3444bdbd0c83b1db540e87dd215a5cd78c083d8c90abcfc5cb94dbcb6850e65a", "text": "GWA members and \u2018ownership\u2019 for network priorities. Unfortunately, we have a dearth of good trainers or facilitators who are well-versed with both gender concepts, frame- Asia Pacific Human Development Network 94 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming works and tools as well as have a sound knowledge of the water sector in the region. Those of us, who are involved in designing programmes and course content on gender and water, do not have the time, energy or indeed resources to follow-up with those we train despite numerous promises to visit their organisations, help, etc. Yet some amount of hand-holding is important for our trainees to take the next step and make change happen. Participants who attended an international ToT on gender mainstreaming in water and sanitation which we conducted with Utthan, an NGO based in Gujarat, India (April 2007), are beginning to take those first steps. Members in Bangladesh are translating and contextu- alising our Resource Guide on Gender Mainstreaming in IWRM in Bangla \u2013 one of the most widely spoken languages in the sub-Continent. A similar strategic planning workshop for South East Asia and the Pacific was held in July 2007 at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Bangkok with the support of the Gender and Development Studies department. Subsequently, we have signed an MoU with AIT for collaboration on institutionalising gender mainstreaming in teaching curricula, knowledge development and dissemination as well as work with our members and partners in the region on strategic gender issues in the water sector. However, at the moment, for want of funds, both the Action Plans for South and SE Asia are moving on a priority project basis \u2013 like the translation of our resource guides into regional languages and the development of a data base on gender and water resources. With AIT we are planning a two weeks Gender and Water Summer Institute (early June 2009) for mid-level professionals, women and men, to understand gender concepts and develop analytical skills for operationalising gender mainstreaming in their work and workplaces. We have also just signed a Cooperative Agreement with UN-HABITAT to work with their partners in South and South- East Asia to engender the Water for Asian Cities programme. The country-level workshops that we are planning for Lao PDR, Viet Nam , Cambodia and Nepal will enable participants to critically examine challenges to gender mainstream- ing in their organisations and programme environment. Participants will attend two rounds of national workshops, in-between which they will have time to implement learning and best practices around gender mainstreaming in urban water and sanitation \u2013 and share the results of the same with their co-participants. At a meeting with GWA members in Bangladesh (January 2008), many NGO leaders (elderly men) thought that the GWA had the organisational structure of a national mission, namely that we could send out spearhead teams to each and every village to educate women and men on the importance of gender mainstreaming both for gender equality and gender rights and to ensure gender-just and equitable community water alternatives. This is the kind of demand that we are facing for capacity building on gender (and water) issues throughout the region and unless we start with individuals questioning their own attitudes, values and cultural norms we cannot even begin to challenge our hierarchically embed- ded, male dominated water bureaucracies. The director of a fairly successful demand-responsive water management programme in the state of Gujarat, western India, told me that while women\u2019s participation in village water committees had been integral to the effectiveness of their interventions, regrettably his staff (the water board) had not had any gender-awareness training. So the gains we are beginning to see at the micro-level through the articulation of voice by strong women leaders on many fronts are not be- ing translated into significant policy or structural changes. Women are still being seen as \u2018victims\u2019 of water scarcity and while they are being acknowledged as social actors, this is largely in their role as \u2018naturally privileged\u2019 environmental carers, extending unpaid household work to the community arena. Moreover, sector reform policies are ignoring the real concerns that women and men have with user fees for unreliable water services or the fact that many poor families and indeed villages are getting excluded from water coverage data. While we have some very fine individual bureaucrats and water engineers, they remain individuals who may be shifted to their next posting before we can start working with them on substantive change.

With best regards, Sara Ahmed Chair, Gender and Water Alliance E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 95 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt wrote: Facilitator's note: Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt explores different views of the effectiveness and the meaning of mainstreaming. As a key strategy to transform gender inequality, mainstreaming implies a focus change away from positive discrimina- tion towards systems and structures that necessitated this. Yet, its malleability in thought (e.g. means or end), and in practice, where the extent of institutionalisation is locally influenced by the preferred view of gender relations, means much work remains on women's inclusion in decision-making. Dear Network Members, On Gender Mainstreaming Building on the contribution from Dr. Sara Ahmed, I would like to highlight the different views expressed on gender mainstreaming in this note. Gender mainstreaming is a new and dynamic process and the concept is highly contested in the development field. Mainstreaming gender within institutions and policy can be complicated because understanding about what it involves or looks like in practice is mixed. There has been a proliferation of definitions of gender mainstreaming and an even greater abundance of methods and interpretations on how it is best achieved. That mainstreaming gender equality can be completed as a development goal at all is contested. As a consequence of the rapid rise in the prominence of gender mainstreaming and the subsequent controversy that has accompanied its growth, few people feel confident in assessing what it really means. Another common problem is that while much is said about gender mainstreaming the growing body of literature on the subject remains fragmented. Here is a brief glimpse of the debates. Gender has become something of a popular \u2018add-on\u2019 to discussions ranging from governance to reproductive health. Issues relating to gender have been brought to the fore of development practice. Gender analysts and feminist researchers have also contributed in a large part to the way women\u2019s empowerment and gender mainstreaming have risen to prominence in corporate and international development contexts. Academics and practitioners such as Kate Grosser (2005a, 2005b), Cecile Jackson (1998, 2006), Caroline Moser (1989), R. Tiessen (2007), Shahra Razavi and Miller (1995) and Silvia Walby (2005a, 2005b) have provided a vital and ongoing critique of gender mainstreaming and how it is manifest in the activity of governments, multilateral agencies and NGOs. This diversity has benefited the development of the gender mainstreaming movement but as a consequence there have been a number of interpretations of gender mainstreaming that have been popularised. Gender mainstreaming is considered by many authors to be the institutionalisation of equality. This is achieved by \u201cembedding gender-sensitive practices and norms in the structures, processes and environment of public policy\u201d (Daly 2005: 435). This is to reduce gender mainstreaming to its most fundamental form. Academics and feminist authors continue to contend the semantics and specifics of gender mainstreaming and the connotative meaning of \u2018gender mainstreaming\u2019 as a functional term. Such debate by \u201ctheorists and change agents\u201d is beneficial in developing the relationship between theoretical concepts and the practical setting in which they operate (Eveline and Bacchi 2005). The way in which ideas, such as \u2018gendering-awareness mainstreaming\u2019 espoused by Eveline and Bacchi, are developed and rationalised will continue to shape the form of mainstreaming in reality. There is then a degree of importance on how such etymological development in the literature is crystallised in an organisation\u2019s corporate body. How principles of gender equality are realised is guided by an organisation\u2019s interpretation of gender relations. Locally dominant gender ideology then, shapes the degree by which gender-sensitive practices are institutionalised. Gender mainstreaming is also sometimes perceived as an end, rather than the means, of achieving gender equality. The European Union, in rapid response to the 1995 Beijing Declaration, quickly established gender mainstreaming as the basis of its actual gender policy. From this reactive position, the EU has subsequently been deepening and become more wide- ranging in its approach to gender equality. This is an example of how gender mainstreaming itself, despite its newness, is an adaptable concept capable of being modelled.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92de6fdd-e2e0-49e1-8d10-9825644f9e39": {"__data__": {"id_": "92de6fdd-e2e0-49e1-8d10-9825644f9e39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "234fa615544de346452a84c4d2b0bb082b44e977e99b0792116c6a72071195b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8c82454-5702-47c5-91da-5a326b7b3b0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a32950a0db24619f9f317ddc16bfb143ddfa3c46f93cc1f9bf331a0149958b5"}}, "hash": "bf82397dc0d2c336e28bfa2388298d03e707241998dd388d574713b6044dcb8f", "text": "The flexibility of its construction enabled the shift in its focus from being the origin of a gender policy to being, within the same organisation, a dynamic starting point in policy formation.

This stance is critically evaluated as being very transparent, but less sustainable and more remedial in focus. In the absence of more progressive objectives, or where no such gender framework exists, gender mainstreaming itself can be a significant achievement. Alternatively, gender mainstreaming can be seen as an organisational strategy to be applied internally, a means of bringing a gender perspective to all aspects of an institution\u2019s policy and activities, through building gender capacity and accountability (Reeves and Baden 2000, Walby 2005a). This view is especially supported by organisations that are particularly driven to be perceived as gender sensitive. For instance, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) - produced toolkit, Gender Mainstreaming in Practice (published online in 2007), defines gender as the integration of Asia Pacific Human Development Network 96 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming a gender perspective and analysis into all stages of design, implementation, and evaluation of projects, policies, and programmes. This focus suggests that when gender is mainstreamed within the corporate structure itself, principles of gender equality are instilled in the products and outputs of that structure. This approach to gender mainstreaming is favoured by development agencies and donors alike and their definitions of gender mainstreaming follow accordingly. According to Walby (2005a: 467): Gender mainstreaming has involved new forms of political practice and alliances. In particular, it involves elected women in parliament, the development of specialised gender machinery in government, as well as gender expertise in civil society from universities to grassroots organisations. Expertise is a form of power, often neglected in conventional analysis, which is increasingly deployed by those representing gendered interests in and against the state. Practitioners report the importance of building the appropriate expert capacity in order to implement gender mainstreaming. In summary, gender mainstreaming has been popularised as a key strategy for overcoming gender inequality, and the confusion over women\u2019s exclusion and the monopolisation of decision-making in development by men is yet to be fully sorted out. Rather than question the decision-making process itself, the proposed solution is for \u201csimilar numbers of women to join the decision-making \u2018mainstream\u2019 with men\u201d (Corner 1996: 1). While this can be interpreted as a call for political reform focused directly upon women (the WID approach), through mainstreaming women\u2019s concerns, for example through gender training of men, women\u2019s needs and interests may be upheld (the recent GAD outlook). In one sense, we have arrived at gender mainstreaming because it is not supposed any to be exclusively about women any longer. Rather, mainstreaming is concerned with how policies are assessed for their impact on women and men. Mainstreaming shifts attention from individuals and rights (equality and equity) and from groups and their special needs and disadvantages (positive action), and focuses instead upon the systems and structures that give rise to those needs and disadvantages in the first place (Rees 2002). The frequency of change in gender perspectives historically suggests that we are yet to reach a final verdict on this subject. However gender mainstreaming is firmly embedded within GAD and has become uniformly recognised as a mandatory element of strategic global objectives such as the third Millennium Development Goal on women\u2019s equality and empowerment, and local development settings alike. There has long been an absence of a suitable vector for establishing gender sensitive practices in development settings and with the rise in prominence of gender mainstreaming as a concept, the framework, its strategies and methodological tools, may represent the catalyst required for sustainable and significant progress toward gender equality.

The full spectrum of duty-bearers must grasp responsibility and comprehend that the real aim is to uproot discriminatory social attitudes and end violence against women. This will only happen when gender equality strategies and tactics are inculcated into all levels of policies and programmes from the very beginning and at every stage. Dear Network Members, Gender Mainstreaming: Some Key Issues Popular thinking among many policy makers and, public officials in various sectors, is that gender concerns are the responsibility of the Women\u2019s Ministry or national machinery established for women\u2019s concerns. This popular miscon- ception in the society is the main obstacle to gender mainstreaming. Gender is viewed as \u2018for women and on women\u2019. Therefore it is important to eliminate misinterpretations related to gender mainstreaming in the society. Gender mainstreaming is vital to promote equality and equity in the society. Gender mainstreaming needs to be in- corporated, into policies and programmes of the government from the very beginning and at every stage. It should be integrated from national to grass root level programmes in order to make a difference to the lives of women and men in the society. Gender mainstreaming programmes should be very tactical and innovative to penetrate deep- seated discriminatory attitudes in the society. A legal-aid association in Sri Lanka broadcasted an impressive message on the urgency of breaking the silence and reporting incidences of domestic violence. It is broadcast over the television during peak hours, and employs popular cricketers and actors to deliver the message. That message, which goes to many living rooms, influences viewers to understand that violence is a gender issue that affects the well being of every member in the family. Gender mainstreaming will be a powerful mechanism if used tactfully to control the gender discriminatory elements in the society.

Dear Network Members, From Policy to Practice: Achievements and Challenges in Mainstreaming Gender in Viet Nam On behalf of the United Nations Gender Programme Coordination Group in Viet Nam , I would like to share with you some of the experiences of mainstreaming gender in Viet Nam . Viet Nam has made significant progress on the road to gender mainstreaming over the past two decades. A number of legal mandates have ensured that gender mainstreaming is, in theory if not in practice, a part of the legislative process. However, certain barriers, however, preclude an effective and comprehensive system of gender mainstreaming across all policy sectors. These challenges include: \ufffd A lack of understanding of the goals and principles of gender mainstreaming amongst key policy makers. \ufffd A lack of co-ordination, monitoring and implementation. \ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49652f6c-01cf-46a2-ae97-fa2e830fcc16": {"__data__": {"id_": "49652f6c-01cf-46a2-ae97-fa2e830fcc16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3cdef98c029325f6dfbb55d1141b4bcdb5e45584a88b95153314fe57378be50"}, "3": {"node_id": "521954d0-9b02-4485-bb1a-08697e940204", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac0c85edf5abeaf9b204e0e14b1f58d34435f270d4533bb96eec32788f9a8483"}}, "hash": "1d79cead1fd945caf96e600302eb38b325691d704f3eb3a94a3d8e357d563d64", "text": "A lack of institutional and individual capacity. The policy and legal framework of Viet Nam has provided a clear mandate for gender equality. The country acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1980. The 1992 Consti- tution of Viet Nam stipulates clearly that all citizens are equal before the law (Article 52). Further positive developments came in the form of the Prime Minister\u2019s 1999 announcement that gender issues had to be incorporated in the national economic development plan and overall socio-economic development plan for the period from 2001-2010; the Communist Party\u2019s Resolution 11 on work for women (2007), and the Law on Gender Equality in 2006. However, implementation of such policies and legislation has however proved challenging. A recent United Nations/ World Bank report found that existing legislation and initiatives were not properly implemented and lacked an effective accountability structure (Kabeer et al. 2005). Similarly, in considering Viet Nam\u2019s Fifth and Sixth periodic reports (in 2007), the CEDAW committee regretted \u201cthat the State Party did not provide sufficient information or data on the actual impact of these laws and measures and the extent to which they have resulted in accelerating the advancement of women and girls\u2026\u201d (UN 2007). A further concern was expressed with respect to the process by which gender mainstreaming was to be delegated to agencies, and the specific obligations placed on the different agencies to collaborate in this pro- cess (UNIFEM 2009). Previously, the National Council for the Advancement of Women (NCFAW) played a central role in promoting gender equality across government. Charged with co-ordination functions, NCFAW was highly visible, ensuring gender issues were considered in policy making processes. Following a period of uncertainty about the specific arrangements for the national women\u2019s machinery, a Department of Gender Equality was established in 2008 within the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) (*).This department now has responsibility as a state managing agency for the implementation of the Gender Equality Law. In promoting gender mainstreaming, one of the principal challenges has been the lack of capacity by individuals and government institutions to undertake gender mainstreaming. There is a clear need to further develop capacity across a broader range of policy actors in Viet Nam. Gender sensitive thinking has not been adopted as a strategy amongst main- stream institutions, in part because there has been a reliance on the National Women\u2019s Machinery (NWM) to provide this expertise and use it in influencing policies and programmes. Both men and women in line ministries have expected this machinery to monitor all programmes despite its limited resources and authority. This has resulted in a lack of identifiable champions on gender issues. Whilst a number of gender mainstreaming train- ings have been delivered to increase capacity, such training has tended to be offered only once, to a few selected staff. A 2005 assessment of the previous NWM, NCFAW, found that staff were either inexperienced or uncommitted. This points to a lack of adequate, comprehensive training in gender analysis and gender mainstreaming techniques, not only for those who are to apply them, but for those with whom these \u2018specialists\u2019 are to work (e.g. in line ministries). E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 99 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming What is needed to ensure that gender mainstreaming has optimum success in Viet Nam now that the Gender Equality Law has been passed, is for key staff and institutions to develop a clear road map to implement and measure the progress of gender equality. The up-coming United Nations-Government Joint Programme on Gender Equality will address this need, focusing on support for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Gender Equality Law and Domestic Violence Law. Until there is adequate capacity, gender mainstreaming will remain as rhetoric.

Noting there is no singular view on this in the broader international community, let alone among proponents of cultural relativism, Taimur questions whether basic freedoms, expressed in outcomes such as school en- rolment or leadership representation, are actually achievable through the diffused approach of gender mainstreaming. An additional question is who do they represent? Do they represent those who are working to institutionalise gender equality? Where is the consensus and where is equality of representation in the group of transmitters? Dear Network Members, Gender Mainstreaming: Some Questions of Definition Having spent just over five years at UNDP I speak with limited experience on the topic. I just have a few observations to make. I still am unclear on what gender mainstreaming means and what it wishes to accomplish. The facilitator, Jim Chalmers writes: Gender equality is the goal of gender mainstreaming. Mainstreaming requires the integration of gender equality con- cerns into every aspect of the development process, including the functioning of institutions of governance and develop- ment agencies. Gender equality in and of itself is an unclear concept. The \u2018benchmarks\u2019 of gender equality may differ from one com- munity to the next, and from one country to another. If we accept the relativist position, then our work should reflect that aspect. If there is some absolutist concept of gender equality that we ought to strive for then the underpinnings of gender equality should be articulated. Presently, it is not clear where the international community stands on this. There is of course room for more than one definition of the concept, but this should then be acknowledged and projected as such. The facilitator points out that \u2018mainstreaming requires the integration of gender equality concerns into every aspect of the development process\u2019. What are the gender equality concerns? If the above problem of definition is resolved, per- haps we can move towards giving some semblance to the specific concerns. Presently the notions floating around have to do with equality of opportunity between genders, the results of which are outcome based, such as equal representation of males and females in parliament, equality in terms of enrolment and educational attainment rates, equality in terms of basic freedoms. These are laudable outcomes that require a more focused approach rather than one of \u2018mainstreaming\u2019. I say this, as the outcomes mentioned are very specific to either a sector and/or a theme. Mainstreaming as defined above tends to dilute the nature of the message rather than strengthen it. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 100 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming Finally, I think it matters who is (are) the carrier(s) of the message of gender equality - is it the people themselves or the parliamentarians who represent the people, or only development practitioners? It could very well be all of the above: the broader the stakeholder and political base the greater the likelihood of gaining consensus. The composition also matters. It is important that there be equal representation in a cause that, at its very heart, rep- resents equality between genders. The irony is stark as \u2018gender teams\u2019 are often comprise composed only of women and are hence fundamentally unequal. Broad and diverse support is needed at every level to accomplish outcomes that champion diversity and equality at the same time.

Dear Network Members, Equality in the Pursuit of Meaningfulness I provide a brief clarification of what gender equality means when stated as the end goal of mainstreaming gender. The human development and capabilities approach enables a view that all human beings are born with the capability of practical wisdom (Aristotle). Among other things, this encompasses the vital importance of equal rights of all humans as a basis of freedom, justice and peace in the world (UDHR). This is not to ignore that what could be socially just in one context might be unjust in another (Aristotle). Rather, it is a universalism based on the conviction that reason and imagining are universal and that all persons have similar access to the same capability of being-in-the-world -: and this constitutes the possibility for global conversations. While such claims are expressed by means of cultural specificity, the process itself does not rely on local variables. Further, this kind of universalism involves the notion there is some shared human essence that has different definitions but commonly refers to striving for meaningfulness as a basis for cultural expression (Sahlins 1976).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c8f19a4-5241-4fc2-93aa-77f3fa33739b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c8f19a4-5241-4fc2-93aa-77f3fa33739b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f61fff67b6ddfe58d6bd4d41beca674486feb1438d63437f3c57400f778c2921"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e05e93b-f1e9-4407-ab2d-724aec0d8155", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68446a2f0625376e62c2ca347c7588d0fe33dd04c5993055bbb800af9cba8aae"}}, "hash": "fc07e270366fcc24e0569b41e9e84573ab00fbb91192489fef643c99783c4f98", "text": "An often-heard objection by proponents of anti-universalism is that such notions of human essence misrepresent what they consider culture to be \u2026.. as if it were monolithic and ageless; but to propose that they are discrete this is a particularly harmful political myth, to propose that they are discrete. Local cultures all cross-fertilise, as Isaiah Berlin understood. Yet, humans are neither defined by just innate capacities nor by actual behaviours, but rather by the vital connection between them (Geertz 1973). Human beings are \u201csymbolizing, conceptualizing, meaning-seeking animals\u201d. And Martha Nussbaum, a central figure in the human development and capabilities project, provides the link between them with her ten \u201cCentral Human Functional Capabilities\u201d. To list just some of these, they include being able to make use of senses, education, and expression; being able to have attachments to things and persons outside ourselves; being able to form a conception of the good and reflect critically about organising one\u2019s life; having social grounds for dignity and self respect, and ability to live in some connection with others; being able to live with concern for and through the natural world; being able to laugh, play, and enjoy restorative activities; make choices that govern one\u2019s own environment and material choices with being able to hold property, having right to seek equal employment, and exercising meaningful relationships (Nussbaum 1999: 41). The social goal is the capability of all humans to carry out significant functions. It has essential universal applicability for human beings, to apply their potential capabilities to live a meaningful life not oppressed by traditions that sustain injustice. Not a prescriptive code of practice but a tool that could be engaged by males and females toward equality.

Ranjani Murthy wrote: Facilitator's note: Ranjani Murthy notes the term 'mainstreaming' implies unwanted ties with neoclassical economics. She discusses cases that effectively \u2018institutionalise gender\u2019 beyond a single sector: UNICEF Nepal\u2019s approach pitched at three levels (community, district and national); ARROW\u2019s intra-regional approach that gets policy-makers to meet the evidence head on; and UNIFEM's gender budgeting that encompasses tracking whether the money follows policies. Dear Network Members, Strategies for Institutionalising Gender I prefer the term 'institutionalising gender' to 'gender mainstreaming', as in the case of the latter phrase it appears that the mainstream is fine, and what needs to be done is add gender into it. The mainstream emphasis on unfettered market driven economic growth is part of the process of marginalising women (Murthy and Kappen 2007). One effective strategy of moving beyond sectoral gender institutionalisation is what I have seen UNICEF in Nepal do, which is 'Decentralised Action for Children and Women' (DACW) at the district level and below, supported by sectoral gender policy advocacy at national level. Under this DACW umbrella, women's rights are addressed at an inter- sectoral level through building a cadre of para- women legal committees from village to district level (which addresses gender based violence and violations of girls and boys rights), community monitoring groups (comprised of women and men) which monitor gender inequalities in health, education, nutrition and ensure marriage registration and take corrective actions, and engendering district budgets and policies (Murthy and Sachdeva 2007). While one may not like to adopt the term women 'and children', the approach itself is rather interesting. A partially effective strategy for institutionalising gender at the national policy level is ARROW's approach of holding regional policy dialogues on MDGs and sexual and reproductive health and rights, calling policy makers from different South Asian countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e05e93b-f1e9-4407-ab2d-724aec0d8155": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e05e93b-f1e9-4407-ab2d-724aec0d8155", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f61fff67b6ddfe58d6bd4d41beca674486feb1438d63437f3c57400f778c2921"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c8f19a4-5241-4fc2-93aa-77f3fa33739b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc07e270366fcc24e0569b41e9e84573ab00fbb91192489fef643c99783c4f98"}}, "hash": "68446a2f0625376e62c2ca347c7588d0fe33dd04c5993055bbb800af9cba8aae", "text": "The policy makers from the countries, which are not doing that well, feel pressured to report bet- ter progress in the next meeting. This is an indirect form of the public praise and public shaming approach to institution- alising gender (ARROW 2006).

Dear Network Members, Gender Mainstreaming and Mind-set Changes: Need for Societal Buy-in Gender mainstreaming requires a holistic and pragmatic working definition. The definition needs to differentiate public policy perspective from cultural and religious perspectives. As acknowledged, the public policy perspective is very much within the control of national governments -, of course with the support of the masses. But, practices that in- volve cultural and religious elements pose great difficulties for national governments or even societies to manage. or streamline development. The issues become more complex in multi-ethnic or multi-religious environments like in Ma- laysia. I believe, it will be even more complex and complicated involving regional or global countries. For example, since the days of colonial rule Malaysia has been registering a steady progress in the provision of equal access to education and health by eliminating gender discriminating policies. Even in rural areas, children have ad- equate access to good education and health unless the family forbids or prevents the female due to cultural reasons. For example, of 1,486 enrolled in rural Tamil schools in 1950, 50.3 percent were females. This proportion increased to 70.4 percent in 1965 (Intisari 1970) and now enrolment reflects the sex ratio at the national level for all ethnic groups. Similar, success stories were registered amongst the Malay population especially after 1970, with the induction of the New Economic Policy, that was explicitly implemented to upgrade the levels of living of poor Malays who were once engaged in predominantly low paying agricultural jobs in the rural areas. This success was mainly attributed to \"buy-in\" from all members of societies, especially the parents, irrespective of race or religion or creed. Everybody wanted their children to receive a good education, a good job and live healthily. But, such a \"buy-in\" is hard to come by in other areas of societal living. Despite high levels of education attainment, practices such as caste system, arranged marriages and dowry are still highly prevalent among the Malaysian Indian community. Practices of gender discrimination in property, land and heritage distribution favouring male siblings, rela- tively lower participation of women in the labour force, religiously and culturally allowed multiple marriages practiced by some men, male chauvinistic approach in job and promotion placement at work places, poor representation of women in decision making processes and public offices inherently exist, even in relatively advanced and educated societies like in Malaysia.

Dear Network Members, Robeyn's Survey of Capability Approach Following on from James Chalmers\u2019 note about capability approach and gender equality, I offer this note to assist the readers to delve deeper into this interdisciplinary approach, literature on which seems to be widely scattered. Whilst some economists have discussed issues around operationalising and the applications of capability approach which are difficult for me to explain here, Ingrid Robeyns in her various works (2006; 2005; 2003) provides a well-rounded theoretical survey of the field from a sociological perspective. She has also clearly brought out the differences between Amartya Sen\u2019s and Martha Nussbaum\u2019s work on capabilities. In the space of this short note, I will try to summarise her perspectives and encourage the reader to explore the literature on this subject. Capability approach as developed by Sen, and later Sen and Nussbaum, Nussbaum places emphasis on the individual\u2019s real freedom to choose something he or she considers as worthwhile or that provides a substantial basis for the recognition and valuation of all the domestic and informal work. This reflects a well-accepted trend in western welfare towards a reworking of the relationship between social provision and employment, as the policy-makers try to shift the emphasis from rights to responsibilities, and from \u2018passive\u2019 to \u2018active\u2019 welfare (in which those taking advantage of the welfare system are \u2018encouraged\u2019 into work, i.e. that is paid work).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9e97eb3-9f33-46ad-a3d4-059794d3f5e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9e97eb3-9f33-46ad-a3d4-059794d3f5e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20808e13face3bd2cf8ce50925b6eb1831077b1fc7bd62d485311c81777bef34"}, "2": {"node_id": "2532ff7d-bf7d-47ce-852f-654ebbb4d365", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "228f6c810efecfde3d21b3d1133099655012cb97e2212aa8e552cebb9747d617"}}, "hash": "bbe945748d6e7665d0d8d3854fe3c8a80ad11a50433de8aa735d00cfc1303ae2", "text": "that is paid work). Robeyns brought out the main differences between Sen and Nussbaum\u2019s approaches \u2013 Sen\u2019s approach lies closer to economic theory while Nussbaum pays more attention to people\u2019s skills and personality traits,.Nussbaum\u2019s mentions three capabilities (basic, internal and combined), and offers a concrete list of ten capabilities (life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses, imagination and thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play and control over one\u2019s environment), Nussbaum views capabilities as providing citizens with a justification and argument for constitutional principles that citizens have a right to demand from their government, and her rejection of agency-well-being dichotomy. Some feminists \u2013 particularly the post-modernists - have critiqued the capability approach for its assumed view of the state as a benign entity and the approach as being entrenched in the structuralist paradigm. This is because the capability approach argues that the design of social policies and institutions, and the evaluation of well-being, inequality, poverty and justice should focus primarily on people\u2019s capabilities to function.

Anushree Sinha wrote: Facilitator's note: This is a contribution on gender mainstreaming that we have just received (after the closure of the dis- cussion on this theme). Dr. (Ms.) Anushree Sinha raises the problem of shortcomings in macro forecasting. This hinders addressing strategic priorities. It also reduces the scope of potential policy outcomes, e.g. forecasting how economic shocks alter choice sets differently for women and men. Dr. Sinha calls for a quantitative framework that formulates differential gender aware indicators and behaviour functions. For instance, she notes countries - including India - are undertaking time use surveys, invaluable in informing on gender distinctions in areas of unpaid and paid work, health, income support, education and training and such data should be linked with national accounting to help formulate policy focused macro models. Dear Network Members, Gender Integration in Macro Analysis for Better Policy There is an urgent need to integrate the gender differences into policy advice, design and implementation, in line with the objective of gender equality and poverty alleviation. Understanding \u201cwhere women are\u201d would make it possible to make gender sensitive policies. Economy wide models are critical to assess the impact of economic shocks that rever- berate across sectors and, in some cases, regions of a country or even the world. They are capable of producing disag- gregated results at the microeconomic level, while providing a consistency check on macroeconomic accounts. Such models, when made gender focussed, help in understanding \u201cwhere women are\u201d as linkages of women\u2019s contri- butions to the economy needs to be spelled out in such models. This indicates the major need for having macro data disaggregated by sex, and other data such as household data distinguished by gender. Apart from information on market related data, the need for information on women\u2019s contributions through Non-Market-Work (NMW) (Harrington 1999) becomes obvious when a structured framework is used. Various studies have shown that a large percentage of women are involved in NMW. Such work has not been included in national accounting and the value-added generation cycles and thus makes such work of women invisible. When governments design policies, there is no information on how a policy can impact women who are mainly involved with such work. Hence, scarce resources cannot be allocated for improving the welfare of non-market workers. Policy changes such as trade policy reforms through reduction of tariff, technology transfer, foreign capital inflows for capital intensive production, introduction of export incentives and creation of export promotion zones, etc., will affect women and men differentially. One reason for this is the nature of participation in work. Moreover, women and men respond differently to economic and trade policies because they have different sets of private resources and levels of access to public ones. Meanwhile, the social and human development impact of reforms and globalisation must look at how choice sets have been altered and how alterations have affected women and men. Another important area of study while examining the impact of reforms and globalisation on women is the study of household behaviour. Households operate in an environment structured by economic incentives and institutional con- structs. Greater competition and a need to reduce production cost generally lead to \u2018informalisation\u2019 (Portes et al. 1989; Sinha et al. 2003; Sinha and Munjal 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f5c0b5d-e1f2-44aa-9b24-3d52b397d0fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f5c0b5d-e1f2-44aa-9b24-3d52b397d0fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebd88ba183b72826afb570245ba1c001f30f7550c0e6999ee786114f85f47e73"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a68175e-e998-4b2a-80a0-c08a7111994d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a99f8538c5dc440fb43c55090a9e00e09ddaecd4f70d32ef9b330b47b08f2fd"}}, "hash": "da5bf120fe79379dccac1c693a05674f9f8fc0d116fe9e7cc72d809f5a44b09c", "text": "1989; Sinha et al. 2003; Sinha and Munjal 2006).

This applies particularly to infrastructural investment, which encourages rather than crowds out investment by the private sector and which increases the likelihood that the price incentives provided by liberalisation will lead to faster growth. Development expenditure on rural infrastructure may be particularly beneficial to women by increasing the supply response and reducing transport and storage costs. Raising living standards of rural households in the immediate future will reduce the damage to the future human and physical capital that results from pressure on livelihoods when people, and in particular women, live in poor conditions. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 105 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming Good quality data is especially important for this process to have integrity. Currently, many countries, including India, have carried out (or are in the process of carrying out) time use surveys. Data from time use surveys is especially sig- nificant for gender analysis as well as for a better quality of policy advice across all sectors of the government. Such data would enable strategic priorities to be addressed better and will improve the accuracy of the forecasting and scope of potential policy outcomes. The main policy issues which time use data would inform and where gender distinctions could be made are unpaid work, paid employment, health, income support, education and training. Policymakers are interested in studying the impact of particular policy measures, like changes in income tax on the welfare of people below the poverty line and other socio-economic categories of households. It is possible to study the impact of policies that are targeted and are not likely to have major indirect impact on the other variables in an economy. Economy-wide analysis is essential when the indirect impact of policy changes are wide and other groups and other markets are affected as a result of a trade or financial policy. Such a model should distinguish between men and women in its variables and behavioural relationships (Duchin and Sinha 1999). The Fontana and Wood model (2000) allows for capturing the interactions between productive and \u2018reproduction\u2019 sectors of the economy. Female wage rates rise when the leisure and \u2018reproduction\u2019 sectors are omitted. In a gender aware multi sector model developed by Sinha and Sangeeta (2000), the authors distinguished by gender a total of six factors of production which were further distinguished by regions such as rural and, urban, and sectors such as formal and informal. Further Sinha et al. (2003) augmented the CGE model by differentiating factors of production by twelve categories while identifying home-based workers within informal workers as a separate category. Another study (Sinha and Adam 2006) has shown that in the case of labour market segmentation, informal workers - which include a high share of women (see Sinha et al. 2003) - face a dampening in their wages during period of reforms. and hence flank- ing policies for women are necessary to mitigate exclusion of women from the benefits that are attributed to reforms. Macro analysis that recognizes the above gender concerns and translates this in quantitative/modelling framework is very important. There is a need to develop a framework which would facilitate decomposition of the effects of policy changes and could evaluate feasible policies or \u201cpolicy packages\u201d in a systematic fashion. Further, the benefits of using such models lies in its use for gender analysis by formulating differential gender aware indicators and behaviour func- tions into the framework.

The AP- HDNet is committed to the fullest possible ownership by all with an interest in gender equality, and these discussions are proving to be a vital thoroughfare towards this goal. The goal of institutionalising equality, as contributors urged reflection on, is a debated one. Members surveyed the con- flicting definitions, and pointed to implications of the term \u2018mainstreaming\u2019, with its unwanted links to underpinnings of neoclassical economics that inform the process of marginalising women. Contributors noted both the persistence of doubts whether a mainstream strategy is apt for seeking outcomes that by definition are sector-specific, as well as cases that are proving successful in \u2018institutionalising gender\u2019 across sectors. Conceptual issues can be seen as teething pains given how the effort to institutionalise gender equity represents an historical shift in focus. It pushes off from a platform that earlier tools built to try and alter residual discriminatory practices. In its present incarnation, it involves steps to change systems and procedures that conserve discriminatory practices, which made the earlier actions necessary. Yet, a big challenge remains to take account of and respond to the whole range of places where power, wealth, knowl- edge, capabilities and rights intersect. Contributors insisted this result will only happen when the fullest possible range of duty-bearers grasp responsibility, with clear comprehension of what is intended. But the concept\u2019s open-endedness encloses its potential, not just for change but also for conserving locally-held preferred views of gender relations. This often reduces the extent to which gender equity is institutionalised. Thus a wide variety of beliefs, norms, organisa- tions, attitudes and actions are shaping the actual processes of institutionalising equality that is occurring in different countries. As evidenced by the above cross-sectoral case studies, contributors pointed out gender equality will never fully reach full potency if reduced to a plan to merely establish a national entity for women\u2019s issues. Similarly, gender policies, gen- der awareness workshops, gender staffing ratios, etc. are all essential portions but represent insufficient milestones to- wards gender equality. In particular, much work remains on including women in decision-making. A big part is to guard against tendencies for gender mainstreaming to catalyse dissolution of gender units within ministries, agencies, etc. Frequently, too, the institutional environment blocks change. Fostering capacity of the people within is a big challenge, along with instilling recognition that the idea is to build strategies and tactics into all levels of policies and programmes from the outset at every point. Mainstreaming gender equality requires integration into every aspect of the development process. This includes the ways that institutions of governance and development agencies function, so that they make gender equality a priority at all levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f09b3558-439e-4fad-8ae8-275eff95e58b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f09b3558-439e-4fad-8ae8-275eff95e58b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad9572d980e942422835a5d79962b9773b52c1f1ebb387607dd464ad1f0a68b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3e343f6-fb4b-4371-992c-95c29bf51fa5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0ad1806baceaa42149045b2704521eb95d0e2d5eb0cf591f74c856c87122061"}}, "hash": "6bb67bbfbdc15db2950f321a88d69daf59aa1143193096068fd1101ac36eb6f7", "text": "Also a problem is the oft-fragmented nature of policy-making institutions with outmoded harbouring of research and strategy decisions, created and conserved by hierarchical structures and politics.

They greatly assist implementation and coordination, en- suring policy-makers incorporate gender issues into national plans \u2013 as a starting point. However, the actual starting point, as contributors reminded, begins with gender analysis to provide assessment of dif- ferences in how women and men are likely to experience a particular project, programme, policy or law.

All the best, Jim Chalmers AP-HDNet Facilitator Asia Pacific Human Development Network 108 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Mainstreaming Opening Message 5 Jim Chalmers wrote: Dear Network Members, Welcome to the next sub-theme discussion on gender identities, that includes masculinity and gender minorities. Once more, your valuable experience will help add much needed light to an important topic. The examination of gender identities and its social, economic, political and cultural formations is vital for understanding the reasons for the persis- tence of gender inequality. Guided by priorities in different Asia-Pacific countries, the end goal is investigating areas strategic for transformation at both individual levels (private and public) and aggregate level, which together carry concrete potential for policy. Unequal power is fundamental to differences in people\u2019s unequal opportunities. In all spheres, public and private, actual and perceived gender and power differences between males and females are built on the basis of historical norms and values. Socialisation of males and females begins at an early age. It shapes masculinity and femininity and their social roles, household relationships, control over bodies, and gender-based violence. A useful starting point for analysis is the notion that identity is social. Our possibilities, options, freedoms as women and men are strongly influenced across the generations through social means and products. Conduits include workplaces, institutional practices, and conflicts in these sites. Other media of expected behaviour and change are gestures, body decoration, vernacular expressions, and television, press and print media that transmit creeds and codes of belief. Yet, while concepts like female and male are social products, neo-classical theorists view them in individualist terms. They ask us to believe the path to freedom is paved by contest between individuals. An implication, for example, is that the traces left from domestic violence are typically individualized \u2013 which leaves the victim invisible. Individualism leaves the injured party hushed, leaving just traces in the violator\u2019s story. Silence associated with exclusion demands alternative analysis to recover denied capabilities and to evaluate policies according to their impact on people\u2019s capabilities. When a person\u2019s functionings as a female are deprived by another\u2019s social possibilities as a male, the essence of confrontation goes beyond simple analysis of gender identities. The essen- tial part of analysis lies in the formations of social self-identification. Self identification, as well as the identities thrust upon us, form a dichotomy that needs to be explored. An important way to understand and transform power that is intrinsic to gender identity is through assessing strategies of participation in development. The valuable ideas and methods are those with an emphasis on facilitating emancipatory capabilities through inclusion in significant decision-making in economic, social, political, and family settings. Changes in thinking and attitudes toward sexual and gender identity are taking place in society. This is happening through a material struggle of social ideas about what kinds of work females and males \u2018should\u2019 do, inclusion in deci- sion-making, and women\u2019s struggles for a meaningful valuation of their productive value.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90662ae3-3288-4a10-a199-cf912d297ae4": {"__data__": {"id_": "90662ae3-3288-4a10-a199-cf912d297ae4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4fd85471b2eac065ee8c531431887726060de2e7e583855509507e138ddf2ed2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3c0df18-2caf-48bf-868b-2f6448949208", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "faa3d3e177e9cde3b56cf46684661bd0ae2da85f09943f60771a34c6934f00c6"}}, "hash": "7dc2b0e63e1e5f30ceacff1f81d260ece664b12bd6b64c474a8d26d404ab919f", "text": "But it is important to know more from the Asia-Pacific region about strategic examples that have worked or are being considered to help bring about more gender-equitable norms and values.

He calls attention to oppres- sive knowledge relations uncovered in two studies from Lao and Indonesia. He points to a key context that controls and restricts the gains possible for women in urban work: market liberalization. It opens ostensible options/freedoms, but in the women\u2019s experience it ultimately renews oppressive norms.

However, the effect of the revival of weaving upon women\u2019s social position is interestingly linked to the ways in which weaving is perceived as a gendered activity. So, in villages with a previous history of weaving, it continues to be regarded as a \u2018woman\u2019s work\u2019 which can Asia Pacific Human Development Network 112 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities be conducted when women have \u2018free time\u2019 on their hands (Kusakabe 2004:587). In villages where the activity has been newly introduced, however, \u2018there were few preconceived notions attached to it\u2019 (Kusakabe 2004: 587), and weav- ing was \u2018considered a major source of income\u2019 (ibid, p. 587). Ironically, in villages with a longer history of weaving, women\u2019s involvement with weaving makes a much higher contribution to the household income than in the new, weav- ing areas. In the latter, however, men were much more willing to share in domestic work as well as excuse women from other work such as gathering forest produce. Gender and labour come into play as twinned aspects in another way. Hence, of those women who turned traders \u2013 buy- ing from other Lao women and selling across the border in Thailand \u2013 the most successful are those who were able to travel with their husbands. This was so as \u2018it was difficult for single women to have socially respectable relationships with their buyers\u2019 (Kusakabe 2004:589). The second example concerns Export Promotion Zones, where, globally, women form between 60 \u2013 90% of the work- force. The Indonesian economic crisis of the late 1990s had very specific consequences for the women workers of the Makassar Industrial Zone (KIMA) in South Sulwaesi. The downturn intensified the sense that KIMA \u2013 and the urban milieu itself \u2013 was a threat to its workers\u2019 \u2018reputations\u2019 as \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018virtuous\u2019 women whose key role \u2013 to be dutiful wives \u2013 was increasingly under threat. As it is, young migrant women did not have access to a discourse \u2013 available to migrant men \u2013 that would situate them as \u2018respectable\u2019 bread-winners for their families. The rise of sex-work as a source of supplementing falling incomes during the crisis period, and urban riots which might lead to women\u2019s sexual victimi- sation, were further contexts that added to the rising chorus that the only way the young female worker\u2019s \u2018sexual purity\u2019 could be maintained was through bringing her back to the village. Indeed, many among those who remained in the city thought of themselves as \u2018bad\u2019 women for continuing to stay in \u2018morally tainted\u2019 KIMA. They lamented at having failed to live up to the ideals of the \u2018good daughter\u2019 / \u2018dutiful housewife\u2019. Hence, ideas of morality, migration, and work com- bined upon the grounds of patriarchal and masculinist politics to constrain the decision-making abilities of women in ways that did not apply to male migrant workers. There was no sense that men\u2019s \u2018moral purity\u2019 might be affected, either by their continuing residence in the city, or liaisons with single women and sex-workers. It is important, then, to understand how gender ideologies might be significant. Ideologies are crucial to the ways in which the contexts of women\u2019s work are constrained. A framework that explores the mutually reinforcing networks of oppressive gender norms that circulate at different social levels \u2013 the state, the family, etc. \u2013 is also crucial for our un- derstanding of issues of equity and social justice. The period of economic downturn in Indonesia \u2013 dating from mid-1997 \u2013 was, however, to have differing impacts upon the male and female labour force of the EPZs. Rachel Silvey (2000) suggests that prior to the crisis, the young women who migrated from the villages in South Sulawesi to work in KIMA in the city of Ujung Pandang were motivated by the sense that urban life and work would provide independence and \u2018freedom\u2019 from familial control. However, simulta- neously as the Indonesian State promoted industrial activity that employed a vast number of migrant young women, it also propagated gender norms where women\u2019s roles were primarily articulated in terms of being supportive wives and dutiful daughters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c43319-2f25-4a7a-b1ee-975ae3f08665": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c43319-2f25-4a7a-b1ee-975ae3f08665", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bdfa87032f605e34b855f1429a997dc00af7b77ddb0a8b438635ddb00b9a09a"}, "2": {"node_id": "2745a281-7599-4a2c-8270-0ae2fad1967f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8496ec5c6d56528863c2c7ce605013d3e32beb3ca877d78a5488a97cfd5a5269"}}, "hash": "652014945453b85e871b04921f83975ccf69fa6ccb62033e812f3886f02bdd54", "text": "That is, \u2018it implemented development policies that involved disciplining the population along gender lines\u2019 (Silvey 2000: 146), thereby being in-synch with the patriarchal ideologies that governed women\u2019s lives in their home-villages and families.

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 113 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities Revati Chawla wrote: Facilitator's note: Revati Chawla explains why it is important not to rely solely on law reform to overcome societies' fears of non-heteronormative persons. She suggests that societal change can be more effective when mainstream move- ments and media join the effort at the same time. For instance, lobbying and advocacy by LGBT groups for greater economic and political empowerment has taken place in Nepal and India. Noting that this implies governments and societies are ready for change, Revati points to successful examples of law reform in practical action across the three social sectors in these countries. Dear Network Members, Combating Homophobia: Is Legal Reform the Only Way Forward? I would like to consider how feminist movements, women\u2019s interest groups and LGBT/non-heteronormative movements have negotiated and advocated with governments and society at large for measures to enhance political and economic empowerment. In fact, are governments in the region ready for this? Law reform needs to be accompanied by societal change in individual beliefs, norms, and values. What we sometimes forget is that a government is comprised of individuals who are part of society. While there is increasing acceptance and acknowledgement of the need for Victorian law reform, what is emerging more and more is the Victorian mindset of people has to change. Homophobia is a universal problem and law reform alone cannot erase this fear. LGBT groups have been trying to negotiate and advocate with governments, not just for law reform and empowerment, but also for the right to stop being treated as criminals. (Even adult consensual sex between people of the same sex is a criminal offense in all of South Asia except Nepal). Advocating for and changing existing discriminatory laws will be met with little success unless there are simultaneous mainstream movements directed towards changing societal at- titudes towards non-heteronormativity persons and shifting people\u2019s values and beliefs. One way of doing this is through the media: by bringing the discourse on sex and sexuality into mainstream media newspapers, television etc. India is an excellent example of this: while Voices Against 377 have been advocating for the decriminalization of same sex relationships (the case rests with the Supreme Court at present) this was accompanied by debates, surveys and panel discussions in every possible mainstream media outlet. In Sri Lanka the law reform process in 1999 was attempted in isolation and resulted in more regressive legislation. Successful examples of law reform in practical action: Nepal Another way in which LGBT groups have negotiated and advocated with governments to enhance political and econom- ic empowerment is through intensive lobbying at every level of society. A good example of this is what has happened in Nepal. In Nepal, LGBT movements have been successful in having the third gender recognized by the state. Last year, Nepal's Supreme Court decision issued directives to the Government of Nepal to recognise gender minorities for the first time. The government has now taken a stand to include pro-poor and inclusive government policies for sexual and gender minorities and has a national budget allocation for the first time in Nepal. In fact, in Nepal, it is not just the government and Supreme Court that are becoming more inclusive. Now a private bank - \"Everest Bank\" - has changed its account opening form and made it possible to open a bank account as a third gender. A semi government corporation - \"Handicraft and Small Industry Corporation\" \u2013 has started providing baking, sewing and tailoring training to LGBT persons.

Asia Pacific Human Development Network 114 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities Although groups of transsexuals in Tamil Nadu have been lobbying with governments for over a decade, their cause was given a global voice when the athlete Soundarajan who won a silver medal in the women\u2019s 800m race at the 2006 Asian Games held in Doha, had to undergo a \u2018sex test\u2019 to prove her womanhood. The results indicated that she \u201cdoes not possess the sexual characteristics of a woman\u201d and she was stripped of her silver medal. Since then, it has been reported that she attempted suicide. Let us also consider what the relationship is between normative attitudes about masculinity and femininity and gender inequality. To what extent is gender identity a matter of choice or a set of customary rules imposed on individuals? In other words, are choice and socialization the only factors that influence gender identity? Does biology play a role? Nature or nurture? Sexual orientation and gender identity are largely influenced by society. Although there are age old debates on whether ones sexual orientation is based on nature or nurture, looking for answers in biology alone (such as trying to isolate the \u2018gay gene\u2019) can be dangerous as we run the risk of attributing people\u2019s sexual orientation to genes and chromosomes instead of trying to understand the complexity within which we live and the multiple factors that affect human sexuality; that it is constantly changing and evolving. So is it nature or nurture? I believe it is both.

It is my view that it is not only choice and socialization that influence gender identity; biology also plays a dominant role in this context. If there is a choice for a baby girl and a baby boy to select toys, girls select toys like dolls and puppets, whereas boys select jeeps, cars or some types of vehicles. Sri Lankan society is largely a patriarchal society, where the male is believed to be the dominant character. But in many households in Sri Lanka, the female is the dominant actor who influences the decision making process, irrespective of her educational level or economic empowerment. But this feature might not be very visible as power is exercised in a very subtle way, so both parties at home are satisfied. Sri Lanka enjoys high literacy rates without gender bias, and many women have been empowered through economic progress. Sometimes gendered attitudes become a deciding factor in recruitment. Generally, women are believed to have much more patience and can thrive in harsh conditions and are known to be good at multi-tasking. In my experience, these ideas about the character of women have been rewarded by recruitments for higher positions. This is an example when gendered attitudes can work positively for women. In relation to more visible changes, there has been some progress in equitable employment rights. For example, there used to be restrictions on getting married in some employments such as nursing. Women were prohibited from getting married in the first seven years of employment. Now, these regulations have been lifted and women are allowed to enter married life and enter motherhood before they overcome the fertility period. There are other positive movements - such as extended maternity leave up to ten months and few days off for the father as paternity leave. However, certain gender roles such as maternal care are still largely limited to women. In the political arena, Sri Lankan history shows male dominance, with a few exceptions of female queens. It is widely known that King Dutugemunu, one of the most famous and respected kings of our history, united and governed the country based on the advice of his heroine mother, Vihara Maha Devi. There is a folk story that once King Dutugeme- unu fled in disguise from a war and came to a small cottage in a remote village. There, upon his request, he was served some rice to eat by a lady. While he was eating he was told by her that he was eating the same way he conducted the war. This woman told him not to eat here and there, but have his food little by little, gradually. So it became well known that King Dutugemunu carried out the war gradually, taking a village lady\u2019s advice which turned out to be a success. Such examples show that though women don\u2019t directly engage in politics, they do contribute behind the scene. In fact, their contribution is very vital and critical. Ultimately this example illustrates that women\u2019s role may be recognized and respected in arenas traditionally dominated by men. In conclusion, there are some gender roles where male-female boundaries are not crossed by each other (such as mater- nal care). These roles are derived from biological roots. But for some roles, which don\u2019t have any biological connection (such as opportunities for higher education and advanced career opportunities), the boundaries are not clear. What is evident in Sri Lankan society is that women\u2019s freedom in accessing education, health and the economic arena is more protected than in other South Asian countries. But there are limitations on women to entering politics. Other roles mainly connected with biological roots remain gender specific. While not very visible, women share in political life and household decision making in notable ways. Culturally women enjoy a respectable and sacred life at the household level, though it can be violated by the other party. Therefore any movement towards uplifting women\u2019s status should be handled carefully and sensitively and the importance of culture should be recognized.

Yet, people are opening up spaces in India. This includes a transgender welfare board and third gender category for student admissions in Tamil Nadu; and Indian passport forms include a third gender category. At the same time, official and non-official stigma and discrimination/violence persist. Dear Network Members, Understanding Gender: Expanding the Discourse First of all, I find it interesting that the facilitator\u2019s opening message mentions gender identity as \u201cincluding masculin- ity and gender minorities\u201d. This is very welcome as ironically, gender to date is viewed as being synonymous with and often limited to discourses on women. Gender is about how societies and cultures construct notions of men, women, transgender people and other gender variant individuals. There are various aspects to gender \u2013 assignment, role, attribution and identity. Gender assignment is when a gender is assigned to a new-born in accordance with the child\u2019s biological sex. Gender role is the performance of an assigned gen- der identity. Therefore, expressions of masculinity or femininity are part of gender roles that are expected of people in accordance with their assigned gender - of male or female. Gender attribution is how society attributes certain codes and conducts as designated to a particular gender. Gender identity is how a person identifies or engages with one\u2019s own gen- der, which may or may not be in consonance with the biological sex or the gender attribution by society. Unfortunately, despite differences in assignment, role, attribution or identity, they are used interchangeably to mean the same thing. Gender is a social construct and is experienced differently in different cultures, societies and contexts. For example, whereas it may be the norm in some societies for men to be the heads of households, in certain other matrilineal house- holds, the lineage could be traced through women. Attitudes about masculinity and femininity differ across contexts. If men are supposed to sport short hair as part of the gender norms in a particular society, these norms may not be accept- able in another. There are cultures where men are known to have long hair as well. Also, norms around gender are also known to vary over time. For example, in present day urban India, many young men feel it is \u2018cool\u2019 to have long hair. Gender is therefore not a fixed notion. It is fluid and varies across individuals, societies, contexts, cultures, time and even within the lifespan of the same individual. Although gender identity is a person\u2019s choice or engagement with one\u2019s own gender, it is very often not left to the indi- vidual to decide one\u2019s identity. Most societies operate on a strictly binary notion of sex and gender \u2013 male and female. However, we know that that\u2019s not wholly true, whether from a biological or a sociological point of view. If biology be the determinant of one\u2019s gender, would it be based on the genitals of the person, the chromosomal make-up of the person or the hormonal make-up? It is difficult to make any or all three the determinant(s) of one\u2019s gender. There are people who are born not with the chromosomal make-up of XY or XX but also XXY, XYY, XO. There are people who are born with genitals that are difficult to be categorized as either male or female. In these cases, it is very often medical professionals who get to decide the sex and therefore also the gender of the person by performing \u2018corrective\u2019 surgeries without the consent of the person and often without the consent of the parents. The biological sex of a person may not be the only determinant of one\u2019s gender identity. Very often there are people who may be born as either male or female, but do not adhere to the gendered notions attached to their bodies. Over time, gender and sexuality have also tended to overlap. In one of the meetings that I attended recently on discrimination on sexual and gender minorities, the categories of male, female, transgender, male sex worker and men who have sex with men were spoken of in the same light. It is therefore important to gain more clarity before making rights claims. The fluidity of gender is being increasingly recognized by various movements in India, including the women\u2019s move- ments, the LGBT and queer ideologies.

Attempts by the government of Tamil Nadu to include issues of transgender people are also a case in point: the Tamil Nadu Government has attempted to create more spaces for transgender people e.g. by providing ration cards for transgender people (Malarvizhi 2006), constituting a transgender welfare board (Muj- taba 2008) and also creating a third gender category for transgender people seeking admissions in schools and colleges. New passport forms in India also allow for another gender category other than male/ female (http://passport.gov.in/). While spaces such as these are opening up and issues of gender variant people are being acknowledged and addressed, there are instances of stigma and discrimination or cases of abuse and exploitation of transgender people by society at large and even by state authorities that we read or hear about every day. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 117 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities There are differing views on how gender may be performed or experienced. It is therefore difficult to have an over-arch- ing and comprehensive definition of gender. Before discussing issues of gender identity, there is a need to interrogate notions of what is male and what is female. It is then that we notice that the boundaries between the two get extremely blurred, thus creating possibilities of many categories which evade the strict binaries of male or female.

In our own region - Asia-Pacific - mascu- line identities which are characterized through certain behaviours (aggressiveness, physical strength, drive, ambition, competitiveness and self-reliance) are encouraged in males but discouraged in females. Understandings of men and masculinity need to intersect with issues of class, caste, race and other criteria to give an accurate picture of the chal- lenges faced. These norms are reinforced by both men and women within society through popular representations of what a man should be as an individual, in the home, at work or when holding public office. Sexuality is also an important, although not the sole part, of identity which influences the freedoms and choices a person can exercise. Why are non-heterosexual men or even heterosexual men (*) who do not display stereotypical traits con- sidered less than their mainstream counterparts? The answer is the inherent idea that societies often view a man being \u201clike a woman\u201d as disgraceful and not fitting the status of what a \u201cman\u201d ought to be. In this way, the struggle for sexual Asia Pacific Human Development Network 118 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities freedom and rights is also the struggle against patriarchy. I would therefore suggest that women\u2019s groups and those fight- ing for sexual rights hold this common adversary in their cause for gender equality. How can something as complex as masculine identities impact daily lives? For example, masculine identities in health often lead men to engage in risk taking behaviour such as alcohol and substance abuse and joining youth gangs. Men are encouraged to be the overpowering figure in sexual relationships with women. Media in the region (for example, the popular Japanese anime) promotes men to perform violent sex and young men and boys are encouraged to compete with each other on the number of women they have \"conquered.\" Masculine identities also restrict the choice men have in terms of choice of education choice and livelihood, particularly in fields such as nursing and visual creative indus- tries. Although men are found in these industries, it is usually not without society placing stigma or a negative label on them. The main message I would like to put forth for this discussion is two fold: that all men do not equally benefit from patriarchy and this is evident through the stratification of masculine identities where there is a hierarchy amongst what is seen as socially valued in terms of appearance, behaviour traits and attitudes. In fact, certain groups of men within a given society also suffer from patriarchy. These men find their choices, freedoms, physical and mental well-being restricted and/or prohibited. Second, that the struggle for sexual rights and freedoms is the struggle against patriarchy and that women\u2019s movements and LGBTIQ movements have a common goal in this regard. As respect for diversity is a fundamental tenet to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, people who do not necessarily fit societies\u2019 mould of what are \u201cmasculine\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d identities should be taken into account. Complimenting advocacy, a lot can be done to work with these issues to change mindsets and behaviours. Media representations, educational institutions/ instruction, workplace expectations and regulations, legal definitions and gender programmes on the ground pushing for holistic gender empowerment all have a role in integrating this understanding of allowing for multiple identities and working toward addressing patriarchy. Cordially, Omar Siddique Policy and Programme Analyst Human Development Report Unit UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific Colombo Office Notes (*) It\u2019s worth pointing out that sexuality is not a static concept. The noted biologist Alfred Kinsey\u2019s work was instru- mental in this regard. In pursuit of empirical evidence on sexuality, Kinsey and his team collected 18000 sex histories in 1930s America. These made up his two books, which became phenomenal bestsellers, even though they were academic tomes. Kinsey developed a heterosexual-homosexual rating scale that suggested sexual preference was not exclusive, that men could have both heterosexual and homosexual feelings. During this work, he developed a scale measuring sexual orientation, now known as the Kinsey Scale which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively heterosexual and 6 is exclusively homosexual; a rating of 7, for asexual, was added later by Kinsey's associates.

This responds to why social values largely shape human choice, and how power operates and shapes social inclusion. They point to migrants\u2019 strategies/values of belonging, strong shared emotional experience, as being instrumental in identity. But behaviour is linked to experiences of previous networks too. Values mirror a mix of new and older pressures. They suggest that oppressive social relations could be transformed by clearer understanding of the interplay between local and other social networks. Dear Network Members, Masculine Identities of Indonesian Muslim Men in Indonesia and Australia This contribution addresses masculine identities of Indonesian Muslim men in Indonesia and in Australia. We have been researching the construction of Asian-Muslim masculinities before and after moving to Australia. Since 2001, a series of terrorist attacks worldwide under the ostensible banner of Islamic jihad - especially the Bali bombings and 9/11 - have intensified mainstream Australian suspicions of Muslim migrants, men in particular. Despite our proximity as nations, there seems to be little understanding of Indonesian cultural identities. For example, throughout their six years of imprisonment the three Bali bombers (all from Java) presented confident smiling faces and devout, yet light-hearted personas - at odds with both the seriousness of their crimes and their looming executions. Western observers found this incomprehensible, even psychotic. However, even though the vast majority of Indonesian Muslims condemned their crimes outright, the \u2018smiling assassin\u2019 persona would not have struck them as in- comprehensible, but credible in terms of the discourse of hegemonic masculinity enshrined in Javanese culture. Accord- ingly, though in circumstances of proven guilt and imminent death by firing squad, the convicted bombers, as Javanese men, were exhibiting masterful self-control - conquering fear by depicting the opposite and - bolstered by their unyield- ing religious conviction - appealing to the \u201cummah\u201d (worldwide congregation of the Muslim faithful) in solidarity. Like most other migrants arriving in Australia, Muslim Indonesian male migrants gravitate to the suburbs and work- places dominated by Indonesians and/or Muslim migrants. The mosque provides a place of cultural refuge and resources for social and economic networking. In the sense that such networks build confidence, prosperity and social capital for Muslim Indonesian male migrants and their families, they are very positive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b6a795b-2f95-419b-92ab-627f7e77dce1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b6a795b-2f95-419b-92ab-627f7e77dce1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64af9fb3c57f75d099784f90925c46a21b09c899fd0a1345d5ec525569e71e05"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a628d69-6f64-4579-828a-0dd4f9a3be8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7d4969d96909232502f86859a149e3b2d07b9d4c9b554f63ffcc13dff4113e6"}}, "hash": "0f7fbc67fdd0d158c3851b01cd896da5ed548ee0bc149424b2e5f889b0a0f487", "text": "However, in the sense that such networks foster extremism, strengthen insularity from mainstream multicultural Australia, and encourage conservative adherence to strict patriarchal orthopraxy, they may act against the interests of the nation as a whole. We need to develop under- standings of Indonesian masculinity that can inform community interventions leading to greater social and cultural inclusion through building, in a well-informed way, on the positive aspects of existing Muslim Indonesian male migrant social networks. Australians\u2019 fear of Muslims focuses around two core \u2018male\u2019 issues: men\u2019s attitudes to women and terrorism (Poynting and Mason 2007). Both make fundamental assumptions about the attitudes and behaviour of Muslim men. There is a contrast between the type of masculinity Australians regard as \u2018normative\u2019 or hegemonic, and the actual or imagined masculinity practised by Muslim migrant men, as the Cronulla race riots demonstrated. Our research so far has uncovered the following themes of difference: Self-regulation: Muslim Indonesian men were surprised that almost all the Australian men they encountered - regardless of age and class - lacked self-control and demonstrated kasar (unrefined, lower class) behaviour: joking around, exhibi- tionism, talking loudly, sexual boasting, grunting and yelling while watching sport, getting drunk, arguing and fighting.

Self-regulation is a virtue enshrined in Koranic teaching (Ahmed 2006: 22). Javanese ideals of masculinity also enshrine the notion of power gained through inner self-control. Sexuality: The men made a strong link between self-regulation and sexuality. They said they were shocked at the unregu- lated, shameless sexuality of Australian men. They were offended by: Australian men\u2019s sexual boasting, public displays of affection between couples, availability of pornography and sex aids, and lack of media censorship. The identification of unregulated sexuality as dangerous and the confinement of sex to marriage are significant moral tenets of Islam. They inform the social/political pressure for anti-pornography laws recently passed in Indonesia. The new laws reflect the extraordinary resurgence in public Muslim piety and devotion across South-East Asia (Smith-Hefner 2005), arising partly in reaction to western cultural hegemony. The construction of masculinity here is one of male sexual passions that must be controlled and should not be tempted, so that public morals and family life are protected (Gerami 2005; Ahmed 2006). In Australia the mosque was considered by some of our interviewees as a refuge from anxiety about sexual im- Asia Pacific Human Development Network 120 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities ages and ideas - among many other stresses and conflicts. All interviewees were pre-occupied with how they might be seen and judged by other Indonesians, demonstrating a strong collective orientation and a desire to avoid shame. Family Life: Interviewees thought Australian men behaved irresponsibly towards their parents, wives and children. They did not often visit or socialise with their own and their wives\u2019 families, and were not in the habit of teaching their children correct moral values. There was little respect for family life and the role of the father. Islamisation in Indonesia is attempting to strengthen the centrality of the family, even while women are moving more and more into paid work (Bennett 2005). Muslim teaching stresses that in marriage, the man is equally responsible for the moral education of children (Roded 2006; Nilan, Donaldson and Howson 2008). Interviewees were committed to their moral regulatory role as family leader. Solidarity: Interviewees criticised Australian men for being \u2018selfish\u2019 and individualistic, for lacking solidarity and com- mon cause with peers. Solidarity here is understood as based on shared feelings, purposes and interests. They implied that their solidarity with each other as men enabled them to maintain the tenets of their faith and their sense of cultural identity. From our subsequent research on masculine identities with men in Central Java in 2008, some new themes have emerged: \ufffd Western men were thought to have a more industrious work ethic, even though Islam teaches men that working is an act of devotion. \ufffd Western men were thought to treat women equally, while Indonesian men dominate women, even though in Islam men and women are equal in the eyes of God. \ufffd The mosque was considered a place for men, not women. It is clear that local masculinities, and in this case Indonesian masculinities, can no longer be understood simply from within national boundaries. In the Muslim male migrant context in Australian cities, targeted interventions to bring about greater social inclusion and harmony need to address the social construction of masculine identity in devout, in- sular migrant communities. Such interventions need to build on the positive aspects of male social networking around mosques.

Specifically, she points out how socialisation by co-educational schools impacts negatively on girls\u2019 adequate ac- cess to the processes of learning, identity and sexuality, and on making satisfactory use of opportunities (getting jobs and pursuing livelihood options). Dear Network Members, Gender Differentiated Experiences in Schools In response to the terms of reference laid out by the facilitator, I just wish to make a few observations leveraging a few studies and drawing on critical reflections of my experiences as a student both in co-educational and single sex schools in India. I would like to draw attention to the role played by educational institutions in shaping a person\u2019s identity. Many scholars have argued that educational systems serve as instruments of social and structural reproduction (Althusser 1971; Bourdieu 1977). My observations are limited to women\u2019s socialization resulting from their experiences in educational institutions that have a direct bearing on their identities and the way men and women learn to identify themselves. In this regard, I would like to draw attention to the difference in experiences for women in single sex and mixed schools. Studies have shown that the experiences of girls in co-educational and single sex schools are qualitatively different (American Association for University Women 1992). Traditionally, as part of the western education system, there were different schools for men and women. However, over the years, co-educational systems have earned more favour as they are viewed to be means of promoting educational opportunity and gender equality. Contrary to popular belief, studies indicate that mixed gender classrooms to do not result in equality of educational opportunity (Mblizi 2008). And these studies reinforce my own experiences as a student in India. Gender bias and stereotyping in educational institutions can limit girls\u2019 opportunities and girls often feel inhibited and constrained in mixed classes. In co-educational institutions, girls feel more bound to confine themselves to gender stereotypical images, as was confirmed by a study conducted on Malawian school girls (ibid.). Often, there is gender bias and inadequate attention from teachers. The study also showed that graduates of all girls\u2019 institutions are more likely than their co-education school peers to choose careers in fields that are not traditionally dominated by women. Another study conducted on girls in Northern Ireland also indicated that self esteem of girls differs in different school types (Cairns 1990). In addition, a recent study by Sax (2005) has demonstrated that girls and boys learn differently; hence, putting them in so called \u201cgender-neutral\u201d education systems favours the learning cycle of one sex over the other.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f6ed7dc-450f-4e74-bca9-19fb0679e0f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f6ed7dc-450f-4e74-bca9-19fb0679e0f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c7054c244c1097291ddcf52eecdbd3a7b4185986ee63b82c69b079f1ea81914"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2fb876c-75bf-41e7-8018-21e2577dacdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b44c3188f17a1454745a9cb294cef82a32f4c051821e69d0e4e1c71b1cea1c3e"}}, "hash": "3cd74a32f05fbbd9bd8c485ae759ddeafa5e9029937c46dd39416238c9ad4919", "text": "Though, at this point, I would like to acknowledge that this is more relevant in today\u2019s educational institutions; the old day missionary girls\u2019 schools were also perpetuating stereotypical notions about gender roles and were serving as finish- ing schools for girls.

Girls\u2019 hostels in educational institutions are a case in point, where through the rules and regulations, there is attempt to control their sexual interaction to preserve their virginity, which is considered to be an indication of a woman\u2019s modesty. Similar and corresponding controls are not to be seen in boys\u2019 hostels. Similarly, there is no such public interest in preserving the virginity of boys, creating a very different space for interaction with the social environment. This duality of public and private spheres results in different repre- sentations of different genders and in turn, gender identities.

This is essential for reasons that include measurement issues. Currently, many persons are not counted if not free to proclaim their identity. Identities can be obscured, suppressed, and discriminated as 'minority'; and people become invisible in the counting. On methods, Rohini calls attention to how policy conversations are dominated by 'either/or' categories and too few shades in between. Plus, whose categories are these? The result is that imprecise categories and conceptual grounds are not conducive to the goal of evidence-based policy decisions. This is especially so against a backdrop of sensitivity associated with gender identity links with the predominant models of 'family' and 'society\u2019. Dear Network Members, Gender identities: Issues for Measurement I would like to raise some \u2018methodological\u2019 points on the theme of gender identities and human development, which in my view beg further scrutiny. This theme is linked to evolving discussions and concepts, and there are fertile opportu- nities for sharpening analytical terminology. These may have implications for current gender debates that can inform socio-economic policy changes. For policy purposes in particular, special attention may need to be paid to categorization, issues of measurement, and sensitivity. The first two areas may require greater cross-fertilization of concepts from the domains of economics, anthropology, feminist critique and LGBTIQ movements (although discussions within these domains are constantly evolving). The last area, the issue of sensitivity and the fallouts through politicisation of discussion, is critical, and one that is likely to raise the maximum ire from \u2018so-called\u2019 mainstream thinking and from cultural or religious quarters. Gender identities seem to be highly vulnerable to fallouts from such quarters as they are seen as intrinsically connected to the domain of family and society. For example, the vote in the UN on decriminalizing homosexuality is one such concern (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7791063.stm).

For example, the generic term \u2018man\u2019 (or \u2018woman\u2019) in most policy documents obfuscates many recent developments around gender identities. \u2018Self-identification\u2019 can refer to how a man or a woman or a transgendered individual sees themselves (*). However \u2018group identification\u2019 refers to how the world at large sees us (society, community, colleagues, etc) as \u2018masculine\u2019 or \u2018feminine\u2019 or displaying attributes deemed \u2018manly\u2019 or \u2018sissy\u2019 or \u2018feminine\u2019 or \u2018girly\u2019 (see Omar Siddique\u2019s contribu- tion). In reality, what we see ourselves as is our gender identity, but it is only when we voice or proclaim it in the public space - \u2018come out\u2019 - are we counted as such. In this context, where some individuals are unable to \u2018come out\u2019 due to fear of social, political or economic exclusion, they become part of the \u2018silent\u2019 majority. For example, employment benefits extended to family are usually not extended to the same gender spouse or partner, as well as for immigration, nationality or naturalisation- gender identities are rarely accommodated (this is changing in a few instances - see Revati Chawla\u2019s and Arpita Das\u2019s contribution). In other words, tension between the ascribed identity (how society or groups see us as) and what we see ourselves as, presents a conundrum for measurement. My colleague, Revati Chawla quite rightly pointed out the inappropriateness of using \u2018sexual minorities\u2019 as a term in this E-Discussion \u2013 with the inherent abnormal nuance or discrimination that it implies. To paraphrase sociological basics, Durkheim defined the \u2018normal\u2019 \u2013 as that which occurs most often. In the popular mainstream arena of social and cultural production (films, newspapers, theatre, everyday life), \u2018minorities\u2019 is taken to connote a variety of individuals and groups, not seen to be following the \u2018norm\u2019 - i.e. a woman boxer is manly, \u2018a stay at home dad\u2019 is understanding/unusual or a \u2018gay\u2019 man is alternative or away from the norm (although this is changing). How the value (and repressions) that society and culture attribute to the issue of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identities (SOGI) means that these identities become obscured or even worse, suppressed, marginalized and discriminated as being \u2018non-mainstream\u2019 or minority. From that coin, what is mainstream and what is minority becomes a sticky issue to \u2018count\u2019. Those individuals with a different sexual orientation or gender identity, unable to voice or proclaim their identity, become invisible to counting in number and are deemed as \u2018minorities\u2019. Whether it comes to behaviour (e.g. the \u2018manly\u2019 woman) or sexual orientation (for e.g. the Queer Man or Queer Woman), \u2018sexual minorities\u2019 becomes a misleading and inaccurate term. To \u2018count\u2019 the invisible SOGIs, is therefore an extremely challenging issue for measurement. Unless all individuals have the capability for \u2018self identification\u2019 or \u2018coming out of the closet\u2019 freely, it is impossible to count accurately all the different gender identities. In conclusion, it is therefore useful to demarcate areas where there is broad consensus, and draw categories from there while establishing areas where the debates are extremely polarized. It may be fair to generalize however, that gender identity as a human rights concern and its relationship to policy making remains heavily contested and sensitive.

The struggle against patriarchy brings women\u2019s movements and LGBTIQ movements close together to expand choices and freedoms. Sexuality and the other components of identity shape women\u2019s and men\u2019s freedoms/choices; and in the case of men\u2019s health, this shows up in risk-taking behaviours. In education and livelihoods, there is further evidence that norms of masculinity restrict men\u2019s choices and freedom to act. In India, there are issues that persist because people have not yet grasped that \u2018gender\u2019 is a fluid, non-fixed notion. 'Gen- der' has different aspects, but people invariably use the concept as if its different aspects (assignment, role, attribution and identity) were one and the same thing. Governments and societies have the potential for policy changes involving economic and political empowerment for LGBT groups. However, a combination of measures is required. In Nepal and India, there are successful examples of law reform blended with practical action taken across the three social sectors. It is, however, critical not to rely solely on law reform to overcome societies' fears of non-heteronormative persons; socialisation initiatives are a crucial part of the programme mix needed. Advocacy and lobbying appear to be more effective when mainstream movements and media join the effort at the same time. This is shown in the Nepal and India cases of LGBT groups working to gain economic and political power. In India, people are opening up gender spaces in ways that include a transgender welfare board and a third gender cat- egory for student admissions in Tamil Nadu. Also, Indian passport forms now include a third gender category. At the same time, interventions are needed to address stigma, discrimination and violence, both official and non-official, that persists and accompanies these changes. In spite of these developments, policy overall needs to catch up with new thinking in social science and activism in de- veloping more precise analytical terms, categories, and methods. This is essential for reasons that include measurement issues. Currently, many persons are not counted if they are not free to proclaim their identity. The link between education and the construction of gender identities is fundamental for the discussion. For instance, formal education processes, also in India, continue to reinforce the inequitable ways through which power operates, and how this shapes who is included and excluded. Evidence-based education policy needs to factor in the co-education school system. In particular, it needs to evaluate data on how this variety of socialisation impacts negatively on girls\u2019 adequate access to the processes of learning, identity and sexuality, and on making satisfactory use of opportunities (get- ting jobs and pursuing livelihood options). In Sri Lanka, in spheres where gender boundaries are not always clearly marked or applied, e.g. in some labour markets, further opportunities for women are evolving. This can be seen in opportunities within higher education. The opening up of gender spaces can have mixed consequences. Two studies from Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Indonesia show the importance of understanding the ways that market liberalization controls and restricts potential gains for women in urban work. Women consulted for these studies refute claims that the \u2018free market\u2019 system frees up women\u2019s options. In their experience, the market reinforces or even prescribes oppressive norms. It does so through the market\u2019s adherence to how daughters or wives should behave as commercial actors. The roles that the market dictates for women, in terms of behavioural expectations, is wholly inconsistent with what women choose, prefer, or aspire to in their workplaces and in their quality of lives. The market\u2019s reinforcement of institutionalized and unspoken expectations shut down choices and put boundaries around women\u2019s social mobility. While women face one set of constraints, elsewhere the construction of masculinity throws up other issues. The evi- dence on construction of Indonesian masculinities is that social values play a large role in shaping choices and in how power operates and shapes social inclusion. In populations of migrant men, researchers have found direct links between E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 125 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities the strategies and values of belonging and the shared emotional experience of migration.

We will begin the discussion on folklore next week. Until then \u2026 Warm regards, Jim Chalmers AP-HDNet Facilitator Asia Pacific Human Development Network 126 TABLE OF CONTENTS Gender Identities Opening Message 6 Jim Chalmers wrote: Dear Network Members, Welcome to the next sub-theme: it is on folklore dimensions. Up until this point, the network has been focused on point- ing out values and norms that renew gender and power differences and unequal opportunities. Now, the emphasis shifts to folklore and stories, which occupy spaces that exist between historical realms and other possibilities of more equitable human relationships. So this discussion brings a very different kind of potential or force to the transformation of gender inequalities. Martha Nussbaum (1995) has previously brought attention to the importance of reflecting on \u2018stories of communal self-definition and self-clarification.\u2019 The \u2018bearers of intrinsic values\u2019 sit at the centre of these stories; but what makes it tricky to see them is that the narrative intent is often distorted. Folkloric stories are always in a state of \u2018version change\u2019 according to the pre- dominating ideology. Sometimes it takes an archaeological dig to discern the authentic \u2018folkloric intent\u2019. \u2018Folkloric intent\u2019 refers to the idea that story cycles often provide the core of silenced or unofficial histories. Oral media such as creation narratives and other story cycles are precious sources of memory. The evidence they provide might be considered \u2018soft\u2019 in mainstream development economics, but it validates memories that are critical in the process of identity-clarification, participation and transformation of power inequalities. The realm of folklore can be seen as driven in particular by what the ethnographer Victor Turner (1982) has called \u2018liminal\u2019 moments. At such times, people strive to understand their lives in terms of their main relationships and how these processes shape their opportunities to do useful things with their lives. Uncovering or recognizing other possibilities from the my- thopoeic or collective imagination can play a crucial role in rejecting oppressive social identity markers and being able to participate in meaningful ways. Folkloric dimensions are not simply imaginative. They link directly with historical events. These performances help to uncover connections between ideology and cultural conflict in power relationships. Typically, the story cycles preserve and transmit spontaneous insight into the norms that limit ideas, behaviour and self-clarification; and they can lead to new perspectives. Yet, again, it is challenging to try and uncover the folkloric intent. In some country contexts, the present-day story-tellers are women and their audiences are women, and the tales portray the experiences of women, yet transmit the behaviour expectations of the dominant patriarchal culture. The same is true when the word \u2018women\u2019 is replaced with \u2018men\u2019, in pa- triarchal contexts. As an example of the former situation, stories often tell of compliant (good) girls, wicked stepmothers, jealous wives and dangerous (assertive/bad) girls. Here the historical use of the folkloric sphere is to condition the child for a domineered social role. Yet, dreams and aspirations of breaking imposed boundaries persist. In other versions of a story, we see emergent traces of resistance and fissures in the symbolic order.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c725f386-a812-41f1-a597-f4b8c7047bc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c725f386-a812-41f1-a597-f4b8c7047bc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2d5702a148489d76439bbf312f28c976391cca9ce7d3aa541433021b54d451c"}, "2": {"node_id": "a80c5208-72ce-4e5f-9cc1-5d6e4cc31f84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "078ed1912d07a7c64b1e59b3870c0742584ee012122dc08be64b9d5db6ca6410"}}, "hash": "fdb9914625e05c797bb6eb4e7df0dbb9321da3ab35ef37afd93ef241c501ccf7", "text": "Sometimes the \u2018traces\u2019 inform comprehensive and effective unofficial resistance.

This is highlighted in a Cambodian folktale shared by Elena Bor- satti. The story features a female protagonist who successfully combats greed, duplicity, faithlessness, and skulduggery through perseverance, innovation, wisdom, grace, and loyalty. Princess Amaradevi In Cambodia there once lived a wealthy princess by the name of Amaradevi who was an educated and talented young woman. There were four old grand ministers of the palace who all wished to marry her, as they were attracted by her riches. Princess Amaradevi turned down their proposals and chose to marry Mahoseth, a fine young man. Amaradevi and Mahoseth loved and respected one another and lived happily. But the four grand ministers were very bitter and resentful and started vicious rumours. One day, they decided to tell the king that Mahoseth was plotting to kill him and seize the throne. This time, their argu- ments and false proofs were so convincing that the king believed them. The king ordered Mahoseth to leave the palace, never to return. The four ruthless ministers congratulated each other and began plotting their next step. They decided to ask for Ama- radevi\u2019s hand one at a time. They also agreed that the one who would marry her would share with the other three min- isters her riches. Amaradevi passed the days in sorrow. She tried to think of a way to prove the truth. Two weeks after Mahoseth was banished, the first grand minister came to visit Amaradevi with his proposals of love and marriage. Amaradevi listened to him quietly. She replied, \"Yes, my dear man. Perhaps I could love you and marry you. Why not return later this evening, at seven o'clock?\" The first grand minister was delighted. He bowed and bowed, and promised to return at the appointed time. During the same morning, Amaradevi was surprised by the visits of the other three ministers. They all praised her beauty, professed their love, and begged her to marry them. Amaradevi was polite to all of them.

The rice, she knew, would expand and swell when it was mixed for a while with hot water. The servants then poured this mixture into the pit, filling it halfway. Finally, Amaradevi taught the servants how to construct a trap door to cover the large hole. The trap door could be opened by a rope that was secretly hidden behind a curtain. When the construction work was finished, Amaradevi dismissed the servants and asked her maid to bring all of her precious jewels and scatter them about on a table near the trap door in the small back parlour. When that was done, Amaradevi told the maid that she expected the four grand ministers to visit that evening. The maid was to welcome them respectfully and ask them to wait for the princess in the small back parlour. Then she had to inform Amaradevi. That evening, promptly at seven o'clock, the first grand minister arrived. The maid greeted him politely and led him to the small back parlour. Then she walked softly to Princess Amaradevi. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 131 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories They both went to the small back parlour. They slipped silently behind the curtain, waited, and watched. The first grand minister was bending over the table of glistening jewels. He put his hand out to touch one. Then he quickly pulled his hand back to his side and stepped back. The jewels were like magnets. He looked around the room and through the doorway. Then, quickly reaching out, he grabbed a huge ruby and stuffed it deep into his pocket. At that moment, Ama- radevi signalled her maid. Both women pulled hard on the rope. The trap door opened, throwing the First Grand Minister screaming into the large pit of warm mud and sticky rice. Then the heavy trap door closed neatly and tightly. The three other grand ministers arrived at their appointed times. Each one in turn was asked to wait in the small back parlour. And each one in turn became bewitched by the table of shimmering rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. None of them could resist the temptation of stuffing at least one of the jewels into his pocket. And at that point, the two women pulled the trap-door rope. As each grand minister was added to the pit, the mud and swelling, sticky rice rose higher and higher. Amaradevi kept the trap door tightly closed all night. The next morning, she told her servants to take the mud-caked ministers out of the pit, bind their hands, and lead them to the royal court. When they reached the throne room, the prin- cess bowed before her father. \"Your Majesty,\" she said, \"I ask your permission to prove to the royal court the treachery of these four grand ministers of the palace. I refused their proposals because they were greedy for my riches. They plot- ted against Mahoseth and finally convinced the royal court that he was disloyal and dishonest. Now the ministers have come to me once again with proposals of love and marriage. But the only thing that they really love is our royal jewels. I trapped them as they were stealing our sacred treasures from my apartments. I will prove this to you.\u201d Amaradevi signalled her maid who, reaching into each grand minister's pocket, pulled out a precious royal jewel. The king was furious. He ordered the palace guards to tie the mud-caked ministers to elephants for all the people to see. Amaradevi bowed to the king and returned to her palace rooms. Mahoseth was summoned from exile, and he returned home to his loving and clever wife.

Dear Network Members, Women Storytellers: Negotiating Multilayered Roles In this contribution, instead of presenting the story, we concentrate on women story tellers \u2013 the meta-tale rather than the tale itself. Women\u2019s roles as story tellers are not unusual. In fact, \u2018grand-mother\u2019 stories are a part of children\u2019s upbringing in most cultures. Tales from grandmothers are often oral and handed down from the ages and across generations. Not rigid in form or structure, the content can involve monsters, ogres, wise men, fairies and witches - moralistic fables, a kind of fluid knowledge that is part of our childhood. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 132 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories What is the reason for their almost universal character and acceptance? The hallmark of these tales is that they are told by a wise woman (often grey haired, bespectacled) or grandmothers that have the experience of life. This gives the story much more weight while we are growing up. The fact that our grandmothers render them leaves us secure in the knowl- edge that they are tempered by wisdom and experience. What happens when two younger women set out to tell a story? Perhaps their biographies start to become more complicated. Two examples come from opposite corners of Asia and the Pacific. The first is of Shahrazad, the daughter of the vizier (royal advisor), betrothed to Shahryar, the Sassanad King (modern day Persia). She is the story teller of Tales From the Thousand and One Nights (Persian, Indian and Arab tales), armed with the challenge of ensuring that the King, con- vinced of the unfaithful character of women, does not murder her as he has all his wives before him. The second, Murasaki Shikubu, from Japan, wrote the world\u2019s first novel \u2013 the Tale of Genji. Murasaki\u2019s life is instruc- tive in that as a spinner of stories, she has to be very discrete or be negatively labelled a woman of solemn character who would find few suitors (Dalby 2000). As time goes by, her work gets recognized and she is promoted to a position in the court of the regent Michinga in the 11th century. Shahrazad: A beguiling storyteller Why is Shahrazad so interesting? Shahrazad makes a very brief entrance and exit in the \u2018The Tales\u2019. But her presence is pivotal to the stories. She enters the prologue after the King and his brother have had a rather disturbing illustration of the \u201ccunning\u201d of women (*). As opposed to this kind of subversive quality, Shahrazad appears to be possessed of many accomplishments and was versed in the wisdom of poets and legends of the ancient kings. She volunteers to marry the king, with the challenge that she will either die or be the cause of deliverance of the kingdom. Her resolute nature, fascinating stories and the king\u2019s sleeplessness offers a passport to this deliverance. The second fateful appearance takes place in the epilogue. After all of the 1001 stories are told by Shahrazad, she ap- peals to the king\u2019s nature to spare her the fate of all his other wives by bringing forward her young children. She projects her role as their mother as the reason to let her live. Whereupon the king tells her that she is \u201cpardoned\u201d already \u2013 be- cause she is \u201cchaste and tender, wise and eloquent\u201d. In all these episodes, the portrayal of Sharahzad is unusual, even if judged by modern day standards. If not an intellec- tual, it is her intelligence and wit that gets her out of the sticky corner. Yet throughout the nights, there are more sinister undercurrents about women and their minds in general. Women use their wit to trap men; their beauty and their sexuality is a lure in which men can become lost or foolish (**). The overwhelming impression after such representations reveals that beauty is de rigueur for most of the protagonists, and the hidden quality of their intelligence is their capacity to beguile. There is no unqualified sense of outpouring of approval for the women\u2019s intelligence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf57074d-b55d-4d10-a793-721a7dbb3f10": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf57074d-b55d-4d10-a793-721a7dbb3f10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66e74570e9fc8ef2d77fe356db22b3597ac64ceb4987823ca366439c3e4fa48b"}, "2": {"node_id": "20095878-a084-4d21-a459-43935bd7fb29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b08a6a75e7d0b8965ba86155354314bb1e2c8ccc12da3ee5fbb586f382120454"}}, "hash": "195ee3b4501ec60e1353502e197dec848563159e738f0ceb48e66fdc514629a3", "text": "There is no unqualified sense of outpouring of approval for the women\u2019s intelligence.

Murasaki, (a woman with a \u201cmale\u201d education who knows \u201cunladylike\u201d Chinese - something that may not endear her to potential suitors), keeps her writerly instincts discrete. The stories become famous through circulation among an intimate circle of friends. Though intelligent, her life is not without its travails. As a young woman, her father praises her intelligence, but laments that she was not born a man. Early on, Murasaki starts to master the waka (poems (***) and communicates with men (and women) she is acquainted with in a dialogue about seasons, emotions and other aspects of the human condition. She takes it much further by writing about Genji, a character from her imagination - a projected ideal romantic man, the sort that can\u2019t be found in real life. In doing so she constructs a certain prototype of masculinity, an individualized reflection rare for the time. In doing so, she provides a social commentary upon court life, which eventually elevates her to a high courtly station. Murasaki becomes a celebrated author, even lending an ear to the Regent Michinaga and serving the Empress. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 133 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories Negotiating spaces through Storytelling In a departure from the \u2018safe\u2019 character of benign grandmothers, Shaharzad and Murasaki provide a window into how women negotiate patriarchal spaces previously not trod upon or open before at the time. In these cases, story telling provides the entry point for reflections about unusual male-female relationships and social morality. Stories themselves provide the space for individualized reflections within an overwhelmingly male dominated context. The characters of both women can further be seen to illustrate the value of female literacy and education to present day audiences. Indi- viduals such as Murasaki achieved this competency despite paternal resistance and societal taboo. Story tellers like Sha- harzad were able to save their very lives through their abilities to record and project cleverly crafted tales. Both women achieved immortality through their ability to form part of the literary legacy of their time.

In the pre-Islamic days, widows were not allowed to remarry freely; they were treated as posses- sions by the family and not as respected community members. The Prophet, by example, taught us that women are to be respected, are individual beings, and have the right to live their lives freely. Gifted with tremendous intelligence, extraordinary wisdom, and a formidable memory, Aisha was one of the Prophet\u2019s most devoted pupils and followed his every action and example. She was skilled in medicine, poetry, mathematics, and speaking. Aisha was never too reserved or shy to ask questions. This in itself teaches us the importance of questioning that which we do not understand. As Muhammad\u2019s (pbuh) wife and close companion, she gained insight and knowledge Asia Pacific Human Development Network 134 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories such as no woman has ever acquired. She was an eyewitness to a number of revelations and had a clear idea of the cir- cumstances in which they were revealed. Aisha did not study in any school, college, or university, yet professors and students of literature, law, and Muslim history study her eloquent words. She not only possessed great knowledge but also was active in education and social reform. Under her care and guidance, Aisha took boys and girls (some of them orphans) into her custody and educated them. She was a pioneer in promoting education, and in particular the education of women. Aisha, the wife of Muhammad (pbuh) was also a brave, young, politically active woman who was present on a number of battlefields, including the battles of Badr, Uhud, and Al-Khandaq, three major battles that shifted the balance of power into the hands of the Muslims. Aisha participated by bringing water to the Muslim warriors and tending to the wounded. She also taught many things related to women, but many learned men, companions, and followers of the Prophet also benefited from her wisdom. It is the claim of Islamic scholars that without Aisha, half of the Ilm-I-Hadith (understand- ing and knowledge of the Hadith and Islam) would have perished. Because of the strength of her personality, she was a leader in every field in knowledge, in society, in politics and in war. Aisha helped to preserve and protect the ways and behaviour of Muhammad (pbhu), not only by embodying it herself, but also by teaching it to others. As a teacher, Aisha had a clear and persuasive manner of speech and her power of oration has been described in super- lative terms. Arwa Bin Zubair said, \u201cI did not find anyone more proficient than Aisha in the knowledge of the Qur\u2019an, the Commandments of Halal (lawful) and Haram (prohibited). That is why even senior companions of the Prophet used to consult Aisha in resolving intricate issues.\u201d Her significant example of being highly regarded, especially among the men, plays an important role in removing beyond a shadow of a doubt uncertainties regarding women to be inferior to men in aspects of faith or false notions condemning women from earning a high status in society, especially in terms of spiritual growth and morality. Aisha lived in honour for almost fifty years following the death of the Prophet. Most of this time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah. Furthermore, she memorized the Revelation, understood it, and had her own script of the Qur\u2019an written after the Prophet died. Aisha is deemed to be an authority for the interpretation of the Qur\u2019an and as a transmitter of hadith (sayings of the Prophet). Her narration of at least 2000 hadith (many of these pertaining to some of the most intimate aspects of personal behaviour) gave Muslims valuable insights into the Prophet\u2019s daily life and behaviour, thus preserving the Sunnah of Muhammad (pbuh). Aisha died in 678 C. E. and was buried beside other companions of the Prophet.

This was during a time when perceptions ruled that such participation would have a negative impact on the institution of families. Story of Mahaprajapathi Gothami Mahaprajapathi Gothami was the maternal aunt and foster mother of Prince Siddh\u0101rtha, who, after enlightenment, was known as Gautama Buddha. Having followed the Buddha\u2019s teachings, she wished to enter the holy order and ap- proached the Buddha, and requested permission to establish an order for women. This request was turned down by the Buddha, and although the request was made again a second and third time, the response remained negative. As \u2018Nirvana\u2019 or liberation was a gender neutral process, the Buddha did not at any time believe that women could not attain libera- tion. It is stated by the Buddha that \u201cbe it women, be it man, for whom such chariot doth wait, by the same karma into Nirvana\u2019s presence shall they come\u201d (Ratnapala n.d.). Joining the holy order entailed giving up a householder\u2019s life and leaving behind families. Therefore concerns had been raised regarding the fate of wives and children left behind by men who chose to become ascetics. Thus, Buddhist scholars attribute the Buddha\u2019s reluctance to establish a holy order for women to the possible adverse impact on families. However, Mahaprajapathi Gothami persisted and in her final at- tempt, she, along with five hundred Sakyan women, shaved their heads, wore yellow robes and followed the Buddha to Ves\u0101li on foot. During this time, she received the support of the public and many women joined her in support of her cause. Mahaprajapathi Gothami was able to demonstrate, by the support she received, that there would not be a negative perception of Buddhism by women joining the holy order. She approached Venerable Ananda, the chief disciple of the Buddha and requested his intervention and gained permission for the establishment of an order for women. At a time when women were relegated to an inferior position in Indian society, the establishment of a holy order for women was considered revolutionary. \u201cMahaprajapathi Gothami who inaugurated the Order of Bhikkhuni on a Binara Full Moon Poya [the holy order for women] proved to the world that women, too, had the capacity like men to attain the highest position in the religious way of life by attaining arhathood [enlightenment]\u201d (Wettimuny 2008). Her achieve- ment in establishing the equality of women in Buddhism is illustrated in the Buddha\u2019s words to her \u201cO Gothami perform a miracle in order to dispel the wrong views of those foolish men who are in doubt with regard to the spiritual attain- ments of women\u201d (Dhirasekera 1991, in Ratnapala n.d.).

(2) Why is it that folklore is mainly narrated by women \u2013 mothers, grandmothers, aunt or any female who shares in the caring of children? (3) To what extent does folklore bring out gender dimensions and why \u2013 is this the main purpose of folklore or is it inci- dental and perhaps an unintended consequence? I do not pretend to have answers to any of these questions. Folklore or folktales is a general term for a variety of traditional narrative. Folklore appears to be a cultural universal, common to basic and complex societies alike through time. Even the forms folklore takes are certainly similar from culture to culture, as comparative studies of themes and narrative ways have demonstrated. Folklore is essentially an oral tale told to children in particular, but also to adults (perhaps to illustrate the point of an argument or a discussion or just for entertainment). It is the body of expressive culture, including tales, music, dance, legends, oral history, proverbs, jokes, popular beliefs, customs, and so forth within a particular population comprising the traditions (including oral traditions) of that culture, subculture, or group. Clearly, folklore is an active cultural cate- gory rather than static classificatory items, and there are different genres (cultural modes of communication). Genres are not objective categories but become \u201cpart of a politics of interpretation in which meaning and the authority to propose and ascribe categories is contested\u201d (Schuman 1993: 71). The boundaries and interpretations of genres are flexible and inevitably shift over time with changing cultural and historical contexts, which may cause some folklore to disappear and others to metamorphose into different tales or genres. The task of the folklorists, then, is twofold: determining what the repertoire of available genre is within a particular culture or community, its category and organization (important to how it is told and the expressive form(s) it takes), and, importantly, who articulates these categories. I contend that women are the main players on both counts. A large fraction of folklore relates stories about the well-off and privileged (a prince, a princess), religious figures (a sadhu, rishi, saint, etc.), or an ordinary person with some admirable personality traits. The first two categories tell of high and lofty morals, of the triumph of good over evil, of bravery, virtue and patience. The last often portrays the desire to take revenge and deliver justice to the poor and low caste. The so-called \u201cbandit queen,\u201d Phoolan Devi of India is a good example (*). Within a given culture, folklore contains its own grammar (a grammar of folklore), \u201ca cultural affirmation of the com- munication rules that govern the expression of complex messages within the cultural context\u201d (Ben-Amos 1976: 225). When Flueckiger (1996) began her field work for her book, done in Chhattisgarha, India, she asked the women \u201cwhat kinds of songs do you sing at weddings,\u201d using the common Hindi words \u201cgeet\u201d and \u201cgaanaa\u201d for songs. The ques- tion drew blank stares or negative responses. It was only later she understood that the Chhattisgarhi usage of the word \u201cgaanaa\u201d without being placed in relationship to a particular genre of song (such as \u201cVeehaa geet\u201d) is limited to male, professional singing. Folklore may be based on legends, myths or truths elaborately embellished, and this \u201cconcoction\u201d may vary from place to place within the same country, even though they contain the same moral. In this sense, folklore is an imagined past that holds lessons for young minds; it is an instrument of socialization, of \u201cculturing\u201d innate tendencies. Probably out- side of western societies and until recently, folklore has not been part of any gender discourse. While folklore tells of deeds and misdeeds of both men and women, their primary purpose was to transmit the \u201cmoral compass\u201d from genera- tion to generation, not to convey messages on gender equality or how many genders there are. This is still the case in many poor countries. Anthropologists, evolutionary psychologists and human ethologists, amongst others, have written much on folklore: how it fits into the larger cultural ethos of societies, its role in cultural transmission through time and its importance to environmental adaption and human behaviour.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3553e74f-3010-4cc1-87a9-f024acc6e3d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3553e74f-3010-4cc1-87a9-f024acc6e3d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4395cee4443eef136322690d08e8b5fb0df0dfe0293f4017729e70ba252fa5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb460de6-3a5b-4ea7-84b8-963a7f0e9335", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80430dc67e0c05ac6f5b646df7e9fe96ac5982369dd051a815b9f0f1c4ec15ae"}}, "hash": "69baa1eac8f190beeaa7fb728987a6de0f6e6af119cfbb345663e2392f7c09fb", "text": "Because of our different biological endowments and psychological inclinations, the result of tens of thousand of years of evolution in a hostile environment (the open African savannah and elsewhere), a particular division of labour has emerged that is still present in varying degrees in all societies throughout history (that is, the allocation of certain roles to each sex).

There is thus an evolutionary significance and explanation for folklore. Folklore is not merely grandmotherly tales or tales told mostly by grandmothers or the elderly. Folklore is not an entity unto itself, but part of the larger cultural ethos and economic and ecological milieu. It is but an element in women\u2019s repertoire used to socialize and nurture children and transmit cultural values intergenerationally. Folklore gets the attention of children, quiets them down, and perhaps even scares them. Indeed, sometimes the more gruesome folklores are deliberately told to frighten kids \u2013 get them not to do or say something or go somewhere. It can be a \u201csilent whip\u201d as well as an exhilarating experience that expands and shapes young minds. It seems to me, then, that the primary aim of folklore is not to convey ideas about sex or gender or partake in the gender discourse; indeed, folklore predates the gender discourse by many millennia. This lack of awareness about gender con- cerns is evident from the fact that there\u2019s no word for gender in many languages, especially those that are more ancient. That said, folklore tells tales about both sexes, but the overriding purpose is not so much about sex as it is about the moral and transmission content. This deconstruction \u2013 to borrow a post-modernist term - of folklore is necessary to delink it from the gender discourse, which it in fact subsumes in its repertoire.

(*) Note on India\u2019s Bandit Queen India\u2019s Bandit Queen, popularly known as Phoolan Devi, is an unusual story of female courage and daring. It is a true story based on a real person, who was born in India to the lowest caste. One day, the deeds of Phoolan Devi will surely pass into the treasury of folklore. Phoolan Devi endured cruel poverty, survived the humiliation of an abusive marriage, the savage killing of her bandit- lover, and a horrifying gang rape to claim retribution for herself and all low-caste women of the Indian plains. In a three- year campaign that rocked the government, she delivered justice to rape victims and stole from the rich to give to the poor before negotiating surrender on her own terms. Throughout her years of imprisonment without trial, Phoolan Devi remained a beacon of hope for the poor and the downtrodden. In 1996, amidst both popular support and media contro- versy, she was elected to the Indian Parliament. On July 25th, 2001, Phoolan Devi was shot dead in Delhi. The identity of her killers is unknown. Millions have found the power and scope of Phoolan Devi's myth irresistible.

Vihara Maha Devi, daughter of King Kalyanatissa, became famous as she sacrificed her life to the ocean to safeguard the country. It was said Vihara Maha Devi\u2019s father, King Kalyanatissa, murdered a high priest in a temple by pouring boiling oil on him. As a result, the weather changed. The sea became rough and a tsunami situation developed. The sea flooded the land and many lives were lost and people were displaced. The king consulted the astrologer to seek a remedy. The astrologer insisted on sacrificing a beautiful virgin to the sea to ward off the evil effects. It was said that Vihara Maha Devi was the most beautiful virgin but the king was reluctant to sacrifice his daughter to the ocean. Vihara Maha Devi came forward herself, and bravely offered to be sacrificed to the ocean. She was placed in a heavily decorated boat and let loose upon the sea and it drifted to the southern part of the country. People of the southern part of the country, spotting the boat, reported it to the ruler of the southern area. He visited the place and seeing an extremely beautiful lady, decided to make her his queen. Later she was known as the Ocean Queen because of \u2018Samudra Devi.\u2019 But she failed to bear children for some time and she used to visit the temple often and offer her assistance to Buddhist monks. She used to approach a sick, elderly chief monk. She assisted him with medicine and alms and made a request of him, asking him to be re-born as her son. Soon after the monk\u2019s death, she became pregnant and it was a popular notion that the Buddhist monk was re-born as her first son Gamunu. Vihara Maha Devi had a desire to wage war with invaders in the country and she brought up her son with the determina- tion of fulfilling this vision. When her son was fully trained and the forces were ready, she accompanied the army with her son to the battlefield. Vihara Maha Devi used her beauty to overpower the enemy. In the battle at Anuradhapura, Vihara Maha Devi used her wisdom to plan the war and was successful in driving the enemy from the country. After the victory, Vihara Maha Devi faded from the scene but her wisdom and willpower was behind the victory. Gamunu, her son, ascended the throne but nothing was mentioned about Vihara Maha Devi\u2019s life or work after that. Her son was the great King Dutugamunu. Most historical chronicles of Sri Lanka were written by Buddhist monks and as a result, the histories of women were rarely documented.

In the quest to make their mark and show their worth, some went to the extent of taking on the persona or garb of a man to exert authority and to be accepted. To take their place in history side by side with men, these women broke traditions, norms and myths. Razia Sultana (1205-1240) was the first female Muslim ruler of South Asia.

The Rani of Jhansi (1835-1858), wife of the Maharaja of Jhansi became a national heroine and was seen as the epitome of female bravery in India. Because of her bravery, courage, and wisdom and her progressive views on women's empow- erment in 19th century India, and due to her sacrifices, she became an icon of Indian Independence. To fight the British, Rani of Jhansi assembled a voluntary army of brave rebels and this army included women. Rani died in the battle of Gwalior (1858). In the report of the battle for Gwalior, General Sir Hugh Rose commented that the Rani had been \"the bravest and the best\" of the rebels. Chand Bibi (1550-1599), also known as Chand Kahtun was a Muslim from the Indian subcontinent, and a warrior. She acted as the Regent of Bijaopur (1580-90) and the Regent of Ahmednagar (1596-99). Chand Bibi is best known for de- fending Ahmednagar against the Mughal forces of the powerful Emperor Akbar. Chand Bibi was well versed in several languages including Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Marathi, and Kannada. The bravery and stories of these exceptional women weave a tale to be told to prove that women are no lesser than men. These women rulers and warriors led their countries and armies to victory, established just administrations and achieved formidable tasks not attributed to women in their day and age.

Gandhi is among those who put her forward as a woman in possession of the right to chose her own path, refuse a life of hedonism, and find liberation in nonviolent resistance. According to Ramesh, Mira was one of the early Indian feminists, though she certainly did not see herself as such. Translations of her poems are available in several European languages.

She was a very versatile genius and a magnanimous soul. Her life has a singular charm, with extraordinary beauty and marvel\u201d \u2013 Swami Sivananda. Source http://www.poetseers.org/the_poetseers/mirabai Introduction Her name has many variations: Mira, Mira Bai, Mirabai, Meera, Meera Bai. Her date of birth is not known with any degree of precision, but is generally thought to be between 1403 to 1506, although 1498, the year Columbus is said to have discovered the Americas, is believed to be the year in which she was born. Mira died in 1547, although some think it was 1546. This Hindu mystical poetess, whose compositions are popular throughout India and wherever in the world people of Indian origin have made their home, composed between 200 to 1300 prayerful songs called bhajans (some put the number at around 5,000). These bhajans are in the bhakti tradition1 and most passionately praise Bhagavan Krishna; they express a powerful and infectious intensity, the spiritual fervour of an aspirant mad with love for God. In their propensity of emotions and bhakti, Mira\u2019s songs are unmatched and have a deep capacity to put one in a spiritual mood. The refrain of her life's song was: 'Mine is the preserver of cows who upholds mountain and no one else'. Mira is undoubtedly the most respected and most loved poetess in India. Little is Known Little is known about the lives of Hindu saints and sages. Indians were not in the habit of writing biographies and auto- biographies, but, more importantly, Hindu saints and sages are completely detached from the work they do, and they do it to benefit all humanity; they have no interest in material things. While these saints engage in work, it is disinterested work for the welfare of all creatures. Precise information about the life of Mira is thus hard to come by and any attempt to locate the historical Mira is fraught with difficulties. What is known and widely acceptable is simple: Mira transcends history and her life cannot be pieced together into a sequential chain of events. So history\u2019s strange predicament is that there is not much about Mira on record, yet history cannot write her off from its pages. Based on her poetry and the writings of others, historians have managed to piece together the broad strands of her life, but the details are still controversial. Here we focus only on a few aspects of her life, including her devotion to Bhagavan Krishna and her poetry. Mira was born in Kudki, a little village near Merta, Rajasthan. When she was three years old, a wandering sadhu came to her home and, for reasons unknown, gave Mira\u2019s father a Krishna doll.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57acc86e-d833-4b18-b453-e0132565e58c": {"__data__": {"id_": "57acc86e-d833-4b18-b453-e0132565e58c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b43163e869a0a63973e1bb4f0a5c6f5eef0f4d9da8b88c63b2a9dff33bec84c"}, "2": {"node_id": "e837ef5e-86d4-4441-970c-674192a91336", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7aee1b49e1f98dcafc5b9a2c45104b71847397457e28e7816aeda113e0ec09b7"}}, "hash": "82416b086887a9c04a41cd2cadba1e33b43b3378d162d06c2792fd24502300c4", "text": "Mira immediately fell in love with the doll \u2013 love at first sight.

Thus, from an early age, Mira felt an irresistible attraction and devotion to Sri Krishna. Despite all the trials and tribulations, all the difficult times life threw at her, Mira, like Bishma of the Indian epic the Mahabharat, never wavered from that resolve.

With a child\u2019s innocence, she asked her mother: \u201cWho will be my husband?\u201d Half seriously, the mother replied: \u201cMira, you have your husband already. He is Sri Krishna.\u201d Mira\u2019s mother was very supportive of her little girl\u2019s blossoming religious tendencies, but passed away while the child was still young. The day came when Mira had to get married. Her marriage was arranged to Prince Bhoj Raj in 1516, who was the el- dest son of an influential Hindu family. While the marriage brought Mira high status, she did not have any appetite for worldly attractions and the comforts of the palace. Indeed, whenever the opportunity arose, she escaped from her daily duties to spend time in prayer and to meditate on her beloved deity, Bhagavan Krishna. Says she in her bhajans \u201cNoth- ing is really mine\u201d: \u201cMira is absorbed in contemplation of Krishna. She is with God and all is well!\u201d Deep in her soul she felt a spontaneous and overwhelming love for Bhagavan Krishna. In testimony, her poem speaks of the unbearable pangs of separation whenever she cannot contemplate on Krishna: Only he who knows the bitterness of love Who has deeply felt its pangs. When you are in trouble No one comes near you: When fortune smiles All come to share the joy Love shows no external wounds But the pain pervades every pore Devotee Mira offers her body As a sacrifice to Giridhara for ever After marriage to Bhoj Raj, Mira\u2019s life took two different but conflicting directions: the devotional to which her es- sential nature, her swabhav to use the Sanskrit term, inclined; and the incidental, which as a human, she was obliged to follow. Unfortunately, going to temples, singing and dancing, her spiritual intensity and religious inclinations, were against traditions and damaged the status of her husband\u2019s family. The family felt Mira\u2019s only duty was to her husband and the good image of the family. The poet bowed not to traditions, and was subjected to great pain and suffering. She refused to renounce her devotion to Krishna for in her mind she was married to Him. No amount of punishment could break her will; she willingly and laughingly submitted herself to the punishment and bore them with fortitude. Nothing could break her obsessive divine love and devotion to Krishna. As she sings in \u201cUnbreakable\u201d \u2013 Unbreakable, O Lord Is the love That binds me to You: Like a diamond, It breaks the hammer that strikes it. My heart goes into You As the polish goes into the gold. As the lotus lives in its water, I live in You. Like the bird That gazes all night At the passing moon, I have lost myself dwelling in You. O my Beloved - Return. The situation worsened after the death of Mira\u2019s worldly husband, Bhoj Raj. Deeply rooted in the traditions of the time, she was commanded to commit sati: self-immolation on the husband\u2019s pyre. Mira refused and explained her refusal simply: I am betrothed to Krishna and Krishna alone is my husband. If my husband is still alive, indeed, is undying, why must I commit sati? Then life became intolerable for the poet, as, among other things, her husband\u2019s family tried to kill her on at least two occasions: with a venomous snake and a poisoned drink. Legend has it that the grace of Bhagavan Krishna saved her on both occasions. Following the advice of sadhus (learned men and saints), Mira left to live as a wandering sanyasin on the streets of Vr- indaban, a city associated with the early life of Krishna, when he lived among the Gopis. Here she was free to worship Giridhara (Govinda) to her heart\u2019s content. She spent her time singing bhajans and in ecstatic communion with Krishna.

Poet Supreme Mira herself wrote nothing. All of her bhajans, devotional poetry, are in the Vaishnava2 tradition. Followers of this tradition, including Mirabai, worship the personal aspect of the Ultimate Reality, known as Saguna Brahman. That is, Brahman with attributes. Saguna Brahman is the creator, sustainer and controller of the universe. Theologically, Vaish- navites believe that between ataman and paramatma (roughly speaking, the Sanskrit \u201cParama\u201d has the same meaning as the Latin \u201cTrans\u201d), the physical body is only a wall (maya). Once the cycle of birth and death (Samsara3) comes to an end the atman and the paramatman merge - just as a pot filled with water is placed in a river and on breaking the water inside (atman) merges with that of the river (paramatman). Saguna Brahman cannot be limited by one form and is therefore worshipped by Hindus in both its male and female forms. As the male aspect, Saguna Brahman is called by various Sanskrit names, such as Ishvara, Parameshvara, Para- matma, Maheshvara, and Purusha. As the female aspect, Hindus refer to Saguna Brahman by various names, too, such as Divine Mother, Durga and Kali. This is the context in which Mira composed and sang her soul-piercing bhajans, chanted and danced, meditated and got lost in ecstatic delights. Traditionally, a Mirabai poem is called a pada, a term used by 14th century preachers for a small spiritual song. The song is usually composed in simple rhythms and carries a refrain within itself. Her collection of songs is called a Padavali. Mira\u2019s devotional poetry \u2013 and she wrote nothing else \u2013 was set, naturally, in the context of her time when Indian love poetry was abundantly written, recited and sung. The genius of Mira was to use this device as a metaphor to express her deepest emotions for her ishta-devata (Krishna). She composed and sang not in Sanskrit or classical Hindi but in Vraja-bhasha, a dialect of Hindi spoken in and around Vrindavan (the childhood home of Krishna) occasionally mixed with Rajasthani. The most distinguishing feature of Mira\u2019s devotional poetry is a simple one: it plainly and simply sings of love for Krishna, who is closer to her heart than family and friends. Krishna is her husband, lover (not in the physical sense), lord and master. Her bhajans sings of complete surrender to Krishna: Do not leave me alone Do not leave me alone, a helpless woman. My strength, my crown, I am empty of virtues, You, the ocean of them My heart's music, you help me In my world-crossing. You protected the king of the elephants. You dissolve the fear of the terrified. Where can I go? Save my honour For I have dedicated myself to you And now there is no one else for me. And again: Nothing is really mine Nothing is really mine except Krishna. O my parents, I have searched the world And found nothing worthy of love. Hence I am a stranger amidst my kinfolk And an exile from their company, Since I seek the companionship of holy men There alone do I feel happy, In the world I only weep.

You offered me a cup of poison Which I drank with joy. Mira is absorbed in contemplation of Krishna, She is with God and all is well! Thus, the longing for union - to merge - with Krishna is the predominant theme of her poetry. Mira wants to be \u201ccoloured with the colour of dusk,\u201d dusk being the symbolic colour of Krishna.

But what does it have to do with gender? Let me recount the ways in which Mira was an early Indian feminist: \ufffd She vividly demonstrated to women in particular that divinity is a personal affair; that there is no gatekeeper be- tween people and God. Anyone has the freedom to worship as s/he pleases. The body may be broken and impris- oned, but the mind cannot \u2013 and there is no reason to break and imprison the body in the first place. \ufffd She saw the essential oneness in all. There is a story that, when Mira was in Vrindavan, a respected spiritual mas- ter refused to talk to her because she was a woman. Mira\u2019s response was profound: there was only one real man in Vrindavan \u2013 Krishna; everyone else was a gopi of Krishna. I see this as another moral argument for equality: gender equality is a moral position, not a substantive or empirical one. \ufffd In a world packed with lies, liars and hypocrites, Mira stood as a beacon of truth and gave hope and strength in the search for truth. She demonstrated that that the search for truth was a moral undertaking open to anyone, male and female \ufffd She rebelled against customs and traditions that were unjust and unjustified. To do this one does not have to discard religion, which is, in fact, a source of strength and courage. All one has to do is to discard sex-biased practices \ufffd She showed that women are equally intelligent as men: after all, she composed hundreds of devotional poems in her head, without writing a single word. It took the West hundreds of years and countless pseudo-scientific and scientific articles and books to realize this simple truth (around the mid-20th century). \u201cO My Mind\u201d In bringing this piece to a close, I bow to Mirabai, a saint, philosopher and poet. More importantly, as one (Mira) who has seen unity in diversity \u2013 the multiplicity of shapes and forms, animate and inanimate, merging into the all-pervading One, who is unchanging, the substratum of all that is, beginless, undying, eternal.

Asia Pacific Human Development Network 146 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories Anuradha Rajivan and Rohini Kohli wrote: Facilitator's note: Anuradha Rajivan and Rohini Kohli reflect on the importance of exploring modern ideas of gender through the lens of folk narratives. These tales are not products of an intellectual tradition but rather a reflection of popular imagination. They carry the potential to alter social thinking, but not always in terms dictated by the predomi- nant environment. In doing so, they bring the likelihood of new forms of dissent against oppressive norms. Dear Network Members, Gender and the Genius of Tales from the Past In this contribution, we look at the age-old genius of folk-tales and explore the potential of reflecting them within a gender discourse. The enduring appeal of legends, fables and folktales lies in the many different ways they can be interpreted and understood. At the surface level, there may be the obvious entertainment value of a story. But there are also functional, moral or psychological dimensions to the narrative. And, further, depending upon the context, how the story is narrated, who the narrator is, and who the audience is, folktales are open to different shades of understanding. Open stories, diverse interpretations Narrators have been women and men, rich and poor, the subaltern. In fact story tellers are drawn from diverse back- grounds, from every section of society and culture. In that sense, telling stories seems to be a universal phenomenon. The skill of a narrator can instil layers of meaning, hint at latent connotations, or even reverse the patent interpretation. Adults and children can draw different meanings from them, as can the rich and the poor, or men and women. The absence of universal interpretations allows this genre to be relevant in different contexts and can even take on shades of genius. In most human societies, oral culture includes rhymes, riddles, jokes, songs, ghost stories, fables, cautionary tales, gossip, old wives tales, rural folktales and urban legends. Jesters, for example, through humour, could get away with much in challenging dominant mores or powerful people, and often upheld the dignity of the marginalized. Using dreams was another technique to push boundaries. The inter-generational transmission of stories (handed down from story-tellers to listeners) provides a clue to one of their social functions. Earlier generations of listeners, in turn, become storytellers for the next generation. Many folk- tales draw upon the origin myths of a community (for example, Australian aboriginal dream-time songs). Often myths can show different qualities of men and women in the community or why nature exists in this or that form (Melanesian myths are one example (*); the Indian story of Dhruv and how he became the evening star). Folktales can be seen as the collective reservoir for a community to transmit values about nature or social life, the lives of kings and queens as well as ordinary men and women. Not all stories are about great people or grand events. Often foolishness, wit, or everyday wisdom make up the brick and mortar of renditions. There are many stories of lazy men and capable women, as well as the other way round. Hidden resistances An aspect of special interest is the \u201csubliminal\u201d or hidden potential to present alternative views and provide entry-points for resistance. By their very nature, stories provide the story-teller a place for the imagination to project ideas that test the limits of traditional or ascribed roles \u2013 using imagination to create a fictional world where the usual norms don\u2019t ap- ply.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1728e213-c640-47b8-973d-23c31dfdafbc": {"__data__": {"id_": "1728e213-c640-47b8-973d-23c31dfdafbc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ad940c9d3d1c08c29e0b84ceecc6060064b731b80cc8179a3fa7fc14eb38c43"}, "2": {"node_id": "03566b41-23ef-41f9-a91b-4912fb5644bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32d1d448cbc0673d58e923c05ff42edf3f573ccab8345aa03bc7d14bd0710d66"}}, "hash": "e739ff2c269cd5336a304c69493ae202e9935c4cd05323f5c5798c3802fc6e27", "text": "Sultana\u2019s Dream, a story by Begum Rokeya first published in 1905, is one such.

With best regards, Anuradha and Rohini Anuradha Rajivan, Regional Programme Coordinator Rohini Kohli, HDR Analyst Human Development Report Unit UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific, Colombo Office Notes (*)The people of Tangu from the north coast of New Guinea have a myth about a certain woman who had no husband to protect her. One day, she leaves her daughter alone and a stranger comes and kills the child and buries the body. The woman has a dream that reveals the whereabouts of the grave and she recovers the body carrying it in her string bag from village to village until she finds a place to bury it as well as a man, the younger of two brothers, who will marry her. She has two sons by her new husband. Later she visits the daughter's grave. While parting some coconut fronds she finds salt water flowing from the grave with fish swimming in the water. The woman takes some water and a small fish as food for her family. The results are miracu- lous. Overnight, her son grows to manhood. Her husband's elder brother is envious and wants the same for his son so she directs him to the grave. Instead of taking a small fish, the foolish man seizes the large eel-like one. Immediately, the ground quakes and water thunders forth from under the ground, forming the sea and separating brother from brother. Source (http://www.janeresture.com/melanesia_myths/png.htm).

Dear Network Members, Reading Malaysian Legends Through Gender Lens Malaysia is a modern Islamic country with a pre-Islamic past that included the practice of animism, Hinduism, and Buddhism (sometimes in an overlap) in various parts of the country. Islam was more formally adopted in the Malay Peninsula by the 12th Century when the first Malay ruler converted to Islam. Prior to that, coastal parts of the peninsula adopted Islam as they came into contact with Indian Muslim and Arab traders. The first Muslim ruler in the peninsula was Sultan Muzaffar Shah of Kedah, the northernmost state of Malaysia which borders Thailand. Kedah is the setting of one of the legends that I have presented below (Mahsuri from the island of Langkawi). The legend of Mahsuri has elements of Hinduism and Islam. Mahsuri is penalised for a friendship with a man who is not her husband (shades of the Muslim law about khalwat or adultery).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caaa915d-b3c9-4cf5-a6d6-5f3cc371e5a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "caaa915d-b3c9-4cf5-a6d6-5f3cc371e5a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a49b28572e7b2cb480c75f66434f703247a4ecd2e5b98713ce1ca5f627328c72"}, "2": {"node_id": "001dc8bd-8b47-45eb-aa59-d9f0029a24d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6453479737e3cb34edfcf5535dda93cc7768c12e7eb4b35817ee3964b782267c"}}, "hash": "8be4a35bc3be74caecad58dd7bc066683b27ce4f8dc056dd1d942101d84f5f9c", "text": "Her blood is shown to be white at the time that she is punished for the false charge of adultery (shades of the Hindu myth of Ram and Sita where Sita is falsely accused of impurity for having been kidnapped by the evil king Ravana.

What is interesting about both legends is their portrayal of gender or cultural stereotypes (which supports Anuradha Rajivan\u2019s and Rohini Kohli\u2019s points about the \u201cfunctional, moral or psychological dimensions to the narrative\u201d). Both legends paint a picture that reinforces cultural or moral values. The power of the women in the two legends is controlled by dominant males (e.g. fathers, husbands or men enraptured by these women). This furthers cultural stereotypes, such Asia Pacific Human Development Network 148 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories as how men control the power that is given to women, the punishment of women who step outside the bounds of \u201cac- cepted\u201d cultural behaviour (Mahsuri is punished for having a friendship with a man who is not her husband while her husband is away at war.

The women in both the legends have gender-based \u201cpositive\u201d attributes e.g. their great beauty, talent and intelligence. However these attributes are seen to be their downfall rather than their strength because they attract undue attention or jealousy from those around them. These legends unfortunately do not reinforce the image of strong, powerful, indepen- dent women living happy lives (when in reality, women in traditional or rural societies of Sarawak and Kedah are strong and respected for their contributions to the economic and emotional strength of their families and societies). Maybe these legends were developed to be a cautionary tale for women in these societies to not aspire to be even more powerful than they are already or to justify why men were ceded so much power within these societies. What has helped both legends to endure in Malaysia is that they are used to explain particular phenomenon experienced in their states. For Langkawi, Mahsuri\u2019s curse is used to explain why it did not prosper throughout much of the 18th century until the late 1980s. For Sarawak, the curse of the King of Kayangan on his daughters is used to explain the existence of a particular mountain range north of the state capital, Kuching. Here are the two legends: The Legend of Mahsuri Mahsuri was a beautiful young Malay woman who lived on the island of Langkawi in the northernmost Malaysian state of Kedah. She was considered to be the most beautiful woman on the island and the wife of a brave warrior, Wan Derus. While her husband was away serving the chieftain of Langkawi, Dato Karma Jaya, in a battle, she was left to fend for herself. She befriended a young man, Deraman, and their close friendship led others in her village to assume that they were having an affair. Some versions of the legend claim that trouble for Mahsuri came either from her mother-in-law or others in the village who were jealous of her great beauty and decided to spread malicious rumours about her honour. Eventually the rumours grew to the point where the villagers took their false accusations to Dato Karma Jaya. He was so taken in by the accusations that he sentenced Mahsuri to death. Her pleas of innocence were ignored and she was tied to a tree and stabbed to death at Padang Hangus (Hangus Field). As proof of her innocence against the charge of adultery, white blood flowed from her stab wounds. With her dying breath, Mahsuri cursed Langkawi to suffer seven generations of bad luck. Makam Mahsuri, her tomb, is a tourist attraction in Langkawi. Many Langkawi locals believe the legend to be true as, following Mahsuri's tragic death, Langkawi suffered the Siamese invasion of 1821 when its rice paddy fields and grana- ries were torched. Dato Karma Jaya and his family were killed during the invasion and there were many years of failed crops following. Grains that look like burnt rice grains can supposedly still be found at Padang Matsirat. Langawi\u2019s current economic boom and fame as a tourist draw are supposed to have only come to pass seven generations after Mahsuri\u2019s death.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c26f25fb-ca8e-4d0b-9311-7f258a7640d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c26f25fb-ca8e-4d0b-9311-7f258a7640d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5646cbea48e114ecdf78fcc761c8d4f9caf2b6f0110259d08662074612f0c5e9"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bb68629-ce7d-40d2-8753-f1c4261601fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81892ddf421f2ee6d72fd32a705736dec371d9d64edfab629e3491a3708ea07f"}}, "hash": "133bf416ae5c89b741e8f20fc29748215cb8e4aa9db2fb6478e464424b174c56", "text": "In 1987 it was granted tax-free status by the Malaysian Government to encourage tourism.

There was an ongoing conflict between two villages in Sarawak: Pasir Kuning and Pasir Putih. The two sisters were sent by their father to Sarawak to restore peace. There was one condition imposed by their father, the King of Kayangan \u2013 they must never quarrel with each other.

They reflect on the importance of exploring modern ideas of gender through the lens of folk narratives. Many such examples do not belong to an official intellectual tradition with its disciplines and options; many folk narratives demonstrate popular imagination. As such, they remain relatively free of ideological terms that the predominant social environment dictates. They introduce the likelihood of new forms of dissent against oppressive norms, which transfers a potential to shift social thinking. Is this, in part, why all societies throughout history enjoy folk tales? Does this go some way towards answering other questions raised, e.g. are women the main singers of tales? What are the implications for equity and equality, consider- ing the fact that the gender discourse is of much more recent emergence? Accompanying some of these questions was the story of Vihara Maha Devi. She is a woman who, for a time, before norms relegated her again to invisibility, plays an unconventional, prominent role as a warrior in a Buddhist classic saga of war and peace.

These historical female figures are Razia Sultana, Rani of Jhansi and Chand Bibi. Folk narratives are relatively free in expressing popular imagination but there are constraints. Questions focused on the problem of narrative control. This involves the uses of the narrative voice, which is a particularly fertile component in a song. Control over \u2018voice\u2019 shapes the audiences\u2019 options about what society expects them to take from a story. Many tales typically send a message through an acceptably simple and \u2018normal\u2019 medium: i.e. the idea of Grandmother\u2019s voice. Thus, when younger women seek to change this, they encounter the gatekeepers. We see this in two examples of young- Asia Pacific Human Development Network 150 TABLE OF CONTENTS Folklore and Historical Stories er writers who present more multilayered roles as woman, hero, and narrator: Shahrazad, the teller of the 'One Thousand and One Nights' stories, and 11th century Japanese novelist Murasaki Shikubu, writer of 'The Tale of Genji'. Beyond constraints, folkloric songs often provide the core of silenced histories. They are not simply imaginative but link with actual events. We see an example in an account of Aisha and her role during the early years of Islam as the young wife of Prophet Muhammad. A second example involves Mahaprajapathi Gothami. She fights for the rights of women to be ordained in the Buddhist way of life against the prevailing idea that women\u2019s participation would have a negative impact on the institution of families. We read an account of three stateswomen and commanders-in-chief who tackled formidable challenges not typically attributed to women in the history of South Asia. We read a contemporary poem about legendary women. Siv Cedering\u2019s song is about the forgotten, uncelebrated at- tainments of numerous women philosophers and scientists. We also read of a woman whose life and work resonates with contemporary Indians and various European audiences. Apart from the exquisite quality of her work, this fact is distinctive because Mirabai is a 16th century woman in a tradition of seer poets. Her story shows a woman in possession of the right to choose her own path, who finds liberation in nonviolent resistance. Mirabai was one of the early Indian feminists though she certainly did not see herself as such. Two legends from Malaysia were also shared. They paint a picture that reinforces cultural or moral values \u2013 the power of the women in the two legends is controlled by dominant males (e.g. fathers, husbands or men enraptured by these women). These legends unfortunately do not reinforce the image of strong, powerful, independent women. In reality, however, women in traditional or rural societies of Sarawak and Kedah are strong and respected for their contributions to the economic and emotional strength of their families and societies.

Bhutan: Estimate of Life Expectancy for Thimphu using the Adjusted Chiang Method 27 i The Case of Bhutan Abstract The human development index, or HDI as it is popularly called, measures progress in the human condition along three dimensions: a long and healthy life, knowledge and command over resources to enjoy a decent standard of living. But the HDI is not the same as the concept of human de- velopment. It does not, for example, capture the varied and multi-faceted dimensions of human development, including the range of freedoms, cultural diversity and many intangible choices that are difficult to quantify and measure. Unlike the GDP, which is a money metric that measures only the value of goods and services, the HDI goes beyond gauging material wellbeing. It is this broader perspective that makes the HDI a powerful advocacy tool to expand and deepen the debate about the state of human condition and to fine-tune national policies with human development concerns. National HDIs, which are published in the UNDP global Human Development Reports (HDRs), present a broad picture of the state of people\u2019s lives in a particular country. To obtain a picture at the sub-national level (for example, among regions and population groups, such as gender or ethnicity), sub-national HDIs are required, which draw attention to local and localized disparities in human development. Among Asia-Pacific countries, India has used sub-national HDRs and sub-national HDIs (at the state and district levels) to influence decentralized, integrated planning by the central government; some states are even using the district level HDIs as an input for policy changes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20a24396-e4c5-4f6a-aa18-044a40f869fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "20a24396-e4c5-4f6a-aa18-044a40f869fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a748547d38cd25a02c28d5ab1f0266689f2b69708978d2fd4889c8d56675af4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "69e2ab3b-1261-45bd-a793-c4063c7e42d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c747969d6440a83fbfbfad7f998462ed93387c0371f87efc3d25a37e71d2f3e"}}, "hash": "6ed317c66e2da6c867650eb6cd3fc52bdbae2184021d89848481647db3e91b74", "text": "Besides India, other Asia-Pacific countries, including Cambodia and Indonesia, have produced sub- national HDRs and HDIs.

We must begin by thanking Tshering Pem of the UNDP Bhutan Country Office, who initiated and coordinated the mission to Bhutan and organized various meetings with government officials. These officials kindly allowed us to pester them about the availability and quality of the required data, which they promptly supplied, and provided valuable feedback at all stages of the indexing exercise. We owe them a debt of gratitude. Aspects of the methodology used in this paper were discussed with T. Palanivel prior to the mission, and we thank him for his time and insights. The Knowledge Resources Committee, KRC, of the UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific, Co- lombo Office, discussed the paper, substantively and at length. The members of the KRC who reviewed this paper were Omar Noman, T. Palanivel, Anuradha Rajivan, Yubaraj Kathiawada, Pra- mod Kumar, Manisha Mishra, and Kirsty Hayes. The authors presented the paper and responded to queries as necessary. The feedback from the KRC members was useful and we have reflected them to varying extent in the final paper. Pradeepa Malkanthi assisted with the data and Elena Borsatti and Manoja Wickramarathne did a fine job with the referencing and also provided editorial support. We thank them both. We take this opportunity to express our profound thanks to Rohini Kohli who coordinated the design and production of this paper in record time. This paper would have remained buried among the stacks of unpublished research work done by the Human Development Report Unit over the years were it not for the encouragement, guidance and feedback from Anuradha Rajivan, who heads the Unit. We would like to acknowledge our debt to her. While colleagues provided intellectual and logistical support, all errors in the paper are the respon- sibility of the authors. iii The Case of Bhutan Abbreviations ACE Annual Consumption Expenditure ADLIT Adult Literacy ADPOP Adult Population ALR Adult Literacy Rate BLSS Bhutan Living Standard Survey CGENR Combined Gross Enrolment Ratio ENR Enrolment Ratio GDP Gross Domestic Product GER Gross Enrolment Ratio GNH Gross National Happiness GNHC Gross National Happiness Commission GNP Gross National Product HD Human Development HDI Human Development Index HDI-AM HDI \u2013 Age-wise Method HDI-CM HDI \u2013 Chiang Method HDR Human Development Report KRC Knowledge Resources Committee LE Life Expectancy MPCE Monthly Per Capita Expenditure NGO Non-Governmental Organisation NSB National Statistics Bureau PCGDP Per Capita Gross Domestic Product POPAG Population Age Group PPP Purchasing Power Parity SEPHO South East England Public Health Observatory UK ONS UK Office of National Statistics iv Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information 1 The Case of Bhutan I. Introduction The popularity of the human development index (HDI) as a rough indicator of the human condi- tion, and possibly as a guide to resource alloca- tion, has motivated many governments to cal- culate sub-national HDIs. Disaggregated data, indicators and indices, especially at the sub- national level, quickly draw attention to glar- ing human deficits, fuel advocacy and stimulate more effective planning and monitoring of so- cio-economic activities and results.Sub-national HDIs, could, ultimately, motivate policies that are more finely aligned with human develop- ment concerns. In the Asia-Pacific region, Cambodia, India, In- donesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand have pre- pared sub-national human development reports, including calculations of HDIs, at the state, pro- vincial, district and even at the local levels. Sev- eral states in India have calculated HDIs at the district level and some have progressed further to calculate HDIs at the local level of the gover- nance structure. While the calculation of national and sub-na- tional HDIs is a simple exercise that requires no particular set of mathematical skills, it does require a good dataset that is sufficiently disag- gregated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9840df09-e3e5-45b5-a3a2-b563d7ba55e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9840df09-e3e5-45b5-a3a2-b563d7ba55e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36a53c29d3f8cd5e6e579dbb0e4ece9c355a364d2bebe87c4bef868dcc15c891"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb38f840-7fe8-4010-8746-e09e4b54e811", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "807465ce66917b062e81fdbbaca811100c24b10dd1dfd5e4646812ac5e603be6"}}, "hash": "03c0e93c88e3a7520877cb97d46f5a7b4dae8bb7ae3f72ae76fd1e67321b738a", "text": "This paper takes up the challenge of estimating HDIs for all 20 dzongkhags (prov- inces) of Bhutan in the presence of the lack of data on per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and life expectancy at the sub-national level.1 An important reason for this exercise was to supplement the socio-economic profiles of the 20 dzongkhags, which the National Statistics Bureau (NSB) and Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) of the Royal Govern- ment of Bhutan were in the process of devel- oping.

Section II of the paper briefly touches upon the concept of human development and its associ- ated indicator, the HDI. Section III discusses the use of sub-national HDIs as a critical tool for measuring the state of human development at local level. Section IV identifies measurement challenges, especially data gaps, and discusses methodological issues: ways to calculate life expectancy for small populations and to esti- mate per capita GDP at the sub-national level. The requisite dataset for the estimation of HDIs for all 20 dzongkhags in Bhutan is compiled in Section V. The results of the estimation exercise are presented and discussed in Section VI. The paper closes in Section VII with an overall dis- cussion and lessons learned. II. Human Development and the Human Development Index Human Development (HD) is a process of en- hancing people\u2019s choices. In principle, these choices can be infinite and can change over time. But at all levels of development and for all societies, the three essential choices are for people to lead a long and healthy life, acquire knowledge and have command over the neces- sary resources for a decent standard of living. The unavailability of these essential choices could mean the loss of many other opportuni- ties. Yet these three central choices do not com- prise the sum-total of human development. Ad- ditional choices, highly valued by many, range from political, economic and social freedom to opportunities for creativity and productivity, and the enjoyment of human rights, dignity and self-respect. Human development thus has two sides: the for- mation of human capabilities such as improved health, knowledge and skills on the one hand, 1 The mission comprised two staff members, Ramesh Gampat and Niranjan Sarangi, from the Human Development Report Unit of the UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific, Colombo Office. The mission visited Bhutan from 28 June to 6 July 2008. 2 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information and the use people make of their acquired ca- pabilities for leisure, productivity or cultural, social and political activity, on the other. Con- siderable human frustrations can result if the gap between capabilities and opportunities is not finely balanced. Two key points may be noted here. First, hu- man development is not the same as economic growth. The latter, taken as an expansion of out- put/income, is perhaps the most popular way of measuring the material progress of nations. But it is a means to an end, not an end in itself. For example, income could be used to purchase es- sential drugs, develop inter-continental ballistic missiles and plant land mines, fuel civil wars or even to land humans on the moon. But human well-being depends upon both the level of in- come and how that income is used \u2013 that is, the quality of growth is no less important than the quantity of growth. One of the founders of the Human Development Report (HDR), Mahbub ul Haq frames the issue in this manner: \u201c \u2026 the use of income by a society is just as important as the generation of income itself, or that income expansion leads to much less human satisfaction in a virtual political prison or cultural void than in a more liberal political and economic envi- ronment\u201d (Haq 1995: 14). Second, high per capita income or rapid growth can coexist with stark human deprivations unless that growth \u2018lifts all boats\u2019. For example, Brazil had a per capita income of US$8,402 (PPP US$) in 2005 and an HDI of 0.800, while Botswana had a higher per capita income of US$12,387 but an HDI of only 0.654. Equity thus becomes crucial and is particularly central to Asia in the context of rising inequality (as gauged by the Gini coefficient) despite robust and sustained growth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1bce2d6-e980-4c42-b6bd-ded6e3687329": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1bce2d6-e980-4c42-b6bd-ded6e3687329", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "617f2488e9988a53c8bd47f3dba213ca32f2e37836f1706abfb2fa8add6ea0c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "24285aea-1bd2-4367-9b0d-a485f68c57fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37c9ea4ee72330f4c58697a3ffe6a94c7a9c800faa371280ba6738481414b673"}}, "hash": "c6180b0d2ad6775bc88913b2dbc9ac66d359ebc6ea5d5c2d06dff1f18b16d6b5", "text": "Clearly, growth does not automatically bring greater equality, including gender equal- ity, which has direct implications for human de- velopment.

Even after 20 years, the hu- man development paradigm is yet to make a large presence in academia, where it is still seen as too \u2018soft\u2019 to equip freshly-minted PhDs with marketable skills. Moreover, while the central idea of human development revolves around choice, choice brings with it a paradox in some countries, especially the rich ones. For example, if one is confronted with a bewildering range of ice cream, as would be the case if one steps into a modern supermarket, one may be unable to choose or will probably make a choice that does not optimize one\u2019s welfare. The information on brand, price, expiry date, ingredients, nutrition- al content and so on is simply overwhelming to process so quickly. When one finally makes a choice, there is no guarantee that it is the best choice. Another critique is that the various freedoms have not been well-integrated into the human development paradigm; the focus has been mostly on the three dimensions of the HDI that are easily quantifiable and thus measurable. Finally, there are conceptual issues: individual vs. societal, the apparent inconsistency between quantification, optimisation and the wider un- derstanding of wellbeing, and the philosophical issue of the role of morality in the human devel- opment paradigm. It is necessary to note that the HDI is not the same as human development. The latter is a multi-dimensional concept, a whole new para- digm of development, while the former is one possible way of measuring progress of the hu- man condition in three dimensions (a new para- digm naturally requires a new measure, which was a powerful motivation for the creation of the HDI). The three dimensions of the HDI are: \u2022 A long and healthy life as gauged by life expectancy at birth. \u2022 Knowledge as gauged by adult literacy and combined gross enrolment ratio (GER). \u2022 Command over resources to enjoy a decent standard of living as gauged by GDP per capita in PPP terms. Clearly, the HDI does not capture the varied and multi-faceted dimensions of human devel- opment, including the range of freedoms, cul- tural diversity and many intangible choices that are difficult to measure. Consequently, the HDI cannot be equated with human development for it captures but a partial view of a holistic and multi-dimensional phenomenon. Yet, the HDI is 3 The Case of Bhutan a popular index, probably because of its power to chart the progress of nations in multi-dimen- sional terms and hence its appeal as an advo- cacy tool. The HDI quickly grabs the attention of policy makers, the media, academia, lobby- ing groups and NGOs. It can help to expand and deepen the debate about the state of the human condition (from global, to regional, to national, to sub-national) and to align policies with human development concerns. The fact that countries around the world so eagerly await the release of the yearly HDI attests to its popularity. Why was there a need for a new index? Exist- ing measures have not been designed to gauge the state human progress as envisaged by the new paradigm. But designing a new measure presented a considerable challenge. There were conceptual issues and were methodological and data issues that had to be surmounted.2 More- over, the new measure should be simple, easy to calculate and easy to understand. The compro- mise between technicality and simplicity meant that the new index could suffer the major short- comings of existing measures, but it would con- vey a broader view of progress. Thus was born the HDI at the beginning of the \u2018revolution\u2019 that increasingly led people to look at development differently: not as a commodity, but as a means to human fulfillment. Just as per capita GDP/ GNP is a way of representing the economic con- ditions of a given country, the HDI is shorthand for mapping the human condition. It is this a broader measure and more information-laden than GDP/GNP per capita. And yet it is simple to calculate and understand, which probably explains its popularity as a powerful advocacy tool. The global Human Development Report (HDR) produced by UNDP calculates the HDI at the national level for most countries of the world \u2013 177 countries in the 2007/2008 HDR.

Interestingly, Bhutan has developed an inde- pendent measure of the human condition \u2013 the Gross National Happiness (GNH) index, which is not the same as the HDI or the concept of human development. Drawing heavily on non- material values, the GNH is intended to capture progress under Bhutan\u2019s model of development which rests on four core values: (1) respecting cultural traditions; (2) protecting the natural en- vironment; (3) ensuring equitable distribution of wealth and resources; and (4) maintaining responsive governance. This is as fine an en- deavor as any, for it shows that Bhutan clearly understands the limitation of measures that fo- cus on means (not ends) and has developed a measure that is contextualized and tailored to its own values and philosophy. III. Why Sub-National HDIs? The HDI is based on three dimensions that roughly capture the state of people\u2019s lives in a country or a specific geographical area of the country in the case of the sub-national HDI. The tradition, as practiced in the UNDP global Human Development Reports, is to calculate the HDI at the national level, which means that macro-level data are used. But such data is highly aggregative and may hide variations at the sub-national level. For example, the adult literacy rate of Bhutan is 52.8 per cent, but there is considerable variation across provinces, vary- ing from a low of 39.2 per cent in Gasa to a high of 68.9 per cent in Thimphu. Similarly, GDP per capita, or life expectancy, could mask signifi- cant differences across regions or groups within a country. For these reasons, national HDIs are not a substitute for sub-national ones (by state, province, community), nor are they very use- ful for comparative assessments of groups of people (by gender or by ethnicity, for example). Like per capita GDP, the HDI fails to capture variations at a more disaggregated level. Indeed, most macro-indicators (or indices) in a country\u2019s national accounts are averages that are too ag- gregative to be representative of all population groups or areas in a country. While national averages are useful for cross- country comparison, more disaggregated data 2 Several principles guided the development of the new index, which became known as the Human Development Index. Such an index (1) must measure the central core of human development which is enlarging people\u2019s choices; (2) include only a limited number of variables to keep the index simple and manageable; (3) must be a composite index instead of several separate indices; (4) must cover both social and economic choices; (5) its coverage and methodology must be kept very flexible; (6) while the index can only be as good as the data fed into it, lack of reliable and up-to-date data should not be allowed in inhibit the emergence of the new index (Haq 1995). 4 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information are necessary if the focus is on in-country com- parison (for example, among regions and popu- lation groups, such as gender or ethnic groups). If the necessary dataset is available, the HDI can be calculated at sub-national levels to convey a broader, more insightful and analytical view of living conditions as depicted by the three dimen- sions of the index: it is a graphic and insight- ful way to identify and draw attention to local and localised disparities in human development across both regions and different population groups. For this reason, sub-national HDIs can be an even more powerful tool than national HDIs in the hands of politicians and the media. Small wonder, then, that many countries are now calculating the HDI at the sub-national level even if they do not produce a sub-national HDR. Among Asia-Pacific countries, India has used sub-national HDRs and sub-national HDIs (at the state and district levels) to influence de- centralised, integrated planning by the central government; some states are even using the dis- trict level HDI as an input for policy changes. For example, the Government of Karnataka, a Southern Indian State, used social sector indica- tors, including those that go into the preparation of the HDI, for identifying backward regions in the State.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f36239f2-95f3-46d9-a685-e101154d49cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f36239f2-95f3-46d9-a685-e101154d49cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74b6487a2da2a2599a49d415519afda6a36b5779f37c8e6d2a50947f0cef7888"}, "2": {"node_id": "27595735-445a-4451-a4dd-ba3e6382da13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef48bbdd4c73278e0e03766f80bdbeab99cc338b343c50bdd38f760c1b3fbc8d"}}, "hash": "ece500a459c2b1935d8046ec30ee45effa6d5485e629b7a3c294f62d2e7eac95", "text": "The Government of Maharashtra launched a human development mission in three districts with low HDI values, and special bud- getary support is being provided to these \u2018back- ward\u2019 regions.

IV. Estimating Sub-National HDIs: Issues and Challenges Data and Indicators The data requirements for the computation of the HDI, especially at the sub-national level, are, as noted, pose the most difficult challenge. In fact, data rather than conceptual issues are the chief constraint to the calculation of the HDI at the sub-national level. Many countries have the necessary data for the construction of education index, but not for GDP and life expectancy. Bhu- tan is a typical example of this problem, and we developed ways to estimate life expectancy (in addition to the standard method) and per capita GDP, both of which are discussed in this section of the paper. To be feasible for inclusion in the sub-national HDI, an indicator must be: \u2022 Comparable across sub-national units, which thus presumes a standard methodology \u2022 Available for all sub-national units and over time, if a temporal comparison is desired \u2022 Of reasonable quality in terms of accuracy and representativeness \u2022 Valid or based on identifiable criteria that ef- fectively captures what the indicator intended to measure. For example, adult literacy rate shows the percentage of literates in the age group of 15 and above in a population, and cannot be approximated by youth literacy \u2022 Policy-relevant or based on criteria that can influence decision-makers and policies direct- ly or indirectly. \u2022 Based on data that is globally comparable, if calculation of national HDI is the goal, but this is not a strict requirement for sub-national HDIs. Often, sub-national data are not available or are not of reasonable quality for two critical rea- sons. First, statistical systems in many countries are usually not geared towards the production of such disaggregated data. Second, small sample estimates are not reliable for sub-national data. For example, the national life expectancy esti- mate for Bhutan is reliable, but estimates at the dzongkhag-level may not be reliable because of small-sample bias, especially for populations below 5,000. Accuracy is also a concern for pro- vincial GDP estimates owing to the difficulties of segregating output by location. The reason is 5 The Case of Bhutan a simple one: GDP does not count semi-finished goods produced by an industry that may be lo- cated in different regions/provinces/areas of the country. Instead, it counts only the finished products of the industry. So, for example, inter- mediate goods that are used to make bicycles or rickshaws are not counted in GDP regardless of where in the country they are produced; only the fully assembled bicycles and rickshaws are counted. Nevertheless, GDP estimate at the pro- vincial or even lower level for calculating the HDI has been attempted in India, for example.3 In many cases, however, the costs and risk of inaccuracy of such estimates are often unaccept- able and proxy estimates are used instead for calculating sub-national HDIs. Life Expectancy: Concept and Overview Life expectancy 4 refers to the average number of years a person of a given age and sex can expect to live, if current age-specific and sex- specific death rates continue to apply through- out the person\u2019s lifetime. More technically, life expectancy is the mean expectation of life at birth, e0, or at a particular age or age interval. Of course, prediction of death is rarely accurate and the range of uncertainty is very wide. A number of factors affect a person\u2019s life span, including gender 5, genetics, state of health, life- style, accidents, disease, medical advances, nat- ural disasters, conflict and war. Life expectancy is dependent heavily upon the criteria used to select the group6 and life expectancy at birth is highly sensitive to the death rate in the first year of life. Nevertheless, it is possible to predict the number of survivors each year with a surprising degree of confidence\u2013but this requires a rela- tively large group of people. Life expectancy at birth, or the expected aver- age life span of a person at birth, is sometimes used as an overall indicator of a country\u2019s (or geographical area) population overall health and physical well-being.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f362d3a-818d-426e-aab8-d781630a9fdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f362d3a-818d-426e-aab8-d781630a9fdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc1ee9b3e17e12670d54ab93d673116714d5c57641c30790f35a2936376e2cd6"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd6f8c19-88f7-4c82-a677-77699b3e7437", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "116b57d60c07dbfcf435b910aca9b7920e3a22046faed4fac5c72d1f339c3079"}}, "hash": "e89359cbfefaf279171ea822ba8bee5934f2334ae899dee278ada8e5ee4e45e1", "text": "Griffiths and Fitzpat- rick (2001) observed that life expectancy \u201c \u2026 is a summary measure of mortality at every age that allows comparisons to be made between areas and time periods without the need to as- sume a particular standard population.\u201d The UK Government (2001), for example, is apparently of the view that life expectancy is the best sum- mary measure of health outcomes and uses it as an indicator of geographical inequalities in health (Toson and Baker 2003).

That said, it is important to note that life expec- tancy is an entirely hypothetical construct. Thus, 3 See technical notes on the HDI in Madhya Pradesh HDR 2007 (Government of Madhya Pradesh 2007: 139-144). 4 Actuarial science is the term used for the mathematics of mortality and life expectancy, named after the profession of actuaries that devel- oped early life tables for commercial use. Life expectancy is a common term for the more technical one expectation of life, which is the average expected total years of life. 5 It is a known empirical fact that women tend to have higher life expectancies than men. At around 2007, the worldwide life expectancy of both males and females was 64.3 years. For males alone, it was 62.7 years and 66 years for females, a difference of more than three years (Rosenberg 2007). The sex difference in life expectancy ranges from about 4-6 years in North America and Europe to more than 13 years in Russia. Sex differences in life expectancy are evident even before birth. In the womb, male fetuses have a higher mortality rate \u2013 males are con- ceived at a ratio of 124 males/100 females, but by birth the ratio is only 105 males/100 females. For premature babies (below two pounds), females have a higher survival rate. Interestingly, the sex ratio tends to equalise at around age 13, which is close to menarche, suggesting a potential reproductive-equilibrium explanation that is probably of evolutionary significance. Women are better able to cope with blood loss whether it is from periodic menstruation or trauma. By age 110, 90 per cent of the population is female; by age 112, the figure is 92 per cent. Yet the reasons for the sex difference in life expectancy are still hotly debated and are far from settled. Standard arguments tend to favor environmental factors: men, on average, are employed in more dangerous occupations (factories, the military, etc), are more prone to ac- cidents, more likely to partake in high-risk sports (\u2018train surfing,\u2019 roller-board skating, skyscraper climbing, etc); they also tend to consume more tobacco, alcohol and dangerous drugs and are more likely to die from lung cancer, tuberculosis and cirrhosis of the liver. Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (for example, automotive accidents) or intentional (suicide, violence, war) (WHO 2004). However, these arguments are not fully sufficient to explain observed differences in life expectancy between the sexes: even for known socio-environmental effects on mortality, females still have longer life expectancy. Some argue that women are biologically superior to men and thus live longer. Others, adopting a more evolutionary perspective, note that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifesta- tion of the general rule seen in all animal species: larger individuals tend to have shorter life spans (Stindl 2004; Samaras and Elrick 2002; Samaras et al. 2003); body size is a function of both nature (genetics) and nurture (environment, including nutrition). Yet, contrary to what some argue, people who are better nourished are taller and tend to live longer. 6 Provided that the requisite data is available, life expectancy can be calculated for specific sub-population by, for example, ethnicity, race or gender or a combination of these characteristics. 6 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information life expectancy at birth may not represent the age at which the average child born today is likely to die, since mortality probabilities are likely to change over time. By the time the child reaches 40, for example, the child born today might be more or less likely to die that year than a per- son aged 40 today is of dying this year. Like all summary statistics, life expectancy is an aver- age and it does not measure the distribution of either mortality risk within one person\u2019s life, or between different sub-populations in a country. Clearly, two countries with the same life expec- tancy at birth may not necessarily have the same mortality probability at every age. Moreover, while life expectancy of the general population may appear quite high, it could mask consider- able variations among sub-populations.

Life expectancy at age x, denoted by ex, is then the summation of the probabilities of surviving to every age. Algebraically: ex = \u03a3t\u03c1x = \u03a3ttpxqx+t \u221e \u221e t=1 t=0 t = years lived and \u221e is taken as the highest age achieved (\u03c9). Because age is rounded down to the last birthday, on average people live half a year beyond their final birthday; so half a year is added to the life expectancy to come up with the \u2018full\u2019 life expectancy. Life expectancy can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from ages 0 to positive infinity (the maximum lifespan, sometimes called omega (\u03c9))8. To estimate life expectancy, it is necessary to construct a life table. The accuracy of the life table depends on the completeness of the data. Starting with a cohort of individuals of any giv- en size (say, N newborns), it is possible to calcu- late how many would survive to each age, which paves the way for calculating life expectancy at any age. Data on the proportion of persons of each age who die is usually taken from national censuses and international sources. However, the vital registration systems that officially register birth and death in many poor countries are often weak and may be non-existent in geographically remote and mountainous areas. In such cases, many births and death go unrecorded. To fill the gap, different agencies use different techniques to correct for missing or non-existent data. The World Bank uses household surveys, which col- lects data on recent births and death, as well as demographic projections, to obtain a picture of the mortality structure of countries where the necessary data are missing. Two sets of data are required to construct a life table. First, population by age bands: where mortality and population data are available on a yearly basis, complete life tables can be pro- duced; otherwise, abridged life tables9, with age intervals of 5 or 10 years, are commonly produced. Second, age-specific death rates: for example, if five per cent of the people alive at their 70th birthday die before their 71st birthday, then the age-specific death rate at age 70 is 5 per cent. All other columns in the table are com- puted from these two sets of data. Life tables are of two kinds: cohort and current. A cohort life table captures the actual mortality experience of a cohort of persons from the birth (or other events such as brain tumor) of the first person, to the death of the last. But cohort life tables are not very useful for studying current life expectancies even though they are useful for other purposes, such as studying patient survival after treatment. For our purposes, cohort life ta- bles suffer from two shortcomings. First, cohort life tables would require following members of the cohort until they are all dead \u2013 possibly as long as 100 years. Second, a cohort life table reflects historical conditions that are probably no longer valid. A current life table provides a cross-sectional picture of the age-specific mortality experience of a population during a specified time period. 7 This is also discussed and illustrated in Newell (1994) and Shyrock and Siegel (1976). 8 The formula is: e0 (0,t)= \u03c9 \u222b l(a,t) da, where l (a,t) is the life table probability at time t of surviving from birth to age a, and \u03c9 is the highest age attained (Vaupel and Romo 2002). 9 Abridged life tables refer to life tables that contain data for age groups instead of single-year ages. 0 7 The Case of Bhutan The age-specific mortality rates are applied to a hypothetical cohort of newborns to calculate their life expectancy. For other age bands, life expectancy is calculated in a similar manner. For example, life expectancy for the age band 25 is calculated by applying the age-specific mortality rate to the hypothetical cohort in this age interval. Complete life tables have life ex- pectancies broken down by each year of life. In some cases, the breakdown could be even finer as in the under-one year of age interval where most infant deaths occur, with many deaths oc- curring during the first 28 days of life (Toson and Baker 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d87d9c46-d2f3-4ef8-a8f6-948d0207c3be": {"__data__": {"id_": "d87d9c46-d2f3-4ef8-a8f6-948d0207c3be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33fb9703f4a9cb55faca54b919117d65cb5692dd2b04a078e5b2a0ff276b8c36"}, "2": {"node_id": "2110c8ab-0f21-4250-b867-a33ee3d27203", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae32f90671df601bc60493578e7102fa0981031677ddcfd21ebbdb816efd904d"}}, "hash": "0a4ee1fbc55bf73eedb32556e98cc99b4628be7eb58cd3d75f0f959eaadd1637", "text": "Abridged life tables have large age intervals, usually 3-5 or even 10-year age bands.

However, the methodology breaks down when it is applied to small areas\u2013where the population is small or the number of deaths are too few in a single year, and remain so even if the data are aggregated over a three-year period. So the critical issue is to find a method that produces reasonably ac- curate estimates for small populations. Griffiths and Fitzpatrick (2001) produced life ta- bles for local authorities for the UK, but exclud- ed certain areas, including the Isle of Scilly and the City of London, which had populations of 2,100 and 7,100 respectively. They argued that \u2018there are too few deaths there in a three-year period to make analysis meaningful\u2019 at the ward level. Silcocks et al. (2001) used a population of 256,000 to study the sampling distribution and utility of life expectancy at the district level and below. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics, using a revised Chiang methodology, produces life expectancies for local authority and health authority areas.10 Others employ the Silcocks methodology to produce life expectan- cies for small areas.11 According to SEPHO (2005), the Chiang meth- odology produces better estimate for life expec- tancy for small populations. Models that use 5-year age bands up to 85+ generated the best life expectancy estimates, which have a normal distribution even for small populations. The as- sociated confidence intervals are also valid. In- terestingly, zero deaths in one or more age bands do not have a significant effect on the standard error of the life expectancy estimate. \u201c \u2026 the presence of age bands with no deaths is likely to have little impact on the calculation of standard errors for population of 5,000 and over\u201d (Toson and Baker 2003: 17). However, a non-zero val- ue in the final age band is required; otherwise, a zero value leads to an infinite life expectancy and the calculation of the variance, and thus the standard error fails. In this case-the final age band-it is recommended that the appropriate na- tional mortality rate for this age band could be used. It was also shown that the adjusted Chiang method produces reliable life expectancy esti- mates for a population size 5,000 and above. \u2018As the population size decreases through, es- pecially under 5,000 the standard error tends to be underestimated\u2019 (Toson and Baker 2003: 13), and life expectancy tends to be overestimated. A more comprehensive review of methods for estimating life expectancy for small popula- tions is beyond the scope of this paper. How- ever, we will now provide an intuitive feel of the mechanics involved in the calculations by illustrating the adjusted Chiang method (Chiang 1968; Newell 1994), which is widely used, for example, by the UK Office of National Statis- tics to calculate life expectancies at the electoral ward level where the mean population is about 5,800 (Toson and Baker 2003). The Chiang Method Because of data problems and the size of popu- lation distribution in Bhutan by dzongkhag, this paper adopts two approaches to estimate life expectancy: small-area estimate employing the Chiang method and an Age-wise method devel- oped by the authors. This section of the paper provides details on the adjusted Chiang meth- od, and we draw liberally on Toson and Baker (2003) and SEPHO (2005). The adjusted Chiang 10 Based on their evaluation, Eayres and Williams (2004:248) concluded that \u2018LEs estimated using the Chiang and Silcocks methodologies showed good agreement,\u2019 but still recommended the Chiang methodology for calculating small areas life expectancies in England.Two reasons are offered: (a) it produces better estimates when compared to the Government Actuaries Department (GAD) figures; and (b) it is consistent with the methodology used by UK Office for National Statistics for larger populations. 11 More to the point, this study aimed to \u2018investigate the usefulness of life expectancy as a summary measure of mortality at health-authority level or below, and to derive a formula for the variance of life expectancy results\u2019 (Toson and Baker 2003: 7).

The age at the beginning of the of the age interval i is denoted by xi. The final age interval does not have an upper age limit and is thus open-ended: xi \u2264 x for i = \u03c9 The choice of the final age band is crucial to the accuracy of the life expectancy estimates, which is increasingly overestimated as population size decreases. The effect is greatest when the final age band is 95+. Eayres and Williams (2004) propose that the final age band should be 85+ for small populations. Interval width: the width in years of the age in- terval i, denoted by ni. Fraction of last age interval of life: individuals in a hypothetical cohort who die during the age intervals do not all die at either the start of the end of the interval. Instead, they die at different time during the age interval. Now, the fraction of the last age interval of life is the average fraction of the age interval that individuals live before they die. It is denoted by ai. As deaths are usu- ally assumed to be evenly distributed during the age interval, this column usually has the fraction 0.5. However, this is not a tenable assumption for individuals in <1 age group as most deaths in this age group occur in the perinatal and neo- natal periods. In this case, the fraction is set to 0.1.

The prob- ability of dying is denoted by qi and the prob- ability of surviving by pi. Both the probability of dying or surviving is calculated from the mortal- ity rate Mi. The life table can then be completed by applying either the probability of dying or surviving to the hypothetical cohort, as these are alternative but equivalent approaches: pi = 1-qi Note that the probability of dying in the final age band = 1, so the probability of surviving = 0. That is: pi = 1, qi = 0 for i = \u03c9 Now there are many ways to estimate the prob- ability of survival during an age interval, and this constitutes a significant difference among methodologies. The Chiang methodology pos- tulates that for the hypothetical cohort deaths of members within an age interval are evenly distributed, which explains why this methodol- ogy is also known as the linear method. So if the number alive at the beginning of the age interval is li and the number of deaths during the interval is di, then the probability of death qi is: qi = di /li By manipulating and substituting terms, we get: 9 The Case of Bhutan qi = ni Mi 1+(1-ai) niMi The above formula is for complete life tables. The probability of dying for the abridged life table using the Chiang methodology is: qi = 2Mi /(2+Mi ) for i = 1,2 \u2026 \u03c9 -1.

As with the numbers surviving, there are two alternative but equivalent ways of arriving at the numbers dy- ing in the interval: (1) apply the probability of dying in the interval to the number of persons alive at the start of the age interval; and (2) sub- tract the number of persons alive at the begin- ning of the age interval from the number alive at the start of the next age interval. Since the final age interval has no upper limit, all persons alive at the start of the interval will die during it. Algebraically: di = li \u2013 li+1 or di = liqi for i = 0,1, \u2026\u03c9 - 1 di = li for i = \u03c9 Number of years lived in the interval: equals the product of the number of person-years lived during the interval i times the number of people in the hypothetical cohort who are alive at the start of the interval, symbolized by Li. However, this is not valid for the final age interval, since it is open-ended. The Chiang method assumes that the probability of survival in the final age band is zero, which, by definition, leads to a zero variance for this age group. If the variance is important, as it is in small populations, then the Chiang assumption of zero survival for the final age group is not valid. In fact, Silcocks et al (2001) argued that life expectancy for the fi- nal age band is not dependent upon the prob- ability of survival, but on the mean length of survival. The UK ONS methodology, which we have used for the calculation of life expectancy in Bhutan, assumes that survival in this age band is exponential. In other words, the number of survivors decreases each year at the age-specific mortality rate (Mi, i = \u03c9). This assumption, it may be noted, affects only the estimate of the standard error for this age interval and not life expectancy itself.14 Algebraically, the above can be written as: Li = ni(li-di) + ainidi or Li = ni(li+1+aidi) for i = 0, 1, 2, \u2026 \u03c9 Li = li/Mi for i = \u03c9 Total number of years lived beyond the start of interval: the total number of person years that will be lived by people of the hypothetical co- hort who are alive at the start of the age interval i, denoted by Ti. In other words, it is the sum- mation of the number of years lived in the given age interval and all subsequent age intervals. That is: 13 Silcocks\u2019s methodology for estimating the probability of survival during an age interval differs from that of Chiang. While Chiang uses a linear method, Silcocks assumes that the mortality rate is constant throughout the age interval. The result is that survival is exponential. That is, the probability of survival is: pi = exp(-ni Mi ), where Mi is the average annual mortality rate: Mi = Di /Pi . For a complete life table, the Silcocks method is less accurate than the Chiang method. This is because the assumption of a constant mortality rate throughout the age interval is not valid for human populations. In such populations, mortality risks for age intervals after childhood increases slowly, but at a rate that is consistent with the linear method. In fact, the Chiang method generated more accurate estimates of life expectancy than the Silcocks method (SEPHO 2005). 14 The UK ONS refers to this as the Chiang II methodology (Toson and Baker 2003). 10 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information Ti = Li + Li+1 + \u2026 +L\u03c9 or Ti = Ti+1 + Li for i = 0, 1,2, \u2026 \u03c9 Observed expectation of life at the start of in- terval: the average number of years that each member of the cohort alive at the start of the interval can expect to live, denoted by ei.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddd74fa7-3ec3-4125-9d90-2b4dac60e026": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddd74fa7-3ec3-4125-9d90-2b4dac60e026", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e4cf3bbcc4dd787a5d2e780aa68133e0f7197d78c8e7801e2aa4160ee15d868"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c560ee7-02ec-43f4-9c69-0aad0cd5fa47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "063d5f4a476d0d15d1fe047062243575af33f698742ab57a4afc4f00fe0b717c"}}, "hash": "a9e33f3f576dd0b0dee21553b8277825391c73c5d525a4bbe1e14497960dab2c", "text": "It is, in other words, the quotient of the total number of years lived beyond the start of the interval and the number of persons alive at the start of the interval.

However, it is helpful to have confidence inter- vals given the problems of estimating life ex- pectancy for small populations, especially those below 5,000. If the estimate of life expectancy is normally distributed, the confidence interval can be calculated in the usual way: ei \u00b11.96Sei where Sei is the standard error of ei given by \u221aS\u00b2 ei . In age bands where there are no deaths, the stan- dard error will be underestimated because the contribution to the variance for those intervals with zero deaths will be zero. As the popula- tion becomes increasingly small, zero deaths in some age intervals is a real possibility. However, Toson and Baker (2003) demonstrated that the presence of age intervals with zero deaths is not likely to have a significant effect on the calcula- tion of the standard error for populations 5,000 and above. For populations smaller than this, even a very small value (0.03) tends to overesti- mate the standard error, while leaving age bands with zero deaths leads to an underestimation of the standard error. Note, too, that zero deaths in the final age band causes the Chiang method for calculating the variance to fail. If no correc- tion is done for the final age interval, the result would be \u2018an infinite LE\u2019 (Eayres and Williams 2004: 248). For estimating life expectancy by dzongkhag, we have used the spreadsheet15 used by the Brit- ish Office for National Statistics (ONS) to esti- mate life expectancy at the electoral ward level. Because the mean population at the ward level is less than 6,000, the spreadsheet enables the calculation expectancy at birth with a 95 per cent confidence interval. The Age-wise Method This is a rather simple method, perhaps less ro- bust than the Chiang method, that was used to generate quick estimates of life expectancy for Bhutan by dzongkhags. This method, which we have dubbed the Age-wise method, is, in effect, a three-step procedure that requires two pieces of data: (a) national life expectancy at birth, and (b) the proportion of Bhutan\u2019s population by dzongkhag (or geographical area, more gener- ally) that is above national life expectancy at birth. A simple assumption is at the basis of the Age-wise method: dzongkhags with a higher share of their population above the national life expectancy at birth tend to have a higher life ex- pectancy than dzongkhags with a lower share of their population above national life expectancy. The three steps involved in the Age-wise meth- od are as follows: 1. Calculate the proportion of population aged 66 (Bhutan\u2019s 2005 life expectancy at birth) and above in each dzongkhag (Xdi) to ob- tain the percentage of the population in each dzongkhag that is above the national life ex- pectancy at birth, which was 66 years. 2. Take the median value (m) of the results from step one (20 data points, one for each dzong- khag), which is the average of the 10th and 11th values in the ordered distribution. 3. Adjust Xdi for each dzongkhag if they are above or below the median value (m) to ob- tain life expectancy at birth for that dzong- khag. The adjustment procedure is: \u2022 If Xdi > m (a higher proportion of population 15 Available at [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=10626] (last accessed on 7 April 2009).

The theoretical justification for the Age-wise method rests on the underlying assumption as stated above. If a larger percentage of people in province Y live longer than the national life expectancy at birth than people in province Z, then people in province Y will have a longer life expectancy than people in province Z. This is a reasonable assumption, but why use the me- dian value, or any value for that matter, of the distribution (which comprises the percentage of people in each province above national life expectancy \u2013 the Xdi) to adjust life expectancy for a given province? An adjustment is neces- sary since it is highly probable that a certain percentage of the people in each province will have (provincial) life expectancy greater than the national life expectancy. If this is in fact the case, then the national life expectancy will have to be higher than the value used to arrive at the Xdi for each dzongkhag, which creates a vicious trap. So the issue is not if an adjustment factor has to be used, but what the adjustment factor should be. We settled on the median of the Xdi distribution because it is more representative of the distribution. Estimating Per Capita GDP GDP per capita at the dzongkhag level is not available from the national accounts. The esti- mate we employ for per capita GDP by dzong- khag is based on three indicators: (1) monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) for each dzongkhag as given by BLSS 2007; (2) population (POP) for each dzongkhag taken from the Population Census of 2005; and (3) GDP of Bhutan at the national level as per the National Accounts data. The steps for estimating per capita GDP for the 20 dzongkhags are given below: 1. Calculate total annual consumption expendi- ture (ACE) of each dzongkhag: ACEdi=12*MPCEdi*POPdi where di refers to i th dzongkhang and i =1 to 20. 2. Calculate annual consumption expenditure of each dzongkhag (Sdi) as a share of total con- sumption for all dzongkhags: Sdi=ACEdi/\u2211ACEdi 3. Apply these shares (Sdi) to the GDP of Bhu- tan (GDPB) to obtain GDP for each dzong- khag (GDPdi): GDPdi= Sdi* GDPB 4. Obtain per capita GDP for each dzongkhag (PCGDPdi) by dividing the GDPdi by the pop- ulation of each dzongkhag (POPdi ): PCGDPdi= GDPdi/ POPdi V. Sub-National HDIs for Bhutan: The Dataset Bhutan is a landlocked country nestled at the foothills of the Himalayas, but also positioned between India and China, the two economic powerhouses of Asia. Its population, estimated at around 0.6 million in 2005, is scattered across the 20 dzongkhags (provinces) that comprises the country. About 16 per cent of the country\u2019s population live in the most populous and devel- oped dzongkhag (Thimphu), while less than one per cent live in the least populous dzongkhag (Gasa). The four most populous dzongkhags \u2013 Thimphu, Chhukha, Samtse and Trashigang 12 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information \u2013 accounted for 45 per cent of the country\u2019s population, while combined shares of 10 other dzongkhags amounted to 23 per cent of the to- tal population (less than three per cent of the population in each of these 10 dzongkhags). It is thus reasonable to say that, besides the four most populous dzongkhags, the population of Bhutan is thinly distributed over the other 16 dzongkhags (Table 1).

Average life expectancy (at birth) for Bhu- tan as a whole was 66.25 years in 2005 (UNDP 2007a), but life expectancy by dzongkhags does not exist.

As explained in the previous section, two meth- ods were used to calculate life expectancy and one for GDP per capita for all dzongkhags. This section of the paper employs these methods to assemble the requisite dataset for the estimation of sub-national HDIs in Bhutan. Estimate of Life Expectancy The results of the adjusted Chiang and Age-wise methods of estimating life expectancy (at birth and by other age bands) for all dzongkhags of Bhutan are shown in Table 1.16 Consider the simple arithmetic mean and standard deviations of these estimates, respectively: Chiang method: 66.5 and 2.8; Age-wise method: 66.7 and 3.3. Clearly, the mean of the two estimates of life expectancy are not far off from that of Bhutan as a whole: 66.25 years, but the estimate generated by the Chiang method for small areas comes closer than that of the Age-wise method.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "248c9697-8dcb-4afd-99de-c1a6663d9e4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "248c9697-8dcb-4afd-99de-c1a6663d9e4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d2b1aa90ad62f83ee27ee0bb7736a5b5417caf97ac2925bfbeae6d4ee9f7efd"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcedc352-9e2a-4670-a9fd-078dc34347e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "393c2026135f668c8b0b2624c3215916e36a32c5f4c76be661f8a07fb054795e"}}, "hash": "00ae5d9a2d9b164ed301d8db20e150f0ebfe1a52c3c2f87bad8fee7eeaa28fe8", "text": "How- ever, the difference (range) between the high- est and lowest estimates by the Chiang method (11.1) is larger than that of the Age-wise method (8.1). Since the upper limits of the two estimates are 70.4 (Zhemgang) and 70.8 (Pemagatshel) re- spectively, the difference stems mainly from the value of the lower bound. Neither of these prov- inces has the lowest mortality rate in the country \u2013 that distinction belonged to Sarpang, which has a mortality rate of 0.56 in 2005. However, consistent with the importance of mortality rates in the estimation of life expectancy, the Chiang method seems more credible: Zhemgang has a lower mortality rate (0.64) than Pemagatshel (0.79) and thus a higher life expectancy. Of the 20 provinces, Gasa has the highest mor- tality rate (1.16) and, according to the Chiang method, has the lowest life expectancy (59.3 years). On the other hand, Trashiyangtse, with a mortality rate of 0.92, has the lowest life ex- pectancy (62.7 years) by the Age-wise method. Sarpang recorded the lowest mortality rate (0.57) in the country, which is only just above Thimphu\u2019s (0.58), but neither method accorded it the highest life expectancy, even though the estimate by Chiang is considerably higher than that of the Age-wise method (69.4 years against 63.9 years). By way of comparison, the national mortality rate in 2005 was 0.79. The 95 per cent confidence intervals have also been estimated for the Chiang method (Table 1). These demonstrate that the estimate of life expectancy at birth is most robust for Chhukha (with a width of 3.03 years) and lowest for Gasa (with a width of 12.16 years). Interestingly, esti- mates for some dzongkhags, including Chhukha, Monggar, Paro and Samtse, appear to be more robust than that of the most developed dzong- khag, Thimphu, the country\u2019s capital, which has a confidence interval width of 5.54.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5eed384-3b1a-4ff6-9b80-206c6ebfed56": {"__data__": {"id_": "c5eed384-3b1a-4ff6-9b80-206c6ebfed56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46231a821cd164d583e8c92a2d1867024ea0ce040d33f6a8a559e3bf226b087b"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3c2139c-5167-4310-887e-d243d02f3a28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d12ae72258f4372be8ef54495fb48b61ba9883a75477e99334ff67d9e1f82574"}}, "hash": "e9365c7f0c6f03b04546b13a2d546fc62a7cb51ee15cbee2cc3b84abbbb65946", "text": "Which of the two estimates of life expectancy by dzongkhag is more accurate? At least two sets of issues need to be considered: methodologi- cal and consistency (Table 2). The arguments presented in this table suggest that the Chiang method produces estimates that are more robust and thus more accurate. As noted earlier, the average of the estimates of the 20 dzongkhags produced by the Age-wise method is not signifi- cantly different from that of the Chiang method, but there are significant differences between the two distributions (greater variability). The Chiang method is tested and is robust for popu- lations above 5,000, while the Age-wise method is untested and still requires a sound theoreti- cal justification. The appeal of the Age-wise method is that is it less data-demanding than the Chiang method, and may be used to produce a quick and tentative estimate of life expectancy possibly even for populations of less than 5,000 even if mortality data is non-existent. Education: Adult Literacy Rate (ALR) Adult Literacy Rate (ALR) is the proportion of the adult population aged 15 years and older that is literate (ADLIT), expressed as a percentage of the respective population (ADPOP) in each dzongkhag. The necessary data is taken from the 2005 Census, which provides, among other things, age and literacy distribution by the 20 dzongkhags. The equation below was used to generate the results shown in Table 3. 16 The authors discovered that a UNICEF consultant, Dirk Westloaf, also produced life expectancy estimate by dzongkhag for Bhutan, but his methodology is not available. His estimates show large variation across dzongkhags and the mean is 64.43 years, which is far below the national average of 66.25 in 2005. For these reasons, we have not used his estimate of life expectancy in calculating sub-national HDIs for Bhutan. 14 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information According to available data, just about half of Bhutan\u2019s adult population is literate. It is less than this figure in 12 of the 20 dzongkhags and greater than 55 per cent in only four of them. Adult literacy rate is highest in the most devel- oped dzongkhag, Thimphu (68.9 per cent), and lowest in Gasa (39.2 per cent). It is perhaps noteworthy to observe that adult literacy rate in Chhukha (59 per cent), the dzongkhag placed second on this indicator, is still 10 per cent be- low that of Thimphu. As a general statement, it can be said that the ALRs for all but four dzong- khags are about 45 per cent, and, with a standard deviation of 7.2, there does seems to be consid- erable variations across dzongkhags.

ALRdi=(ADLIT di /ADPOP di)*100 15 The Case of Bhutan Education: Combined Gross Enrolment Ratio (CGENR) The combined gross enrolment ratio is calcu- lated by expressing the total number of pupils/ students enroled in primary, lower secondary, middle secondary and higher secondary educa- tion (ENR) as a percentage of the population in the theoretical age group17 of 6 to 18 years for the same level of education (POPAG) in each dzongkhag. The necessary data comes from the population Census of 2005. The equation below was used to generate the results shown in Table 4. CGENRdi=(ENRdi/POPAGdi)*100 The data in Table 4 demonstrates that only about two-thirds of the country\u2019s population between 6-18 years is enroled in educational institutions. Three dzongkhags - Gasa, Dagana and Samtse - have combined gross enrolment ratios that are less than 50 per cent. This statistic is highest in Thimphu (78.8 per cent) and lowest in Gasa (43.8 per cent), but Dagana is only marginally better off than Gasa in this respect. On the other hand, the combined gross enrolment ratios for five dzongkhags are higher than 70 per cent: Thimphu, Paro, Pemagatshel, Bumthang and Punakha. In sum, Bhutan\u2019s combined gross enrolment ratio ranges from 78.8 per cent in Thimphu to 43.8 per cent in Gasa. The SD of 10.7 suggests that there is significant variabil- ity around the average enrolment ratio of 62.1 per cent, but it\u2019s variability is concentrated mainly in the lower and upper ends of the dis- tribution. The fact that CGENR > ALR is not necessarily a cause for concern at this point in time, since the former includes only students in the age group 15-18 years, while ALR refers to the share of the entire population 15 years and above.

The latest Bhutan Living Standard Survey (BLSS) 2007 contains data on monthly per capi- ta consumption expenditure (MPCE) at both the national and sub-national levels. Consumption can, of course, be used as a proxy for income but could be a biased proxy if consumption is greater than income for more than a short pe- riod, which is in fact what the data shows for many poor countries. One reason for this is that people do not reveal their entire income in these surveys because they are afraid of taxes. This does not appear to be the case with Bhutan: its consumption expenditure in 2007 was about half the size of its GDP in 2006. The estimate we employ for per capita GDP by dzongkhags is based on three indicators. These are: (1) monthly per capita consumption expen- diture (MPCE) for each dzongkhag as given by BLSS 2007; (2) population (POP) for each dzongkhag as given by Census 2005; and (3) GDP at the national level as per the National Accounts data.

First, PPP US$ are not necessary, and local currency can be used, since no cross-country comparison is involved. Second, the maximum GDP goalpost is not a target that provinces and small geographical ar- eas in many poor countries can aspire to reach in the next 50 years or so. A poor country as a whole may be able to pull this feat off, but not some of its isolated, remote and direly poor provinces and communities. Third, provincial price levels are often not available for PPP conversion purposes. Fourth, goalposts should be set within the national development context (UNDP 2007b) so that they are more realistic, relevant and appropriate. The calculation of the three dimension indices and the aggregate HDIs for dzongkhags are dis- cussed in this section. Life Expectancy Index The life expectancy index measures the rela- tive achievement of a dzongkhag on life ex- pectancy at birth (LEdi). It comprises one indi- cator, life expectancy, and the life expectancy dimension index is calculated by using the UNDP standard methodology of Range Equal- ization (which will be used for all dimensions indices): Life expectancy index = (LEdi \u2013 25)/(85 \u2013 25) where LEdi refers to the life expectancy at birth for the ith dzongkhag. The results are shown in Table 6. Education Index The education index measures a dzongkhag\u2019s relative achievement in both adult literacy and combined primary, secondary and higher sec- ondary enrolment. The steps are given below: 1. Calculate the index for adult literacy by us- ing the UNDP standard methodology of Range Equalization. The maximum and min- imum values are the same as those used by the UNDP (UNDP 2007a): Maximum =100, Minimum= 0. Thus: Adult literacy index = (ALRdi \u2013 0)/(100 \u2013 0) where ALRdi refers to the actual adult literacy rate of ith dzongkhag. 2. Calculate the index for combined gross enrol- ment by using the UNDP standard methodolo- gy. The maximum and minimum goalposts are the same as those used by the UNDP (UNDP 2007a): Maximum =100, Minimum=0. Combined gross enrolment index = (CGENRdi \u2013 0)/(100 \u2013 0) where CGENRdi refers to the actual combined gross enrolment rate of ith dzongkhag. 3. Sum the two indices by applying two-thirds weight to the adult literacy index and one- third weight to the combined gross enrolment index. That is, Education index = + 2/3 (adult literacy index) 1/3 (combined gross enrolment index) Table 6 gives the result of this exercise. GDP Index The GDP index measures a dzongkhag\u2019s rela- tive command over resources to enjoy a decent standard of living. The steps are given below: 1. Fix the goalposts for maximum (PCGDPmax) and minimum (PCGDPmin). 2. Transform GDP per capita into their logarithm values and then apply the UNDP standard methodology of range equalization to make the indicator scale-free. Log transformation of GDP per capita is used to account for the diminishing returns of utility derived from in- come. 19 The Case of Bhutan Fixing the goalposts Maximum: The maximum goalpost is fixed by projecting the per capita GDP of each dzong- khag for the next 25 years. The projection uses Thimphu\u2019s per capita GDP, which is currently the highest among the 20 dzongkhags. The other piece of data required for projection is, of course, per capita GDP growth rate. The prob- lem here is that a time series of per capita GDP by dzongkhags is unavailable. Indeed, we have per capita GDP by dzongkhag only for 2005. Why not use the growth rate of Bhutan\u2019s per capita GDP? While time series data for Bhutan\u2019s GDP is available from 1980 onwards, popula- tion data is not (the first Census has population data only for 2005).

The steps involved in arriving at the maximum goalpost for dzongkhag GDP are: 1. Calculate the trend growth rate 18 (r ) of GDP of Bhutan from 1980 to 2005. 2.

Minimum: The minimum per capita GDP (PCGDPmin) for any dzongkhag is set as Nu 100. The idea of Nu 100 is borrowed from the global HDR, which uses US $100 (PPP) per capita as the minimum goalpost. In India, sub-national HDRs have used Rupees 100 as the minimum goalpost. Note that Nu 100 is not the equivalent of US $100 (PPP), but it probably represents a hypothetical minimum situation that would per- mit a Bhutanese a mere existence. Most likely, however, no Bhutanese actually lives on Nu 100 during a given year. The next step is to transform the values of GDP per capita into logarithm values and apply the range equalization method as below: GDP index = [Log(PCGDPdi) \u2013 Log(100)] [log(590,000) \u2013 log(100)] where PCGDPdi refers to the actual per capita GDP of ith dzongkhag. Table 6 gives the result of this exercise. HDIs for All Dzongkhags All the necessary data for the calculation of HDIs by dzongkhag are now available. The HDI is simply an equally-weighted average of its three dimension indices, viz: HDI = + + 1/3 (life expectancy index) 1/3 (education index) 1/3(GDP index) Because of its underlying methodology, the val- ue of the HDI ranges from 0 to 1. Higher values show higher human development; lower values, lower human development. It will be recalled that two estimates of life ex- pectancy have been produced, and that the esti- mates generated by the Chiang method is superi- or than those obtained by the Age-wise method. HDIs based on life expectancy generated by the Chiang method will be denoted by HDI-CM, and those produced by the Age-wise method by HDI-AM (Table 7 and Figure 1). Since GDP per capita and education are common to both esti- mates of the HDI, the difference between the es- timates is due to life expectancy at birth. Both estimates of the HDIs are in the range 0.500 \u2013 0.800, which means that Bhutan\u2019s 20 dzongkhags are all in the medium range of hu- 18 The formula for computing the trend growth rate: Yt=Y0(1+r)t where Yt and Y0 refer to the terminal and base points and r refers to the rate of growth. Taking log on both sides we obtain log (Yt)=Log(Y0)+t*log(1+r). Or y=\u03b1+\u03b2t where y=log(Yt); \u03b1=log(Y0) and \u03b2=log(1+r). Regressing y on t we obtain the coefficient \u03b2. Then r=antilog (\u03b2) - 1. So r is the trend annual growth rate. 20 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information Table 6.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b592bbf-2b55-4e4f-95ae-936a731ecb00": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b592bbf-2b55-4e4f-95ae-936a731ecb00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6286c81d4ca59d9a087cafddbb7c8eaadc21d3f01b0e9d6d11aab51633862dc2"}, "2": {"node_id": "771afcc5-91c1-42d5-bd12-dff03c3b27c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df69753ac1d6638b53e833e62eed1d26673f6e49a73b2eefca8e3305a546ad3e"}}, "hash": "f50220d7286eceb7b8960e60ed723ca9cca6e1ef4aa4911a6fbbfe73d6164049", "text": "20 Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information Table 6.

The differences in HDI ranking accorded to dzongkhags by HDI-CM and HDI-AG are shown in Table 8. Evidently, these differences are significant (greater by three or more steps) for eight of the 20 dzongkhags. For planning pur- poses and possibly the allocation of resources, it is HDI ranking of dzongkhags that is crucial and not necessarily the absolute values of the HDI. From this standpoint, it is desirable to have one estimate of the HDI. We have shown that the es- timate of HDI using life expectancy generated by the Chiang method is more accurate. VII. Discussion and Lessons Learned The initial estimation of HDIs by dzongkhags was actually done in Bhutan in July 2008, us- ing estimate of life expectancy generated by the Age-wise method. Later, a more rigorous meth- od was employed to estimate life expectancy.19 Life expectancy estimate: the two methods used in this paper to estimate life expectancy for the 20 dzongkhags of Bhutan are the adjusted Chiang method and the Age-wise method. The former is tested, robust and widely used; the latter, devised by the authors, is experimental, untested and requires a more robust theoretical justification. The adjusted Chiang method is su- perior to the Age-wise method for the following reasons: \u2022 The Chiang method has been rigorously tested and widely used; it produces accurate estimates of life expectancy for populations of 5,000 and above.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4299b29d-eec9-480a-aa9d-45a92a272ee8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4299b29d-eec9-480a-aa9d-45a92a272ee8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Estimating Sub-National Human Development Indices in the Presence of Limited Information: The Case of Bhutan", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac2b987040a6f83664e58baae52364f5d17d8c12368ece6e609f878c6e34fc2b"}, "2": {"node_id": "06da372c-c8ca-4e9a-b38d-24b1d1d9b6e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/estimating-sub-national-human-development-indices-presence-limited-information-case-bhutan", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ec0f7578e3e412e23f92f37783ddac802647de842cf20081a9b5e4232715142"}}, "hash": "048f9d717384f4864dc92bd4cffde85bb7aabc40878c64aa5384a99f32709f68", "text": "Zero deaths in any but the last age interval do not compromise ac- curacy, and even in the latter case, only the standard error, not the life expectancy of this age-band, is affected \u2022 As the Age-wise method is not correlated with mortality rates, it does not necessarily follow that areas with high mortality rates will tend to have low life expectancy. The central point of the Age-wise method is that it ties life expectancy around the national av- erage and then adjusts it by the percentage of people in each province who are older than the national life expectancy. In this way, it adds or subtracts x years to national life ex- pectancy at birth in order to arrive at provin- cial life expectancy. Hence, the latter is thus a two-natured figure: expectation (national life expectancy at birth) plus/minus lived experience (percentage of people older than national life expectancy). The method fails if the national life expectancy is not available and thus in a way it requires national life ex- pectancy to estimate sub-national life expec- tancy. Per capita GDP estimate: as official data sourc- es in Bhutan do not provide per capita GDP data by dzongkhags, the share of consumption expenditure by dzongkhag was used as a proxy to arrive at dzongkhag GDPs.

This may not be the case. For example, con- sumption does not capture many production ac- tivities including the hydro-electricity industries that may be present in some of the dzongkhags such as Pemagatshel. It is also possible that con- sumption expenditure in some dzongkhags may be higher than income \u2013 this is particularly true when people do not report actual income in an effort to avoid taxes. The use of the more accurate Chiang method to generate estimates of life expectancy means that there are now two different estimates of this dimension. These were used to calculate two sets of sub-national HDIs. But two estimates of HDIs do raise an issue: which is more robust and thus could be used by policy makers, the media and other stakeholders involved in advo- cacy? We have seen that, while overall differ- ences are not very significant, there are in fact significant differences when one drills down to the level of dzongkhags. While an accurate answer cannot be given in the absence of a rig- orous evaluation of the Age-wise methodology 19 The methodology and results were presented to the representatives of GNHC, NSB, UN staff and national consultants of the Royal Govern- ment of Bhutan on 4 July 2008. The presentation was very much well received by the audience. In particular, government officials appreci- ated the results, the innovative methods employed to approximate missing data, the spreadsheet developed for the calculation of HDI (which can be used for further refinement of the estimates by merely entering the data into the appropriate cells of the spreadsheet) and the detailed documentation of the methodology used for estimation. Authors express their sincere thanks to all participants. 23 The Case of Bhutan and results, we suggest that the HDI-CM results should be used as estimates of life expectancy as it produces robust estimates for populations of 5,000 and above. There is now a debate as to whether sub-nation- al HDIs could be used as a tool for resource al- location. On the \u2018for\u2019 side, there is the argument that, because the HDI is one of the most criti- cal indices of human development concerns, it should be used for resource allocation. The HDI undoubtedly shows achievements at the sub- national level in three critical areas (health in terms of longevity, education, and purchasing power in terms of per capita GDP), but it omits many other dimensions of human development that are less susceptible to rigorous measure- ment. On the \u2018against\u2019 side, a central position is that the HDI does not explicitly capture many aspects of human development, including poverty. Hence, using HDI as the sole criterion for resource al- location would be inappropriate. Then there is the issue of the politicization of the HDI: would casting the HDI as an instrument of resource allocation open it up to political meandering, which could undermine its legitimacy and ad- vocacy power? Further, in the case of Bhutan, if the HDI is the only indicator for resource alloca- tion to dzongkhags, a perverse situation could result: dzongkhags with high levels of human development (as measured by the HDI) would not have any incentive for improvement. This is because low HDIs will reward low-performing dzongkhags and punish high-performing ones at least until an equilibrium situation is reached \u2013 where the HDIs of all provinces are more or less equal. The danger is that this perversity could lead to a low-level HDI equilibrium trap. We believe that the HDI should continue to be used to expose human development deficits; it is here that its advocacy power lies. The ability of the HDI to reveal discrepancies in the human condition is unsurpassed, and thus its power to influence decisions that takes these deficits into consideration. Nevertheless, while the national HDI was not intended to be used as the criterion for resource allocation, this is probably not the case with sub-national HDIs.

Give officials a spreadsheet (template) with the exact disaggregated data require- ments. Keep them informed of progress and do not spring surprises upon them.

Tool for Applying the Human Development Perspective 1 Introduction There is a fundamental difference between analysing a development issue as a theme versus examining it from a human development perspective. This tool helps with the latter. Adopting a human development perspective involves recognition of development as a process beyond economic concerns and beyond a particular sector, to one that respects the choices and freedoms of human beings and seeks to enlarge capabilities and opportunities for all. The human development perspective is fully consistent with the human rights approach \u2013 acceptance of the universality of human rights (rather than particular rights for selected persons) is the backbone for arguing for a people centered approach. This tool aims to develop skills to apply a human development lens to issues. It is a first step in operationalising the human development approach in shaping policies and programmes. The human development approach keeps people at the centre (rather than, for example, GDP per capita) and their quality of life as the ultimate aim. We take a couple of themes as illustrations and demonstrate how a human development lens could be applied. \u201cEmployment\u201d through a human development lens Consider the theme of Employment. Employment can be studied as a pure employment sector issue - jobs, wages, structural unemployment, underemployment, hidden unemployment, etc. This sectoral approach misses out on many other aspects and repercussions of the employment sector, its effects on human beings in other ways. Consequently the indicators identified to assess employment conditions are also limited. Examining the sector from a human development lens means studying the critical questions relating to the lives of human beings. It does not mean ignoring incomes or the importance of material conditions, but going beyond them. Specifically, the questions that follow suggest how the theme can be analysed from a human development angle: How sustainable are emerging job \u2022\ufffd opportunities? What are the possible trade offs between employment now and future livelihoods? How sustainable are employment-oriented \u2022\ufffd policies and programmes in terms of fiscal implications? What are the environmental sustainability \u2022\ufffd implications? What is the quality of working conditions in \u2022\ufffd paid work? What are the links between employment/ \u2022\ufffd unemployment on one hand and health and nutrition security on the other? Do the effects vary between adult workers and child workers? Do the nature of employment and \u2022\ufffd conditions of employment influence health? Are differences along gender lines significant? How does employment status influence \u2022\ufffd the ability to access to knowledge? Do the effects vary between adult workers and child workers? What about female workers? How are employment conditions linked \u2022\ufffd to efficiency and incomes? Are there From Development to Human Development 2 differences between short and longer term effects (e.g. investing in education and training could postpone incomes but allow higher incomes at a later date)? Does employment reduce poverty, if \u2022\ufffd so, how? Are the effects the same for all sections of the population (e.g., children)? What are the implications of changing \u2022\ufffd employment patterns on inequality?

How does employment influence \u2022\ufffd participation in community, political and cultural life? Is there a reverse linkage, i.e., do better or \u2022\ufffd worse human development conditions influence employment status, earnings, quality and predictability of work? Applying the human development lens to \u201ctrade\u201d No country in the world can isolate itself from buying and selling across borders. But too often discussions tend to focus on commercial aspects and the economic implications. The location of trade policies in ministries of commerce or economy indicates the dominant perception regarding how trade related issues are seen in national policies. Yet, trade is not just about exporting and importing and having the foreign exchange to do so. Goods, services, people and ideas cross national borders, resulting in an enormous widening of opportunities for some, as well as restricted choices and worsening conditions for others. Applying the human development lens for policies and programmes would imply addressing questions that go beyond the economic to those that reflect concerns for improving people\u2019s lives and widening their choices. Questions of interest for human development are: l\ufffd What are the implications for people\u2019s livelihoods and future generations if trade in natural resources is accelerated for the current profits of commercial entities? How can trade offs between food security at the national level versus farm livelihoods be addressed? l\ufffd\ufffd How are female Tool for Applying the Human Development Perspective 3 employment opportunities being influenced with increased integration of production processes and geographic dispersion, say, in trade in the ready-made garments sector? l\ufffd\ufffd Are women from disadvantaged sections of the population getting more opportunities through trade in services (house maids, entertainers, nurses); what are the negative implications for their lives, health, bodily integrity, safety that policies need to address? l\ufffd\ufffd Is outsourcing of business processes contributing to efficiencies for both buyers and sellers? What are the negative effects on health, educational choices? l\ufffd\ufffd Does travel across national boundaries contribute to educational experiences, access to new ideas and opportunities, empowerment? What are the negative human consequences like implications for families, unsafe money transfer and physical safety? l\ufffd\ufffd What can poor countries do if they are denied access to lifesaving drugs because of intellectual property regimes as non- trade barriers come into centre-stage of international trade debates? l\ufffd\ufffd Can poor countries participate better in global trade by leveraging and add value to traditional knowledge through tools like establishing geographical indications for products that go beyond wines, spirits and cheeses? For example, neem or phukok sauce? Or diversify their exports by strengthening travel and tourism? Such questions can be posed around some of the key dimensions of human development.1 For example the five human development dimensions of interest are: Are the benefits sustainable? From the viewpoint of their environmental implications, to what extent, for example, does trade increase the pressure for marketization of agriculture and fisheries? Could this lead to intensive cultivation and mono-cropping? To what extent can the benefits be sustained over time, in view of, for example, technological change, dynamic comparative advantages or intergenerational considerations? Are the benefits equitable? Do some have more opportunities than others? Which groups benefit more than others? Are there losers, and if so, are they the relatively worse off? Does trade contribute to reducing or widening of inequalities? How do Least Developed Countries and those that face trade-related vulnerabilities fare? When people and countries at different starting points engage in trade, do the better-off benefit more? Do policies and institutions have to be \u2018unequal\u2019 to promote equity, for example, through special and differential treatment provisions? Are the implications empowering? Does the \u2018agency\u2019 of some groups get compromised or enhanced? Can people lead more dignified and empowered lives, say, through better or new 1 A similar conceptualization may be seen in Wagl\u00e9 and Gibbs (2003), later incorporated in Montes and Memis (2005). The idea originates from Mahbub Ul-Haq (1995) and has been used in the Asia- Pacific Human Development Report, Trade on Human Terms (UNDP", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "380a5b3d-ba38-4922-a67d-66e70c8dd290": {"__data__": {"id_": "380a5b3d-ba38-4922-a67d-66e70c8dd290", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-human-development-tool-applying-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "From Development to Human Development: Tool for Applying the Human Development Perspective", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-human-development-tool-applying-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1320c0ee4f42121bfb1e395e3ac81679c1acbb2a2e716afa0371d7026002e569"}, "3": {"node_id": "efeb3145-2eeb-4644-9308-95fc9f1fd994", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-human-development-tool-applying-human-development-perspective", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9650113d4950ee0de4db80c0780e801d656506e54a26aedea17eb4ecc0efa75b"}}, "hash": "9ebf606facb720a232c1d752629cf0b6078105c7e4d60f11b6214d8f6d84d20c", "text": "2006). From Development to Human Development 4 employment opportunities, for example, through the offshoring of business processes? To what extent does more open trade destroy jobs, say, for farmers or garment workers of Asia? Are the new ideas and experiences empowering? Are there efficiency effects? Does the exchange of goods, services, money and ideas contribute to productivity improvements? Does this happen more in the already more profitable sectors, as against in sectors that employ lower-end workers? Does more income in people\u2019s hands lead to better health, with less absenteeism, less down-time? Do people invest more in education as they see its benefits? Are educational choices influenced by market? How can trade become more inclusive, so there is wider participation of people in its benefits? Trade that excludes people who have little to sell, or created enclaves of prosperity in a largely deprived population will be hard to sustain and may contain seeds of disaffection and conflict. Sustainability \u2013 Equity \u2013 Empowerment \u2013 Efficiency \u2013 Participation: Does human development \u2018SEEEP\u2019 to the bottom? There are also tradeoffs, between productivity, for example, and equity. While these dimensions do not encompass all of human development, they serve as a useful tool to assess international trade on human terms. Other themes A similar exercise can be undertaken for other issues like the complex issue of corruption. Corruption can be studied, both, as thematic issue, and in contrast, as a human development issue by applying the human development lens2 to identify human causes, consequences that affect people\u2019s lives and human development oriented solutions through policies and programmes. Corruption is not limited to politicians or officials taking bribes in return for favours, for doing or even refraining from doing legitimate duties. Even seemingly petty forms of corruption can hide deep institutional weaknesses that disempower disadvantaged people, widen inequalities, undermine sustainability of institutions, and lower productivity \u2013 undermine genuine choices for people\u2019s daily lives. Similarly, HIV/AIDS is not just a health issue, but is one that has much wider implications in terms of human development. In exploring HIV/ AIDS from a human development perspective, issues such as equity, women's rights, stigma and discrimination, livelihoods, productivity and employment implications, empowerment of the affected population, going beyond those infected (care givers, family members, children) as well as health need to be considered. The human development perspective also can be applied to specific groups to assess and overcome horizontal inequalities such as males and females, indigenous peoples or other socially excluded groups. When looking at development indicators for the groups it is useful to disaggregate data to examine what the sustainability, equity, efficiency, empowerment and participation implications will be. 2 UNDP 2008. Tool for Applying the Human Development Perspective 5 Using the Millennium Development Goals as a framework for the analysis can also help. For example, it is possible to assess the development issue by asking how and to what extent are the goals, targets and indicators affected? Are there reverse linkages, i.e., do better human development conditions influence? These are useful questions to answer in order to get a 'more human development oriented perspective' on the development problem. The table below facilitates such an exploration. It is an indicative guidance tool to help root analysis in human development, systematically leading us towards accurate DIAGNOSIS, looking for EVIDENCE and following up with appropriate SOLUTIONS to address particular challenges. It helps keep the focus on the disadvantaged, expand capabilities and choices and leads us to doing something about it. The table can be modified by customising for the particular theme under consideration, incorporating local specificities and priorities.

Abstract The paper explores the relationship between the scourge of corruption and human development and argues for prioritizing social services in finding solutions. While the focus is on Asia Pacific, the issues are relevant more generally for developing countries. It addresses conceptual issues in defining and measuring corruption and argues that corruption is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon. Its very nature inhibits a unique definition and measurement. There are popular indices of corruption which may indeed be useful for some purposes. However, no metric by itself measures this phenomenon in all its complexity. This paper proposes a complementary method to gauge the vulnerability of a country to corruption by identifying some indicators that can capture ex ante the climate of corruption. Such a strategy could help prevention. Corruption hurts everyone, but the disadvantaged are hurt the most. The paper focuses on social services \u2013 in particular, publicly funded education, health and the basic utilities of water, sanitation and electricity. The better off can access oth- er options, but it is the poor who are far more dependent on public provisioning. While there are other factors that interfere with availability, access and quality of social services, corruption is a contributory and aggravating factor. Shortages also provide conditions for survival corruption. It also generates a sense of injustice and disempowerment, particularly for the poor. Thus, while the poor are already excluded from various opportunities because of lower initial endowments, market imperfections, and asymmetric knowledge, corruption erects an additional barrier that widens inequality between the more and less privileged. However, there are success stories of anti-corruption initiatives in the region which the paper high- lights. While all forms of corruption need to be tackled, reducing those that hit the poor the hardest should be prioritized from a human development perspective. The pa- per proposes solutions combining top-down-plus-bottom-up pressure. Pressure from above, through political will, can be sustained through people\u2019s expectations, checks, and support from below. This strategy underscores the point that just as the motivations for corruption lie inside and outside of governments, the respon- sibility to fight corruption cannot be that of governments alone. To be successful, anti-corruption strategies must leverage checks and balances at all levels. While details and priorities need to be guided by national circumstances, there are some common points under the overall sandwich strategy of top-down-plus- bottom-up that together could create a tipping point.

Corruption has become an increasing concern around the world \u2013 among citi- zens, national and local governments, donors, media and civil society. No country is immune to it, regardless of its economic or political system. Its damaging effects go well beyond what can be measured in money terms; to re- stricting opportunities and choices for people. The costs to societies include the obvious loss of public revenues, eco- nomic inefficiencies and unequal ac- cess; they also include the less obvious costs of weakened institutions, un- checked environmental damage, a per- sistent sense of injustice and disem- powerment, an undermining of values and norms, with longer term conse- quences that are hard to reverse. The impact on the poor, on daily lives of peo- ple, and on human development more generally, is now beginning to receive attention and needs to be more directly addressed as a poverty-focussed gover- nance issue. Corruption, through loss of tax revenues, reduces resources avail- able for public policies for inclusive growth, social services and safety-nets. Stepping back, it can also influence the very direction of public expenditures \u2013 channeling them to areas which are more vulnerable to collusive siphoning of resources. Further, more directly, cor- ruption can magnify the harm to health and education services, reliable access to credit or electricity for small and mi- cro business. It can make a mockery of social safety-net programmes, such as subsidized grains for the poor, school feeding, pensions or employment schemes which are essential to suppor the most vulnerable by giving them an opportunity to survive or exit poverty. The objectives of this paper are to ex- plore the relationship between the scourge of corruption and human de- velopment and to propose solutions to accelerate human development, espe- cially for the relatively disadvantaged. While the focus is on Asia Pacific coun- tries, given the pervasiveness of the scourge, and the commonality of many aspects of the circumstances, issues and solutions, it is expected to be relevant to other developing countries as well. The premise is that corruption eventu- ally hurts everyone, but the disadvan- taged are hurt much more. The paper focuses on social services - in particular, public health, education and utilities - where the poor are especially affected, as they tend to depend heavily on public provisioning, and are least able to pay bribes for what should be theirs by right. Corruption diverts goods and services away from the poor to those who have money (so they can pay bribes) or power (so they may not need to bribe). While there are other factors that interfere with availability, access and quality of social services1, corrup- tion is a contributory and often aggra- vating factor. It also generates a sense of injustice and disempowerment. Condi- tions of shortages drive those at the bottom to survival corruption. Thus, while the poor are already excluded from various opportunities because of lower initial endowments, market im- perfections, and asymmetric knowl- edge, corruption erects an additional barrier that widens inequality between the more and less privileged. Section two addresses conceptual Introduction 1 issues in defining and measuring cor- ruption and presents an analytical framework to explain how corruption undermines access to social services - health, education and utilities. Section three analyses the pattern of corruption perceptions and human de- velopment in Asia Pacific countries. Sections four, five and six analyse the nature of corruption in education, health and the basic utilities of water, sanitation and electricity, and present some of the implications relevant for human development, especially for the poor with possible solutions for curb- ing corruption. The final section seven discusses some policy options to curb corruption in social services to acceler- ate human development. Solutions need to be rooted in local conditions. Yet there are some common factors that have wider applicability. They also need to be grounded in human development if this is the ultimate aim. 2 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development \u2022 2.1 Concepts Corruption is commonly understood as the \u2018misuse of entrusted power for private gain\u2019. This definition includes corruption by individuals, but it does not go beyond public officials and poli- ticians. Moreover, it is a limited defini- tion since it portrays corruption as a one-way process driven by the greed of those in power.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75595674-6d2e-41aa-ad22-71120cebed2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "75595674-6d2e-41aa-ad22-71120cebed2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c372fff4613e3bc742914344eaf2c3d25eed0a066b32931e324fedefb85e74e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9b9cbbc-0f85-4f12-9e9b-7673f8fb034d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfaedc5176767da93fa723f5eaf407054da05947ea44b6b751152a0096f11c39"}}, "hash": "10281095bffdf5e9fab6911ba69fb0f0938a2b88bc43bc2d5f6cee45d2861c75", "text": "The balance of pow- er is not necessarily on the side of the corrupt person with \u2018entrusted power\u2019, since powerful financial and other inter- ests can overwhelm underpaid officials and weak administrations.

Some acts of corruption involve coercion \u2013 a demand for a bribe, for example, or ex- tortion. This tends to happen in secret but may also become public if the vic- tim protests, though there are costs to such protests. Others involve collusion between the corruptee and the corrup- tors \u2013 a premeditated meeting of minds that is harder to detect as both parties have an interest in concealment. Short- ages-based corruption occurs when demand outstrips supply and citizens pay sums not legitimately required for access. For example, a lot of \u2018survival\u2019 corruption, especially in essential ser- vices like water or electricity connec- tions, or in quality schools or hospital beds, is conducted by ordinary people in their daily lives. Corruption can take on many forms ranging from the gross to the subtle, some of which are not widely understood. The phenomenon is thus difficult to capture in a single defi- nition or measure as seen below. Corruption is intrinsically bound up with social norms and practices (Gam- pat 2009a). However, it is important to distinguish between cultural pluralism and cultural relativism. Cultural plural- ism acknowledges that traditional prac- tices differ and that these differences will affect the forms of corruption, but it is nevertheless consistent with an un- derlying set of universal principles that would condemn corruption. Cultural relativism, on the other hand, would say that it is impossible to apply val- ues across traditional practice systems - each country has to work out its own principles of right and wrong \u2013 includ- ing on corruption2. \u2022 2.2 Categorising corruption Corruption take many forms3 such as bribery, embezzlement, theft and fraud, extortion, abuse of discretion, favourit- ism, nepotism and clientelism, creating or exploiting conflicting interests and improper political contributions. Grand and \u2018petty\u2019 corruption - Classified by money value, grand corruption in- volves mega deals where the monetary value is very high as in large contracts. The participants are usually large businesses and high-level politicians and officials. Periods of rapid economic growth offer opportunities for grand corruption, particularly through invest- ment in infrastructure or extraction of natural resources. But grand corruption need not wait for periods of robust eco- nomic growth: many areas of govern- ment activities - such as arms supplies, for example - are shrouded in secrecy and thus vulnerable to grand corruption. 2 A related idea is \u2018cultural determinism\u2019 which would find some traditional practices innately more prone to corruption. Some studies have found evidence that traditional practices do not matter but they do not show that some are destined for corruption or are likely to be more tolerant of it (La Porta et al. 1997; Triesman 2000; Lipset and Lenz 2000; Paldam 2002). 3 See the most common forms of corruption in UNDP (2008a). Understanding corruption 2 3 4 The 1997 Revised Recommendation on Combating Bribery in International Business Transactions (OECD. n.d). \u2018Petty\u2019 corruption is more appropriate- ly called \u2018street\u2019 or \u2018retail\u2019 corruption, as although it involves much smaller transactions, they are more frequent with a much more direct and immedi- ate impact on the poor. Retail corrup- tion typically involves lower officials, agents or sub-agents who demand or accept \u2018speed money\u2019 to issue licenses, provide access to schools, hospitals or water supplies. Retail corruption often thrives during periods of weak eco- nomic growth or during periods when goods and services are in short supply \u2013 real or deliberately created shortages by agents who by erect additional bu- reaucratic hurdles. Although many acts of corruption, whether grand or petty, are clear enough, there can be areas of ambiguity. Legality and illegality \u2013 Acts many peo- ple would regard as corrupt need not automatically be illegal. Thus, until a few years ago, it was legal for compa- nies based in OECD countries to bribe officials in other countries. Only re- cently4 has this become a crime in home countries. On the other hand, there are many illegal acts that are not corrup- tion.

Lobbying \u2013 Many developed countries frown at bribery yet allow high-pow- ered lobbyists to bombard the public with one-sided information and argu- ments. The lobbyists do not provide cash but may offer free \u2018services\u2019, such as research and information with the intention of influencing law-making or contracts. Private and public \u2013 Private entities, such as businesses, professional sports, research, stock markets can all engage in corruption, no less than politicians and officials. Corruption also occurs at the interface between the public and private sectors. In many countries across Asia and island states of the Pa- cific, where there are strong notions of hierarchy, it is considered appropriate to make payments to those in author- ity as a way of showing respect. In these cases the public-private interface can be ill-defined; power seen to reside not in offices but in the persons of high offi- cials. These lines can be further blurred when loyalty comes into play and offi- cials have ties based on, say, ethnicity or religion \u2013 and may favour groups even without direct financial gain. Gift giving \u2013 When is a gift a bribe? In many Asia Pacific societies, daily transactions and social network- ing traditionally involve gifts, typi- cally consumable items such as food. Indeed, in many Pacific countries not giving a gift can be seen as corruption. However, as traditional sys- tems of governance intermin- gle with \u2018introduced\u2019 systems the potential for corruption emerges: for example in gifting of non-consum- able items of high value like land or gold. This manipulation of a traditional practice has often been used to justify corrupt acts. 4 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development \u2022 2.3 Distinguishing features of corruption Corruption is certainly not a new phenomenon. Rulers have been occupied with this issue ever since the states started collecting funds from the governed \u2013 initially then peasant agriculture. The Indian statesman- philosopher Kautilya wrote in the fourth century B.C. about the king\u2019s servants: \u201cJust as it is impossible not to taste honey or poison that one may find at the tip of one\u2019s tongue, so it is impossible for one dealing with government funds not to taste, at least a little bit, of the King\u2019s wealth.\u201d5 While Kautilya is here speaking of corruption in government, it is a phenomenon observed no less in the private sector, as seen in sections 2.1 and 2.2. Corruption occurs due to a strong prioritization of immediate gain, even at the expense of others, and is especially observed in common property situations. A potential for corruption arises in situations of \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 who need to be passed for a benefit to accrue, where power can vest. Gampat (2009b) pondered over the larger question \u201cwhether corruption is part of human nature?\u201d, and concluded that a full understanding of the phenomenon requires us to step outside of the economic domain and draw upon sociology (social norms and practices), anthropology, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology and neuroscience. While underlying causes of corruption are complex and difficult to identify, six core characteristics or prerequisites for a corrupt act may help understanding the reasons for corruption better (Gampat 2009a; Rajivan 2009). These are: \u2022 The existence of a Gap between group and individual interest or between short and long-term benefits. \u2022 Two or more parties since one can hardly be corrupt with one\u2019s own self. \u2022 Consenting persons that have a common understanding, with reciprocity, explicit or understood, whether by collusion, coercion, through perceived lack of choice, passive or facilitative. \u2022 Benefit\ufffd furtherance, be it private, sectional, or political party interest. \u2022 Existence of power that could be grabbed, usurped, entrusted or otherwise available; corruptors (givers) can have power; it should be available, whether in public or private hands or both. \u2022 Misuse of the power that often drives a wedge between intended and stated positions, for unintended benefits. The last prerequisite is complicated by the fact that what constitutes \u2018misuse\u2019 or unacceptable behaviour could differ by context, shaped by local norms and priorities6.

Rangarajan in 1992. 6 For example, in rural India the poor may think it is perfectly legitimate to draw water from pipelines that take water to the city (making unauthorized holes in the pipes, paying the field staff a \u2018fee\u2019) when the pipes pass through wayside villages without serving them. But others would consider such local collusion corruption - field staff collecting bribes in return for turning a blind eye to the water theft. 5 7 \u201cThe goal of the CPI is to provide data on extensive perceptions of corruption within countries\u201d Transparency International (2007a). 8 This work was part of the research that went into the Asia Pacific Human Development Report, Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives (UNDP 2008a). 9 See Gampat et al. (2009) for detailed method of calculating CVI and justifying the selection of indicators. Moreover, corruption can happen at many different levels, from the lowest to the highest, and also cross national boundaries. Measures of one kind can only imperfectly represent a country as a whole. It is difficult to capture the ex- tent of an inherently under-the-table phenomenon, including its role in un- dermining institutions, values and norms. Yet measuring corruption is an important element of any anti-corrup- tion strategy \u2013 for focusing public atten- tion, shaping public policy, and for mon- itoring the phenomenon. Donors and investors frequently use available mea- sures of corruption to guide aid and other financial commitments. They are in fact a number of measures to gauge corruption (see Annex) but the two most popular indices are: Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)- Pro- duced annually by Transparency Inter- national (TI), since 1995 the CPI is per- haps the best-known index of corruption7. By 2007, the CPI, which is based on perception surveys, covered 180 countries. Several Asian countries are listed regularly as some of the most corrupt countries in the world. Control of Corruption Index (CCI)- Pro- duced since 1996 by the World Bank, is another popular corruption index. Al- though its title suggests that it is measur- ing the effectiveness of measures to control corruption it is, in fact, another perception index. It does differ, however, in a number of respects from the CPI. The CCI gathers data from a wider range of sources than the CPI and also covers petty and grand corruption as well as state capture. In addi- tion, the CCI uses different statistical tech- niques that make it better suited for com- parisons across countries and over time. However, because the CCI is based on both perceptions and observed data, interpre- tation can be tricky. A complementary innovative approach8 is to gauge the climate of corruption by identifying observable and measure- able indicators that make a country vul- nerable to corruption. The corruption vulnerability index (CVI) is a first step in this direction (Gampat et al. 2009). Using 21 directly observable and mea- surable indicators in 12 dimensions (Table 2.1), such as the marginal tax rate and relative wages in the public sector, the CVI gauges the country\u2019s sus- ceptibility to corruption9. Equal weight is applied to all the dimensions and all the indicators in calculating the CVI. In short, the where Xj* is the scale-free indicator that is obtained by applying the range equaliza- tion method to observed Xj. Thus, Xj* = (Xij \u2013 Xj min) / (Xj max \u2013 Xj min) where Xij re- fers to observed value of jth indicator for ith country, Xj max is the observed maxi- mum value of the jth indicator, Xj min is the observed minimum value of the jth indica- tor, N is the number of indicators. There are three distinct advantages of measuring vulnerability to corruption. First, an ex ante assessment of the poten- tial that a phenomenon may, in fact, occur helps in assessing the need for a preven- tion strategy. Second, appropriate selec- tion of indicators can help policy makers to target their interventions on the most vul- nerable areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5be1e964-baf9-4a02-99f9-957782b564a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5be1e964-baf9-4a02-99f9-957782b564a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de5be1c34c0cdd047c40e43e040fc0f1afa6ba4f59df9172658e2e1f9a7fe326"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc8bd966-9e3e-4937-9e8b-8494aec411f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d40267234fec182f1a9c5b835feeb410e74246706de4d31ed5c35f88debc815a"}}, "hash": "ffc01d47dacd349a7ca0b971ec499ae59587334d53590b8c31f353aa88cecceb", "text": "Third, difficulties in measur- ing non-observable aspects of a complex phenomenon can be minimized by a focus on the \u2018climate\u2019 that influences the likeli- hood of the phenomenon.

The poor depend much more on public pro- visioning of health, education and utili- ties, such as water and electricity, with very direct human development impli- cations. Corruption can also aggravate gender inequalities as unmet demands for bribes may further restrict women\u2019s 7 access to health and education. Corrup- tion may also undermine services such as the provision of water which may in- crease women\u2019s labour, as fetching water is often a task traditionally assigned to women; or they may be unable to par- ticipate in cottage industries or micro- businesses if electricity is not available. Social services are open to several types of corruption \u2013 from grand to re- tail to state capture. Here both greed- based and need-based survival corrup- tion can be observed and participants can come from the public and private sectors as well as the unemployed. Cor- ruption may take the form of licenses to private companies producing coun- terfeit drugs or large construction con- tracts for education or utilities proj- ects. Shortages of electricity or hospital beds arising from supply-demand gaps motivate citizens to jump queues through side deals. Corruption in these sectors also has serious negative externalities. Poor health leads to greater absenteeism from work and loss of person-days. Poor water and sanitation can lead to spread of infectious diseases that cut across income classes. A cross-country study by Gupta et al. (2000) finds that corruption in access to hospital facili- ties can contribute to higher child mor- tality. The study also found that cor- ruption in education increases drop-out rates in schools. While ev- eryone loses eventually, the poor face immediate and direct losses. In a situa- tion of shortages, those who can pay have better access \u2013 with the poor los- ing out. The rich and the powerful can get the best deals out of the existing stock, either through bribery or con- nections. They also have better access to markets. Thus, while the poor are already excluded from various oppor- tunities such as credit and insurance because of market imperfections, cor- ruption erects a further barrier. Signifi- cantly, the poor use up a higher pro- portion of their income to pay bribes even if they do so less frequently than those who are better-off. Important ways in which corruption in social services operate to harm the poor can be analysed by adapting the framework of Shleifer and Vishny (1993). First, corruption can limit the supply of social services, for example, when government officials create con- ditions in which people have to pay a bribe for access, raising cost of access, thus limiting supply. Second, corruption by siphoning public funds or material, i.e., \u2018corruption with theft\u2019 as Shleifer and Vishny (1993) call it, results in revenue loss to the government treasury.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b12e0373-c8aa-49e2-afed-d353441e1e80": {"__data__": {"id_": "b12e0373-c8aa-49e2-afed-d353441e1e80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e20abb0ac73b0b75c7c78ee93b3ad1896be4a7696a66897a5506199f8c07d391"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9211ba6-8cab-4828-825d-2cfddfbdbbcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4975840fc3e3679eee8cab95ddfb2f78c861d706b461dd234679d5976be1d2e"}}, "hash": "04b6701470fc29174f1e997e88bc8fabd46ef9f8dd66bec080b07729afe91ecc", "text": "This happens through collusion between influential persons and officials, favouritism or under-invoicing the cost of providing services.

This can also limit the supply of social services (Mauro 1997; Shleifer and Vishny 1993). Figure 2.1 presents a graphical representation. The figure shows the total potential benefits (per capita) from publicly fund- ed social services in the form of a pro- duction possibility curve p0b0. We call it the benefits possibility curve 10. The shape of the curve depends on the re- turns to public expenditure on social services. Since the better off can exer- cise private options, we assume that benefits to them are less than those to the worse-off or the relatively choiceless. Conversely, loss to the worse- off from denial of access to public provisioning of social services is higher than that to the better-off. In other words, with increase in per capita income there are diminishing re- turns to public provisioning of services. This implies that every time abetter-off person enjoys the benefit, which may come at the cost of poor, the loss of benefit to poor is higher than the gain accrued to the rich. So the ben- efits possibility curve is concave to the origin. Under constant returns to public expenditure for all, regardless of income per capita, the benefits possibility curve would be a downward sloping straight line. The full benefits of the public expendi- ture on social services are realized any- where along the curve p0b0. The point a0 shows the potential benefit of publicly provided social services when these are available to the whole population, in- 10 This is a conceptual figure for illustrative purposes assuming that reduction in potential per capita benefit is only through corruption. In other words, we hold constant factors like inefficiencies, budgets, different policy priorities, etc., which can also limit per capita benefits. 9 11 This could, for example, be identified on the basis of some specified criteria, as part of public policy. cluding all the rich. The minimum level of benefit accruing to each individual beneficiary is a0, which is positive and asymptotic to zero as the benefits are distributed among all the population. The point b0 shows the potential benefit of public expenditure on social services when this is concentrated on a single individual, the poorest. So b0 is the max- imum benefit that can accrue to a single individual. If only the worse-off section of population11 gets the benefits of the public provisioning, the level of benefit is b1. Now, assume corruption diverts a chunk of the benefits from the intended beneficiaries-from those who are worse-off to those who are better- off (p1p2). So the level of benefit per head goes down to b2. Loss of benefit to the poor is equivalent to a1a2. Thus the full advantage to society of public provi- sioning of social services is not realized. Corruption, by siphoning off revenue from the government treasury, can lead to reduction in supply of public servic- es. Shifts in public investment away from social services to large, lucrative projects would also reduce supply of social services. This will shift the bene- fits curve down to p0b0 1 (the dotted curve). The maximum benefit that the poor can get in such a situation will be b1 1. Both scenarios show that corrup- tion undermines the benefits accruing to poor. 10 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development 3 Patterns:\ufffdWhat\ufffdwe\ufffdsee\ufffdin\ufffdAsia\ufffdPacific As we have seen in section 2.4, there are unresolved issues in measuring corruption as no single metric adequately gauges it.

However, a close look at the CPI 2007 shows that there are drastic changes in perceptions of corruption in certain countries such as Bhutan, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea and Thailand. There was also a change in the methodology for the computation of the 2007 CPI values. Nevertheless, the rank correlations between CVI and CPI do not show any consistent pattern. 14 The rank correlations between CVI and CCI, using data for 2005 and 2006, for the sample 17 countries, are significant at the 5 per cent and 10 per cent level respectively.

In terms of trends in corruption in Asia Pacific, the CPI series is available from 1995 to 2007 for a few countries (though not strictly comparable over time because of changes in methodolo- gy and data sources). For most countries in the world, the CCI is available since 1996 with comparable data15. However, one major shortcoming of both indices is that many of the data sources are 15 The CCI 2007 revises all back year series up to 1996.

That is, both CPI and CCI can be expected to change insigni- ficantly in the short-run. This makes it hard to distinguish between a lack of change in actual corruption and the stickiness of perceptions. One example is the CCI series for sample South Asian countries (figure 3.1). Except for Ban- gladesh, which shows a worsening cor- ruption situation, the CCI values for other countries do not vary much from 1996 to 2007. What is the relationship among cor- ruption and human development? If, for example, corruption influences hu- man development, is there a feedback effect from human development to cor- ruption? Corruption can directly affect human development because it reduces government expenditure on education and health (Mauro 1998). But it can also do so indirectly by lowering eco- nomic growth and incentives to invest. Figure 3.2 plots CCI 1996 against HDI 2005; that is HDI for a later year with the CCI for a previous year. The correla- tion shows that countries having higher control of corruption in the past tend to have higher human development at present, such as Malaysia, Japan, Sin- gapore, New Zealand and Australia. Al- ternatively, there can be feedback effect from human development to corruption. Figure 3.3 plots the CCI 2007 against the HDI 2005; that is HDI for a previous year with the CCI for a later year. This figure also shows that countries that have higher (better) control of cor- ruption also have high human devel- opment, as is the case with Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and Australia. On the other hand, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea have lower con- trol of corruption and lower attain- ment of human development. Bhutan 13 16 Plotting CCI 2006 with HDI 1980 to allow for the effect of initial levels of human development also rein forces the same pattern.

The pattern thus seems to suggest that human development conditions and corruption control move together.

Education, not just literacy, empowers citizens: it helps them to access entitlements, to demand rights, to raise their voices against ir- regularities; and reduces asymmetric information, all of which can contribute to vigilance over corrupt practices.

Corruption perception is measured by the CCI 2007 and second- ary enrolment rate relates to 2005, the latest comparable data available. Coun- tries with higher attainment of second- ary enrolment do show higher control of corruption.17 Better education can also have inter- generational effects as well. Higher edu- cational attainments can be part of the solution set. But, of course, the educa- tion sector itself is plagued by corrup- tion in several countries. A number of factors contribute to vul- nerability of this sector. The number of employees, low salaries, the construc- tion contracts, the purchase of text books, desks and other supplies, the shortage of seats in better schools, vari- ous levels of desirability associated to postings, inadequate accountability and monopoly of power are among the fac- tors that make this sector vulnerable. Contracts arising from building con- struction, running of hostels, and purchase 15 of school supplies; and benefits for poor students like free uniforms or scholar- ships provide opportunities for corrupt behaviour. The large size of many educa- tional operations and far-flung locations can make supervision difficult. Account- ability is therefore often low. \u2022 4.2 Types of corruption in education: Examples from \ufffd Asia\ufffdPacific Corruption by category of participants in education systems in Asia Pacific are summarised in Table 4.1. Corrupt prac- tices range from misappropriation of public funds, to misuse of public office, abuse of administrative and political power, theft, kickbacks and the exchange of informal payments and favours. Six common ways in which corruption occurs in the education sector are: \u2022\ufffdDistorting public policies and laws. \u2022\ufffdSiphoning of public funds. \u2022\ufffdTaking and giving bribes. \u2022 Personnel-related corruption. \u2022 Corruption with theft - stealing goods. \u2022 Negligent regulation. Distorting public policies- A well-known form of distortion in public policies is the prioritisation of expenses and pro- grammes that provide a greater scope for corruption. In this regards, Mauro (1998) and Knack and Sanyal (2000) found that corruption reduced the share of public expenditures on educa- tion. Part of the reason for this has to do with the allocation of resources: prefer- ence given to construction rather than operation and maintenance because it offers greater scope for corruption. Student-Teacher Payer-School School-Supplier Within School/Ministry Bribes for admission \u201cGhost schools\u201d for processing vouchers Kickbacks for purchase orders for textbooks, equipment, supplies, meals and cleaning services Sale of jobs and promotions and transfers Bribes for grades and promotions Inflating number of students to get reimbursements Bribes for approval of textbooks Theft of funds Induced demand for private tuitions Loan officers bribed to give loans to rich students or non- students Board members bribed by publishing houses for selecting their textbooks Theft of supplies Absenteeism Students who stay in university for decades to collect stipends Bribes for turning a blind eye to photocopying textbooks and violating intellectual property Fraudulent billing for expenses Teaching badly Kickbacks for construction Under allocation to education Sale of exams and bribes for letting professional exam- takers take exams for students Commission in order to receive salary Prioritizing Public- sector priorities in favour of rent-seeking expenditures Source: Azfar and Azfar 2009.

Personnel-related corruption- Hiring, postings, transfers, promotions and even regular salaries payments are all open to corruption. Those on hired based on considerations other than merit can hardly be expected to per- form their assigned duties. In other cases, teachers are \u201chired\u201d but simply do not exist: they are \u201cghost teachers,\u201d a practice quite common in South Asia. In this part of the region, teachers pay between US $200 and $1,400 to get a job and then collect a monthly salaries of US $70-$100. They do the minimum possible work but have to share their salaries with their supervisors, who turn a blind eye to absenteeism. In Pak- istan, for example, it is estimated that around 32 per cent of the teachers nev- er show up for classes (Burke 2000), while many more who buy their jobs or procure them as favours are incompe- tent or even illiterate. In a study in Afghanistan, one third of teachers (out of total surveyed) indicat- ed that they had to pay a modest com- mission (on average equivalent to about US $1), usually to a bonded trustee, for the receipt of their salary every month a practice that was considered \u201cnor- mal\u201d as a fee for travel expenditures (World Bank 2005). One report states that, based on visits to many hundreds of classrooms in remote rural areas in Africa and Asia, where the majority of children live, roughly 70 per cent of teachers fail to show up for work on a typical day (Bennett 2000). Absenteeism is probably the most dis- cussed form of corruption in the litera- ture on corruption and education in developing countries. It not only has implications for cost (Table 4.2) and quality of teaching; it can generate cor- rupt values as students internalise cor- rupt practices as \u2018normal\u2019. 17 Table\ufffd4.2:\ufffdTeacher\ufffdabsence\ufffdrate\ufffdin\ufffdsome\ufffdAsia\ufffdPacific\ufffdcountries\ufffdand\ufffdcost\ufffd implications Country Absence rate in primary schools (%) Budget leakage (estimate in %) India (2002) 25 22.5 Indonesia (2002) 18 16.2 Papua New Guinea (2001) 15 13.5 Source: Hallak and Poisson 2007. Corruption with theft - Stealing goods- Not only funds, but material resources also disappear through corruption with theft, undermining the quality of the education system and diverting benefits to unintended beneficiaries. Corruption can occur in the purchase of textbooks, desks, blackboards, and other supplies, as well as in contracts for cleaning services and meals. Sup- plies and funds are frequently misap- propriated. In one province in Pakistan a social audit estimated that only 16 per cent of textbooks procured by the gov- ernment reached the intended children (CIET 1999). In Bangladesh in 2001, 25 million secondary level children started the school year without textbooks and when the books were finally delivered they were found to be full of errors (U4 Anti-corruption Centre n.d.). \u2022 4.3 Effects of corruption in education services The human cost of corruption has been assessed in several specific studies. For example, the impact on girls\u2019 education and drop out rates was illustrated by the results of a social audit in the North- west Frontier province in Pakistan. School facilities were a major factor in determining whether parents sent girls to schools. On the day of the survey con- ducted by CIET, only 44 per cent of the schools had latrines. CIET estimated that just providing latrines in schools could increase the enrolment rate by 17 per cent. The survey revealed that teachers\u2019 attendance, punctuality, be- haviour and teaching were also impor- tant: if parents were not satisfied, a girl was 5.5 times more likely to drop out than if the parents were satisfied (CIET 1997). Several studies \u2014 notably Gupta et al. (2000) and Rajkumar and Swaoop (2002) \u2014 have shown negative effects of corruption on education outcomes in cross-country analyses18.

After controlling for income, corruption is correlated with repeater rates and drop-out rates, but not with enrolment, persistence to grade five or illiteracy. The coefficients on repeater rates and drop-out rates each fall by about a third, implying cor- respondingly smaller effects of corrup- tion on education outcomes. The coeffi- cient of 0.20 on drop-out rates implies that a two-point improvement in the corruption index would reduce drop- out rates by around 33 per cent. Gupta et al. (2000) also conducted a multivariate analysis of drop-out rates, controlling for average female educa- tion among adults, public education spending, the dependency ratio and ur- banization. Though the coefficient drops to 0.13, they found a persistently sig- nificant effect of corruption on drop-out rates, implying that a two-point im- provement in the corruption index would reduce drop-out rates by around 22 per cent. Clearly, there seems to be huge divi- dends from tackling corruption in edu- cation \u2013 the immediate universalisation of education is of value in itself; it shapes young minds to allow them to lead and sustain future generations; it could raise productivity; and improve health condi- tions. Better educated populations are also part of the solution set on the pre- ventive side. Governments urgently need to address corruption in education without which schools will continue to transmit a culture of corruption to suc- ceeding generations. This will under- mine anti-corruption initiatives. \u2022 4.4 Uprooting corruption in the education sector Though few countries in the region have been able to approach the issue in an effective manner, a number of initiatives have been tried, some more successfully than others. Given the wide geographical spread and large staff involved in education services, the evidence shows that closer supervision from above combined with greater control over schools by communities, through parent-teacher associations and other local organizations, has worked. Some successful initiatives include: Digital attendance in India- Most rural schools in Rajasthan have only one teacher. When the teacher is absent, children miss an entire day of school. Because villages are often remote, it is difficult to monitor attendance and the absentee rate has been over 40 per cent. The NGO Seva Mandir came up with a novel solution \u2013 requiring teachers to take a photo of themselves with the students at the beginning and end of each school day, using cameras with tamper-proof date and time functions. They randomly selected 60 schools to serve as treatment schools and another 60 as a control group. Teachers received a salary of about US $22 if they were present for at least 21 days in a month and a bonus of US $1 for each additional day but were penalized US $1 for each day they were absent. In the control schools, teachers simply received a monthly salary of US $22 but were reminded that they could be fired for poor attendance and were warned of unannounced monthly school visits. The results were striking. The schools with cameras made dramatic improvements and increased the number of child-days taught per month by one-third. The experiment was also 19 cost-effective: average salaries in both groups were similar, excluding the costs of cameras and programme administration \u2013 annually around US $6 per child (Banerjee and Duflo 2006). Counting books in the Philippines- Textbook procurement and delivery in the Philippines has long been plagued by theft, patronage and favouritism. To tackle this, one of the country\u2019s best- known anti-corruption advocacy groups, Transparent Accountable Governance (TAG), organized Book Count 2 in 2004. This initiative brings together a range of civil society groups, from NGOs to churches to Girl and Boy Scout groups, to monitor the delivery of books all over the Philippines. TAG is a joint project of the Makati Business Club, the Philippines Center for Investigative Journalism, the Philippines Center for Policy Studies, and Social Weather Stations, with funding provided by USAID, through a partnership with the Asia Foundation (Johnston 2009). Community management in Indonesia- In some schools in Indonesia corruption in the management of funds has been minimized by the involvement of parents\u2019 associations, which decide on the use of these funds and monitor them to ensure that they reach their intended destination. At the beginning of the school year, school officials meet with representatives of the parents\u2019 association to agree on an annual plan and provided them with a detailed accounting of expenditures during the year. The system works because the use of funds is highly structured, expenditures are transparent and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d98a7b6-6314-4d64-9f51-e80e728e5153": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d98a7b6-6314-4d64-9f51-e80e728e5153", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2395233d21d6f5d5f212b07d1023b59257d694c9740e19e73ffe10400eff1790"}, "3": {"node_id": "b38be5ba-6291-4ab9-9030-031f055b440e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/challenging-corruption-prioritising-social-services-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57ca57f4b4eb71b8124f4b9f8ac44907ecd887e4126788cff05da257489aa88b"}}, "hash": "4681dd1cf39a0a39e50435c5f47c4380002f50adcd465e314529c101c6bc484f", "text": "community attaches considerable importance to the system with pride in its success (Chapman 2002). Ultimately fighting corruption should rely less on external controls and deterrents and more on prevention through institutionalized checks and balances, self-motivation, mutual respect and self-discipline. A number of countries in the region - from Mongolia to Papua New Guinea have introduced some form of anti-corruption education forchildren to help them take a stand on corruption, thus countering corruption through prevention. Public education is an important part of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in Hong Kong, China (SAR). These examples are an indication of what is possible. What works in one context may not work in another. Some countries have, for example, had good experiences with decentralization but in others this has merely shifted corruption from one level of administration to another. No single intervention will be sufficient in itself, rather the more successful approaches have combined a better understanding of the problem with incentives, supervision, sanctions and participation (UNICEF Islamabad 2007). 20 Challenging Corruption: Prioritising Social Services for Human Development \u2022 5.1 Why is health important yet vulnerable? Developing countries in the region have been expanding health services, though the region as a whole still spends less as a percentage of GDP than some other parts of the world. When much of this expenditure is eaten up by corruption, the situation is aggravated. Indeed, the literature based on cross- country regression using corruption indices and indicators of provision of health care services suggests that high corruption has adverse consequences on child and infant mortality rates (Gupta et al. 2000). Here we plot infant mortality rate (2004) and World Bank CCI (2007, for 177 countries around the world. The plot (Figure 5.1) indicates that countries with high corruption have high infant mortality rates. This association is particularly evident for Asia: many countries have high infant mortality rates coexisting with high perceptions of corruption; Bhutan is an outlier. Causality is plausible for a number of reasons, including widespread fraudulent practices
