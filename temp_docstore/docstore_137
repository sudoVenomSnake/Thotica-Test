The extent of occupancy has been estimated at 983,000 km2 (BirdLife International, 2018). Syrmaticus reevesii was widely distributed and quite common in central China in the relatively recent past (Cheng et al., 1978). While the species was widely known from western, central to eastern provinces of China historically, now there remain three main shrinking fragmented subpopulations in the Dabie Mountains, the Qinling Mountains and the Shennongjia mountainous massif, and the species\u2019 range has become divided into eastern and western regions (Zhou et al., 2015). The population size began to decrease during the mid-20th century due to illegal hunting and habitat destruction. According to the report of the First National Terrestrial Wildlife Resource Survey published in 2009, there were about 23,000 S. reevesii in the wild in China. In 2018, the Red List estimated the population size to be 3,500-15,000 (approximately 3,000 \u2013 5,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International, 2018)), with a decreasing population trend. The effective population size of this pheasant has decreased by about 99% in the past one thousand years, and the species was found to have experienced a severe genetic bottleneck. Surveys from 2011-2012 in 89 historical distribution sites covering the species\u2019 entire post-1980 known range in central China found that the pheasant had disappeared from 46% of the surveyed sites and revealed a population decline in a further 46 sites (52%) (including protected areas, although densities were higher than in non-protected areas), and the authors estimated a population reduction of \u226550% over the last 10 years (Zhou et al., 2015), equivalent to two generations (the species has a generation length of 5 years according to BirdLife International, 2018). From 2007-2015, 41 kg and 3,674 pieces of feathers of S. reevesii were commercially imported into the EU reportedly originating from China.

Online surveys indicate that feathers are the main parts in trade (the tail feathers of the male of the species can measure up to 2.4m in length, the longest of any pheasant). In the past the tail feathers were used as a decoration in traditional opera costumes in China. Now, operas generally use plastic or dyed stitched feathers as IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 18 95 substitutes. Demand for feathers in Europe is reportedly for circus costumes, home decorating and flower arranging, and fly tying for the fishing industry. It appears most of the feather markets are rather niche, and there are alternative sources of materials for all of these uses (J. Carroll, in litt., 2019). It has been reported that feather imports to Europe have dramatically decreased in length (which is age related) and increased in price, suggesting that availability has decreased (J. Carroll, in litt., 2019). Removal of tail feathers might affect the success of courtship and mating; one adult male pheasant can only grow two long tail feathers in each year. It is not clear whether tail feathers are generally removed from live or dead birds. The majority of adverts for S. reevesii specimens found online (whether Chinese or English language) do not specify whether the source is wild or captive; those that do (generally for live birds/eggs rather than feathers) specify that they are sourced from captive birds. Some adverts include a copy of the relevant permit for the breeding facility but most do not. Feathers from captive-bred and wild birds would be indistinguishable (J. Carroll, in litt., 2019). Additional Information Threats Illegal hunting, habitat destruction, and poison in farmland are the three main threats to the survival of this species. Surveys conducted in 2011-2012 in 43 sites with presence of the species found 83%, 26% and 20% of sites had evidence of poaching, habitat loss and use of poison, respectively (Zhou et al., 2015). According to the IUCN Red List assessment, the main threat to the species is the continuing deforestation within its range, which is reducing and fragmenting its habitat (BirdLife International, 2018). The species is threatened by poaching for food by local communities and their eggs are also illegally collected for food or breeding (see section above). According to the Database of Legal Instruments of China, 11 S. reevesii were known to be poached for food by indigenous farmers and one individual bird was illegally traded in Anhui Province from 2013-2017. One person who illegally hunted four S. reevesii was sentenced to five years in prison and 30,000 RMB fine (http://miliwealth.com/plus/view.php?aid=938). Conservation, management and legislation Syrmaticus reevesii has been listed as a second class species on the list of Wildlife under Special State Protection of China since 1989, which is under the protection of the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Protection of Wildlife, and Regulations on the Nature Reserves of the People's Republic of China. The hunting, killing, selling, buying and utilisation of this pheasant and its products is strictly prohibited. Administrative approvals by provincial conservation competent departments are needed for selling, buying and utilisation of this pheasant and its products for special purposes like scientific research, captive breeding and public exhibitions. Permission from the relevant responsible department of the State Council must be obtained for the export of this pheasant and its products. The Chinese Government has taken a series of actions to conserve forests in recent decades, including a ban on logging in the middle and upper reaches of large rivers and imposing forests under the National Forest Protection Programme. At present, there are 49 national nature reserves (NNRs) which include S. reevesii on the lists of protection objectives. The total area of all relevant NNRs is more than 17,040 km2.

The species has been introduced to many countries outside China since the beginning of the last century for sport hunting and for ornamental purposes. The UK first introduced this pheasant in 1831. After that, many European countries and the USA began to introduce this pheasant directly or indirectly from China. Introduced populations are reported in the Czech Republic, France, Pakistan and the USA. Among them, the populations in Pakistan and the USA may rely on recruits due to the low population size and the effect of inbreeding degradation, while independent populations can be found in the wild in the Czech Republic and France. It is treated as a game or sport hunting species in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In the UK on some estates there is a history of mixing a few S. reevesii in with other pheasant species for driven shooting. Most of those are reared locally. There should be no market for importing wild S. reevesii from China although it might take place in IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 18 96 the mistaken belief wild birds would naturalise more readily (J. Carroll, in litt., 2019). However, further deliberate releases of this species into the wild are illegal in the UK (S. Dowell, in litt., 2019). The Zoological Information Management System managed by Species360 provided holding records of S. reevesii indicating that 258 individuals can be found in 60 institutions from Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The average number of individuals in these institutions is fewer than ten, except for some zoos, and 47 chicks were hatched within the last year. This species is widely held and bred successfully in captivity so the population is likely to be much larger than the known zoo population. At present there is no formal studbook for the captive population of this species (S. Dowell, in litt., 2019). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Distinctive stripes and colour patterns on the tail feathers of pheasants can be used in distinguishing between different Phasianidae species, including the other species in the genus (three other species in the genus have been included in CITES Appendix I since 1975: S. humiae and S. ellioti occur in mainland China while S. mikado occurs in Taiwan, Province of China).

Hunting of the species for food, use of parts in traditional medicine, and use of feathers in traditional dance have also been reported as a threat in certain areas. Legal international trade was mainly for commercial purposes and zoos. Hunting and trapping are considered to have contributed to the near-extinction of the species in Mali and Nigeria and localised declines in Senegal. Since 2007 exporters have reported a total of 524 live B. pavonina in trade, 36% of which were reportedly captive-born or bred, although the species is considered difficult to maintain and breed in captivity. Concerns over the sustainability of the reported trade in wild- sourced birds led to the species being included in the Review of Significant Trade (RST) and resulted in recommendations to suspend trade from Guinea, Sudan, South Sudan and Mali which remain in place. Illegal trade, including cross-border trade, is reported to be a concern in at least seven range States, however the extent of this trade is unclear. Habitat loss and degradation, human and livestock disturbance, and direct poisoning to reduce crop depredation also reportedly pose a threat to the species. Balearica pavonina is legally protected in most range States, but this protection is considered to be largely ineffective due to low public awareness and insufficient resources for enforcement. Analysis: Balearica pavonina has a wide but fragmented distribution and low productivity. It has an estimated population of 43,000\u201370,000 individuals. In 2010, the population was estimated to have declined by 30\u201349% over three generations (45 years), but the true decline may be greater depending on the status of one of the two subspecies, B. p. ceciliae, for which reliable population estimates are not available due to political instability within its range. Although the species is legally protected in most range States, live trapping for local domestication and international trade has reportedly been the cause of severe declines in certain populations. Concerns regarding implementation of the Appendix II listing have been raised through the RST process, with three range States (and one non- range State) currently subject to recommendations to suspend trade. While current reported levels of trade in wild specimens are low, illegal international trade is reported to be a concern, although the extent of this trade is unclear. Since the species is affected by international trade and the estimated population decline may be close to and could exceed 50% over the last 45 years, B. pavonina is likely to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 19 98 Other Considerations: Trade suspensions are in place for several range States through the RST process, and it appears that much of the international trade that currently takes place in wild specimens is illegal; it is therefore unclear what additional protection inclusion in Appendix I would provide. However, given concerns over illegal trade and reported declines caused by harvest, a suspension of further trade from wild sources may be in the conservation interest of the species. B. pavonina is considered similar to the Grey Crowned-crane B. regulorum, which occurs in Eastern and Southern Africa, and was not previously distinguished as a separate species. B. regulorum is currently included in Appendix II and therefore a transfer of B. pavonina to Appendix I may present implementation difficulties.

It was also agreed that all Parties should suspend trade in this species from Guinea, Sudan, South Sudan, and Tanzania. These trade suspensions remain in place (Notification No. 2018/006). B. pavonina from Mali was included in the RST at AC29 (July 2017) and categorised as \u201caction is needed\u201d at AC30 in July 2018 (AC30 Com. 11 (Rev. by Sec.)). The working group noted that the recorded trade levels in wild specimens of this species were very high (90 birds between 2015 and 2016) considering the population in Mali was estimated to be 100 birds in 2004. It was suggested that birds may be coming from neighbouring countries but were not reported as re-exports, noting that Guinea is subject to a trade suspension for this species. The AC recommended a number of actions to be taken by Mali, including publication of an interim zero export quota within 30 days (which does not appear to have been published yet) and studies on the status of the species and harvest levels for use in making NDFs within two years. At SC70 the SC requested the Secretariat follow up with Mali to clarify the origin, provenance, and legal acquisition of specimens that were exported in 2015 and 2016 (SC70 Sum. 8). Taxonomy Two subspecies are recognised: B. p. pavonina and B. p. ceciliae. The Grey Crowned-crane B. regulorum, which occurs in Eastern and Southern Africa, is considered a separate species by both the current and former CITES Standard References for birds (Sibley & Monroe, 1990; Dickinson, 2003), although historically was not considered a separate species by some.

Vagrant in: Benin; Burkina Faso; Central African Republic; Congo, The Democratic Republic of the; C\u00f4te d'Ivoire; Egypt; Eritrea; Sierra Leone; Togo; Uganda. Possibly Extinct in Nigeria (BirdLife International, 2016). IUCN Global Category Vulnerable A4bcd (2016) ver. 3.1. Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population In 2004, it was estimated that the number of B. p. pavonina was approximately 15,000 individuals and B. p. ceciliae was approximately 28,000\u201355,000 individuals in the wild; this would bring the total population estimate to 43,000\u201370,000 individuals or roughly 28,000\u201347,000 mature individuals. B) Restricted area of distribution IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 19 99 Balearica pavonina does not have a restricted area of distribution. The species occurs from Senegal and the Gambia to central Ethiopia, northern Uganda, and northwestern Kenya, and is known to occur as far south as Difule on the Uganda-Sudan border, the northwest corner of Murchison Falls National Park and the northern portion of Lake Turkana. Balearica pavonina pavonina occupies the western part of this range and scattered populations occur throughout sub-Saharan West Africa from Senegal and the Gambia to Chad, while B. p. ceciliae occurs in eastern sub-Saharan Africa from Chad to Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and northern Kenya, especially in the upper Nile River basin. Within this range, populations are limited to wetland habitats and have become severely fragmented. C) Decline in number of wild individuals This species has shown rapid population and range declines in recent surveys which are predicted to continue, primarily due to habitat loss and trapping for domestication or illegal international trade. B. p. pavonina: Survey results indicate that the range of B. p. pavonina, which was historically nearly contiguous across West Africa, has been severely fragmented with large gaps between many of the subpopulations. It is estimated that B. p. pavonina declined from 15,000\u201320,000 individuals in 1985 to 15,000 individuals in 2004.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83bbde4b-4873-4554-b9b2-213a413feb73": {"__data__": {"id_": "83bbde4b-4873-4554-b9b2-213a413feb73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c20f460731cd331603430a8289fac6c4eb1b4d1667519e96c31edf2f4519f3d5"}, "2": {"node_id": "557764b6-8fb0-4e51-8cc0-8019041600b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98d10e67baa71ca689f170b1ce296c3311fa68e010b4c0a31f6c58b0716fe229"}}, "hash": "5e6399e326cf4fdbdd8718cb4373a6ed912d337df2d814b95db3e708f74b90f2", "text": "B. p. ceciliae: Trend data for B. p. ceciliae is poorly known but may have undergone a more substantial decline from 50,000\u201370,000 individuals in 1985 to 28,000\u201355,000 individuals in 2004.

Population declines are reported to have taken place in Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Nigeria, Mali, South Sudan, and Togo, but the extent of these declines is unclear (AC26 Doc. 12.2 (Annex)). The Mali population may also be extinct (no cranes were reported during a count in 2014 in the country (AC30 Doc. 12.2 (Rev. 1)).

Since accessing large sections of the range is difficult to impossible due to unrest and insurgent control, we do not have the data and trend statistics to fully understand the extent of the decline in the species (K. Morrison, in litt., 2019). Should the worst-case scenario for B. p. ceciliae prove to be accurate this species may warrant uplisting (i.e. to Endangered) in the future (BirdLife International, 2016). Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade International trade over the period between 1986 and 2017 consisted principally of live birds, with small quantities of bodies, skins, feathers, trophies, and scientific specimens also reported in trade. The majority of trade involved wild-sourced birds, with trade in captive-bred specimens also reported. Trade was primarily for commercial purposes, with live birds also traded for breeding in captivity, as personal possessions and, to a lesser extent, for zoos, circuses or travelling exhibitions, education, and scientific purposes. Tanzania was the biggest exporter of B. pavonina between 1986 and 1995 even though the species is not found in this country; it is unclear whether the trade was misidentified, and the birds exported were actually Grey Crowned-crane B. regulorum for which Tanzania is a range country, or the birds were imported from other countries and sold in Tanzania. Guinea also exported a large number of cranes, having its highest exports between 1991 and 1995, but this number decreased in subsequent years. Between 1996 and 2000 Mali was a significant exporter with a decrease in exports between 2001 and 2010 but rising again between 2011 and 2015. Sudan was the biggest exporter between 2001 and 2005. According to the CITES Trade Database, from 2007 onwards exporters reported direct exports of 524 live birds (304 or 58% wild-sourced) while importers reported imports of 357 live birds (226 or 63% wild-sourced). Mali and Sudan were the top exporters of wild-sourced birds in this period (177 and 48 birds reported by Mali and Sudan IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 19 100 respectively, and 120 and 50 birds reported by importers from these two countries); Sudan was also the second biggest exporter of live birds reported as source \u201cC\u201d (74 birds reported by Sudan and 30 reported by importers). Non-range States reported exports of 169 live birds in this period; the main exporter was the Netherlands (exporting 77 birds). The main importer was China (41% of exporter-reported live birds), followed by Qatar (8%), Oman (5%), Kuwait (5%), and Russia (5%). According to exporter-reported data, direct trade in wild-sourced live birds from range States from 2007 onwards peaked in 2011 (80 birds) and subsequently declined (10 birds in 2015 and none reported in 2016 onwards). However, importers reported imports of 90 wild-sourced live birds direct from Mali between 2015 and 2016 (and not reported by Mali as either direct exports or re-exports, although annual reports have been submitted by the country for both years).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58278b47-494e-42d8-9944-85dfc21994aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "58278b47-494e-42d8-9944-85dfc21994aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ff6ffff561ecc5513abc9d55e0ed8734b460afd9d6fdc1cb80682059f676f33"}, "2": {"node_id": "992c8e75-9762-4340-ad85-7fbf22dbfecb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cb95fbebb9ffa8b60b370be24b21493bfac850b24a0d1789e0c5c975273554b"}}, "hash": "317be80e94a53403499ea5e8ba678d6af37e605e47a3e7cd88c4055c96b71c1b", "text": "Nigeria reported exports of eight live, wild-sourced B. pavonina in 2014 which is of concern since recent surveys indicate this species is extinct in the wild in Nigeria (although Edet et al.

Both the legal and illegal trade in B. pavonina is reported to have depleted the species in the wild. In 2011 there was reported to be evidence of cross-border illegal trade between Chad, Cameroon, and Nigeria which is considered a major threat to the species; cranes were reportedly sold at high prices in Nigeria for export to the Middle East (Tursha & Boyi, 2011). The capture of live individuals for export to international private markets was reported to be a particularly significant problem in Guinea; around 20 individuals were imported illegally into South Africa in December 2011, with unconfirmed reports that they originated in Guinea (AC26 Doc. 12.2 Annex). Kone et al., (2007) reported that trade in cranes was extremely common in Mali; between 1998 and 2000, 524 individuals were captured in a region in central Mali with a wild population of only about 1,500 individuals, and exports of the species continued despite being made illegal in 1998. The capture of individuals for international trade was reported to be a particularly significant threat to the species in Sudan/South Sudan (AC26 Doc. 12.2 Annex). The International Crane Foundation/Endangered Wildlife Trust Partnership commissioned a rapid assessment of B. pavonina trade from Sudan in 2009/2010, conducted by the Sudanese Wildlife Society, which concluded that only 12% of all B. pavonina exports were given CITES export permits and appeared in the CITES Trade Database (Hashim, 2010). Sudan reported the export of 30 B. pavonina in 2009-2010, therefore an additional ca. 220 cranes were apparently exported without permits (it is not known how many of either the reported or unreported cranes were wild-caught as opposed to captive-bred; according to K. Morrison (in litt., 2019) it is likely that a large proportion, if not all, were wild). Additional Information Threats Estimates of change in the habitat available for B. pavonina have not been made. However, habitat loss poses a significant threat and has had an impact on population numbers. Habitat loss and degradation occur through conversion of wetlands to agriculture, over-exploitation of wetlands, overgrazing, wetland drainage, dam construction, cutting of roost trees, agricultural and industrial pollution, and industrial construction. Human and livestock disturbance also play a role in reducing breeding productivity (K. Morrison, in litt., 2019). In addition, indiscriminate pesticide application may be leading to harmful bio-accumulation of toxins, and direct poisoning to reduce crop depredation has been reported in East Africa (Williams et al., 2003). A study from 2003 noted that warfare and political instability affects nations across the range of the species, particularly in South Sudan where the implementation of crane conservation measures has not been able to proceed (Williams et al., 2003), it is likely that this is still the case. In addition to habitat loss, live trapping may be the most significant threat to B. pavonina. It has been reported that this species is highly prized in private collections. Birds are either trapped or eggs and chicks are removed from the nests and the individuals are raised in captivity and sold on the local, regional, or international market for considerable profit. It was reported in 2001 that a profit of ca. USD 213 could be made in the trade of one bird in the Kano market in Nigeria. Poaching for food and the use of heads and wings in traditional medicine has also been reported, although in the Casamance region of Senegal and in parts of Burkina Faso the eating of cranes is taboo. Around the area of Niokolo-koba National Park in southeastern Senegal, near the Guinea-Bissau border, B. pavonina feathers are used in ritualised traditional dance and this has seriously affected the species. The hunting and trapping of B. pavonina have resulted in the virtual elimination of the species in Nigeria and could IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 19 101 lead to its extinction in Mali; 86% of crane captors interviewed in Mali in 2001 had noticed a decline in the number of cranes in the Inner Niger Delta, and directly attributed the decline to crane capture (Kone et al., 2007).

Conservation, management and legislation Balearica pavonina is legally protected in most range States but this protection is thought to be inadequate; many countries do not have the financial resources to control illegal hunters. For example, in Mali, B. pavonina was listed as a fully protected species in Law No. 95-031 on the management of wildlife and habitats, and exports of the species from Mali were made illegal in 1998. However, interviews revealed that few crane owners were aware of the legislation, and exports continued, albeit limited by the high costs of transportation and taxes. In Niger, protection in most wetlands was reported in 1996 to be insufficient and hunting and capture, although illegal, was still taking place on a small scale. In 1999, the Black Crowned Crane Programme was launched by the International Crane Foundation and Wetlands International to identify key areas where effective projects could be conducted to help in the conservation of the cranes and their habitat. As part of this effort, a network was established across 20 nations in West, Central, and East Africa to identify key areas where effective projects could be established for conservation of the species and their habitat. A Conservation Management Plan was published in 2003 which identified 226 sites that supported B. pavonina. Approximately 21% or 48 of these sites have some degree of official habitat protection that includes National Parks (12%), Ramsar sites (4%), reserves (4%), and locally protected sites (1%). Artificial Propagation/captive breeding Breeding success of cranes in captivity is considered to be very low and birds are known generally to be short- lived and prone to diseases and injury. In Mali, breeding attempts have been unsuccessful. Nigeria conducted an experimental release in 1992 in association with the West African Crane Conference. There have been discussions of developing a captive breeding program in Borno State, Nigeria and a release program in the Chingurme-Duguma section of the Chad Basin National Park but only if habitat conditions are assessed and a habitat management plan is implemented. The Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens (CAZG) and the Association of Zoos and Aquaria (AZA in the USA) both have B. pavonina studbooks in place that are actively managed. This will improve the captive situation for the species within these two formal zoo association structures. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) too has plans for a studbook to be developed to improve the captive management of this species. Note that only captive facilities that are members of these associations can be included in the studbook (at least to a large degree), and that very few private captive facilities are included in these studbooks (K. Morrison, in litt., 2019). Implementation challenges (including similar species) The Grey Crowned-crane B. regulorum, which is also currently included in Appendix II, looks very similar to B. pavonina. The Black Crowned-crane is distinguished by the red found in the lower part of the cheek patch, a darker neck and smaller wattle. The Grey Crowned-crane looks rather similar and is classified at a higher level of threat on the IUCN Red List (Endangered; assessed in 2016) and the literature suggests it may be even more impacted by (international) trade (R. Thomas, in litt., 2019). Other comments A large proportion of the population may be in Sudan and South Sudan; South Sudan is not currently a Party to CITES, and a trade suspension is already in place for both Sudan and South Sudan.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 22 103 Transfer of the Mexican population of American Crocodile Crocodylus acutus from Appendix I to Appendix II Proponent: Mexico Summary: The proponents seek to transfer the Mexican population of American Crocodile Crocodylus acutus from Appendix I to Appendix II. Since submission, the proponent has indicated to the CITES Secretariat its intention to amend the proposal to include a zero export quota for wild specimens for consideration at CoP18. The species was included in Appendix II in 1975 and transferred to Appendix I in 1981; the population of Cuba and several Colombian populations were transferred to Appendix II in 2005 and 2017, respectively. Crocodylus acutus is a widely distributed species, occurring in 17 range States from the USA and Mexico through to Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. In Mexico, the species is found in both fresh and saltwater habitats in coastal and inland areas, with a distribution area estimated at just under 200,000 km2 from Sinaloa to Chiapas states on the Pacific coast to the eastern coast of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. The species was categorised as globally Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2009. While severely depleted historically due to overexploitation for skins, substantial recovery is reported to have taken place in several countries including Mexico, and the global population is determined to be increasing. Surveys have indicated continued increases in certain localities in Mexico, and increases in reported incidences of human-crocodile interactions in the country may be indicative of an increasing population. Although there is no reliable estimate of the current population size in Mexico, available survey data are not consistent with the wild population being small. Reported threats in Mexico include illegal hunting for skins and meat, and habitat loss and degradation particularly as a result of tourism developments in coastal areas. There is evidence of inbreeding in certain populations that have been fragmented by tourism developments in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. Genetic introgression with Morelet's Crocodile Crocodylus moreletii is also reported as a natural occurrence in this area and may pose an additional threat. The species is in demand for international trade in skins and there are plans to develop and implement a management scheme that will aim to replicate that already in place for C. moreletii in the country, in consultation with the national CITES Authorities and experts in the species. This scheme will involve a combination of ranching and captive breeding, with egg collection limited to localities where monitoring indicates that populations are healthy and stable. The intended prohibition of trade in wild specimens is expected to mitigate potential negative impacts on wild populations while the proposed management scheme is refined. Analysis: The available information indicates that the Mexican population of Crocodylus acutus does not meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I: it has a wide distribution within the country, and the population appears to have recovered substantially since the Appendix I listing, with continued increases in certain areas. Regarding the Precautionary Measures outlined in Annex 4 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), the species is in demand for international trade and a managed ranching/captive-breeding programme will be developed in co-ordination with the national CITES Authorities and other experts. The proponents have indicated their intention to amend the proposal to include a zero export quota for wild specimens, although it is not clear whether the quota would also apply to ranched specimens.

Taxonomy Although there are studies evaluating the possibility that a subpopulation of C. acutus on Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast is a distinct species, CITES currently only recognises the existence of a single species. Range Crocodylus acutus occurs in the coastal zones of 17 countries of the American continent: Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic, the USA and Venezuela (the SS lists 18 countries including Cayman Islands). The Cayman Islands population may have been extirpated, with only occasional sightings of individuals that have dispersed from Jamaica, Cuba and Central America. Cayman Islands are not mentioned as being part of the species\u2019 range in the Red List assessment for the species (Ponce-Campos et al., 2012). IUCN Global Category Vulnerable A2cd (2009) ver. 3.1. Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population Although there is no current estimate of the size of the national population of the species, a review of 50 monitoring studies conducted over the last 30 years in 86 water bodies across the species\u2019 distribution range in Mexico (all states with the exception of Yucat\u00e1n) found that around 50% of studies reported encounter rates greater than or equal to 5 individuals/km, a value higher than that of Crocodylus moreletii in Mexico, for which the encounter rate is 3.23 individuals/km and has healthy populations (currently listed in Appendix II). The percentage of studies with encounter rates greater than or equal to 5 individuals/km was 56% for studies in the period 1988\u20131997 (range 0.4\u201373.4 individuals/km), 47% for 1998\u20132007 (0.1\u201351 individuals/km) and 47% for 2008\u20132018 (0.3\u2013163 individuals/km). Although no \u201cguestimates\u201d of the absolute number of individuals in the population can be made with any confidence from the available survey data, the survey data are consistent with the wild population not being small. The population unequivocally meets the criteria for Appendix II (IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group, in litt., 2019). Crocodylus acutus was previously listed in the Official Mexican Standard NOM-059-ECOL-1994 as Rare. In 2001 it was re-categorised as Subject to Special Protection (the lowest risk within the Standard) and has been maintained in this category up to the most recent version of the Standard (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010). B) Restricted area of distribution The global distribution area estimated by IUCN is ca. 2,533,582.33 km2. In Mexico, the species occurs in the states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoac\u00e1n, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Quintana Roo and Yucat\u00e1n (with isolated records in Sonora and Campeche). For the present proposal, a re-estimation of the national distribution area was made based on bibliographic information and the experience of experts; the result was an estimated area of ca. 199,765 km2, equivalent to 10.2% of the national territory. C) Decline in number of wild individuals The global population trend was determined to be increasing in the 2009 IUCN Red List assessment of the species: overall numbers are still depleted in some countries such as Colombia and Ecuador, but substantial recovery has taken place in other areas including Cuba, Costa Rica, Mexico and Venezuela (Thorbjarnarson et al., 2006). In the review of 50 monitoring studies described above, repeated monitoring over a period of five or more years was conducted in five localities, and in all cases the populations were observed to be stable or increasing. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 22 105 The population low point regionally and in Mexico was in the 1960s\u201370s, prior to hunting bans implemented in the 1970s.

Species likely to be in demand for trade, but its management is such that the CoP will be satisfied with: A) Implementation by the range States of the requirements of the Convention, in particular Article IV; and B) appropriate enforcement controls and compliance with the requirements of the Convention Mexico has announced its intention to amend the present proposal at CoP18 to include a zero-export quota for wild-sourced specimens and has submitted documents to this effect to the CITES Secretariat (H. Ben\u00edtez, in litt., 2019). This precautionary measure is to allow time to develop management systems in order to ensure compliance with Article IV, although it is not clear whether the quota would also apply to ranched specimens. Any removal of this quota would need to be the subject of a new amendment proposal thus allowing the Parties to assess the progress made by Mexico. The objective of transferring the species to Appendix II is to lay the foundations to replicate the successful management scheme implemented for C. moreletii in Mexico (monitoring and habitat conservation programme in combination with ranching of eggs from the wild and captive breeding) and sustain a trade that benefits local communities, the species and its habitat. Ranching will be limited to localities where monitoring indicates that populations are healthy and stable, in local communities committed to the conservation and sustainable use of the species and its habitat, with the endorsement of the Group of Specialists in Crocodilians in Mexico (GEC- Mexico) and the national CITES Authorities. Therefore, no hunting or trade of specimens other than skins produced on farms will be authorised. It is expected that the ranching activities to be carried out under the Wildlife Conservation Management Units (UMA) scheme will promote the conservation of C. acutus habitat as a source of revenue for the communities and serve to mitigate land use change (see \u201cThreats\u201d below). The GEC-Mexico is preparing a C. acutus monitoring programme which aims to monitor the status and trends of the main wild populations of C. acutus in the entire area of its distribution in Mexico. In order to facilitate the implementation of this programme, the operating model has been taken from the C. moreletii monitoring programme for Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. This programme is intended to be implemented from 2019 at the national level, and will be promoted by state authorities, academia, private initiatives and communities. The IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (in litt., 2019) considers that the management programme developed by Mexico for C. moreletii is exemplary and demonstrates that Mexico clearly has the capacity to manage wild populations of crocodilians such as C. acutus. Export quota or other special measure Mexico has confirmed its intention to amend the present proposal at CoP18 to include a zero-export quota for wild-sourced specimens (H. Ben\u00edtez, in litt., 2019). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 22 106 Additional Information Threats In Mexico, habitat modification resulting from tourism developments in coastal areas has been one of the main threats to the species, since it has replaced or modified the sandy beaches where C. acutus normally nests. Habitat loss resulting from tourism developments in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula has resulted in population fragmentation with evidence of inbreeding (Machkour-M\u2019Rabet et al., 2009). In the Pacific, breeding of cattle near crocodile nesting areas has a negative impact by reducing the hatching rate through trampling. A poorly evaluated threat is the use of agrochemicals and spills of industrial and domestic sewage into rivers and coastal areas. In the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, hurricanes also pose a threat, as well as genetic introgression with the sympatric species C. moreletii. In some coastal areas of Chiapas, crocodile hunting is practiced for meat and to sell skin illegally, and in some communities they use them as pets.

This decline was attributed to the fact that the populations of the states of Sonora and Sinaloa are located in the geographic limits of the species, where the climatic conditions may be unfavourable for populations to be viable. Conservation, management and legislation Crocodylus acutus has been classified as Subject to Special Protection since 2001 in the Official Mexican Standard NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, which allows its use under certain conditions stipulated in the General Law of Wildlife and its Regulations. In Mexico there are three legal schemes through which crocodiles are managed: Wildlife Conservation Management Units (UMA), which may be free-ranging or intensive, and Premises and Facilities that Manage Wildlife in Confined Form (PIMVS). The UMA have among their main objectives the conservation of populations and habitat, while the PIMVS undertake controlled reproduction for exclusively commercial purposes. The Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) is in charge of evaluating the management plans and registering the UMA that have free-ranging populations of C. acutus. Likewise, it grants licences to the properties that are used for captive management (intensive UMA and PIMVS). It is also responsible for evaluating population studies or inventories to respond to requests for use of the species. The UMA and PIMVS must submit an annual activity report summarising the use that has taken place. The owners of UMA with free- ranging populations of C. acutus commit to conserving their habitat and their populations, in exchange for sustainable use that until now has been mostly for ecotourism and scientific purposes. Currently, Mexico has 58 UMAs (15 free-ranging and 43 intensive) and 24 PIMVS for the breeding of C. acutus. In the period 2000\u20132018, eight animals from free-ranging UMA and 39 animals from intensive UMA and PIMVS were authorised for national utilisation of various products including skins, meat and oil. There are 47 protected natural areas within the distribution of C. acutus. In 2018, the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) and the General Directorate of Wildlife of the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (DGVS-SEMARNAT) published the \u201cProgramme of Action for the Conservation of Species (PACE): Crocodylia (Crocodylus acutus, Crocodylus moreletii and Caiman Crocodilus chiapasius)\u201d which establishes guidelines for the management and conservation of the three Mexican species. A Group of Specialists in Crocodilians in Mexico (GEC-Mexico) was created in 2010, made up of experts from different sectors (government, academia, private enterprise, civil society, producers and communities), which is consulted periodically to support decision-making regarding the conservation and sustainable management of Mexican crocodilian species, and will be consulted in making decisions related to C. acutus to improve regulation and sustainable management of populations. The present proposal was developed during the GEC meeting held in 2018 with the support of the CITES Authorities of Mexico. Artificial propagation/captive breeding See above. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 22 107 Implementation challenges (including similar species) An identification guide for C. acutus and C. moreletii has been developed; features are highlighted to distinguish C.acutus from C. moreletii and C. crocodilus. However, it is known that there is sympatry and historical natural genetic exchange between C. moreletii and C. acutus in the populations of the Yucatan peninsula.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 23 Inclusion of Garden Lizards Calotes nigrilabris and Calotes pethiyagodai in Appendix I Proponent: Sri Lanka Summary: The Garden Lizards Calotes nigrilabris and C. pethiyagodai are members of the agamid lizard genus Calotes which comprises some 25 species in total occurring in South and South-east Asia. Both species are endemic to Sri Lanka, where they inhabit the high elevation areas of the Central Highlands and Knuckles Massif. Calotes nigrilabris is found within the Central Highlands region, primarily within montane and submontane cloud forests mainly at altitudes above 1,400 m, and has an estimated area of occupancy of around 300 km2, divided between five known sites. Calotes pethiyagodai, described in 2014, has only been recorded within the Knuckles Massif, at elevations of between 900 m and 1500 m above sea level, with an estimated range of less than 25 km2. No estimates of total population sizes are available for either species. In 1988, a density estimate for C. nigrilabris of 220 individuals per hectare was obtained and recent observations have suggested the population may be declining. Both species are reported to be affected by deforestation, the removal of forest understorey to grow cardamom, pesticides, road mortality and the spread of opportunistic predators, although there is little information on the direct impact of these threats. Both species have been offered for sale at relatively high prices both online and in physical markets in the USA and Europe, but trade instances appear to be low. Both species are protected under Sri Lankan law and harvest and export have been prohibited since 1993. It seems unlikely that all individuals observed for sale are the offspring of animals exported pre-1993 (particularly Calotes pethiyagodai which was only described in 2014), therefore it seems probable that wild animals are illegally entering the trade. Analysis: On the basis of a restricted area of distribution (<25 km2), with the extent and quality of this habitat in decline, Calotes pethiyagodai meets the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. For C. nigrilabris, the area of distribution is larger (estimates range from 300 to 500 km2), but this habitat is also fragmented and likely to be declining. It is possible that it meets the Appendix I biological criteria. In recent years, both species have been offered for sale within the hobbyist trade (although numbers appear low) and illegal collection from the wild is suspected. It is thought that adults of both species can be differentiated from each other, although it is more difficult with juveniles. As it seems that it is mainly adults in trade, if Parties decide that only one species meets the Appendix I criteria, the other should not necessarily be listed in Appendix II as a look-alike (for which there is no provision in Appendix I). Other Considerations: An additional six species of Calotes occur in Sri Lanka, of which four are also endemic. While identification guides exist, other Calotes species could be affected by a shift in harvest pressure were either species proposed here to be included in the Appendices, even though trade in all lizards is already prohibited under national legislation in Sri Lanka. Listing of other species in the genus native to Sri Lanka in Appendix III could also be considered; stipulating a zero export quota with the listing would reflect that export from Sri Lanka is illegal.

It is also recommended that the taxonomy of the isolated population of C. nigrilabris occurring in the Knuckles Massif be verified in the future. If this population represents a new species, the status of C. nigrilabris would need to be reassessed. Calotes pethiyagoda: Due to its recent description, no estimates of population size or density for this species have been made. Calotes pethiyagodai is not listed in either the IUCN Red List or the National Red List of Sri Lanka. The authors who described the species noted it would meet criterion B2b (iii) (area of occupancy <10 km2, and continuing decline in area, extent and/or quality of habitat) of the IUCN Red List criteria and should be considered endangered. B) Restricted area of distribution Calotes nigrilabris: Endemic to Sri Lanka. This species is found within the Central Highlands region, primarily within montane and submontane cloud forests >1,400 m above sea level (Amarasinghe et al., 2011; Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009) in Sri Lanka\u2019s wet zone. Calotes nigrilabris is classified as endangered within the National Red List of Sri Lanka, based on an area of occupancy <500 km2, in which its habitat is fragmented (MOE, 2012). Bahir and Surasinghe (2005) estimated this species\u2019 area of occupancy to be around 300 km2, divided between five known sites. The largest of these is the Horton Plains, ~2,200 m above sea level. Calotes pethiyagodai: Endemic to Sri Lanka, and has only been recorded within the Knuckles Massif, at elevations of >900 m (Amarasinghe et al., 2014). Across this mountain range, only 35 peaks exceed 915 m elevation (IUCN, 2010) and, based on observations at six spotting sites, this species is thought to be restricted to an area of occupancy of <25 km2 and an extent of occurrence of <180 km2, with the extent and quality of this habitat in decline (Amarasinghe et al., 2014). C) Decline in number of wild individuals According to personal observations by Karunarathna et al., (2011) the population size of Calotes nigrilabris may be declining. Calotes pethiyagodai is known to occur in only a small area, where its habitat is also declining in extent and quality (Amarasinghe et al., 2014). Without baseline population figures and detailed population studies, the extent of any declines for either species cannot be quantified. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade: Both of these species are known to be in the pet trade. The proposal states that some legal exports for commercial purposes took place from Sri Lanka until the mid-1980s although as Calotes pethiyagodai was not identified until 2014 it seems unknown if this species was among those exported. Since 1993, however, national legislation strictly prohibits any capture, trade and export of agamids from Sri Lanka. It is therefore conceivable though unlikely that those offered for sale outside Sri Lanka are descendants from this stock, and in recent years, the appearance of adult specimens of C. nigrilabis and C. pethiyagodai in online advertisements for the international pet trade has raised concerns of wild-caught individuals entering the market (Altherr, 2014; Auliya et al., 2016; Janssen and de Silva, in prep.). In Europe, the first documented online advertisement was made in 2011 by a Russian trader, who offered for sale several Sri Lankan agamids, including Calotes nigrilabris. Three years later, C. nigrilabris was offered by another Russian trader, in connection with \u201cHamm\u201d Germany, one of the world\u2019s largest reptile trade shows.

These records are dominated by imports of large numbers of C. versicolour, although in many instances, specimens are only recorded to genus level. Calotes emma has also appeared in trade since 2007 and C. mystaceus since 2009. Of these species however, only C. versicolour occurs in Sri Lanka, with none of these imports originating from Sri Lanka (Viet Nam being a principal exporter of this species). The only Calotes specimen originating from Sri Lanka between 1999 and 2013, was a skull of Calotes calotes, re-exported from Australia in 2011 for scientific purposes. The SS notes that the LEMIS database does not document any trade in either Calotes nigrilabris or C. pethiyagodai, to 2017. Evidence of online trade of Calotes nigrilabris or C. pethiyagodai within the USA has, however, been observed. In 2015, a trader from the USA offered two breeding pairs of C. nigrilabris for USD 1,000 per pair, highlighting that these were the only specimens in North America. The first offer for C. pethiyagodai took place in 2017. The trader stated that he had imported the animals as \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d from Europe and was now selling one pair from his small group. Between September 2016 and October 2018, Janssen and de Silva (in prep.), found further evidence of online trading, in the form of 20 online advertisements for Calotes nigrilabis, and four for C. pethiyagodai, which originated from traders in Germany, Canada and the USA. These adverts all occurred in 2017 and were among nine species observed for sale in this year that were not observed for sale in 2016 or 2018, suggesting that these species are not yet established in trade, possibly indicative of a smuggling event (Janssen & de Silva, in prep.). The SS also notes that the illegal collection of reptiles often targets gravid females, so that offspring can later be presented as \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d, and that any genuinely captive-bred specimens of recently smuggled adult specimens would be a result of illegally acquired breeding stock. Additional Information Threats Calotes nigrilabris and C. pethiyagodai face a range of threats including habitat destruction and fragmentation. Deforestation is the main threat faced by the reptile fauna of Sri Lanka, where natural forest cover has been reduced from 80% to less than 16% over the last 130 years. Other causes of mortality include the use of pesticides, road kills, and exposure to predatory species that opportunistically move in to human habitations, including the Jungle Crow Corvus macrorhynchos, Sri Lanka Whistling Thrush Myophonus blighi, and feral cats. Wild harvest and the targeting of gravid females would serve to compound the other threats that are known to affect them. The SS suggests that due to these species\u2019 small areas of distribution, habitat specialisation and low reproductive output, offtake of even small numbers of Calotes pethiyagodai, especially of mature or gravid females, may severely damage remaining populations. Conservation, management and legislation Since 1993, all reptile species of Sri Lanka\u2014except five highly venomous snakes\u2014are protected by law, in accordance with the Section 30 of the \u2018Seventh amendment to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO) of Sri Lanka. This means that collection of these species anywhere in the country, is illegal and export is strictly forbidden.

Implementation challenges (including similar species) The genus Calotes is currently represented by some 25 species, eight of which are native to Sri Lanka, and six of which are endemic to Sri Lanka (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009; Hartmann et al., 2013; Amarasinghe et al., 2014). Comprehensive identification guides for each of the Sri Lankan species exist (e.g. Somaweera and Somaweera, 2009; Amarasinghe et al., 2014). Calotes nigrilabris and C. pethiyagodai are said to be distinguishable from one another by a number of morophological differences, including the absence of supratympanic spines in C. pethiyagodai (present as a continuous row in C. nigrilabris), and the lack of a gular pouch in C. pethiyagodai (present in C. nigrilabris) (Amarasinghe et al., 2014). As these diagnosable features appear at the subadult stage (K. Ukuwela in litt., 2019), the identification of adults in trade should be possible. While the juveniles of most species of Calotes spp. are hard to distinguish (K. Ukuwela in litt., 2019), they equally are not regularly advertised in trade. Potential risk(s) of a listing As there are three other endemic species of Calotes within Sri Lanka, there may be potential for any illegal collection to switch to other non-CITES listed species, including C. liocephalus (which C. pethiyagodai looks most similar to), which also inhabits the Central Highlands and is only known from a small number of high elevation sites (Amarasinghe et al., 2014).

The genus is represented by five species, all of which are endemic to Sri Lanka. Limited recent information is available on population size and distribution, but from what is known it appears that the species are generally range restricted and considered threatened: - Ceratophora erdeleni and C. karu were both described in 1998 and categorised nationally as critically endangered in 2012, and are restricted to one forest reserve, each with a range estimated at between 10 and 100 km2. Both have been described as \u201crare\u201d and the population \u201csmall\u201d. In 2017, 12 and 10 online adverts respectively were observed. - Ceratophora aspera was assessed on the IUCN Red List as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b34e899-8be9-422d-a761-209a26138911": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b34e899-8be9-422d-a761-209a26138911", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c6732ef6a427bc32d8a2d3b7443ee3c9c9a7a4b9ed7dc6339944efb68daecf5"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c22181b-169d-4e78-8e87-2ae682aaf5bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd63e2dba32de30759c6afd2a4aafc365bc6e6f2d0e5c88ee84539c785429fd5"}}, "hash": "8c1e844037c494afb8cb4b337e2a1fae86f8aaf917b76e4adfdb841f978ea174", "text": "Vulnerable in 2009 due to a continuing decline in quality and extent of its habitat. The extent of occupancy was estimated at 700 km2 in 2005 and less than 500 km2 in 2012. Twelve online adverts were observed in 2017. - Ceratophora tennentii was assessed on the IUCN Red List as Endangered in 1998, and nationally as critically endangered in 2012. In 2005 the area of occupancy was estimated to be around 130 km2 (divided between three known sites) and in 2012 it was suggested it could be as low as 10 km2. This species is considered to be one of the most common in trade. Forty online advertisements were recorded for this species during 2017\u20132018, while trade data record the import of 10 specimens into the USA between 2016\u20132017. - Ceratophora stoddartii is considered nationally to be endangered, with an estimated area of occupancy of 200 km2. In 2005 it was described as one of the more abundant species in the genus and is also considered to be one of the most common in trade. Fifty-seven online advertisements were recorded during 2017\u20132018, and 25 specimens imported into the USA between 2013 and 2017. All species are threatened by continued habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, with tolerance to habitat disturbance varying between species. The distinctive appearance of these species makes them sought after by reptile collectors. Exports from Sri Lanka were banned in 1993. In recent years all species have been offered for sale, often at high prices outside of Sri Lanka, and are sometimes reported as being wild-caught. Due to differences in colouration and morphology, it is said to be possible to distinguish all five species in their adult form, but not as juveniles, and most observed trade appeared to involve adults. Analysis: All species have been globally or nationally assessed as endangered or critically endangered, except Ceratophora aspera, which was assessed as Vulnerable in 2009. Several of the species have a restricted distribution, which is likely to be fragmented, and are declining due to deforestation, and therefore appear to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I: Ceratophora erdeleni, C. karu, C. tennentii and C. stoddartii. In recent years, all species within the genus have been offered for sale within the hobbyist trade, some of which was reported as, or suspected to be, wild-sourced, and therefore illegal. The area of occupancy for Ceratophora aspera has most recently been estimated at less than 500 km2. In 2009 the habitat was declining in extent and quality and the species was categorised as IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 24 113 Vulnerable. While the decline has likely continued, C. aspera is unlikely to meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. It is thought that adults of all species can be differentiated from each other, and although it is more difficult with juveniles it seems that currently it is mainly adults in trade. Therefore, if Parties decide that not all species meet the Appendix I criteria, the other(s) should not necessarily be listed as look- alikes in Appendix II (for which there is no provision in Appendix I). Other Considerations: Sri Lanka could consider an Appendix-III listing for Ceratophora aspera; stipulating a zero export quota with the listing would reflect that export from Sri Lanka is illegal.

In 2015, a field survey recorded an average of 10 individuals per 100 m transect within mixed cardamom forests, eight individuals per 100 m transect in natural forests, four individuals per 100 m transect in cardamom plantations, and no individuals within pine plantations (Somaweera et al., 2015). Ceratophora erdeleni and C. karu were both described in 2005 as \u201crare\u201d and populations of both species as small (although no size was given). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 24 114 B) Restricted area of distribution The five species are distributed within a number of specific habitat types and locations within Sri Lanka: Ceratophora aspera: Ceratophora aspera occurs in southwest Sri Lanka, in the lowland wet zone between 60 and 990 m above sea level. This species\u2019 extent of occurrence is approximately 10,300 km\u00b2. Bahir and Surasinghe (2005), estimated its area of occupancy to be 700 km2, while the National Red List assessment estimated it to be <500 km2 (MOE, 2012). It is thought to be restricted to undisturbed (but fragmented) forests, although it has also been observed in home gardens adjacent to forested areas. Ceratophora stoddartii: Ceratophora stoddartii is found in the cloud forests of Sri Lanka\u2019s Central Massif (1,200\u20132,200 m elevation). The species only inhabits a small amount of its former range, with most of the lower elevations (under 1,800 m) of the Central Massif having been cleared during the past century for the cultivation of tea. The area of occupancy is thought to be <500 km2 (Somaweera & de Silva, 2010), and may be as low as 200 km\u00b2 divided between >10 known sites (Bahir & Surasinghe 2005). At one of these locations, (Namunukula), this species is restricted to a site of around 200 ha, with individuals within this isolated subpopulation showing morphometric differences to other subpopulations within the Central Massif (Pethiyagoda & Manamendra-Arachchi, 1998). Ceratophora tennentii: Ceratophora tennentii is restricted to the Knuckles forest region, where it is found in natural forests, abandoned cardamom plantations and home gardens, between elevations of 700 to 1200 m (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009). Bahir and Surasinghe (2005), estimated its area of occupancy to be around 130 km2, divided between three known sites although Somaweera et al., (2015), suggested that this may be an overestimate, given the patchy distribution of the species within its range, while the 2012 National Red List assessment of critically endangered suggests its distribution may be as low as <10 km2. Ceratophora erdeleni: Ceratophora erdeleni is limited to the Morningside Forest Reserve at elevations of between 1,000\u20131,300 m. The National Red List of Sri Lanka categorises this species as critically endangered, based on an extent of occurrence of <100 km2 (MOE, 2012). Bahir and Surasinghe (2005), estimated its area of occupancy to be <10 km2. Ceratophora karu: Ceratophora karu is limited to the Morningside Forest Reserve at elevations of between 1,000\u20131,300 m. The National Red List of Sri Lanka categorises this species as critically endangered, based on an extent of occurrence of <100 km2 (MOE, 2012). Bahir and Surasinghe (2005), estimated its area of occupancy to be <10 km2. C) Decline in number of wild individuals The population trends for all species are unknown. Long term population declines might be inferred based on the loss and degradation of their habitat (Bahir & Surasinghe, 2005). In 2005, the National Red List of Sri Lanka classified Ceratophora aspera as vulnerable, and C. tennentii as endangered.

Ceratophora aspera is reported as being \u201cextremely intolerant of habitat disruption\u201d, and it therefore seems likely that this species had been heavily impacted by the expansion of agriculture within Sri Lanka (Senanayske (1980), in Somaweera & de Silva, 2010). Field observations noted a possible decline in some populations. For example, in a 2011 field survey of the Morningside area, neither Ceratophora karu nor C. erdeleni were observed. In 2017, a survey of habitat favoured by C. aspera in Kithulgala also failed to reveal any individuals, perhaps due to the presence of a nearby development. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I International trade in all five species has been documented, with live specimens offered for sale as pets in Europe, the USA and Asia. As regulation of agamid exports from Sri Lanka was less restrictive in the past, Ceratophora individuals may have been legally exported.

It is unknown if this has occurred with any species of Ceratophora. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 24 115 The availability of each species in trade appears to vary: Ceratophora stoddartii: Of the five species, Ceratophora stoddartii is most commonly seen in trade. A survey of European reptile fairs in 1998 found specimens of C. stoddartii among the 15 most expensive non-CITES listed species on sale, priced at the equivalent of EUR 176 (ca. USD 200). By 2014 prices had increased to EUR 2,000\u20132,500/pair (USD 2,250-2,800/pair). Since then observed prices appear to have decreased to around EUR 750\u20131,200/pair (USD 850\u20131,360/pair). In a study of online trade platforms, between 2016 and 2018, Janssen and de Silva (in prep.) reported average prices of around EUR 312/specimen (ca. USD 350) for this species. The SS states that the first documented online offer for Ceratophora stoddartii, was on a European online platform in January 2011. Since mid-2013 regular advertisements have been observed on European online pet trade websites and in Facebook groups. For example, in 2013 at least three Russian and one German trader advertised several species of Sri Lankan agamids, including C. stoddartii. Since then, similar offers have been made by Swiss, French, Russian, Italian, British, Czech and Spanish nationals. In a survey of online advertisements conducted between 2016 and 2018, Janssen and de Silva (in prep.) documented 57 adverts for C. stoddartii in Denmark, Slovakia, the USA and Canada. The majority of these specimens were advertised as captive-bred, although in some cases no specific origin was mentioned, and in three cases, wild origin was reported. Forty-four of these advertisements were documented in 2017, and 13 in 2018, with this spike in adverts potentially indicative of a smuggling event (Janssen & de Silva, in prep.). Ceratophora stoddartii was also found in trade within Asia and was recorded in a 2004\u20132005 survey of pet shops in Taiwan, Province of China. In 2013, adult specimens were offered for sale by a Japanese national in a Facebook group. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) data show that between 2013 and 2017, the USA imported 25 live specimens of C. stoddartii. Of these, three were declared as wild and 22 as captive-bred. In 2014 an Italian trader offered adult C. stoddartii for delivery to the USA for USD 1,250 a pair and, since then, several US nationals have offered this species for sale. Ceratophora tennentii: Ceratophora tennentii appears to be one of the most commonly traded Ceratophora species. In 2014, several offers for C. tennentii were observed, at prices of USD 850/pair. In 2014, a trader from Malaysia offered specimens of C. tennentii (along with specimens of C. stoddartii) on a European online platform. In 2016, eight captive-bred specimens of C. tennentii were imported into the USA, followed by two individuals in 2017, which were declared as wild-caught. All specimens imported into the USA were for commercial purposes and were exported from Germany and Poland. In 2017, Janssen and de Silva (in prep.), documented 28 online adverts for C. tennentii in Germany, the Czech Republic, Spain, Slovakia and the US, which was followed by 12 adverts in 2018. The authors of this study suggest that the changes in the volume of these adverts in different years, points to a smuggling event. Ceratophora aspera: Since December 2014, several online offers for Ceratophora aspera have been documented, at prices of up to USD 2,850/pair.

Additional Information Threats Deforestation is the main threat faced by the reptile fauna of Sri Lanka, where natural forest cover has been reduced from 80% to less than 16% in the past 130 years. Habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation are IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 24 116 considered the most serious threats to this genus. Severe deforestation has occurred in Sri Lanka due to the clearing of land for agricultural purposes, conversion to plantations for crops such as tea, mining, logging and pressures associated with expanding human settlements. In 2005, it was estimated that only 5% of the island's original wet zone forest remained intact. Bahir and Surasinghe (2005), also cite rainwater acidification, pesticides and the effects of climate change as further principal threats. Somaweera et al., (2015) found Ceratophora tennentii to be adaptable to disturbed habitats (particularly mixed cardamom forests), provided these retain forest canopy cover and vegetation of sufficient structural complexity. Other members of the genus, however, may be less tolerant to habitat degradation. For example, C. aspera is thought to be \"extremely intolerant of habitat disruption\u2019\u2019 and \u201cdisappears when primary rain forest cover is lost\" (Senanayske (1980), in Somaweera & de Silva, 2010). It has been reported that some farmers may kill C. tennentii under the misapprehension that they damage cardamom crops (Somaweera, et al., 2015). The impact of any illegal collection of Ceratophora spp. for the international pet trade is unknown. However, any illegal offtake may compound the threats identified above, particularly for C. edelini and C. karu, which are considered rare and occupy a very small range. The SS describes the reproductive rate of Ceratophora spp. to be low. Clutch size is between one and ten eggs and varies between species. Females of C. aspera have been observed as depositing only one to two eggs per clutch, a clutch size of two eggs is reported for C. karu, while C. stoddartii produces up to eight eggs per clutch. Sexual maturity is reached at an age of six months. Ceratophora stoddartii, C. tennentii and C. aspera are also noted as being slow moving species (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009), which may make them more susceptible to illegal collection if this occurs on an opportunistic basis (P. Bowles, in litt., 2019). Conservation, management and legislation The range of some species partially falls within a number of protected areas. For example, C. aspera is known to occur in the Sinharaja Natural Heritage Wilderness Area. However, even here, illegal logging, mining and human encroachment remain a threat. Bahir and Surasinghe (2005) note that much of the range of C. tennentii does not have protected status and is not subject to conservation management. Since 1993, all trade in Ceratophora, (including wild collection, ranching and breeding), has been strictly prohibited. There are concerns that adult specimens recently seen in trade may be wild-caught (and therefore illegal), rather than originating from long-held captive stock (Auliya et al., 2016; Altherr, 2014; Janssen & de Silva, 2019; J. Wu, in litt., 2019). Artificial propagation/captive breeding The majority of specimens in trade are described as captive-bred (Janssen and de Silva, in prep.). Limited anecdotal reports of captive breeding exist (for example within German magazine articles dating from 2007 featuring captive breeding of C. stoddartii, (K. Ukuwela, in litt., 2019)), but overall, accounts of successful captive breeding are scarce.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b531ef8b-e569-45f8-802a-b5c14729de5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b531ef8b-e569-45f8-802a-b5c14729de5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11e34206de84c55a25b41b7215b1897aebe56d7c5eae8424505fe25aab170d0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b1db671-c378-43bb-a670-bdd52abbe9be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a0fa800de1ec914cbb83e818c3ceef2bb8733a44701cd55349f52ad619f16e2"}}, "hash": "7f553748168e51d2b7cf1f1069c145e6e055c88a8332723ad32cab2803648481", "text": "In a scientific study, Kravac et al., (2015) attempted to breed C. aspera in carefully controlled conditions, with some success, noting that captive breeding techniques still require development as a \u201ctool of last resort\u201d for the conservation of the species. Many experts doubt that individuals observed for sale online were legally acquired prior to 1993 (Altherr, 2014; Auliya et al., 2016; P. Bowles, in litt., 2019; J. Wu, in litt., 2019; Janssen & de Silva, (in prep)). Implementation challenges (including similar species) All five species within the genus can be identified in adult form (P. Bowles, in litt., 2019; K. Ukuwela, in litt., 2019). Among other distinguishing features, adults display distinctive rostral appendages (\u201chorns\u201d), which are larger in males than females and differ in appearance between species (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009). Horns are absent in juveniles which are not easily distinguished, (K. Ukuwela, in litt., 2019), but equally are not regularly advertised in trade. Only one other genus within Agamidae, Harpesaurus, contains a prominent horn-like appendage, although their structure is fundamentally different to the \u201chorns\u201d seen in Ceratophora (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009).

Both species are threatened by a number of factors including habitat loss and fragmentation: timber extraction and clearing of forest for tea plantations have already destroyed large areas of habitat. Cophotis ceylanica was classified in 1998 as endangered nationally. This species has a restricted range with an area of occupancy estimated at less than 500 km2 and perhaps as low as 60 km2. The species was considered \u201crare\u201d in 2005. Cophotis ceylanica was estimated to have decreased by more than 50% in the decade prior to 1998, and was predicted to decline further, although the threats identified at the time did not include over-collection. Die-offs of hundreds of individuals occurred due to drought in the 1990s. In 2017 and 2018, 69 online adverts were observed in Europe and the USA; most individuals were described as captive-bred. Cophotis dumbara was described in 2006 and classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2008. The population size is not known, nor is the current trend, but its habitat is severely fragmented and its area of occupancy is thought to be less than 10 km2. Eight online adverts were found in Germany and the USA for C. dumbara in 2017 to 2018. There is evidence of trade. Both species have been offered for sale at high prices, particularly within the USA and Europe, but trade instances appear to be relatively low. Both species are protected under Sri Lankan law, and harvest and export have been prohibited since 1993. It seems unlikely that all individuals observed for sale are the offspring of animals exported pre-1993 (particularly C. dumbara, which was only described in 2006), therefore it seems probable that wild animals are illegally entering trade. It is considered that adults of the two species can be distinguished by finer taxonomic details, such as the number of spines and the appearance of scales in certain regions of the body, and although juveniles are very difficult to tell apart it appears that most current trade is in adults.

For C. ceylanica, the area of distribution is larger (<500 km2 but perhaps as low as 60 km2), which is likely to be declining and fragmented. The species was said to be rare in 2005, apparently having undergone a marked decline in the 1990s, and is highly vulnerable to extrinsic factors such as drought. Therefore, it is possible that C. ceylanica also meets the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. In recent years, both species have been offered for sale (although numbers appear relatively low) within the hobbyist trade and illegal collection from the wild is suspected. Other Considerations: Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations should ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could help allay any concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and wild offtake for breeding stock.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 25 119 Taxonomy Until recently, the genus was thought to comprise a single species, Cophotis ceylanica. In 2006 a second species, which is geographically isolated from C. ceylanica, was described. This was named C. dumbara, after the Dumbara Range (known as the Knuckles Hills), which is the only region within Sri Lanka where it is known to occur (Manamendra-Arachchi et al., 2006; Samarawickrama et al., 2006). Range Sri Lanka. IUCN Global Category Cophotis dumbara: Critically Endangered B1ab(iii) (2008) ver 3.1. Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population Cophotis ceylanica has not been assessed by IUCN. Nationally assessed as endangered since 1998. There do not appear to be any population estimates for C. ceylanica, although Bahir and Surasinghe (2005) described this species as \u201crare\u201d. Cophotis dumbara has rarely been observed, and there is little information available on the abundance of this species (Samarawickrama et al., 2009). B) Restricted area of distribution Cophotis ceylanica is restricted to tropical montane cloud forests at elevations in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, >1,700 m above sea level (Manamendra-Arachchi et al., 2006). It was nationally assessed as endangered, based on an area of occupancy of less than 500 km\u00b2, with this habitat declining in extent and/or quality (MOE, 2012). Bahir and Surasinghe (2005), estimated the area of occupancy to be even smaller at 60 km2, and considered the species to be restricted to four known sites. Somaweera and Somaweera (2009), list seven known locations for this species. Cophotis dumbara is only known from the Knuckles Mountains (Dumbara Hills) of central Sri Lanka, where it is restricted to cardamom plantations (Somaweera and Somaweera, 2009), at elevations of between 1,000\u2013 1,550 m (Samarawickrama et al., 2009). The species\u2019 extent of occurrence is thought to be <100 km2, and its distribution within this severely fragmented (Samarawickrama et al., 2009). The National Red List of Sri Lanka considers its area of occupancy to be <10 km2 (MOE, 2012).

By 1998 the population was thought to have declined by more than 50% within the previous decade, and future declines were predicted. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade: Both of these species are known to be in the pet trade.

The SS also notes that the illegal collection of reptiles often targets gravid females, so that offspring can later be presented as \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d, and that any genuinely captive-bred specimens of recently smuggled adult specimens would be a result of illegally acquired breeding stock. Cophotis spp. are slow-moving animals, which makes them particularly easy to capture, and C. dumbara can be easily collected during seasonal clearing of cardamom plantations. Of the two species, C. ceylanica appears to be most frequently offered for sale, but specimens of C. dumbara have also been advertised in trade since at least 2015. The trade appears to be focused on markets in Europe and the USA: IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 25 120 Europe: The first documented online advertisement for Cophotis ceylanica was in 2013, for sale in \u201cHamm\u201d, Germany, one of the largest reptile trade shows worldwide. Since that time, regular advertisements have been found on European online platforms: the prices vary between EUR 280 to 600 (USD 317 to 680) per male, while adult breeding pairs were sold for up to EUR 1,500 (USD 1,701). The majority of these offers are advertised within Europe. In 2015, C. dumbara was also offered for sale in Europe. USA: LEMIS data show that in 2015, five live specimens of Cophotis ceylanica were imported into the USA from Poland, reportedly captive-bred (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS), 2015). Both species have also been seen in recent advertisements by traders in the USA. Cophotis ceylanica (first seen in online adverts in 2015) was offered for USD 1,350/pair, while males were offered for USD350\u2013500. In 2018, two adult pairs of C. dumbara were advertised in the USA for USD 2,250, with the trader highlighting that \u201cthis species was discovered in 2006 and is very rare and critically endangered\u201d, claiming these animals would be \u201cthe first ones ever imported into the USA\u201d. Asia: In 2014, a trader from Malaysia advertised specimens of a variety of Sri Lankan endemic agamids, including Cophotis ceylanica, on a European online platform. Further evidence of international trade is also provided by a recent study of online advertisements. In this study, Janssen and de Silva (unpubl.) found Cophotis ceylanica offered for sale in 69 online adverts. Of these, 52 were posted in 2017, followed by a further 17 in 2018, originating from Germany, the USA, France, Austria, Poland and Slovakia. The same study also found eight online advertisements for C. dumbara, two of which occurred in 2017, and six in 2018, with the adverts originating from Germany and the USA. The majority of specimens were described as captive-bred, although two pygmy lizards (Cophotis spp.) were described as F1, suggesting at least one of the parents was taken from the wild. Of 17 Sri Lankan species offered for sale, the authors found C. dumbara to be the most expensive, offered at prices of EUR 1,443 (USD 1,667). Auliya et al., (2016), has also documented C. ceylanica for sale at high prices of EUR 2,200/pair (USD 2,495). Bowles (in litt., 2019) notes that as these prices, within Western markets, are lower for Cophotis spp. than for other Sri Lankan agamids such as Lyriocephalus scutatus, this may increase their appeal to a broader section of the hobbyist community. Additional Information Threats Deforestation, leading to loss of habitat and habitat fragmentation, are the main threats faced by the reptile fauna of Sri Lanka. Timber extraction and clearing of forest for tea plantations has already destroyed large areas, and Sri Lanka\u2019s natural forest cover has been reduced from 80% to less than 16% over the last 130 years. Given the likelihood of ongoing deforestation, it is feared that by the end of 2030, less than 10% of forest cover will remain in Sri Lanka.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97045fe9-363f-4c7d-8202-5a681caebf6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "97045fe9-363f-4c7d-8202-5a681caebf6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2aa844c641afdc6a84fb45cc2e588e1acfe85dbb1e8ec4c95680ed322f6ee107"}, "2": {"node_id": "31083502-abb0-42b1-a48c-4166e2fbd128", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3e1740e29c393ab3ca6b541a71a39c45c94d6c9aa1e87873ca830c6d40ed296"}}, "hash": "014bd1151444b6632ed328ec66bd9cc589928bc328306c4b8651cbef7984954d", "text": "Areas of forest habitat suitable for C. dumbara are also currently being lost through die-back, and from fires set to clear land for agricultural use (Samarawickrama et al., 2009).

This means that collection of these species anywhere in the country is illegal. A permit issued by the Department of Wildlife Conservation is mandatory to perform any ex-situ or in-situ activity that involves a protected reptile species. Ranching and breeding of reptile species is also forbidden. In 2010, the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, including the Peak Wilderness Protected Area, the Horton Plains National Park and the Knuckles Conservation Forest, were recognised as a World Heritage Site. Populations of both species of Cophotis lie partially within this conservation area. Artificial propagation/captive breeding The extent to which Cophotis spp. can be successfully bred in captivity is unclear. Some online adverts offer photographic evidence of juvenile specimens, but reptile smugglers are believed to collect gravid females, and therefore this does not provide conclusive proof that all captive specimens originate from animals collected prior IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 25 121 to 1993. The smuggling of endemic reptiles from Sri Lanka is suspected to occur (see SS and Auliya et al., 2016), and some experts raise doubts that Cophotis spp. could be successfully bred in captivity (J. Wu, in litt., 2019). It is therefore considered to be unlikely that all specimens seen in trade have been produced from legally acquired captive breeding stock. Implementation challenges (including similar species) The genus Cophotis can be distinguished from other agamid genera by the presence of a fleshy bulb on its snout, along with a number of other physical features. To non-experts, Cophitis ceylanica and C. dumbara are very similar in appearance but can be differentiated on the basis of finer taxonomic details including: the number of spines in the nuchal crest (two in C. dumbara and three in C. ceylanica (K. Ukuwela, in litt., 2019); the scales on the gular sac (smooth in C. dumbara and rough in C. ceylanica), and size of the gular sac (less well developed in C. dumbara) (Manamendra-Arachachi et al., 2006; T. Amarasinghe, in litt., 2019). A high-quality photograph of this region would seem likely sufficient for a specialist to tell the species apart if these were supplied by monitoring officials (P. Bowles, in litt., 2019). The juveniles of both species are not easily distinguished, (K. Ukuwela in litt., 2019), but equally are not regularly advertised in trade. References Amarasinghe, T. (2019).

Population size and trends are unknown. Loss and fragmentation of natural habitat has been severe within its range, one population was nearly extirpated due to intensive logging, although there is evidence that the species can adapt to modified habitats. The species was assessed on the IUCN Red List in 2009 as Near Threatened and considered \u201cnot rare\u201d within its range. Collection for the pet trade was said to be reducing population numbers. The distinctive appearance of the species makes it sought after by reptile collectors. According to one estimate, around 500 specimens were collected from the wild for export in the past 30 years. Export from Sri Lanka has been prohibited since 1993, although the species has been offered for sale at high prices outside of the range State. Given reported challenges in captive breeding it is thought unlikely these animals are the progeny of individuals imported pre-1993. Analysis: The species is in demand for the hobbyist trade within the EU, USA and Asia, with illegal collection from the wild suspected, although the overall volume of trade is not known. The population size of Lyriocephalus scutatus is unknown but unlikely to be small. It was not considered to be rare within its range ten years ago, and despite severe and ongoing deforestation within its range, it does not have a restricted distribution. While at least one population has reportedly been almost extirpated due to logging, and collection for the pet trade is said to be causing a decline, it is unclear if the species overall has undergone a marked decline. Therefore, there is insufficient information to determine if the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: Sri Lanka could consider an Appendix III listing. In this case stipulating a zero-export quota with the listing would reflect that export from Sri Lanka is illegal. Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations shall ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could help allay any concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and wild offtake for breeding stock.

Taxonomy Described in 1758, the genus is monotypic. Range Sri Lanka. IUCN Global Category Near Threatened (2009) ver. 3.1. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 26 123 Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix A) Small wild population While population studies are highly localised and no long-term monitoring has been carried out to date, anecdotal and opportunistic observations suggest that Lyriocephalus scutatus is not uncommon within its range. According to the IUCN Red List assessment undertaken in 2009, the species was considered \"uncommon\", and in Kosgama lowland forest the population is almost zero due to intensive logging activities (Somaweera & de Silva, 2010). In 2009, Lyriocephalus scutatus was assessed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. The Red List assessment states that its distribution is not severely fragmented, it occurs in more than 10 locations, and is not considered to be rare within its range, and therefore does not qualify for a higher threatened category (Somaweera & de Silva, 2010). B) Restricted area of distribution Lyriocephalus scutatus is endemic to Sri Lanka. Widespread in the wet lowlands and mid-hill areas to the south- west of the country, it is found in cool and shady forested areas, plantations and gardens, at elevations from ~25 m to 1,600 m above sea level (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009). The IUCN Red List estimates its extent of occurrence as <17,400 km2. This agrees with a classification of vulnerable in the National Red List of Sri Lanka, based on an extent of occurrence of <20,000 km2 (MOE, 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aa3606e-7a28-4c6c-b725-82b591f7b590": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aa3606e-7a28-4c6c-b725-82b591f7b590", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8e3c927a7a9a84208d50d541af314e74351513c83fb585183666b1d1d9b1d84"}, "2": {"node_id": "d43efbf8-c389-4121-abf8-f45ad9416019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de6cf439dbb997f7c2fc83aad3ca9f8e71ec212d3704cabfb8c8cdf7cc87015d"}}, "hash": "224ef804bfad54b4ca1c66dec50abcaea93ebb8fd377a0799424e2fb353536a5", "text": "While it is an island endemic, it occurs in more than 10 locations, its distribution is not severely fragmented (Somaweera, & de Silva, 2010), and it inhabits a number of habitat types at both high and low elevations (Somaweera & Somaweera, 2009).

Since 1993, however, national legislation prohibits any capture, trade and export of agamids from Sri Lanka. Despite this protection, it has been estimated that during the previous three decades, around 500 specimens have been collected from the wild (Somaweera & de Silva, 2010). Karunarathna and Amarasinghe (2013), also suggest that illegal smuggling has occurred over the past few decades. Lyriocephalus scutatus possesses features which are known to be highly desirable in the pet industry. This demand in the international pet trade is reflected in prices ranging from USD 1,600 to USD 5,500 a pair. Since at least 2011, a growing number of Lyriocephalus scutatus specimens have been documented within the European, USA and Asian pet markets. In Europe, in 2013 and 2014, L. scutatus were being offered for up to USD 3,400/pair. In 2017, Janssen and de Silva (in prep.), recorded six online advertisements for this species in Germany and the Czech Republic, and a further 19 the following year. The 2017 adverts coincided with advertisements for a number of other endemic Sri Lankan species that were not observed for sale in either 2016 or 2018, possibly indicating a smuggling event. Lyriocephalus scutatus specimens have been on sale in the USA pet market since at least 2015. Adult breeding pairs are sold for between USD 2,200 and USD 5,500, and the species praised as \u201ca truly rare reptile in today\u2019s hobby\u201d and \u201cvery rare, almost never offered for sale\u201d. In 2016, a USA trader advertised a number of \u201ccaptive- bred\u201d Sri Lankan endemic agamid species, including L. scutatus. According to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) data for 2000\u20132017, no L. scutatus specimens were traded until 2016\u20132017, when ten live individuals were imported for commercial purposes. Of these, two were declared as wild and eight as captive-bred, and were imported from the Netherlands, Germany and Canada. Nine live individuals were exported during 2016\u20132017; four to the Netherlands and five to South Korea. All nine were declared as captive-bred and traded for commercial purposes. In Asia, the species is reportedly a kept as a pet species in China, although the origin of these specimens is not known (L. Chou, in litt., 2019). There are also anecdotal reports of this species being traded in Taiwan, Province of China, Japan, and Malaysia. In 2004 and 2005, Lyriocephalus scutatus was recorded on sale in pet shops in southern Taiwan, Province of China. In May 2011, a Japanese trader offered five specimens for export, IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 26 124 underlining their rarity (\u201cvery few been in trade before\u201d), and other examples of the online sale of adult specimens has also been noted in Japan. Although it is impossible to rule out that these animals in trade are offspring from specimens exported before national legislation became more restrictive, it is thought unlikely that breeding stock originating from this time is being exclusively used to supply the pet market\u2014wild sourcing is strongly indicated for some animals in trade, based on customs data that declares some specimens as wild (as noted above), and descriptions in adverts, such as one from a trader in Poland who noted that specimens for sale had been \u201c8 months in captivity\u201d. Many advertisements also offer \u201cadult specimens\u201d, rather than juveniles, which may also indicate illegal capture from the wild (Wakao et al., 2018). The sporadic appearance of online advertisements for Lyriocephalus scutatus and other Sri Lankan species in some years but not others may also be indicative of smuggling events (Janssen & de Silva, in prep.). The SS notes that the illegal collection of reptiles often targets gravid females, so that offspring can later be presented as \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d, and that any genuinely captive-bred specimens of recently smuggled adult specimens would be a result of illegally acquired breeding stock.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd7028fb-6077-4798-826b-c3c6803a8c0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd7028fb-6077-4798-826b-c3c6803a8c0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6d85ad3b50e9e64046d17844f72d8281fe1bbd47019c3631bef0fc5e062be3e"}, "2": {"node_id": "af7ed1b0-4b07-4e18-814f-b5d789ab8989", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6e6cd7e6f845430a119cd263832b2fe6bf8a0390715fc7dc533802e3eb057ee"}}, "hash": "ba441b183c0253ebf6370bc201e986f5358e154373e4c53ceceb723675bc9dc8", "text": "Additional Information Threats Deforestation is the main threat faced by the reptile fauna of Sri Lanka, in 2007 only 17% forest coverage was recorded.

Conservation, management and legislation Since 1993, all reptile species of Sri Lanka\u2014except five highly venomous snakes\u2014are protected by law, in accordance with Section 30 of the \u201cSeventh amendment to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance\u201d (FFPO) of Sri Lanka. This means that collection of these species anywhere in the country is illegal. This species occurs in protected areas, including the Sinharaja Natural Heritage Wilderness Area, although illegal logging, mining and human encroachment remain a threat even within this protected area. In 2010, the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, including the Peak Wilderness Protected Area, the Horton Plains National Park and the Knuckles Conservation Forest, were recognised as a World Heritage Site. Artificial Propagation/captive breeding In the wild, females mature at 10\u201312 months and lay up to 10 eggs, up to three times a year. While there have been some legal exports of agamids from Sri Lanka until the mid-1980s, there is no recent reliable information on the success of past or current captive breeding. Anecdotal reports of captive breeding exist (for example within magazine articles dating from the 1970s and 1980s), but the extent of any successful breeding is unclear (K. Ukuwela, in litt., 2019). A pet keeper\u2019s resource notes: issues with lighting and feeding in captivity; that the species \u201cwas thought to be keepable but not breedable\u201d; and that \u201ccaptive-bred animals are available from time to time\u201d. Zoffer (1996), states that this species has a \u201ccult following in the herpetocultural hobby and would probably be more popular if it was available more often\u201d and adds that this species\u2019 specialised feeding habits present a difficulty in keeping them. Other experts have also expressed doubts over the likely ability of this species to breed well in captivity (J. Wu, in litt., 2019). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Lyriocephalus scutatus is comparatively easy to identify in adult form, which is the form in which it appears to be predominantly traded. The species has a distinctive rostral knob, which is more developed in males than in females, and which makes the species easy to discriminate from other agamids such as the Ceratophora genus.

Eleven of the 13 species occurring in China and Viet Nam were described from 1999 onwards. Very little is known about the ecology of most of the species, although they appear to show a high degree of adaptation to specific microhabitats and most are considered to have limited ranges, with many only known from a single mountain range or island.

Reproductive capacity is likely to be low, males are thought to reach maturity at around one year of age and females lay clutches of two to three eggs annually. Population estimates are lacking for almost all species. Published IUCN Red List assessments are available for three of the species: one Critically Endangered (G. huuliensis), one Endangered (G. catbaensis) and one Vulnerable (G. lichtenfelderi). A further five species have assessments accepted for publication in March 2019: one Critically Endangered (G. yingdeensis), three Endangered (G. bawanglingensis, G. liboensis and G. zhelongi), and one Data Deficient (G. zhoui). Due to their attractive appearance and colour patterns, many species (ten out of 13) are known to be traded internationally as pets, with Europe, Japan and the USA identified as key markets. Comprehensive trade data are lacking, but imports reported by the USA from 1999-2018 totalled nearly 17,000 individuals with 70% of imports reported as wild sourced. Only three species were not reported in global trade and they are three of the most recently described species G. kwangsiensis, G. liboensis and G. zhoui. However, it is believed that recently discovered species may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Local extirpations have been recorded for three species to feed demand from the pet trade, and newly described species are often advertised at higher prices. The most highly traded species based on available data are G. lichtenfelderi, G. hainanensis and G. luii; trade in G. catbaensis may also be significant (see below). There also appears to be harvest for the domestic pet trade and medicinal purposes. Goniurosaurus catbaensis is endemic to Cat Ba Island, Viet Nam. Described in 2008, the species was assessed as globally Endangered in 2016 and has an estimated area of occupancy of 120 km2 (which is declining) and a severely fragmented population which may be less than 250 mature individuals. Habitat destruction is a major threat, and a flood in 2015 appears to have caused local extirpations. G. catbaensis was the species most commonly advertised of seven Vietnamese endemic reptiles observed for sale online in Europe and Japan, and is frequently observed in pet shops in southern Viet Nam where they are reported to have been collected from the wild. Goniurosaurus luii is native to northern Viet Nam and western Guangxi, China. No estimates of the total population size are available. The species was subject to over-exploitation for commercial sale before it was described in 1999, which has led to extirpation from its type locality. Some trade has been reported to the USA (from 1999-2018 ca. 600 were imported) and it has been observed in pet shops in southern Viet Nam (believed to be collected from the wild) and in Japan. Occasionally G. luii is harvested from the wild in China for use in traditional medicine. Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi is known from three provinces and one archipelago in Viet Nam and was assessed as globally Vulnerable in 2017. Over 7,000 individuals were reportedly imported into the USA from 1999-2018, accounting for 44% of the USA\u2019s reported imports of Goniurosaurus. Trade in G. lichtenfelderi has also been reported in Europe, Japan and locally in Viet Nam. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 127 In addition to over-harvest, major threats to Goniurosaurus include habitat loss, tourism and exceptional weather events. In China, collection of certain species in the genus is prohibited under national legislation, while collection of the remaining species is subject to quotas and the issuance of a permit. Goniurosaurus species are not currently protected in Viet Nam, but a proposal to include these species in national legislation to regulate international trade will be considered in 2019 (and will be automatic if the genus is included in Appendix II). Some of the species have part of their range within protected areas.

Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi and G. luii also meet the criteria on the basis of large trade volumes, local extirpations and/or small populations.

Other Considerations: There may be implementation issues with the six Japanese Goniurosaurus species that are not included in the proposal as although there are features that distinguish them from the Chinese and Vietnamese species (the precloacal pores are absent, and claws are not sheathed by scales for the Japanese species) it is reportedly difficult for non-experts, particularly if the geographic origin is not accurately known. Where species are subject to national protection in China, China could consider publishing a zero- export quota for wild specimens on the CITES website to reflect national legislation. If the proposal is adopted, Japan may wish to list its six native Goniurosaurus species in Appendix III to monitor any potentially increased trade in this species as a result of the other species of the genus being listed.

Current evidence suggests most species in the Goniurosaurus genus to have very limited ranges (Yang & Chan, 2015) and within those ranges to show a high degree of habitat specificity associated with rock/karst topography within primary rainforest (Blair et al., 2009).

Population studies have only been attempted for G. bawanglingensis, G. catbaensis and G. luii, none of which have been able to provide a comprehensive population size or density estimate for the species in question (Ngo et al., 2016; Qi et al., 2011). Not a single specimen of G. catbaensis could be observed at a formerly populated site after an extreme flood in August 2015 in Viet Hai Village on Cat Ba Island.

There is evidence that wild sourced Goniurosaurus specimens are subject to domestic and international trade. Goniurosaurus have been popular in the pet market since the 1990s, due to their attractive appearance and colour patterns. Rare species fetch high prices, giving traders incentive for poaching and excessive collection. Most, if not all Goniurosaurus species are said to be being sold in the international pet market, mainly in Europe and the USA. It is believed that recently discovered species are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The authors that described G. kadoorieorum and G. kwangsiensis in 2015 and G. zhoui in 2018 did not make the type localities public for fear of them being exploited. Evidence suggests that the description of a new species within the Goniurosaurus genus prompts an increase in demand from hobbyists. In the case of G. luii, specimens were traded for USD500 prior to the species being described (under an older name), but the price increased to USD1,500 after the species was described (Grismer et al., 1999; Stuart et al., 2006). This suggests that some of the more recently described Goniurosaurus species (e.g. G. kadoorieorum, G. kwangsiensis, G. zhoui and G. zhelongi) could also face commercial exploitation to supply the pet hobbyist market. According to the LEMIS database of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, a total of 16,714 specimens of Goniurosaurus spp. were imported into the USA between 1999 and 2018. Goniurosaurus species were imported into the USA from 15 countries, and the majority of specimens imported were live (90%), 11,515 specimens (69%) were wild-caught and 5,086 specimens (30%) were allegedly bred in captivity, for mainly commercial purposes (97%). It should be noted that the overall trade figures reported here also include Japanese species of the genus Goniurosaurus; more than 7,000 specimens imported were reported as Goniurosaurus spp. These data were not available to the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses Team and therefore it is not possible to determine what proportion of specimens were exported from Japan. A European market survey in March 2018 confirmed that the trade in Goniurosaurus specimens mainly takes place online as well as at international reptile fairs in Europe. Specimens fetch prices between USD35\u2013200 in the international internet markets. A total of 535 specimens of six Goniurosaurus species were observed for sale in 120 different online adverts with prices from USD40\u2013137 between September 2017 and March 2018. The main species in international trade appear to be G. lichtenfelderi, G. hainanensis and G. luii; only three of the thirteen species subject to this proposal (G. kwangsiensis, G, liboensis and G. zhoui) were not observed in IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 129 international trade (Table 1). The figures presented in Table 1 should be treated with some caution as the online and physical surveys in Japan, Europe, China and Viet Nam only give a snapshot of the trade during a limited time period.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 130 Goniurosaurus araneus This species was described in 1999 and is known from rural areas surrounding Cao Bang Town in Cao Bang Province, Viet Nam (Grismer et al., 1999), and in south-eastern China in Guangxi Province (Chen et al., 2014). Field studies suggest that G. araneus has already been extirpated at its type locality due to over-harvesting for the pet trade (Ngo et al., 2016). Several extensive field surveys in Cao Bang failed to record any specimens of G. araneus in northern Viet Nam. However, G. araneus (of Chinese origin) have been observed for sale in Viet Nam in 2018. According to one dealer in Dong Nai Province, southern Viet Nam, 50 animals were illegally imported from China in 2016 and then smuggled to Thailand with a higher price of USD 150 per individual. There was a reported case of one dealer exporting over 10,000 individuals combined of G. luii and G. araneus to the USA for the pet trade (breakdown of species unknown) (Grismer et al., 1999). According to the LEMIS database of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, 138 G. araneus specimens were imported into the USA between 1999 and 2018. An online European market survey between September 2017 and March 2018 observed a total of 56 G. araneus individuals advertised. TRAFFIC observed one G. araneus in a physical market survey in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018). Occasionally G. araneus is harvested from the wild in China for use in traditional medicine. Goniurosaurus bawanglingensis This species was described in 2002 and is only known from Hainan Island, which has a forested area of only 10% (Chen et al., 2016) suggesting a maximum range of 3,290 km2 (this figure is likely to be an overestimation). During field surveys in 2017 and 2018, local rangers reported that habitat degradation and illegal harvest were frequently observed and the populations were considered to be in decline. A population study of G. bawanglingensis on Hainan Island produced a population estimate for the species of 380 individuals using both transect and mark-release-recapture methods (Qi et al., 2011). This study concentrated on the three regions of the Bangwangling National Nature Reserve where G. bawanglingensis is known to occur. The species is also known to occur in the Yinggeling Nature Reserve, but the population is unknown. TRAFFIC observed one G. bawanglingensis individual for sale online and three individuals in a physical market survey between February and May 2017 in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018).

Goniurosaurus catbaensis Goniurosaurus catbaensis is an island endemic, only known from Cat Ba Island, Viet Nam (surface area of 200 km2). The population was reported to be severely fragmented and the habitat declining (Nguyen & Schingen, 2016). The total wild population has not been estimated. However, preliminary estimations of population size along seven transects (each of 1.1-4.2 km in length) at two sites on Cat Ba Island were repeatedly undertaken in July and August 2014, and again in May 2015. Small numbers (12-17 individuals) were encountered each month. Goniurosaurus catbaensis was found in relatively low densities of 1.2 individuals per transect km at sites containing suitable habitat such as limestone cliffs and caves; the species is limited to these formations and is not found throughout the whole of Cat Ba Island (Ngo et al., 2016).

Even though only recently described (2008), G. catbaensis has already been regularly observed on offer in European pet markets and in local pet shops in southern Viet Nam as well as in Hang Market, Hai Phong City, northern Viet Nam during recent years. Specimens of G. catbaensis were collected at the type locality and subsequently offered for sale for USD 7\u201325 within Viet Nam. At least 20 specimens of G. catbaensis were reportedly smuggled to Thailand with a higher price up to USD 150 per individual. Goniurosaurus catbaensis was recorded for sale in Europe for USD 340 per pair. On the largest European reptile classifieds website, G. catbaensis was the species most commonly advertised of seven Vietnamese endemic reptile observed over a one month period in 2017 (Janssen & Indenbaum, 2018).

A market survey in March 2018 surveying online IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 131 adverts and international reptile fairs observed G. hainanensis for sale for USD 40\u2013160 (162 individuals) in Europe. According to the LEMIS database of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, 999 G. hainanensis specimens were imported into the USA between 1999 and 2018. TRAFFIC observed eight G. hainanensis individuals in a physical survey in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018). Goniurosaurus huuliensis This species was described in 2008 and is only known from a single nature reserve in Lang Song Province in Viet Nam (Orlov et al., 2008). No population or density estimate could be found for G. huuliensis in the literature. G. huuliensis specimens have been used locally in traditional medicine and have been advertised online and recorded for sale in shops in Viet Nam. According to an interview with a pet shop owner in Dong Nai Province, southern Viet Nam in April 2018, G. huuliensis was not available in stock, as they were very difficult to be collected in the wild at that time. At least 20 specimens of G. lichtenfelderi or G. huuliensis were recorded to have been allegedly smuggled without any permits from Viet Nam to Thailand with prices about USD 100 per individual in 2016. TRAFFIC observed five G. huuliensis for sale online and at a reptile fair between February and May 2017 in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018).

No population or density estimate could be found for G. liboensis in the literature. One advert was observed during a survey of the online market Tabao.com in November 2018, where G. liboensis was offered by a dealer in unknown quantities. Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi This species was described in 1897 and is known from three provinces and one archipelago in Viet Nam (Nguyen, 2018). No population or density estimate could be found for G. lichtenfelderi in the literature. In Viet Nam a survey in 2018 (physical as well as online) found that G. lichtenfelderi is being offered locally for USD 100 per animal. According to an interview with a pet shop owner in Dong Nai Province, southern Viet Nam in April 2018, G. lichtenfelderi was not available in stock, as they were very difficult to be collected in the wild at that time. At least 20 specimens of G. lichtenfelderi or G. huuliensis were recorded to have been allegedly smuggled without any permits from Viet Nam to Thailand with prices about USD 100 per individual in 2016. TRAFFIC observed one G. lichtenfelderi for sale online between February and May 2017 in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018). According to the LEMIS database of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, 7,281 G. lichtenfelderi specimens were imported into the USA between 1999 and 2018.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 132 Goniurosaurus luii This species was described in 1999 and is known from northern Viet Nam and the border area of western Guangxi, China (Grismer et al., 1999; Yang & Chan, 2015). Information on the species\u2019 natural history is still poorly known and data on its abundance in Viet Nam is lacking to date (Ngo et al., 2016). A study in northern Viet Nam of one population in 2014 observed 15 animals along seven transects and estimated the total population size to be 21; for fear of illegal collection, the exact localities and area of the site were not reported (Ngo et al., 2016). Evidence from field work suggests that G. luii is already extirpated at its type locality due to over-harvesting for the pet trade; It was claimed that G. luii reached very high prices per individual in importing countries after it was described in 1999. Since 2014, wild-caught G. luii individuals have been frequently recorded in local pet shops from Dong Nai Province and Ho Chi Minh City, southern Viet Nam (as well as online) - a survey in 2018 found that G. luii is being offered locally for USD 20 - 25 per animal. Interviews with two local dealers and two private keepers in southern Viet Nam revealed that they paid villagers living within the species\u2019 range in northern Viet Nam to collect specimens of this species. According to local traders, the species is frequently being exported illegally to Thailand and Indonesia (at least 50 specimens per transaction, USD 100-150 per individual) for re-export to Europe and USA. Between 1999 and 2018 608 G. luii were reported as imported into the USA. In 1996, one dealer in China reportedly exported a combination of over 10,000 G. luii and G. araneus to the USA for the pet trade (breakdown of species unknown) (Grismer et al., 1999). TRAFFIC observed one G. luii for sale online between February and May 2017 in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018). Occasionally G. luii is harvested from the wild in China for use in the traditional medicine.

Local rangers reported during surveys in 2017/2018 that habitat degradation and illegal harvest had frequently been observed and the populations could be considered to be in decline. No population or density estimate could be found for G. zhelongi in the literature. TRAFFIC observed two G. zhelongi individuals for sale at a reptile fair in Japan (from Wakao et al., 2018). Goniurosaurus zhoui This species was described in 2018 and is only known from Hainan Island, which has a forested area of only 10% (Chen et al., 2016) suggesting a maximum range of 3,290 km2 (this figure is likely to be an overestimation). There are no population or density data for G. zhoui and there is no evidence of this species in international trade. Additional Information Threats Pressure from harvesting is considered a serious threat, since Goniurosaurus species are habitat specialists occurring in low densities in the wild, most species have highly limited distribution ranges and at least three species are thought to have been locally extirpated. Other threats include habitat loss (e.g. due to quarrying, forest clearance for agriculture, illegal timber logging, infrastructure), impacts from tourism activities, climate change and associated exceptional weather events, such as increasingly extreme floods and storms in north-eastern Viet Nam which have resulted in mass die-offs. Some species in the genus are believed to be especially vulnerable to extinction by climate change due to an assumed narrow temperature optimum and limited options for behavioural and physiological adaptation. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 133 Conservation, management and legislation According to the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Wildlife, anyone who intends to hunt or catch wildlife that is not under special state protection must obtain a license and observe the quota assigned. From 2000 onwards, the former recognised G. lichtenfelderi and G. hainanensis have been listed as species of terrestrial wildlife that are beneficial or of important economic or scientific value so logically the newly described species of Goniurosaurus in China considered as cryptic species of G. lichtenfelderi and G. hainanensis are also under protection. Goniurosaurus hainanensis and G. bawanglingensis have been further listed as wildlife under special local protection in Hainan province. In nature reserves, the hunting and catching of wildlife and other activities which are harmful to the survival of wildlife are prohibited. No member of the genus Goniurosaurus is as yet included in any wildlife protection laws in Viet Nam. However, collecting wild animals for the pet trade without permits is illegal in the country. Permits are required for collection for all forms of trade in Goniurosaurus spp. not specifically for the pet trade (CITES Management Authority of Viet Nam, pers. comm.). Collecting wild animals including Goniurosaurus species has been strictly restricted within protected areas as national parks and nature reserves. Goniurosaurus species have been proposed to be listed in the Governmental Decree as Group II B, which will be confirmed in early 2019.The proposed listing of Goniurosaurus spp. in the Governmental Decree will be automatic if the genus is listed in Appendix II. If the genus is not listed in Appendix II, then there would be debate surrounding its inclusion. Inclusion in Group II B would more strictly limit international exports rather than regulate domestic trade (CITES Management Authority of Viet Nam, pers. comm.). There are no existing specific measures in either China or Viet Nam to protect the habitat of Goniurosaurus species or specifically protect the species. However, some species occur within protected areas. Artificial Propagation/captive breeding Goniurosaurus species are also being kept by zoos and other wildlife organisations for scientific purposes and captive breeding.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85cf4762-3349-4dbb-be8a-cf8ca8730dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "85cf4762-3349-4dbb-be8a-cf8ca8730dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c29a61198dc0850bbcdcaf6da17a6d770c3712bff065babf62a52d514f09ab71"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a88a5a1-ebe9-4c00-ad7b-ccddb5d00b3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd65efb3746313869011e0c66cd100268ec12711484ea9f1ffbd8eaaab209ed1"}}, "hash": "b2bc42e496236bcca66d5cfed073d5f41a94e14dbbbccbcd9d5c3dc51b2a9d54", "text": "A total of 34 specimens are being kept in seven institutions in USA/Europe: - G. hainanensis n=7 (3 x wild-caught, and 4 x captive-bred) - G. lichtenfelderi n=11 (all captive bred) - G. luii n=12 (all captive-bred) - G. spp n=4 (1 x captive-bred and 3 x undetermined) G. araneus, G. catbaensis and G. huuliensis are also known to be kept in zoos (numbers unknown).

According to the US LEMIS database, a total of 5,086 captive-bred Goniurosaurus spp. specimens were imported into the USA between 1999 and 2018 for commercial purposes and scientific uses. Implementation challenges (including similar species) The remaining six species within this genus are endemic to Japan: G. kuroiwae, G. orientalis, G. sengokuii, G. splendens, G. toyamai and G. yamashinae. The Japanese species can be distinguished from other species in the genus since the precloacal pores are absent, and claws are not sheathed by scales (in the other 13 species, precloacal pores are present, and the claws are sheathed by scales). Studies revealed that morphological characters amongst species within each group of the genus (the Chinese and Vietnamese species versus the Japanese species) are significantly similar. Species identification by non- specialists is therefore difficult, especially if location data are not (accurately) provided. As a result, molecular analyses are necessary to distinguish species. One study mentions that there are no significant differences in diagnostic characters between G. luii and G. kadoorieorum (Ngo et al., 2016). Blair et al (2009) indicate that molecular investigation may be necessary to determine species designations in the G. lichtenfelderi group (which includes : G. hainanensis, G. lichtenfelderi and G. zhoui). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 27 134 Potential risk(s) of a listing Given that the six Japanese Goniurosaurus species are not included in the proposal, this could lead to species in China and Viet Nam being mis-labelled as Japanese species in order to circumvent CITES controls (although it is reportedly possible to distinguish the two groups of species based on morphological differences). Listing of the Chinese and Vietnamese species could cause an increase in demand for the non-listed Japanese species. Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation Given that the Goniurosaurus is a cryptic genus, there is a high likelihood that further species will be discovered in the near future, and it appears that newly described species are quickly over-exploited. If the proposed genus- level listing is adopted, any new species would automatically also be listed in Appendix II and therefore protected from potential overexploitation.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 Inclusion of Tokay Gecko Gekko gecko in Appendix II Proponents: European Union, India, Philippines and United States of America Summary: The Tokay Gecko Gekko gecko is the second largest extant gecko species, with a striking bluish-grey body with red or orange spots. It has a widespread distribution throughout South- east Asia, China, Bangladesh and India. It has also been introduced to several countries including Brazil, Madagascar, the USA and areas of the West Indies. This species inhabits a broad range of habitats from forest to human-modified environments. Over a six-month breeding period Tokay Geckos produce clutches of one to two eggs laid at 30-day intervals, which are deposited in tree holes and guarded by both parents. The species has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for hundreds of years and is sold throughout South-east Asia in dried form or preserved in alcohol; to a lesser extent, it is also traded live for pets. Consumption of G. gecko for medicinal purposes does occur domestically in South-east Asian countries, but international trade is assumed to be on a much larger scale and consumption is centred around China and Viet Nam. Thailand and Indonesia (particularly Java) are the main exporters; G. gecko is not protected in these countries but subject to regulation by quota/permit: - Thailand \u2013 Exports of G. gecko from Thailand alone have been reported to be between two to five million geckos per year going to China, Taiwan Province of China (which reported imports of 11 million from Thailand between 2004 and 2013), Malaysia and the USA. The species is not nationally protected in Thailand, but exports and imports of the species require a permit. - Indonesia \u2013 Three traders were estimated to be exporting 1.2 million dried G. gecko annually in 2006, although Indonesia has no quota for exports of dried G. gecko for medicinal purposes. In 2006 the quota for live animals was 50,000 individuals, of which 5,000 were intended for domestic consumption and 45,000 were intended for export. Exports were also reported from Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e6b21ca-ff6c-412b-9995-1d49dd396aee": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e6b21ca-ff6c-412b-9995-1d49dd396aee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51521a9e21d27cc39db78c0a2c61614ef3de52232bf394b326d4140191c094cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9924363-4923-4a68-aa55-419c528ebf7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fe77ac400471fd9b572b60c4c789814b1443fbe772f458351262798f30caade"}}, "hash": "8158ada74c102f9f72d9637315ce3fa444eaec182036328a81ae57cf5bf17193", "text": "A novel trend in G. gecko demand emerged in 2009 after consumption of its parts was promoted as a cure for HIV/AIDS.

Thailand stated that G. gecko was considered abundant countrywide (least concern in 2005), although declines were noted in the north-east, and poaching was causing the population to \u201cdwindle\u201d. The Philippines reported declines. Population trends are not clear from other range States. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 136 Gekko gecko has some form of legal protection in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, Peninsular Malaysia, the Philippines and Viet Nam; but it is not protected (outside of protected areas) in Indonesia, Myanmar or Thailand. Analysis: Gekko gecko has an extensive range across a large part of Asia and is known to be present in a broad range of habitats including human-modified environments. Population information is scarce and although some range States have anecdotal reports of population declines, others have reported stable populations and it is considered to be common in much of its range. The latest IUCN Red List assessment to be published in 2019 categorises the species as Least Concern. While population information is contradictory, there are concerns regarding the population in the main consuming countries of China (critically endangered, 2016) and Viet Nam (near threatened, 2015, localised declines noted). There are also concerns over certain populations in the main importing areas: Thailand (least concern, 2005, with declines in the north-east which borders Viet Nam) and Java, Indonesia (anecdotally reported to be extremely difficult to find, whereas in parts of Bali and Sulawesi it is still common). The species has been harvested for medicinal purposes for hundreds of years and there is a large body of evidence to show that the species is currently traded in the millions or tens of millions annually (most are presumed to be wild-caught), for use in traditional medicines. While G. gecko is still considered to be common throughout most of its range, in the main consuming countries the populations appear to be declining, as do populations in other range States now exporting to these countries. Although there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding the impact of international trade, it may be precautionary to list the species in Appendix II in order to ensure that trade of specimens from the wild does not threaten the species.

Taxonomy Gekko gecko (Linnaeus, 1758). This proposal does not consider Chinese specimens recently described as Black Gecko G. reevesii as a separate species. The CITES Nomenclature Specialist of the Animals Committee considered that \u201cthe recognition of reevesii as a separate species is too recent to be generally known in the biological and trade management communities, and its distinction from the widespread and widely traded Gekko gecko appears insufficient for consistent, reliable identification of specimens in trade. Thus, for practical purposes it appears advisable for CITES purposes to retain the traditional concept of Gekko gecko, and to include mildly-different peripheral and island populations (including Chinese specimens attributed to reevesii) as part of the species until stronger evidence of taxonomic distinctness and practical ability to differentially identify specimens in trade becomes available.\u201d The Chinese Red List recognises G. reevesii as a species (critically endangered, 2016) (Jiang et al.,2016). Range: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam Introduced populations: USA (Florida, Hawaii and Texas), Lesser Antilles (including Martinique), Madagascar, Belize and Brazil (Carlos, Junior, Piva, Batista, & Machado, 2015).The species\u2019 status in Taiwan Province of China is disputed; there are very few occurrence records, and it is unclear whether they represent introduced individuals.

In captivity, the species has been known to live for 23 years, but longevity in the wild is considered likely to be shorter. The population status of Gekko gecko is largely unknown, the perception of the species as common is considered to be a result of its wide distribution, relatively high fecundity, and ability to thrive in human modified landscapes, but several declines had been recorded. The IUCN Red List assessment (accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update) describes the species as common in its range, but there is no global population estimate and population trends are reported to be unknown. There are no national or local population estimates for Gekko gecko in any of its range and only a few studies that consider their population density within a given area (Huang et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2009). Many reports of declines are anecdotal and based on reports in the media (Thongsa-Ard & Thongsa-Ard, 2003) rather than in the form of empirical evidence from studies over a given time period. The availability of information on the status of Gekko gecko is geographically patchy. Gekko gecko was described as Rare in a field guide to the reptiles of Nepal. In Lao PDR, it is listed as a category III species in the 2008 Wildlife and Aquatic Law, which is reserved for \u201ccommon wildlife\u201d that is not \u201cclassified in the rare and near extinct categories\u201d. In the Malaysian States of Sabah and Sarawak, the species was considered \u201cquite rare\u201d. In Bangladesh, populations of Gekko gecko were estimated to have \u201crecently\u201d declined by 50% due to collection as a result of novel medicinal claims. Although, the CITES (MA) of Bangladesh reported the species to be common in 2018 and noted that it presumably had a \u201clarge population\u201d in the country. In 2015, the Red List of Bangladesh (Ahsan & Khan, 2015) has assessed G. gecko as least concern, stating that although there is poaching pressure, the species is widely distributed, with a presumed large population and a presumed stable population trend. Declines have been reported in Indonesia. Anecdotal accounts from Indonesia suggest that trapping pressure continues to be high, and that Gekko gecko is considered to be valuable in trade and therefore trappers will seek them out if they hear them calling (C. Wilcox pers. comm.). In Java specifically, it has been reported that the species has been extremely difficult to find in the past few years (A. Miller pers. comm.). In other locations such as Bali, G. gecko was the most commonly encountered reptile in a study of human modified landscapes (Janiawati et al., 2016) and in Sulawesi, G. gecko was considered common in Lore Lindu National Park (Wanger, 2011). Whilst the species was considered abundant in most countrywide areas in Thailand, the status of the wild population was unknown according to the CITES MA of Thailand. Declines have been reported in the media in north-eastern Thailand. Gekko gecko was classified as a species of least concern in Thailand\u2019s 2005 Red Data Book. However, it was reported in the media that \u201cthe gecko population has dwindled in Myanmar and Thailand\u201d after years of poaching. It has been noted, however, that the species is commonly associated with human- modified environments and can be common in houses in suburbia but is at lower densities in urban and agricultural landscapes according to a study conducted in northern Thailand. Declines have been reported in north-eastern Thailand. In China, the population of Gekko gecko was reported to have been \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d in recent years as a result of habitat destruction and hunting, and the species was categorised as an endangered species in China\u2019s 1998 Red Data Book. In the 2015 version of China\u2019s Red Data Book, G. gecko is categorised as critically endangered, but it should be noted that G. reevesii was considered as a separate species (Jiang et al., 2016).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 138 Gekko gecko was listed as threatened, vulnerable, and near threatened in the 2000, 2007 and 2015 versions of Viet Nam Red Data Book respectively. In the 2015 version, the population was estimated to have declined (by less than 30%) over the last 10 years, and possible declines in upland areas were noted as a result of small- scale harvesting for traditional medicines. Studies in India found Gekko gecko in commercial areas, residential areas and forested areas (Purkayastha et al., 2011), with some studies showing that more individuals were found in mud houses than they were in trees (Singh & Choudhury, 2016). Although there is evidence showing that G. gecko occurs at lower densities in modified environments (Weterings et al., 2018), it is clear that they are habitat generalists and are found widely in human modified environments. The only numerical estimates of decline that could be located were for Bangladesh and Viet Nam, though population decreases have also been noted in Indonesia, north-eastern Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar, and \u201cdrastic\u201d population decreases have been reported in southern China. Although numerical estimates have been given for a 50% decline in Bangladesh and declines of 20% were reported in Viet Nam\u2019s 2007 Red Data Book, neither of these figures appear to be based on any empirical evidence. All of the other noted population decreases have been from media sources rather than based on any scientific population studies. Deforestation rates in several range States (such as Indonesia and Malaysia) have historically been noted to be high. B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences National utilisation Gekko gecko is principally used for medicinal purposes and is traded either preserved in alcohol or as dried specimens, but G. gecko meat was also reported to be served in restaurants in cities close to the Viet Nam/China border. Virtually all trade is thought to be in animals that were harvested from the wild. Although the species is used domestically in Indonesia for various medicinal purposes, the volumes of geckos involved were considered to be negligible compared to those involved in the international trade, whose consumption as traditional medicine is thought to be centred in China and Viet Nam. Geckos harvested in Viet Nam are mainly used domestically rather than exported. The CITES MA of Bangladesh noted that there was no record of local consumption of G. gecko in the country. Gekko gecko has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for hundreds of years, where it has been reported to be effective in suppressing asthma, treating diabetes and erectile dysfunction, replenishing \u201cthe kidney essence\u201d, and relieving coughing. A novel demand emerged in 2009, for use as a cure for HIV/AIDS; this was centred in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore and peaked in 2010/2011 but has since declined. The reasons for this are considered to be unclear but were thought to be related to a combination of improved enforcement, realisation that the claims were unfounded following World Health Organization statements outlining the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of their use, and the prevalence of scams. By 2013 the trade in Tokay Geckos for novel medicinal claims was considered to be relatively small and did not appear to pose a threat to the conservation of the species. Trade Levels of international trade in Gekko gecko are considered to be very high, with the principal destinations for dried exports of Tokay Geckos (i.e. those which are intended for consumption as traditional medicine) reported to be China and Viet Nam. The volumes of G. gecko imported into these countries annually were reported to be unknown but substantial. Taiwan Province of China alone, for example, was reported in 2013 to have imported ~15 million G. gecko individuals since 2004; 71% from Thailand with the remainder coming mostly from Indonesia (Taiwan Province of China import data). In China, reported annual trade levels of G. gecko in Pingxiang City were of 20,000\u201330,000 individuals, and Dongxing City of 2,400\u20136,000 individuals.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 139 More recent reports from Indonesia suggest that in 2014 this quota was increased by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry to over three million live captive-bred Gekko gecko, intended to supply the international pet trade (Nijman & Shepherd, 2015). Research predicted that it was not an economically viable option to produce geckos on that scale and suggested that captive-breeding permits were being issued to launder wild-caught geckos for illegal export as dried specimens (Nijman & Shepherd, 2015). Previous research had shown that the quota of 45,000 live geckos (mentioned above) intended for the international pet trade was drastically exceeded and that 1.2 million dried G. gecko were exported to China outside of the quota system (Nijman, Shepherd, Mumpuni, & Sanders, 2012). The vast majority of global trade in Gekko gecko is thought to originate from Thailand and Java, Indonesia. However, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Peninsular Malaysia, Cambodia and the Philippines have also been highlighted as important source countries. It has been estimated that 2\u20135 million Tokay Geckos were exported from Thailand to China, Taiwan Province of China, Malaysia and the USA each year; whereas other reports state that, on average, the country exported 40 t of Tokay Geckos (equivalent to ca. 1,467,000 individuals) annually to Taiwan Province of China alone. Thailand reported exporting 1,099,178 live geckos between 2014\u20132018 (for unknown purposes), and 1,455,362 \u201clive and dried\u201d specimens in 2017 and 2018 combined. It was noted that export volumes had decreased, reportedly as a response to declining demand in destination countries and the increasing costs of export procedures. The main harvest areas in Thailand were reported to be in northern and north-eastern regions. A one day survey at Mong La market in Myanmar counted 72 Gekko gecko bodies (Shepherd & Nijman, 2007). Many of the Tokay Geckos destined for the pet trade have been reported to originate in Viet Nam and Java, Indonesia. It has been reported that the species was mainly exported to the EU and USA; however, Gekko gecko has also been noted to be present, among others, in the pet trade of Taiwan Province of China and Malaysia. According to trade data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS), direct imports of Gekko gecko to the USA 2007\u20132016 mainly comprised 179,681 live geckos, the vast majority of which were wild-sourced (96%) and the remainder reported as captive-bred. Live, wild- sourced geckos were imported from Viet Nam and Indonesia (56 and 44%, respectively). Imports of live geckos by the USA declined by over 50% between 2007 and 2016. Of the 173,275 live, wild-sourced geckos imported from Indonesia and Viet Nam, 12% were re-exported by the USA (information on destination of re-exports was not available). Additionally, imports of bodies (2,447 kg and 96 reported by number) and \u201cmedicinal parts or bodies\u201d (8,929 kg and 476 reported by number) were reported 2007\u20132016, most of which were wild-sourced and imported from China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Thailand. Illegal trade The export of dead, dried specimens of Gekko gecko from Indonesia is not permitted; however, high levels of trade were still considered to take place. It was reported that in 2006 the country\u2019s three largest traders exported 1.2 million kiln-dried individuals to China, which would require a harvest of approximately 31,000 individuals per week. Illegal exports were thought to be facilitated by the laundering of wild-caught G. gecko individuals through legally registered captive-breeding facilities. In 2011, 6.75 t (equates to 225,000 dried geckos (Caillabet, 2013)) of illegally harvested Gekko gecko were seized en route from Indonesia to Hong Kong SAR.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 140 In Malaysia, collection, selling, import, export, re-export and ownership of Gekko gecko is prohibited without a licence from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (PERHILITAN). It has been noted that several dealers of G. gecko possessed these licences; however, according to PERHILITAN\u2019s head of enforcement, no licences to trade in Tokay Geckos have ever been issued. Rather than evidence of illegal activity, however, it has been considered that these contradictions are evidence of miscommunication or a lack of co-ordination between PERHILITAN\u2019s headquarters and its State offices. Additional Information Conservation, management and legislation Bangladesh: Gekko gecko is listed in Schedule II of the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012 (Government of Bangladesh, 2012). Under this Act, hunting, export and import of any wild animal requires a licence. Possession of wild animals as well as their parts or derivatives must be registered (Government of Bangladesh, 2012). Cambodia: Gekko gecko is listed as a common species under the 2002 Forestry Law. Customary use is permitted, but trading or transporting Tokay Geckos above levels \u201cnecessary for customary use\u201d is prohibited and can incur a fine of up to three times the market value of the species. China: Gekko gecko is listed under a number of regulations that afford it protection. It is included in (a) the Regulations for the Conservation of Wild Terrestrial Animals, under which the sale of protected species and their derivatives is forbidden and (b) the Regulations on the Conservation and Management of Wild Resources of Medicinal Plants and Animals, under which it is listed as a Category II species (collection is \u201csubject to the prior grant of a Medicine Collection Permit \u2026approved by medicine departments at higher level\u201d). The species is additionally listed in Appendix II of the 1988 Wild Animal Protection Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, which stipulates that, as a Class 2 State protected animal, the species can only be collected, used and traded under licence (People\u2019s Republic of China, 1988). In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region, it is listed as a Class 1 key species, as a result of which any collection and trade is prohibited unless it is \u201cnecessary for scientific research, domestication and breeding, exhibition or other special purposes\u201d. Use of the species for any of these exceptional circumstances requires approval from the Department of Wildlife Administration. India: Gekko gecko was listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 in 2014, which prohibits collection except for educational purposes and scientific research. Indonesia: The species is not protected by Indonesian law, but wild specimens are subject to a national annual harvest and export quota. Breeders wishing to export Gekko gecko (whether captive-bred or wild-caught) must be registered with the Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation (PHKA), and breeders supplying specimens to exporters must be registered with the Regional Natural Resource Management Office (BKSDA) offices at a provincial level. Indonesia has a quota for G. gecko for domestic consumption and live export for the pet industry, whose setting and regulation was reported to be managed by the CITES Scientific and Management Authorities respectively. Collection is only permitted from 23 designated sites, mainly in Java but also in Bali, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Sumatra. There is no quota for the skin or medicinal trade. In 2006 the harvest quota for G. gecko was reported to be 50,000 live individuals for the pet industry, of which 5,000 were intended for domestic consumption and 45,000 were intended for export. Most of the quota (24,000 individuals) was for the harvest of G. gecko in Java.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8eba68d7-e245-489c-a585-20743b9bb1b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "8eba68d7-e245-489c-a585-20743b9bb1b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3c38bcaa93b1c514e5f7c6ac7cc9272c9620313df4d43a22304b411efa44848"}, "2": {"node_id": "d37ba3d1-96b1-4a2c-89d1-8d604e908f81", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "935fbfd1afb1391503a322d36f84a9927aca5293b8115e79a4053080e65feecb"}}, "hash": "5694e5a0cc905acaeb1bad5bc93aa1f26da9e13255e6e5bab3ef930d415a4864", "text": "It is unclear whether the export of live individuals was within quota, but in the same year it was reported that 1.2 million dried individuals were exported from the country\u2019s three largest traders to China, in contravention of (a) the scale of the annual quota and (b) the nature of the quota (which is for the export of live specimens only).

Hunting of species listed in Category III is only permitted in specified seasons and is only allowed \u201cusing tools and equipment not harmful to the animals\u2019 population\u201d. Hunting and capture for commercial purposes requires permission from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Export of G. gecko requires, among other things, an origin certificate, a certificate of health and permission from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 141 Malaysia: Gekko gecko was protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010, where it is listed as Protected Wildlife under its First Schedule. Under the act, hunting, selling, import, export, re-export or ownership of Tokay Geckos (or any derivative of them) is only allowed with the possession of a licence issued by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (PERHILITAN). Possession or hunting of the species without a licence can lead to penalties of up to MYR 50,000 (USD 16,000) (or MYR 200,000 (USD 63,957) for females and juveniles) and up to two years in prison. According to PERHILTAN (in 2012), no licences had ever been issued in Peninsular Malaysia to hunt, own or trade in Tokay Geckos. The species is not protected under the State law of Sabah and Sarawak. Myanmar: No species-specific measures are in place, but all species within protected areas are protected from harvest in accordance with the Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Areas Law 2018. Nepal: Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 2029, wildlife (including Gekko gecko) cannot be hunted without a licence (Government of Nepal, 1973). The species is currently proposed for Schedule III listing in an upcoming amendment to the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 2029. Philippines: Gekko gecko is nationally protected under the Republic Act 9147 or Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act. In accordance with section 27 of the said law, hunting and trade of G. gecko in the Philippines can only be allowed subject to certain requirements and prior issuance of permits (e.g. a Wildlife Collector\u2019s Permit for commercial breeding, a Gratuitous Permit for scientific research, or a Wildlife Special Use Permit for direct trade purposes). No permits have been issued for G. gecko so far. A number of private individuals have been permitted legally to possess G. gecko provided they were acquired prior to the passage of the Wildlife Conservation and Protection Act (2001) and were registered with the government. Viet Nam: Hunting of Gekko gecko is prohibited in protected areas. The species is listed under the \u201ccommon forest animal\u201d category whose exploitation is controlled by Circular No. 47/2012/TT-BNNPTNT of 2012. Collection outside of protected areas requires a permit from the country\u2019s Provincial Forest Protection Department, and those requesting a permit must carry out a species population assessment and submit a plan for exploitation. The legal origin of specimens must be certified according to the procedure outlined in Circular No. 01/2012/TT-BNNPTNT. Thailand: The species is not nationally protected, but exports and imports of the species require a permit. Hunting and collection are prohibited in protected areas.

In the Philippines less than 10 individuals have been bred in captivity, and no legal trade of captive-bred specimens has been recorded to date. Implementation challenges (including similar species) The genus Gekko consists of 45 named species. Gekko gecko is considered to be \u201ceasily identifiable\u201d as a result of its orange-spotted, blue-grey skin (however, as previously noted, \u201cblack geckos\u201d have a different colouration). Their vocalisations are considered to be unmistakable. It is unclear whether dried Tokay Geckos maintain a diagnostic feature that allows them to be easily identified from other species. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 28 142 The only other species which could potentially be confused with Gecko gecko is Smith\u2019s Green-eyed Gecko, Gekko smithii, but there is no evidence of this species being utilised in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Potential risk(s) of a listing Given that some researchers have already found substitute species being sold as Gekko gecko for use in TCM (Wagner & Dittmann, 2014), a listing could promote the use of substitute species, which may not be as commonly distributed as G. gecko. A major threat to Tylototriton asperrimus (subject to CoP18 Prop. 41) is said to be harvest in China for use in traditional medicine, where it is considered a substitute for Gekko gecko (van Dijk et al., 2008). Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation Given the patchy nature of both trade and population data of Gekko gecko a listing would certainly provide data in the future of the full scale of international legal trade of G. gecko. A listing may also promote the collection of empirical data on populations and densities of G. gecko throughout its range. This could alternatively be achieved through an Appendix III listing if enough populations were listed. References Ahsan, M.F. & Khan, M.M.H. (2015).

It was first discovered in 2005 and is endemic to Union Island of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is only found in the mature forest on Chatham Bay, from near sea level to 300 meters above sea level. This species was classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2011. There is only one known population of G. daudini, currently tentatively estimated at almost 10,000 and inferred to be decreasing. A survey in 2017 found that densities have dropped by almost 80% since 2010 in some parts of the species range. It has a known extent of occurrence of 1 km2 and an area of occupancy of 0.5 km2. No export permits for commercial purposes have ever been issued. Illegal trade in this species was first reported soon after the species was described in 2005 and exploitation is thought to have accelerated in recent years for the international pet trade. Collection of individuals damages the environment and exposes the remaining geckos to increased risk of predation and desiccation. Little quantitative data are available on numbers traded, but on the basis of online adverts in 2016 and 2017 that identified more than a dozen dealers operating from USA, UK, the Netherlands and Germany and significant microhabitat destruction caused by local harvesters, the proponents conclude that a significant number of geckos are being taken illegally from the wild population. Some captive-breeding appears to be taking place in non-range States. In addition to threats from alien species and habitat destruction, a road constructed in 2005 has improved access to Chatham Bay. The proposed further development in this area would significantly impact the species\u2019 remaining habitat. The species is protected from harvest by existing legislation and is the subject of a Conservation Action Plan that seeks to protect the habitat of G. daudini, enhance population survival and incorporate local stakeholders. Analysis: Population estimates for Gonatodes daudini indicate a relatively small population of just under 10,000 individuals, including both mature adults and juveniles. The density of the gecko population has fallen by nearly 80% in some parts of its limited range since 2010. The recorded extent of occupancy (1 km2) and the area of occupancy (0.5 km2) are very restricted, and it is only found in one location that is highly vulnerable to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors and has undergone declines. Therefore, the species meets the Appendix I biological criteria. Although the numbers in trade are unclear, illegal harvesting of specimens for international trade is impacting the microhabitat and by inference, also affecting the species. The species therefore meets the criteria for listing in Appendix I in Annex 1 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17).

Range Saint Vincent and the Grenadines IUCN Global Category Critically Endangered B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii) Ver 3.1 (assessed in 2011) (Powell & Henderson, 2011). Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population There is only a single population of G. daudini. A survey conducted in 2010 (Bentz et al., 2011) estimated the population to be 6,562 individuals. A transect based survey in August 2018 estimated the total population to be 9,957. In both surveys the estimates were considered tentative because of the small sample size and patchy distribution of the species. Extensive surveys have failed to detect any other populations on Union Island. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 29 144 B) Restricted area of distribution The single population of G. daudini has a limited range found only in Chatham Bay on Union Island. It has a known extent of occurrence of approximately 1 km2 and an area of occupancy of 0.5 km2, and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat resulting from increasing development and reportedly from collection pressure. This litter dwelling species relies on relatively mature forest, and this area of the island holds one of the last relatively intact areas of secondary forest (Bentz et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a72c5cf8-dcf3-439d-8ab5-82adc3361a88": {"__data__": {"id_": "a72c5cf8-dcf3-439d-8ab5-82adc3361a88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65b608b63cabef7b26d04d8008033e46f6c77ee5026a30d521c1b25cde7b684f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1da54664-4cd0-4ec1-b532-b77e385f144f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d10281724053ddcde8aba6b0ab67c316d5b0f903c2fac2c8bc6e7a4d44e8a3f"}}, "hash": "6e45fca95f277adfe80d06bfc76815835d3edc5b680b98cb169dec9e51e66f8c", "text": "2011).

However, the 2018 survey found that population densities in some of the species range has decreased. Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Prior to G. daudini being formally described in 2005, this species was unknown and there is no evidence to suggest it was collected or exported under any other name. As a native reptile under the Wildlife Protection Act 1987 no person may export any wildlife from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines without the written permission of the Minister. No permit has ever been issued to collect or export G. daudini for commercial purposes. Only a small number of permits have been granted to scientists to catch the geckos for research purposes, but in most cases, this is on condition that the animals are released unharmed. Illegal trade was first reported soon after the species was described and exploitation is said to have accelerated in recent years, driven by the commercial demand of the international pet trade. Desk-based research in 2016 and 2017 found more than a dozen dealers offering live G. daudini at prices upwards of USD 700 each from addresses in the USA, UK and the Netherlands and Germany. This species was included in a review of species which may warrant further consideration in preparation for CoP17 (UNEP-WCMC, 2015). In this review a search of trade online found a wild-sourced pair in Germany for USD 1,450 and a single male for USD 500, these advertisements included shipping to the USA. More recent searches online found information on people selling and wishing to buy G. daudini on forums such as Terraristik, suggesting there is continuing demand for this species in the international pet trade. A study conducted between September 2014 and December 2018 for online trade in G. daudini found a total of 19 advertisements with a total of 36 individuals offered for sale, the most frequent reported origin countries were Germany (39%), Netherlands (22%) and Austria (14%). A total of five individuals advertised during this period were reported to have been wild-sourced (Shepherd et al., 2019). In addition, there is evidence online that hobbyists are claiming to be breeding G. daudini in captivity, in some cases for commercial purposes, however the veracity of these claims cannot be verified. Collectors damage the gecko\u2019s environment and expose the remaining individuals to increased risk of predation and desiccation. In 2016 the Forestry Department, Fauna & Flora International and Union Island Environmental Attackers, conducted a total of five days of surveys of the gecko population in Chatham Bay (Daltry et al., 2016). A dozen geckos were found during this survey, a quarter of which had broken tails which could suggest either predator attacks or careless human captures. It was also clear from the survey that collectors had been active in the area, leaving many of the logs and rocks overturned from collecting specimens. Additional Information Threats Over-harvesting for commercial purposes is said to be a major threat to the continued survival of the G. daudini population in the wild. Trade is having a highly detrimental impact on the status of the species by both removing individuals from the population and causing critical damage to the species\u2019 microhabitat during the extraction process. The forests of Chatham Bay have also been degraded by several invasive alien plants and animals and are used for grazing domestic goats during the dry season. A road constructed in 2005 improved access to Chatham Bay forest, opening this area to risk from further development. There is a proposal to extend the road through the heart of the Chatham Bay forest, which would IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 29 145 destroy much of the rock and litter cover that represents critical habitat for this gecko and facilitates the spread of invasive alien species. Conservation, management and legislation Gonatodes daudini is not yet listed as a Protected Species, but nonetheless has significant protection under the Wildlife Protection Act 1987, as a native reptile. Under this Act; no person may export any wildlife from St Vincent & the Grenadines without the written permission of the Minister. In 2016, a Conservation Action Plan was developed by the Forestry Department, Fauna & Flora International and a diverse array of stakeholders. This plan sets out clear objectives that aim to both enhance the survival of this species, the habitat and inclusion of the local stakeholders to benefit livelihoods (Daltry et al., 2016).

Implementation challenges (including similar species) Gonatodes daudini is a distinctive miniature gecko, with a conspicuous white spot encircled first by black and then by red is also on the pineal eye. No other lizard has these distinctive markings. Therefore, no implementation challenges in terms of lookalike species are anticipated. Potential risk(s) of a listing There is the potential risk that if this species is included in CITES Appendix I that this could increase popularity amongst hobbyists. Advertisements of this species online do already mention that it is currently listed as Critically Endangered. Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation The Forestry Department is currently investigating the status of lands in Chatham Bay and intends to propose that critical habitat is afforded stricter protection, ideally as a Wildlife Reserve under the Wildlife Protection Act. It is hoped that the inclusion of G. daudini in CITES Appendix I would lead to better enforcement, including potentially the establishment of a protected area, and reduced chance of future development within its range (Daltry et al., 2016).

It is endemic to southern Madagascar and can be found at elevations of up 120 m within dry-deciduous, spiny and gallery forests, but is not found in disturbed forests. The IUCN Red List assessment of 2011 classified P. androyensis as Vulnerable with a declining population, but suggested that more research on the ecology and status of the species was needed. In 2011 the extent of occurrence was ca. 18,000 km2, but it was noted that there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. There are very little quantitative data on population size or trend, but some studies have reported the species to be rare or infrequent based on the observations of just a few individuals during transect and pit-fall trap surveys. Breeding behavior is unknown for this species, but another species within the genus (P. picta) has been observed to lay two eggs per clutch with short interclutch intervals.

Biological and trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix II (Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I Paroedura androyensis was described as \u201crare\u201d with a decreasing population trend. Its relative abundance was found to be \u201cinfrequent\u201d in a survey of Belomotse Forest in the Lower Onilahy River Valley Temporary Protected Area in southwest Madagascar in 2002. The species was assessed as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List in 2011 on the basis of its extent of occurrence of 17,970 km2, severely fragmented population, and a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. No information was found concerning the population size of Paroedura androyensis. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 30 147 Paroedura androyensis has been observed at altitudes of 40 to 80 m above sea level in dry forests, on dry coastal rocks, in transitional, littoral and spiny forests, gallery forests, shrub land, and in riparian habitats. The species has not been found in heavily disturbed forest, and reportedly disappears after initial habitat modification. It was not reported to occur within forest edges during surveys of Malahelo nor at other nearby sites of Petriky and Andohahela. Paroedura androyensis was recorded from spiny forest at an elevation of 120 m above sea level at a site 7.5 km northeast of Hazofotsy in central-southern Madagascar in 1995. Paroedura androyensis is a nocturnal species which has been described as both arboreal and as being \u201cmainly active on the ground\u201d. It is oviparous, and species of this genus usually produce a clutch of two eggs, which are buried in the ground. Feeding advice on a hobbyist website suggests that the species\u2019 diet consists of insects, mealworms and crickets. Paroedura androyensis has only ever been reported in studies that have been centred around more general herpetofauna assessments. From these studies, P. androyensis has been observed at very low levels in five protected areas (D\u2019Cruze et al., 2009; D\u2019Cruze & Sabel, 2005; Gardner, 2012; Gardner et al., 2016; Ramanamanjato et al., 2002; Raselimanana et al., 2012; Scherz et al., 2012; Theisinger & Ratianarivo, 2015), but reports often suggest conflicting ecological descriptions of the species. In the Ifotaka North Protected Area, P. androyensis was described as being absent from disturbed areas of forest (Theisinger & Ratianarivo, 2015), whereas a separate study in the same protected area discovered P. androyensis in moderately disturbed areas (Scherz et al., 2012). Although there is no population estimate for P. androyensis, a density estimate of one individual per hectare was calculated during a study from western limits of the PK32 Ranobe protected area (Gardner, 2012). This figure should be treated with caution as it was calculated from observations of only two individuals from one study site. The vast majority of the information on observations of P. androyensis comes from presence/absence data where observations have been rare/infrequent. All of the data collected from field activities comes from transects and pit-fall traps and data were almost exclusively collected during the day. Given that P. androyensis is a small (max snout to vent length of 47mm) (Glaw et al., 2001) nocturnal species which has been described as both terrestrial and arboreal, these general survey methods could underestimate the presence of the species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12807159-c32a-41fd-a6fa-1becb501ef47": {"__data__": {"id_": "12807159-c32a-41fd-a6fa-1becb501ef47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14ea37d2bafb033cfb8e10ff691a1bfd402b884ebfd553a36d720fce9a0bb320"}, "2": {"node_id": "c15ac4db-a055-4b8c-9b82-5d6923d5136b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e592f41b3fd24eca26ca30cfc95a67184c3362bebf6069da612095d49c85523"}}, "hash": "449b50a0c58ee140d31ad49b6b11c150e9da009217437f99842e01b6c2cc23f2", "text": "No specific reproductive behaviour was reported in the literature for P. androyensis, but another species within the genus (Paroedura picta) has been reported to lay two hard-shelled eggs per clutch and interclutch intervals were observed to be short (Starostova et al., 2010).

The reported destinations of these exports were (in alphabetical order): Canada, Czech Republic, France Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Russian Federation, Spain, Taiwan POC and USA. According to the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) database, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, imports of wild-caught Paroedura androyensis to the USA increased over the 10 years 2009-2018, with imports peaking in 2018 at around 600 individuals and a total of ca. 1900 imported over the ten year period. Low numbers of captive-bred specimens were reportedly imported from Madagascar to the US during the same period (mainly in 2010 and 2011), although captive breeding facilities for this species are thought not to exist in Madagascar. Several websites in the EU priced an individual of this species at around EUR 30 (USD 34) in 2018. One online pet-trade website noted that Paroedura androyensis was not easily obtained, and that captive-bred specimens of this species were rare. Two P. androyensis specimens were also seen for sale during a physical market survey that took place in Japan in 2017 (Wakao et al., 2018). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 30 148 The species is known to be collected in the south west region in the following places: Tulear II, Belalanda, Ankililoaka, Fiherenana, Antsoanabo, Mihary, Saint Augustin, Sept Lacs, and Mangily. Many of these collecting sites are located in proposed or newly created protected areas (Nouvelles Aires Prot\u00e9g\u00e9es). Samples of the species from the pet trade were found in the Toliara region, but the original location of collection of these specimens was unknown. The species was included in a list of commercially traded exotic amphibian and reptile species in Texas in the USA 2002-2008, in which it was reported to be wild-sourced and exported [presumably re-exported] from the USA. Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I One species from the Paroedura genus (Paroedura masobe) was listed in Appendix II following CoP17, but there are not thought to be any issues of resemblance between the two species. Additional Information Threats Paroedura androyensis is confined to intact forests, which are at risk from timber extraction for charcoal production and land clearance for slash and burn agriculture, both of which are ongoing throughout the species\u2019 range. A recent study has shown that annual deforestation in Madagascar has reached 99,000 ha/year between 2010 and 2014, with 46% of forest located less than 100 m from the forest edge (Vieilledent et al., 2018). Conservation, management and legislation Paroedura androyensis is classified as a category III species under Madagascar Law 2006-400 on the classification of wildlife species. Category III includes game species for which hunting, and capture are only permitted with a hunting license and within the hunting season, from 1st February to 30th April. Madagascan law 2005-018 on the international trade of species of wild fauna and flora monitors and manages the country\u2019s wildlife trade with species listed Appendices I, II, and III which follow those of the Convention, and Appendix IV which includes non-CITES-listed species whose international trade is subject to national regulation and ensures Madagascar\u2019s compliance with CITES. The export of a species included in Appendices I, II, or III requires a formal export permit, whereas the export of a species in Appendix IV requires a less formal \u201cleaving authorisation\u201d. Reports suggest that no species-specific conservation measures were in place. Artificial Propagation/captive breeding There were reported to be international breeding stocks of Paroedura androyensis in captivity.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 Inclusion of Spiny-tailed Iguanas Ctenosaura spp. in Appendix II Proponents: El Salvador and Mexico Summary: The genus Ctenosaura, known as Spiny-tailed Iguanas, are medium-sized omnivorous lizards that occur in lowland dry forests of Mexico and Central America. There are currently 18 recognised species, of which 11 are endemic to Mexico. Four species (C. bakeri, C. melanosterna, C. oedirhina and C. palearis) have been included in Appendix II since 2010; one additional species (C. quinquecarinata) has been included in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2010. Of the 14 species not listed in the Appendices, one is assessed as Critically Endangered (C. oaxacana), two Endangered (C. flavidorsalis and C. quinquecarinata), three Vulnerable (C. clarki, C. defensor and C. nolascensis), one Near Threatened (C. alfredschmidti), one Least Concern (C. similis), one Data Deficient (C. praeocularis), and five have not been assessed (C. conspicuosa, C. macrolopha, C. hemilopha, C. pectinata and C. acanthura). Two species are island endemics with both islands being less than 40 km2 (C. conspicuosa and C. nolascensis), two have a range of less than 500 km2 (C. alfredschmidti and C. oaxacana), six have ranges less than 5,000 km2 (C. clarki, C. flavidorsalis, C. hemilopha, C. macrolopha, C. praeocularis and C. quinquecarinata), and four have ranges greater than 5,000 km2 (C. acanthura, C. defensor, C. pectinata and C. similis). Habitats are generally fragmented for all species and the actual area of occupancy is considerably smaller than the overall range. However, several species also occur in human-dominated landscapes, and C. similis and C. pectinata are recorded as invasive species in some areas where they have been introduced. There is very little population information for any of the proposed species, although IUCN Red List assessments for six species estimate populations to be likely less than 2,500 individuals (C. alfredschmidti, C. clarki, C. defensor, C. oaxacana, C. nolascensis and C. quinquecarinata). Ctenosaura species are in trade for the exotic pet market, with 15 species recorded in international trade. Information on the global trade for most species is limited to imports into the USA. The USA reported imports totalling 30,000 live individuals from 1999-2012, of which 95% comprised C. quinquecarinata (10,000) and C. similis (17,000) (see below).

Since 2007, the USA reported the import of ca. 700 wild-caught and ca. 7,000 captive-bred individuals. Almost all the captive-bred individuals were imported from Nicaragua and El Salvador (98%), while nearly all wild-sourced individuals were imported from Honduras and Guatemala (97%). A study in Japan found seven live individuals from four different species advertised online and 60 individuals from nine different species in a physical market survey. Ctenosaura quinquecarinata: Native to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and suggested to have an extent of occurrence of less than 5,000 km2 and an area of occupancy of less than 500 km2 when it was assessed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004. Its estimated population may be less than 2,500 individuals. In 2010, C. quinquecarinata were listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations to allow trade monitoring. According to the CITES Trade Database, 896 live C. quinquecarinata have been imported into the EU since 2010, with 592 exported from Nicaragua (of which 250 were captive-bred and the rest were from unspecified sources). USA import data shows imports into the USA between 1999\u20132012 totalling 10,000 live individuals. Of these, 7,000 were reported as captive-bred (all from Nicaragua) and just over 3,000 were reported as wild-caught (of which almost all were from Honduras, which is apparently not a range State). Ctenosaura similis: Native to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama, this species is the most widespread in the genus. No population estimates exist, but it is said to be common, and was assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (2015). Ctenosaura similis was the Ctenosaura species imported into the USA in the highest numbers between 1999-2009; it accounted for 74% of all wild-caught Ctenosaura imports (12,323), and 22% of captive-bred imports (3,270). However, there have been no recorded imports of C. similis into the USA since 2009. The species can also be found for sale in Europe and Japan. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 151 A number of other species were reportedly imported into the USA between 1999 and 2012 in smaller quantities, including Ctenosaura alfredschmidti (15), C. clarki (22), C. conspicuosa (50), C. defensor (49), C. flavidorsalis (6) and C. pectinata (205). In addition to collection for international trade, Ctenosaura species are impacted by habitat loss, predation by domestic cats and dogs, and local consumption by people. Ctenosaura are protected by national legislation to varying degrees in six of their range States (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico). Captive breeding is taking place in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua, including for conservation purposes. Differences between species in the genus were highlighted at CoP15 in relation to a proposal to list four Ctenosaura species, although more recent reports suggest that there are look-alike issues for all species in the genus, especially at the juvenile stage. High numbers have been exported as juveniles. An identification guide for the genus has been produced, but is intended to be a starting point rather than a conclusive document for identification. Analysis: There is very little information on the wild populations of almost all Ctenosaura species, but some have been estimated to have small populations and/or limited ranges. Based on this, some species may already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I (including but not limited to C. conspicuosa and C. nolascensis), although reported international trade in wild-caught animals of these species is very limited. The recorded international trade primarily comprises two species (C. quinquecarinata and C. similis) and trade in individuals reported as wild-caught appears to be decreasing.

Although the majority of trade in this species appears to be in captive-bred individuals, given the possible small size of the population even low levels of trade may be of concern. It is reportedly difficult for non-experts to distinguish between species of Ctenosaura and virtually impossible for juveniles, of which there are large numbers in trade. As some species in the genus are already included in the Appendices, the non-listed species therefore meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex 2b of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17).

Ctenosaura species have experienced rapid population declines in recent years and have disappeared in many areas where they were previously abundant. No population increases have been reported for any of the species within the Ctenosaura genus.

C. acanthura: Endemic to Mexico and widely distributed along the Eastern coast of Mexico (ITWG, 2016). There is no IUCN Red List assessment for this species, but a recent study suggested that populations are stable (Morales-Mavil et al., 2016). There is very limited evidence of C. acanthura in international trade. No evidence of trade was found in Japan and data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 153 shows that only one scientific specimen was imported from Mexico and less than 50 kg of meat were imported between 1999 and 2012. C. alfredschmidti: Endemic to Mexico and known only from the Yucatan Peninsula in the state of Campeche (ITWG, 2016). The IUCN Red List assessment estimated the population to be fewer than 2,500 individuals in an area of less than 100 km2 (K\u00f6hler, 2004a). Further studies have estimated the distribution of C. alfredschmidti to be 5.1 individuals/ha, but further examination suggested a density of 0.2 individuals/ha (Morales-Mavil et al., 2016). Extrapolating the data using an area of occupancy of 100 km2 gives a population estimate of 1,964 individuals, but the author states that the density estimate is assumed to be low due to the secretive nature of the species (Morales-Mavil et al., 2016). There is limited evidence of trade in this species. The US LEMIS database reports that from 1999-2012, 15 live C. alfredschmidti were imported to the USA with six of these having been collected from the wild. *C. bakeri: This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 2010. CITES trade data since the listing show that only four live C. bakeri have been exported for zoological purposes from Honduras (reported by the importer), three of which were born in captivity (source code F) and one of which was a pre-Convention live individual (source code O). Online survey data (from the SS) shows C. bakeri advertised for sale online in the USA on two websites (number of individuals not reported). Physical survey data from Japan showed two C. bakeri for sale at a reptile fair (unpublished data in Wakao et al., 2018). C. clarki: Endemic to Mexico, specifically the Balsas-Tepalcatepec basin in the states of Michoac\u00e1n and Guerrero (ITWG, 2016). The Red List assessment estimated a population of less than 2,500 individuals (but no population data appear to be available) with isolated subpopulations and an area of occupancy of less than 2,000 km2 (K\u00f6hler, 2004b). No further population data could be found. There is limited evidence of this species in trade. The US LEMIS database reports that between 1999-2012, 22 live C. clarki were imported into the USA, with 21 of these exported from Germany. Five individuals were observed on sale during a survey of reptile fairs in Japan in 2017 (unpublished data in Wakao et al., 2018) and the SS shows online advertisements in France and Germany (no quantities reported). C. conspicuosa: This species is a Mexican island endemic (range limited to San Esteban Island (40 km2) and has also been introduced to Cholludo Island) (ITWG, 2016). There is no Red List assessment for this species and no population data could be found in the literature. There is some evidence of C. conspicuosa in international trade. The US LEMIS database reports a total of 50 live imports of this species to the USA between 1999-2012, of which all were captive-bred from Nicaragua. In 2017, six C. conspicuosa were found to be available at reptile fairs in Japan (unpublished data in Wakao et al., 2018).

Very limited evidence of this species in trade was found. US LEMIS data shows that between 1999\u20132012, six live, captive-bred C. flavidorsalis were imported into the USA. There was no evidence of C. flavidorsalis in trade in either Europe or Japan. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 154 There is no current evidence of this species being significantly consumed in range States, but there is anecdotal evidence that in El Salvador the fat of C. flavidorsalis is used medicinally to treat sprains and cure young children of illness (Stephen et al., 2012). C. hemilopha: Endemic to Mexico and is found in the southern part of the Baja California peninsula and on Isla Cerralvo (Davy et al., 2011; ITWG, 2016). There is no IUCN Red List assessment, but a study in 1989 suggested a density of 2 individuals per hectare (Alvarez et al., 1989) and from the distribution presented by the Iguana Taxonomy Working Group (ITWG, 2016), C. hemilopha has a range much larger than 10,000 km2. There is almost no evidence of C. hemilopha in trade, with only one scientific specimen of C. hemilopha being imported to the USA from Mexico in 2010 (based on US LEMIS data). No evidence of trade in either Europe or Japan. C. hemilopha is consumed for its meat and is thought to have medicinal properties to cure whooping cough (Grismer, 2002). C. macrolopha: Was regarded as a subspecies of C. hemilopha until 1999, and is endemic to north-western Mexico (ITWG, 2016). There is no Red List assessment for this species and no population data could be found in the literature. There is limited evidence of C. macrolopha in trade; no live C. macrolopha were imported into the USA between 1999-2012 according to the US LEMIS database. Two live C. macrolopha were observed at a Japanese reptile fair in 2017 (unpublished data in Wakao et al., 2018). *C. melanosterna: This species was listed on CITES Appendix II in 2010. The only trade recorded in the CITES Trade Database was of 318 wild-caught C. melanosterna imported into the USA from Honduras for scientific purposes. C. nolascensis: This species is an island endemic with a range limited to San Pedro Nolasco Island (5 km2) (ITWG, 2016). C. nolascensis was considered as a subspecies of C. hemilopha until 1999 (Grismer, 1999). The IUCN Red List assessment states that the population is unknown but estimates it to be less than 2,500 individuals, and cites encounter rates of 80 individuals/km which suggests that C. nolascensis is found at high densities on the island (Reynoso & Pasachnik, 2012). No evidence could be found of C. nolascensis in international trade, but care guides with photo evidence of the species in captivity can be found (K\u00f6hler et al., 2004). The extent of the numbers being kept in captivity is unclear. C. oaxacana: Endemic to the state of Oaxaca in Mexico (K\u00f6hler, 2004e; Valenzuela-Ceballos et al., 2015). The species was separated from C. quinquecarinata in 2001 (Kohler & Hasbun, 2001 in Hasbun & Kohler, 2009). The IUCN Red List assessment states that the population is unknown but is perhaps less than 2,500 mature individuals with an area of occupancy of less than 100 km2 and is thought to occur in severely fragmented populations (K\u00f6hler, 2004e).

C. pectinata: Endemic to Mexico, with a distribution covering western Mexico (ITWG, 2016). There is no IUCN Red List assessment for C. pectinata, but it does not have a limited area of distribution and densities of up to 12.3 individuals/hectare have been recently recorded (G\u00f3mez-mora & Alvarado-d\u00edaz, 2012). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 155 A total of 205 live individuals were imported into the USA between 1999 and 2012 according to US LEMIS data. Of these imports 80 were wild-caught and 125 were captive bred (all from from Mexico). The USA also reported exports of live individuals totalling 529 individuals over the same time period with 98 of these reportedly wild- caught. Data from a market survey in Japan in 2017 observed one C. pectinata for sale online and 30 individuals for sale at reptile fairs (unpublished data from Wakao et al., 2018). The SS shows evidence of online adverts in Germany, France and the UK advertising C. pectinata for sale. C. praeocularis: Described in 2009 and has a range that is limited to south-eastern Honduras (Carlos. Roberto. Hasbun & Kohler, 2009; ITWG, 2016). Due to the recent description of the species, it is assessed on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient and has no population estimate but an estimated range of 1,200 km2 (C. R. Hasbun & Pasachnik, 2013). In 2012 it was reported that there were no research or in situ conservation programs aimed at C. praeocularis (Stephen et al., 2012). No evidence of trade in C. praeocularis could be found. C. quinquecarinata: Present in Nicaragua and Costa Rica and suggested to have an extent of occurrence of less than 5,000 km2, an area of occupancy of less than 500 km2 and fewer than 2,500 mature individuals remaining in severely fragmented populations (K\u00f6hler, 2004f). A study by Chamorro estimated a population density of 0.93 individuals/ha (Chamorro, 2010). In 2010, C. quinquecarinata were being imported in such numbers to the EU that they were added to Annex D to allow trade monitoring (European Commission, 2010). According to the CITES Trade Database, 896 live C. quinquecarinata have been imported into the EU since 2010, with 592 exported from Nicaragua (of which 250 were captive-bred and the rest were from unspecified sources). US LEMIS data shows imports into the USA between 1999 \u2013 2012 totalling 10,660 live individuals. Of the imports into the USA, 7,179 were reported as being from captive-bred sources (all from Nicaragua) and 3,431 were reported as wild-caught (of which 3,296 were from Honduras (not a range State)). The general trend in imports of this species into the USA has been a reduction in the number of wild-caught Ctenosaura and an increase in the number of captive-bred individuals. For example, from 2007-2012, 155 wild-caught C. quinquecarinata were imported, versus 6,783 captive-bred individuals over the same time period. In Japan, a survey in 2017 showed three individuals for sale online and one individual for sale at a reptile fair (unpublished data from Wakao et al., 2018). it has been reported that C. quinquecarinata are locally persecuted out of fear that they are poisonous (Stephen et al., 2012). Also, like all species within the genus, it is believed to be affected by habitat destruction/degradation (K\u00f6hler, 2004f; Stephen et al., 2012). C. similis: The most widespread of the Ctenosaura species with a range throughout Central America, and has also been introduced to the USA and the Bahamas (ITWG, 2016). Although no population estimate exists for this species, it was reported to be common throughout its range in the IUCN Red List assessment (Pasachnik, 2015). It was also reported in 2012 that although there was continuing international and domestic trade, this had not endangered populations (Stephen et al., 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e61867ea-4112-410d-a9ea-4bf363aec8a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e61867ea-4112-410d-a9ea-4bf363aec8a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78976f83d394223402c2db67e746151a1a64a0fbf43bcb28db742546d034cc7c"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6d9db55-027e-4e84-8559-4a343b6f650c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8fa1d0cb2f453c3b3d443073962752c00ec8ff0fa7e2ad42a41f7c2ec5f2a28"}}, "hash": "72dd08ebaac1ee7519f9d918cee82d20d2acde89184d88f66885e878f0ff9bca", "text": "C. similis was the Ctenosaura species imported into the USA in the highest numbers between 1999-2012 according to US LEMIS data; it accounted for 74% of all wild-caught Ctenosaura imports (12,323), but only 22% of captive-bred imports (3270).

National use The iguanas of the genus Ctenosaura are commonly hunted locally for the consumption of their meat and eggs. Gravid females are consumed more frequently. In some regions they are affected by collection for medicinal use; it is believed that they can cure colds and are used for the treatment of sprains or headaches. Some are sold as handicrafts and skins, such as C. pectinata. It has been reported that C. similis and C. quinquecarinata are used as feed for domestic animals. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 156 International trade International trade in Ctenosaura spp. has been documented. In addition to the species already listed in Appendix II, trade in C. quinquecarinata is also recorded in the CITES Trade Database (records are for imports into the EU as the species has been listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2010), and in the greatest numbers. Of these records, 5% were bred in captivity and the same percentage were wild-sourced (the source of the remaining were unspecified). According to the CITES Trade Database, 896 live individuals of C. quinquecarinata were imported into the EU since 2010, with 592 exported from Nicaragua (of which 250 were captive-bred, the remainder were from an unspecified source). There is also evidence of nine Mexican Ctenosaura spp. having been advertised as for sale within the EU (Auliya et al., 2016), but the specific species and numbers advertised were not reported. In 2018, Mexico carried out consultations with 23 countries regarding international trade in Ctenosaura spp. Responses were received from 11 countries/territories, of which five reported no known trade in Ctenosaura spp. (Canada, China, France, Hong Kong SAR and Malaysia) and six reported trade in one or more species (Austria, El Salvador, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and UK). Mexico also carried out a trade analysis on trade in Ctenosaura spp. using data from the US Fish & Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database (date range 1999-2018). Further information from these analyses can be found in the Supporting Statement. According to the US Fish & Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database, 95% of all Ctenosaura imports from 1999-2012 were of two species: C. similis and C. quinquecarinata. Over the period 1999-2013, Ctenosaura imports to the USA peaked in 2004 and subsequently declined considerably, although there was an overall increasing trend from 2008 to 2012; there was also a shift from wild-caught to captive-bred imports over this period (Figure 1). 98% of captive bred individuals were imported from Nicaragua and El Salvador, while 97% of wild-caught individuals were imported from Honduras and Guatemala. Figure 1: Imports to the USA of wild and captive Ctenosaura spp. according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS), 1999-2012. A 2018 web search found 30 sites with Ctenosaura advertised for sale (from websites in Europe and North America). Ten species were advertised: C. acanthura, C. bakeri, C. clarki, C. conspicuosa, C. defensor, C. melanosterna, C. oedirhina, C. pectinata, C. quinquecarinata and C. similis.

Nicaragua: In 2008, the Nicaraguan authorities confiscated a total of 707 illegal wild Ctenosaura and Iguana iguana, which made them the most confiscated taxa in that year. From 2005 to 2010, more than 1,561 Ctenosaura were seized in Nicaragua. El Salvador: Illegal shipments of Ctenosaura from Honduras and Guatemala have been recorded, which were confiscated by the authorities. From 2006 to 2008, 3,611 Ctenosaura spp. and Iguana iguana were seized according to official data. In 2009, 241 Ctenosaura were seized in El Salvador, exported from Nicaragua, and in 2010, 45 black iguanas (C. similis) were reported as being seized by the National Police. The CITES Authorities of El Salvador stated that there have been six seizures of C. similis in the last 10 years, totalling 226 individuals. Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I There is similarity between species of the genus, and it is difficult to differentiate species even by expert biologists. It is common for confiscated specimens to have been assigned the wrong species name, generally of more common species. The offspring of large species of the genus Ctenosaura may become confused with those of Iguana iguana (which is currently listed in Appendix II along with other species of the genus Iguana). High numbers have been exported as juveniles (Stephen et al., 2012). Although the Supporting Statements for C. bakeri, C. melanosterna, C. oedirhina and C. palearis at CoP15 (CoP15 Props 11 and 12), highlighted the differences between these species and other species in the genus, recent reports suggest that there are look-alike issues for all members of the Ctenosaura genus with species being difficult to tell apart, especially at the juvenile stage (Stephen et al., 2012). An identification guide has been produced, but it has been designed to be a starting point for authorities rather than a conclusive document for identification (in Stephen et al., 2012). Additional Information Threats Habitat in the original range of all Ctenosaura species has been modified by degradation, fragmentation and destruction, with the exception of C. conspicuosa and C. nolascensis, which are occur on islands that do not authorize human settlements or changes in land use. Species that inhabit very remote places (e.g. C. hemilopha, C. macrolopha, C. melanosterna) suffer the effects of habitat destruction less than species such as C. acanthura, C. pectinata and C. similis that are highly affected by agriculture and livestock. Some species like C. bakeri and C. oedirhina are being seriously affected by tourism development. Despite the change in land use, many species can coexist with humans (but are affected by hunting). Species such as C. defensor and C. alfredschmidti are the exception, since they need pristine habitat for their survival. The main threats to the genus are habitat destruction, hunting for meat and skin, the illegal national and international pet trade, hybridisation with similar species, elimination by invasive species (e.g. cats), and hunting due to being thought to be a poisonous species. The dry forests where smaller species live consistently suffer changes in land use due to introduction of livestock; this is important for C. alfredschmidti, C. defensor, C. clarki, C. flavidorsalis, C. quinquecarinata and C. defensor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb11bbbc-7a29-4521-8e90-9512d7c036e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb11bbbc-7a29-4521-8e90-9512d7c036e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf3704695be146c2d109132f0d2f5e8d1c25dba598f608aac25853b51aded3ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d9f8cc1-46b9-4abd-891b-878303871c96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e987eaa0ed6fad4a6deeeaf2a1040a62f0727aadbb363b62f39d7d1a12e932d1"}}, "hash": "56f5e0c7eee03b7326bc0a113e2086b18e219b4202e392142a3f69b1b2b2a30b", "text": "The illegal sale and consumption of Ctenosaura iguanas in Mexico and Central America is common, mainly for food consumption, including traditional consumption (e.g. C. pectinata during Easter and during the Guelaguetza, in Oaxaca, Mexico), and to a lesser extent for the pet trade.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 31 158 Costa Rica: The Wildlife Conservation Law prohibits the hunting and extraction of threatened wildlife species except those from registered sustainable captive breeding facilities. All imports and exports of wild fauna are forbidden. Guatemala: The Law on Protected Areas prohibits the collection, hunting trade and export of endangered fauna. Guatemala has an official list of endangered species that has three categories: C. palearis is included in Category 2 that only allows its use for scientific purposes and for reproduction with conservation purposes; C. similis is in Category 3 that restricts use including trade. Honduras: The General Law on the Environment regulates the use and conservation of wildlife. Exports of C. melanosterna, C. bakeri and C. oedirhina have been restricted, and captive breeding facilities for C. melanosterna and C. bakeri have been created for conservation projects and reintroduction. Nicaragua: This is the only country with a law that focuses on iguanas (Decree 547), which prohibits the capture or trade and prohibits the export of C. similis and its products such as eggs. The conservation and trade of other species of iguanas such as C. quinquecarinata is regulated by the Mandatory Nicaraguan Technical Standard for Domestic Wildlife Trade (NTON 05011-01), Law 217, General Law of the Environment and Natural Resources, which allows for the allocation of hunting closures. Nicaragua only allows the export of C. quinquecarinata from two captive breeding facilities. El Salvador: The Wildlife Conservation Law regulates the hunting, collection and marketing of wild species. Artificial propagation/captive breeding There are few captive breeding facilities for Ctenosaura spp. in the Central American region because these species are reportedly very aggressive and difficult to maintain, and also because there is a much greater demand for Green Iguanas Iguana iguana. Mexico: Eight captive breeding facilities have been created for C. pectinata and one for C. defensor since 2000. In the period 2000-2015 there were 6,016 individuals of C. pectinata and seven C. defensor produced. Honduras: There is a captive breeding facility for C. bakeri used to increase wild populations and a further captive breeding facility has been proposed for C. melanosterna for reintroduction purposes. Nicaragua: There are two captive breeding facilities for C. quinquecarinata, one of which claims to produce more than 6,000 individuals per year. A captive breeding facility for C. similis is used exclusively for the purposes of research. Guatemala: Has a program of reproduction in semi-captivity of C. palearis for conservation in a private reserve. Further captive breeding facilities to supply the pet trade have been reported in El Salvador and Costa Rica (Stephen et al., 2012). References Alvarez, S., Galina, P., & Ortega-Rubio, A. (1989).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 32 Inclusion of Spider-tailed Horned Viper Pseudocerastes urarachnoides in Appendix II Proponent: Islamic Republic of Iran Summary: The Spider-tailed Horned Viper Pseudocerastes urarachnoides is a recently described (2006) viper species, known only from a few locations in the Zagros Mountains of western Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran). The species may also be present in suitable habitat in adjacent areas of Iraq. Its unique tail resembles a spider and is used to lure insectivorous birds. Little information is available on its biology, but it is mainly found in hilly areas and is associated with deep cracks in limestone sediments. There are no population size estimates and population trends are lacking, although it is considered to be rare based on field observations. In Iran the hunting, killing or catching of all wild animals (including reptiles) is prohibited. Any export of live wild animals without a licence or approval from the Department of Environment is also prohibited. Despite this there is some evidence of international trade in Pseudocerastes urarachnoides, although it is limited to photographic evidence of the species in captivity on social media, a survey of German pet keepers for the German Government in 2018, and a single conversation on social media in 2017. Only described in 2006, the uniqueness of the species may create increasing demand in the future in the pet trade. Similar species do not appear to be traded in large volumes. The species is said to be impacted by illegal collection for the pet trade, habitat destruction and future climate change. It is reported that the species is sometimes killed when encountered by local communities. Analysis: Pseudocerastes urarachnoides has a small reported range in western Iran, based on observations of a few specimens. There are no population estimates and population trends are not available, although it is considered to be rare.

All current trade from Iran is illegal. Given limited evidence of trade, it seems unlikely that the species meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Iran could consider an Appendix III listing. Other Considerations: If the proposal is accepted (or Iran lists the species in Appendix III), as it is nationally protected and therefore trade is illegal, Iran may wish to reflect this by putting in place a voluntary zero export quota that would be listed on the CITES website and empower re-exporting and importing countries to assist law enforcement. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Taxonomy Pseudocerastes urarachnoides is one of three species in the genus Pseudocerastes (Pseudocerastes urarachnoides, Pseudocerastes persicus and Pseudocerastes fieldi). Range Islamic Republic of Iran. IUCN Global Category Data Deficient (2008) ver 3.1. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 32 161 Biological and trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix II (Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences Pseudocerastes urarachnoides is known only from a few localities in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Based on the extent of potentially suitable habitat, the species is presumably more widely distributed within the Zagros Mountains and is likely to be present in adjacent areas of Iraq (Fathinia et al., 2009). It is mainly found in hilly areas and is associated with deep cracks in limestone sediments. The political instability in Iraq and its border with Iran, together with low detection of these vipers hampers the precise knowledge on the distribution of this species (del Marmol et al., 2016). Biology Described in 2006, there is little information on the biology of the snake. It is an oviparous, primarily diurnal species with sexual activities occurring nocturnally. It emerges from hibernation in early April and enters hibernaculum in late November. It has a bimodal activity pattern with peaks in spring and late summer/early autumn. Adult specimens have a total length of 55\u201386 cm and a short tail (TL/T=9.65), few pairs of subcaudals (15 in the known specimens), the distal pair forming an oval knob-like structure; lateral dorsal caudal scales projected to form elongate \u201cappendages\u201d along the sides of the terminal knob. The scales are more prominently rugose than in any other snake found in Iran. The tail of Pseudocerastes urarachnoides resembles a spider to attract small birds. Population size and trend There is no estimate available for population size of this species from recorded sites. Evidence based on field observations indicates that the species is rare, and the lack of reliable data prevents estimation of the total population and population trends (Anderson & Papenfuss, 2009). A complete decline of a 10 individual population was observed after exposure to people (B. Fathinia, in litt., 2019). Trade The SS reports that the principal and immediate threat to the species is the illegal collection to meet the demand for national and international trade. There is no use of the species for traditional medicines or other purposes in Iran and there have been no legal captures and exports of this species for commercial purposes. No permits have been issued in this regard. There is a rumoured use of this species in the pet trade\u2014detailed records for the volume of illegal trade are lacking, the SS suggests there are strong indications that this species is illegally collected and smuggled out of the country. The SS provides photos from Germany of Pseudocerastes urarachnoides on community networks (possibly six individuals seen in the photo).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ef83d33-d745-4caf-8906-fc91131270ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ef83d33-d745-4caf-8906-fc91131270ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df7d566e03f4543f6612f53a4f8488d0456efd91f2366b0c52866fe2f9ae4394"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ee09ac9-c32e-447d-9c7a-68517eb66f75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcaa9ba3759cf7c80ab30827bf7ff671f3fb84662bbba31c4e8201c9c7fac445"}}, "hash": "b59dcf95c711b0247c846950baa5ddba3860f7eebec1007ec2309b6e7c34047b", "text": "It is reported that the species is kept in European terrariums (this is based on a personal communication).

The SS states that the collection for the pet trade has already resulted in the local extinction of some populations of the other two species of the Pseudocerastes genus, Pseudocerastes persicus and Pseudocerastes fieldi. These are based on IUCN Red List assessments. For Pseudocerastes persicus the IUCN Red List assessment states \u201cover-collection is a serious threat and is causing significant declines in local populations. Continued over- exploitation could cause this species to be threatened, hence ongoing monitoring of its status is required\u201d (Ananjeva et al., 2010). For Pseudocerastes fieldi the IUCN Red List assessment mentions that over-collection for the pet trade in Egypt is a threat (Amr et al., 2012). Between 1999 and 2014, 58 live specimens of Pseudocerastes persicus were imported into the USA from Egypt according to USA import data, while 14 live specimens of Pseudocerastes species reported as False Horned Vipers were also imported (US Fish & Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) data). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 32 162 Additional Information Threats The principal and immediate threat to the species is believed to be illegal collection to meet demand for national and international trade, while habitat destruction and global warming effects such as drought may affect survival of the species. It is presumed that animals are also killed when encountered by villagers because of fear and superstitions. Fathinia (in litt., 2019) reports that when talking to local communities, they report the killing of this viper. The IUCN Red List assessment states that threats to the species are not known, although because it is an unusual snake a threat may be over-collection for the international pet trade in the future (Anderson & Papenfuss, 2009). Conservation, management and legislation In accordance with the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (1974) and the Executive By-Law on the Game and Fish Law (1967) any hunting, killing or catching of all wild animals, birds and reptiles as well as fishing, killing or catching aquatic animals is prohibited. Any export of live wild animals without a licence or approval from the Department of Environment (DoE) is also prohibited. The DoE has recently listed Pseudocerastes urarachnoides in the \u201cnationally endangered species\u201d category. Any illegal and not permitted collecting of this snake is subjected to a fine of IRR 50 million (more than USD 500). The species lacks a formal \u201cconservation action plan\u201d (CAP) from the DoE in Iran. Some projects on basic information collection have been started and the DoE plans to prepare a CAP as soon as possible. Implementation challenges (including similar species) Pseudocerastes urarachnoides closely resembles Pseudocerastes persicus in the dorsal scale characters, which distinguish that species from Pseudocerastes fieldi, apart from the greatly shortened tail and the elaborate caudal appendage, which set it apart from both.

Cuora bourreti has historically been consumed for food, however in the last decade large-scale consumption has largely ceased with most animals collected now sold into the pet trade or for traditional medicine. Based on observations in captivity, the species matures at 10\u201315 years and lays a single clutch of one to three eggs annually. Cuora bourreti has been listed in CITES Appendix II since 2000 under a genus-level listing. Cuora bourreti was previously considered a subspecies of C. galbinifrons, however it was recognised as a species in the standard nomenclature reference adopted at CoP17 in 2016. Before this split was recognised under CITES, C. galbinifrons was included in the Periodic Review after CoP16 and the Animals Committee recommended the transfer of C. galbinifrons (at", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22d4de75-cb67-408b-a373-45506062d699": {"__data__": {"id_": "22d4de75-cb67-408b-a373-45506062d699", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93f7f8fd90d47362624076f18676cd1b98e19b99d29d1bec2611bddc676eb7b7"}, "3": {"node_id": "94f04781-3d6a-41ba-874c-2183ee574421", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fe3481f9a22f95e4dcb5213c91f1bbbe4ceb3fd615a2dd40aee2af7a842b23f"}}, "hash": "207c72b82496640d4b81d1570c933268a31da243f59b882b13663de376362ecb", "text": "that time including C. bourreti and C. picturata) to Appendix I. Cuora bourreti is known from central Viet Nam and the adjoining province of Savannakhet in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), although confusion with C. galbinifrons means its range could be smaller than currently believed. It inhabits upland, moist, closed-canopy evergreen forest, and habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but predominantly localised threat to the species. Unsustainable collection is considered to be the main threat given that C. bourreti is a long- lived, late-maturing species with limited annual reproductive output and high juvenile mortality. The species was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2015 on the basis that documented market volumes in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) indicated a collapse of populations of over 90% over the past 60 years (three generations) and decline was predicted to continue for the next 20 years. This was inferred from market observations reported as predominantly C. galbinifrons, which at the time was also considered to include what are now accepted as C. bourreti and C. picturata. The population of C. bourreti is estimated to be between 10,000\u201320,000 individuals in the wild and the species is considered rare. In 2013 a zero export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes was adopted for the listing of C. galbinifrons (including C. bourreti) and there has been no legal trade in C. bourreti reported in the CITES Trade Database since then. Live specimens are observed for sale online, often stating that they are from captive-bred populations. However, it continues to be regarded as a difficult, sensitive species to breed successfully in captivity, reproducing slowly with small clutch sizes. Low numbers have been observed in farms in China, and juvenile animals are said to be raised in villages in range States for sale into trade, although they suffer high mortality rates. The species is legally protected from exploitation in both range States. Illegal trade is considered to continue to the main destination markets of China and Hong Kong SAR. A small number of captive- bred specimens were observed in Hong Kong SAR markets between 2014 and 2018. Analysis: No legal trade in Cuora bourreti has been reported since a zero export quota was put in place in 2013. Illegal trade is thought to occur, but it is not clear on what scale. The population size was estimated to be between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals, which could be considered small for a low productivity species such as this. It does not appear to have a restricted range, although issues with misidentification with C. galbinifrons could mean that the distribution is smaller than previously thought. The species was categorised as Critically Endangered in 2015 based on a decline of 90% in the past three generations. It would therefore appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: At CoP16 a zero export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes was adopted with the listing for Cuora galbinifrons and therefore all trade in wild specimens of C. bourreti is already illegal. Benefits of an Appendix I listing are not likely to be realised unless enforcement efforts are increased.

Cuora bourreti inhabits upland, moist, closed-canopy evergreen forest. The species is predominately terrestrial and is not specifically associated with forest streams. In general, forest cover in Viet Nam declined between 1943 (43% land area) and 1973 (29% land area). Reforestation attempts have been made but efforts have been focussed of monocultures of fast-growing exotic species (McNamara, et al., 2006) which cannot be considered suitable habitat for this species (R. Struijk, in litt., 2019). In Viet Nam the species\u2019 range is from Ha Tinh Province southward to Kon Tum Province, however details of its distribution are not certain due to misidentifications with Cuora galbinifrons (Stuart et al., 2011). Stuart et al., (2011) consider that the extended range of C. bourreti northward to Nghe An Province is likely an error as the authors listed this discovery in the same distribution of C. galbinifrons and field-collected specimens from this area are C. galbinifrons. Therefore, the distribution of this species may be smaller than previously reported. In 2009, Stuart et al., (2011) documented C. bourreti in Lao PDR for the first time. During their survey the authors made two observations of C. bourreti, one was in the possession of a turtle hunter who was camping at Laving- Laveun within the Laving-Laveun Provincial Protected Area in Savannakhet Province and the second was observed by a village resident in the Vilabouli District, Savannakhet Province. C) Decline in number of wild individuals Cuora bourreti has been subject to intensive exploitation since the 1990s across its range, primarily for consumption and secondarily for the pet and farming/aquaculture trades. Trade volumes have collapsed in recent years and field surveys indicate the species to be rare, with an estimated population collapse of over 90% over the past 60 years (three generations, at 20 years per generation time), and predicted to continue for the next 20 years, is likely an underestimate (McCormack & Stuart, 2016). Extensive survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009\u20132012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for taxa of the Cuora galbinifrons group, with a focus on C. bourreti and C. picturata. Anecdotal information from interviews throughout the range has found that historic quantities of C. bourreti available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while the species was common 7\u201315 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. During surveys in 2006 in and around Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam Province, local hunters claimed that numbers of C. bourreti had already been seriously depleted; from being able to catch 20 animals a day in the mid-1990s they were able to obtain only a few animals in a week. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 33 165 Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Cuora bourreti has historically been consumed locally for food as part of a subsistence diet, however, in the last decade consumption has largely ceased, with most animals now sold into the pet trade (McCormack & Stuart, 2016). Collection efforts include both targeted searches for turtles involving trained dogs, or occasionally pitfall traps, as well as capitalising on casual turtle encounters when collecting other forest products. Turtles, of any species, are collected whenever or wherever they are encountered in the region, regardless of legal protection status or location inside protected areas. Collected turtles are traded, mostly illegally, through a network of middlemen before being exported or consumed locally. Increasing economic value has ensured that hunting pressure is sustained despite the increasing rarity of the species (local prices have increased from an estimated USD 9 in 2006 to USD 15 more recently and in the Chinese markets from USD 20 in 2005 to USD 150). Available information indicates that most Cuora traded in Viet Nam were exported to East Asian markets, mainly in Hong Kong SAR and southern mainland China.

Commercial turtle farms in China are not interested in breeding Cuora bourreti in captivity due to high mortality rates, low egg rate production, difficult maintenance and lower value compared to other turtle species in the pet trade (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019), therefore the provenance of \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d specimens available in trade could be considered questionable. In more recent years, Viet Nam and China have made increasing efforts to produce specimens with eggs taken from wild-collected females (presumably this meant the female was killed) that are hatched in captivity. These captive-born stocks are considered hardier and yield more money in Viet Nam and China (R. Struijk, in litt., 2019). Cuora galbinifrons (and likely C. bourreti) were present in nearly every reported market survey of turtle trade in China and Hong Kong SAR since recording began in 1993, with C. bourreti usually recorded if precise taxonomy was known. All these animals appeared wild-caught and most were offered in food markets. Cuora bourreti was not evident in visible retail trade in China or Hong Kong SAR in the early 2010s. It is occasionally offered for sale on internet fora and bulletin boards often claimed to be from captivity: the veracity of such claims is often difficult to confirm. Searches for C. bourreti online found advertisements for both captive-bred and wild-sourced animals although they were sometimes described and traded as Cuora spp., (Y. Wang, in litt., 2019), making it difficult to determine the level of trade. Reported seizures of Cuora bourreti appear to be relatively limited: in 2018, 18 individuals were seized in Kon Tum and Quang Nam provinces in Viet Nam. It appears that most of the trade is illegal and there are limited seizures that report this species, which could be a result of weak enforcement in this region and which is unable to regulate trade in this species (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). Additional Information Threats Long-lived late-maturing species with limited annual reproductive output and high juvenile mortality, as exemplified by Cuora bourreti, have proven to be highly susceptible to over-exploitation, particularly of adult animals. The primary threat to C. bourreti is collection for trade. Habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but more localised threat to the species. Conservation, management and legislation Cuora bourreti was included as a subspecies of C. galbinifrons, in CITES Appendix II at CoP11 (2000) as part of the genus level listing. Cuora galbinifrons was proposed for inclusion in Appendix I at CoP16 (2013) but due to another proposal proposing C. galbinifrons and a number of other species already included in Appendix II for a zero-export quota for wild specimens (CoP16 Prop. 32), Viet Nam withdrew their proposal. A zero-export quota for wild specimens traded for commercial purposes was adopted for C. galbinifrons (including bourreti and picturata as subspecies) at CoP16 (2013). The CITES Standard nomenclature adopted at CoP17 in 2016 recognises C. bourreti and C. picturata as full separate species. Cuora bourreti is legally protected from exploitation in both range States, but enforcement may be insufficient. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 33 166 The genus Cuora, including C. bourreti is included in Annex B of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations. Populations of Cuora bourreti are not known to be managed in any part of its range, although a conservation initiative to focus on C. bourreti through improved protected area management, community engagement and enforcement capacity building has been initiated at Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam Province in central Viet Nam.

Blanck, in litt., 2019). The same expert also believed that captive-bred individuals were destined for the pet trade as they were hardier, and wild-caught individuals were consumed as food or for Traditional Asian Medicine. Juvenile animals are often kept at the village level in attempts to raise them to sell on into the trade (often unsuccessful, with animals dying) (McCormack & Stuart, 2016). Extremely little is known of the biology of C. bourreti in the wild; most observations on diet, growth, and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity. Slow growth to maturity (10\u201315 years) is combined with low fecundity (in captivity a single clutch of 1\u20133 large eggs) (McCormack & Stuart, 2016). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Cuora can be separated from all other turtles by the combination of possessing a single hinge on the plastron allowing them to close their shell effectively, their distinctly domed shell, and generally bright facial coloration. The species C. bourreti can most easily be separated from C. galbinifrons by its plastron colouration, which is solid black in galbinifrons and bony yellow with a large black blotch on each scute in bourreti and picturata. This group of species is easy to identify from the plastral pattern, and easy for specialists to identify from the carapace side (R. Struijk, in litt., 2019). Potential risk(s) of a transfer from Appendix II to I Information from hobbyists in China indicates that the inclusion of Cuora picturata in Appendix I would have little impact on trade and animals would continue to be wild-sourced and the value may go up as a result of increased demand (D. Gaillard, in litt., 2019). Although the current CITES Appendix II listing with a zero-export quota has meant no legal exports have occurred from Viet Nam, enforcement is weak with illegal trade between Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China occurring. If current enforcement efforts are not sufficient, inclusion of this species in Appendix I may not have any significant effect on regulating this trade (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). One expert considered that ex-situ captive populations of this species were crucial for its long-term survival, and this requires international exchange to maintain genetic diversity of captive populations so they are viable for reintroduction; inclusion of the species in Appendix I, may hinder these efforts (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). References Blanck, T. (2019). In litt. to the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses Team. Cambridge, UK. Gaillard, D. (2019). In litt. to the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses Team. Cambridge, UK.

Cuora picturata has historically been consumed for food, however in the last decade large-scale consumption has largely ceased with most collected animals now sold into the pet trade or for traditional medicine. Based on observations in captivity, the species lays a single clutch of one to three eggs annually. Cuora picturata has been listed in CITES Appendix II since 2000 under a genus level listing. Cuora picturata was previously considered a subspecies of C. galbinifrons, however C. picturata was recognised as a species in the standard nomenclature reference adopted at CoP17. Before this split was recognised under CITES, C. galbinifrons was included in the Periodic Review after CoP16 and the Animals Committee recommended the transfer of C. galbinifrons (at that time including C. picturata and C. bourreti) to Appendix I.

Unsustainable collection is considered to be the main threat given that Cuora picturata is a long- lived, late maturing species with limited annual reproductive output and high juvenile mortality. The species was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2015 on the basis that documented market volumes in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) indicated a collapse of populations of over 90% in the past 60 years (three generations), and that collection pressure for the last remaining individuals was likely to continue if not increase in the next 20 years. This was inferred from market observations reported as predominantly C. galbinifrons, which at the time was also considered to include what are now accepted as C. picturata and C. bourreti. The global wild population of C. picturata is estimated at below 25,000 individuals, and likely no more than 3,000\u2013 10,000. Many hunters state that while C. picturata was common 7\u201315 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. In 2013 a zero export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes was adopted for the listing of C. galbinifrons (including C. picturata) and there has been no legal trade in C. picturata reported in the CITES Trade Database since then. Live specimens are observed for sale online, often stating that they are from captive-bred populations. However, C. picturata continues to be regarded as a difficult, sensitive species to breed successfully in captivity, reproducing slowly with small clutch sizes. Low numbers have been observed in farms in China, and juvenile animals are said to be raised in villages in Viet Nam for sale into trade, although suffer high mortality rates. Cuora picturata is protected from commercial exploitation in Viet Nam. Illegal trade is considered to continue to the main destination markets in China and Hong Kong SAR. However, no observations of the species were reported in Hong Kong SAR markets between 2014 and 2018. Analysis: No legal trade has been reported since a zero export quota was put in place in 2013. Illegal international trade is thought to occur, but it is not clear on what scale. The population size is estimated at fewer than 25,000 (more likely between 3,000 and 10,000) which could be considered small for a low productivity species such as this. Due to habitat loss only a small part of its range is now believed to be suitable (3,000 km2). The species was categorised as Critically Endangered in 2015 based on a decline of 90% in the past three generations, and this decline was predicted to continue. It would therefore appear to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: At CoP16 a zero export quota in wild specimens for commercial purposes was adopted with the listing for Cuora galbinifrons and therefore all trade in wild specimens of IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 34 168 C. picturata is already illegal.

B) Restricted area of distribution The estimated area of occurrence is 25,000 km2 and the estimated area of occupancy is 3,000 km2 (McCormack et al., 2016). Large areas of suitable habitat at suitable elevation have been converted for agricultural purposes. Cuora picturata is apparently limited to the eastern slopes of the Langbian Plateau, being known only from Khanh Hoa and Phu Yen provinces of southern Viet Nam. A survey found one male specimen of this species in Binh Dinh Province in 2013 but as this specimen was observed in the house of a trader it is still unverified if this species naturally occurs in this area (Duong et al., 2014). Cuora picturata was originally (at the time of its description, late 1990s) speculated possibly to occur in eastern Cambodia. However, surveys in Cambodia have failed to find any indication of the species there. C) Decline in number of wild individuals Documented trade volumes indicate a collapse of populations over the past three decades of over 90% which is extrapolated back to cover the past 60 years (three generations), and collection pressure for the last remaining individuals is likely to continue if not increase in the next 20 years (McCormack et al., 2016). Available interview and trade observation data strongly suggest that populations have been severely depleted in recent decades. Sustained survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009\u20132012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for the Cuora galbinifrons group, focusing on C. picturata and C. bourreti. Anecdotal information from interviews concluded that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while these box turtles were common 7\u201315 years ago, they are now increasingly difficult to find. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 34 169 There have been recent reports of a new hybrid species described as Cuora serrata which was believed to be a hybrid of C. picturata and C. mouhotii obsti, found in the possession of a local trader in Phu Yen Province who sourced the specimen from a locality within C. picturata range (Struijk & Blanck, 2016). One possible outcome for natural hybrids of these species is that population densities for both parental species has become so low that is has reduced the availability of compatible mates (Struijk & Blanck, 2016). Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Cuora picturata has historically been consumed locally for food as part of a subsistence diet. However, in the last decade consumption for food has largely ceased, with most animals now sold into the pet trade (McCormack et al., 2016). Collection efforts are targeted and occur mainly as searches for turtles involving trained dogs. Turtles, of any species are collected whenever and wherever encountered in the region, regardless of legal protection status or location inside protected areas. Collected turtles are traded, mostly illegally, through a network of local middlemen before being exported or consumed locally. In May 2012, local hunters claimed they still caught 50 individuals of the species annually (during a six-month hunting season). There are no records of Cuora picturata in the CITES Trade Database. Previous records would have been recorded as part of the trade in C. galbinifrons, for which records of legal trade of 3,372 live specimens and 35 specimens are recorded during 1999\u20132013; only a small minority of these specimens were likely to have been C. picturata, making it difficult to determine the level of trade. The population trend data strongly suggests that Cuora picturata has been subject to unsustainable collection for the past 15\u201320 years with over 15,000 specimens of C. galbinifrons (including C. picturata) recorded in Hong Kong SAR markets alone during the period 2000\u20132003 and this has resulted in depletion if not collapse of each population that has been surveyed (McCormack et al., 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bdab06b-3828-4adc-9a81-7b4c143a0909": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bdab06b-3828-4adc-9a81-7b4c143a0909", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b69d6faeaf306fb04974818681e690b1a21f89d8847a2a19dd349090ce089b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "06f187c0-96ce-4261-a714-0bc3ad694b68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bacfaed5439b4254366160d83b99d2570a956a9707555d34278d81f158850120"}}, "hash": "4d45389a574963159a0ad39a766494153f70bb3ddedd046c61ba0ade730f5a57", "text": "Turtle farms are considered to be the primary purchasers of wild collected turtles and are driving the collection of the last remaining wild animals through increased trade prices.

Blanck, in litt., 2019) therefore, the provenance of \u201ccaptive-bred\u201d specimens available in trade could be considered questionable. However, it was noted by a different expert that in more recent years, Viet Nam and China have made increasing efforts to produce captive- born species with eggs taken from wild-collected females (which are presumably killed) that hatch in captivity, these captive-born stocks are hardier and yield more money in Viet Nam and China (R. Struijk, in litt., 2019). Cuora picturata was not evident in visible retail trade in China or Hong Kong SAR in the early 2010s. It is occasionally offered for sale on internet fora and bulletin boards, often claimed to be from captivity: the veracity of such claims is difficult to confirm. Searches for C. picturata online found advertisements for both captive-bred and wild-sourced animals. However, they were sometimes described and traded as Cuora spp., (Y. Wang, in litt., 2019), making it difficult to determine the level of trade. Surveys conducted of markets in Hong Kong SAR between 2014\u20132018 found no C. picturata (T. Blanck., in litt., 2019). An evaluation of reported seizures of tortoises and freshwater turtles between 2000\u20132015 did not record any Cuora picturata. Illegal trade in C. picturata may have been recorded as part of C. galbinifrons, which was reported in nearly every market survey that looked at turtle trade in China and Hong Kong SAR since recording began in 1993. All these animals appeared wild caught and most were offered in food markets. It appears that most of the trade is illegal and there are limited seizures that report this species, which could be a result of weak enforcement in this region and which is unable to regulate trade in this species (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). Additional Information Threats The primary threat to Cuora picturata is collection for trade. Long-lived, late maturing species with limited annual reproductive output and high juvenile mortality, such as exemplified by C. picturata, have proven to be highly susceptible to over-exploitation, particularly of adults. Extremely little is known of the biology of C. picturata in the wild; most observations on diet, growth, and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity\u2014the species has low fecundity (in captivity a single clutch of 1\u20133 large eggs) (McCormack et al., 2016). Habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but more localised threat to the species, large areas of forest on the Langbian Plateau are being rapidly converted to coffee plantations and other agricultural lands and only one of the three localities where Cuora picturata was found (Deo Ca Protected Forest) was protected at the time (McCormack et al., 2016). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 34 170 Conservation, management and legislation Cuora picturata was included as a subspecies of C. galbinifrons, in CITES Appendix II at CoP11 (2000) under a genus level listing. Cuora galbinifrons was proposed for inclusion in Appendix I at CoP16 (2013) but due to another proposal proposing C. galbinifrons and a number of other species already included in Appendix II for a zero quota for wild specimens (CoP16 Prop. 32), Viet Nam withdrew their proposal. A zero-export quota for wild specimens traded for commercial purposes was therefore adopted for Cuora galbinifrons (including bourreti and picturata as subspecies) at CoP16. The CITES standard nomenclature adopted at CoP17 in 2016 recognises C. bourreti and C. picturata as full separate species. Cuora picturata is protected from commercial exploitation in Viet Nam as a Priority Protected Rare, Precious and Endangered Species under the revised Decree 160/2013/ND-CP of the Government.

Cuora galbinifrons was recorded among the stock kept at commercial turtle farms in China in the early 2000s, and likely included some specimens of picturata. The galbinifrons group is understood not to breed successfully in commercial captive conditions and is no longer included in inventories of turtle farms in recent years. This species is hard to keep and breed in captivity, producing small clutches, which makes them unattractive to commercial Chinese turtle farms (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). The climate in southern China is not warm enough so they do not do well in farms\u2014during farm surveys there only a handful of C. picturata (and C. bourreti) were observed compared to a few dozen C. galbinifrons, tens of thousands of C. flavomarginata and thousands of C. amboinensis, C. trifasciata etc. (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). The same expert also believed that captive-bred individuals were destined for the pet trade as they were hardier, and wild-caught individuals were consumed as food or for Traditional Asian Medicine. Juvenile animals are often kept at the village level in attempts to raise them to sell on into the trade (often unsuccessful, with animals dying) (McCormack et al., 2016). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Cuora can be separated from all other turtles by the combination of possessing a single hinge on the plastron allowing them to close their shell effectively, their distinctly domed shell, and generally bright facial coloration. The species picturata can most easily be separated from galbinifrons by its plastron coloration, which is solid black in galbinifrons and bony yellow with a large black blotch on each scute in bourreti and picturata. This group of species is easy to identify from the plastral pattern, and easy for specialists to identify from the carapace side (R. Struijk, in litt., 2019). Potential risk(s) of a transfer from Appendix II to I Enforcement is weak with illegal trade between Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Viet Nam and China and if current enforcement efforts are not sufficient, inclusion of this species in Appendix I may not have any significant effect on regulating this trade (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). One expert considered that ex situ captive populations of this species were crucial for its long-term survival, and this requires international exchange to maintain genetic diversity of captive populations so they are viable for reintroduction, inclusion of the species in Appendix I, may hinder these efforts (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). References Blanck, T. (2019). In litt. to the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses Team. Cambridge, UK. Duong, L.D., Ngo, C.D. & Nguyen, T.Q. (2014).

Historically Mauremys annamensis was consumed as food as part of a subsistence diet, however in the last decade most animals were sold into the higher value international pet and traditional medicine trade. Mauremys annamensis occurs in central Viet Nam in five provinces (possibly seven) where it is found in the marshes and slow-flowing streams of the lowlands. Within this area, the species is now limited to scattered occurrence within isolated wetlands. Conversion of wetlands to agriculture, such as rice paddies and irrigation canals has led to extensive collection of M. annamensis through incidental encounters. The current or historic population size of M. annamensis is unknown. In the late 1930s the species was considered to be abundant, and this remained the case in the 1980s and early 1990s according to anecdotal accounts. Mauremys annamensis was assessed as Critically Endangered in 2000 based on a known or inferred population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations due to actual or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b089daee-491f-4ac5-8b2a-828eab02ad5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b089daee-491f-4ac5-8b2a-828eab02ad5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f71435afffb2861a5f80dd7537edb9fd42659bbd68e0c0d68b9f71f9e356a1f4"}, "3": {"node_id": "539a4257-23f5-4477-ae43-b1ab579804d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4415dbc9e940e9cc6ae587acfd468f04c45e15da5cba93170c0ac24176c839de"}}, "hash": "5637c7b48430ec7a10b7d0923fe5dda439e9444c0f9d6391d4be08d3f624992a", "text": "potential levels of trade, and a similar projected future decline over the same time period. The main threats were/are over-collection and habitat loss. In recent years, field surveys have found very small numbers of animals in the wild, despite targeted surveys, and the species is rarely observed in market surveys or seizures, indicating it is now extremely rare. Some experts consider that this species is now functionally extinct in the wild. Mauremys annamensis is legally protected from exploitation in Viet Nam, although enforcement is considered to be weak. The species was included in CITES Appendix II in 2003, and since 2013 there has been a zero-export quota for wild specimens for commercial purposes. Captive breeding is known to occur in Viet Nam and non-range States (including China, the USA and Europe) and it is now thought most specimens in trade are captive-bred, although wild individuals may be being used as parental stock. Animals take about seven years to mature, and recruitment is slow. Prior to 2013, live exports were approximately five individuals per year, whereas from 2013 this increased to ca. 300 per year totaling ca. 2,000 (predominantly reported as captive-bred/born exported from the USA for commercial purposes to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) (1,100). Extreme price fluctuations have been observed in trade in China and Viet Nam, and the current price of around USD 30 per juvenile has been inferred to suggest that the demand for this species is decreasing or that there was now an abundance of captive-bred hatchlings available which reduced the market value. Analysis: The ongoing international trade in Mauremys annamensis consists mainly of individuals reported as captive-bred and captive-born. Its range is limited to scattered isolated occurrences in five provinces (possibly seven) in central Viet Nam. In 2000 the species was assessed as Critically Endangered. Reports from local people and market observations indicate that the species was considerably more abundant in the 1980s and 1990s, suggesting a marked population decline. It is very rare and could be functionally extinct in the wild. All indications suggest that this species\u2019 life history traits make it intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation. Following a Periodic Review after CoP16 the Animals Committee recommended the inclusion of M. annamensis in Appendix I. It would appear M. annamensis meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix I. Other Considerations: At CoP16 a zero-export quota in wild-sourced specimens for commercial purposes was adopted with the listing for this species and therefore all trade in wild specimens is already illegal. Any additional benefits of an Appendix I listing are not clear.

Range Viet Nam IUCN Global Category Critically Endangered A1d+2d (2000) ver 2.3. Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population The actual or historic population size of Mauremys annamensis is unknown. In recent years, field surveys have found very small numbers of animals in the wild, indicating that the species is now extremely rare; the first animal trapped by scientists in natural habitat since 1941 was in 2006, over 65 years later. Recently, seven animals found in the wild were identified as \u201cOcadia glyphistoma\u201d, a name now believed to be based on specimens of a hybrid origin with Mauremys annamensis and Mauremys sinensis as parents. The occurrence of these animals in the wild led to the hypothesis that population levels of both species have fallen so low that no separate breeding populations exist anymore, leading to hybridisation.

Interviews conducted by the Mauremys annamensis Project staff in recent years found local interviewees often reported that when the species was common in the 1980s and early 1990s, animals would often wander into local houses, or were even considered pests as large animals would trample rice crops. Mauremys annamensis was assessed in 2000 as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List based on a known or inferred population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generations due to actual or potential levels of trade, and a similar projected future decline over the same time period. A reassessment (currently in progress) indicates that the species will be retained as Critically Endangered. The actual or historic population size of M. annamensis is unknown. Since its description there have been a limited number of observations of this species in its native range as a result of conflict and political isolation, it has therefore been difficult to determine the rate of decline (McCormack et al., 2014). Mauremys annamensis take about seven years to mature and females may produce one or two clutches of 5\u20138 eggs per year; egg and hatchling mortality rates are high, and recruitment is slow. These life history attributes make the species intrinsically vulnerable to over-exploitation, particularly of adults. During April and May 2006 comprehensive interview-based surveys were conducted in Quang Nam province, focusing on Mauremys annamensis. A total of 397 local people were interviewed, 93 of whom provided information on M. annamensis. Information was received from a boy who was in possession of a specimen of M. annamensis he claimed to have caught in a lake known locally as Ha Tre Lake. In November 2006, a team from the Mauremys annamensis Project (MAP) investigated this area, which resulted in the first capture of a wild single sub-adult since 1941. A full-time monitoring team was then deployed in the area in September 2007 in the Dien Phong Commune in addition to further interviews with locals. A total of 110 days of trapping were carried out at three sites in Duy Xuyen and Dien Ban districts and resulted in no further field records of M. annamensis. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 35 174 Habitat loss, the use of pesticides and habitat degradation combined with collection for Vietnamese farming demand and trafficking to China have resulted in dramatic declines in numbers and experts now consider M. annamensis functionally extinct in the wild (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). Trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix I The species is or may be affected by trade Historically, Mauremys annamensis has been consumed locally for food as part of a subsistence diet, however in the last decade consumption as food has largely ceased with most animals now sold into the pet trade (and Traditional Asian Medicine (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019)) due to the high economic incentive. Mauremys annamensis does have specific local medicinal uses: throughout much of its range, its use in local traditional medicines remains and is possibly being promoted. Blood from the turtles is mixed with strong rice wine and drunk with the belief that it is a cure for heart disease. Soups and other tonics are also made from the species. The alleged heart disease cure gives it a higher local price than other, closely related local species such as Mauremys sinensis. According to the CITES Trade Database, between 2003 and 2017 exporters reported exporting a total of 1,685 live specimens (importers reported 1,558): - 1,246 were reported to be from captive-bred sources (\u201cC\u201d), 435 were captive-born (\u201cF\u201d) and there were no reported exports of wild-sourced specimens (\u201cW\u201d).

Wang, in litt., 2019). There have been significant price fluctuations. The wholesale price in central Viet Nam has varied around USD50 during 2009\u20132011, but in August 2011 the wholesale price for Mauremys annamensis spiked to USD1,200\u20131,440 per kg, before collapsing below its previous level within weeks, and hovered around USD25 per kg in 2012. Similarly, its price increased dramatically in China from over USD12 per individual in 2008 to over USD1,700 per individual in 2014. The market appeared to collapse soon after due to a large quantity of captive-bred specimens entering the market (Y. Wang, in litt., 2019). Since 2017, the interest of Chinese farmers for M. annamensis was said to be ceasing, while Western breeders were selling hatchlings for over USD100, the current price is around USD30 per juvenile suggesting that the demand for this species is decreasing (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). While Mauremys annamensis was common in local trade in 1996, the species is rarely seen in wildlife trade shipments in recent years, with only modest numbers (fewer than 10) specimens seen annually in local trade at sites since 2007, and the last wild collected specimens recorded in trade in 2013. 0 200 400 600 800 2003 2005 2006 2007 2009 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 No. of Individuals I F C IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 35 175 Additional Information Threats Mauremys annamensis is affected by direct collection and habitat degradation. Direct collection of adults and juveniles, historically for occasional subsistence consumption, but mainly for the international pet trade in recent years, is highly likely significantly to impact populations of a species whose life history has evolved to accept moderate losses of juveniles but whose reproductive adults are of great population value. With very limited numbers of wild-sourced individuals seized and the rarity of Mauremys annamensis in the wild, there may be no trade in wild-sourced specimens occurring (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). Conversion of natural lowland to wetlands to agricultural land use, such as rice paddies and irrigation canals leads to extensive collection of animals that are encountered incidentally while tending crops etc. In addition, pollution from herbicides used during conflict, agrochemicals, industrial pollution, and sewage effluent, likely all represent additional impacts on the species and its habitat. Conservation, management and legislation Mauremys annamensis is legally protected in Viet Nam from any form of exploitation by inclusion in Schedule IIB of Decree 32/2006/ND-CP, though enforcement at local jurisdictions may be insufficient. Schedule II includes species whose utilisation is restricted to scientific research, establishing breeding populations, and international exchange; any such activities require a collection permit from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Mauremys annamensis was listed in Appendix II in 2003, and a zero-export quota for wild-sourced specimens for commercial purposes was adopted in 2013, and it is included in Annex B of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations. It was proposed for inclusion in Appendix I at CoP16 but due to another proposal proposing Mauremys annamensis and a number of other species already included in Appendix II for a zero-export quota for wild specimens (CoP16 Prop 32.) Viet Nam withdrew their proposal. Mauremys annamensis was included in the Periodic Review between CoP16 and CoP17 and the Animals Committee agreed with the recommendation in the review to transfer M. annamensis to Appendix I. No population management measures have taken place or are in preparation in the species\u2019 range beyond the establishment of a legal framework for sustainable development and conservation of freshwater turtles and tortoises. An international programme has taken shape since 2006 to reintroduce and strengthen a viable population of M. annamensis in its native range. There have been attempts to release captive-bred specimens back into the wild, but this has been hindered by the lack of remaining suitable and protectable habitat (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019).

The Asian Turtle Program, at its facilities at Cuc Phuong National Park, has a long- established successful breeding programme for the species for conservation purposes. Mauremys annamensis is one of about 30 species of freshwater turtles that is commercially bred at a turtle farm at Tun Chan, Hainan Island. Breeding of Mauremys annamensis in Europe and the USA is primarily a non-commercial, conservation-focused effort, and a commercial interest for only a very limited number of breeders. Successful captive breeding at European institutions occurred from 2006 and quickly became so successful, and placement options so limited, that some institutions have resorted to only incubating some of the eggs produced. Implementation challenges (including similar species) Mauremys annamensis can be easily recognised by its clear pattern of creamy yellow stripes on its otherwise deep olive-green face, head and neck. Potential risk(s) of a transfer from Appendix II to I Some experts now consider Mauremys annamensis to be functionally extinct in the wild (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019) and the long-term survival of this species relies on ex-situ conservation programmes that are captive breeding this species for reintroduction purposes (D. Gaillard, in litt., 2019 & T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). Therefore, inclusion IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 35 176 of Mauremys annamensis in Appendix I could prevent or impede possible reintroductions from ex-situ captive bred populations (D. Gaillard, in litt., 2019 and T. Blanck, in litt., 2019). Enforcement appears to be weak in this area with illegal trade occurring between Viet Nam and China, allowing turtles to pass across borders that are not controlled. Therefore, if current enforcement efforts are not sufficient, inclusion of this species in Appendix I may not have any significant effect on regulating this trade (T. Blanck, in litt., 2019).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 36 Transfer of Star Tortoise Geochelone elegans from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponents: Bangladesh, India, Senegal and Sri Lanka Summary: The Star Tortoise Geochelone elegans is very popular in the pet trade. It is found in north-western and south-eastern India, eastern Pakistan, and northern and eastern Sri Lanka. Its current area of occupancy is greater than 2,000 km2 and extent of occurrence greater than 20,000 km2, with both reported to be declining. Geochelone elegans is found in a variety of dry vegetation types including scrubland, grassland and desert edge. It is a relatively adaptable species and tolerant of change, being found in agricultural landscapes including fields, hedgerows and plantations. Geochelone elegans faces two main threats; habitat loss, primarily in the form of conversion of preferred habitat to agriculture, and illegal harvesting for the pet trade, particularly the collection of juvenile specimens. Other threats include accidental mortalities from road kills, agricultural equipment and discarded fishing nets, and deliberate killing to protect crops. There is a lack of quantitative population data for this species. Geochelone elegans is categorised by IUCN as Vulnerable having been assessed in 2015; based on past and inferred future declines, a decline of greater than 30% (over a three-generation period) was predicted to occur by 2025 (from a start point of 1995), if exploitation continued or expanded. However, as G. elegans was assessed as Vulnerable and not Endangered, declines of greater than 50% were not indicated. Estimated densities of 4.0\u20132.5 animals/ha were recorded in 1991.

However, it is the single most confiscated species of tortoise or freshwater turtle worldwide. Seizures of large numbers of G. elegans are well documented. At least 34,000 live individuals were seized between 2000 and 2015, with a further ca. 14,400 individuals seized between 2016 and 2018. Observations of 55,000 individuals being removed from the wild from one location over one year (2015), in India, suggest illegal harvest and trade levels could be considerably higher than the observed seizures. The CITES Trade Database shows high numbers of Geochelone elegans in trade; almost 63,000 live specimens were reported between 2000 and 2015, over half of which were reported as captive-born or bred individuals (ca. 37,000). Over a third had no source code reported (ca. 24,000) and were exported from Jordan, a non-range State, and the largest global exporter of G. elegans. Jordan also reported exporting almost 31,000 captive-bred individuals, as well as re-exporting just over 1,900 wild-sourced with no origin specified. Afghanistan was also a significant exporter of wild-caught individuals (5,000). Uncertainty over the size of captive breeding populations and numbers exported from non-range States suggest a large portion of the legally permitted trade is likely to include illegally harvested and misreported wild specimens from range States. Trade from Jordan of G. elegans has been subject to the \u201cReview of trade in animal specimens reported as produced in captivity\u201d, with recommendations for Jordan including a zero-export quota. Analysis: Geochelone elegans does not have a restricted range, nor does it appear to have a small population. The G. elegans population has been reported to be declining, there is strong evidence of large-scale illegal international trade, which along with other factors is believed to be driving this decline. Scant quantitative population trend data are available, but it has been estimated that if threats continue, declines of greater than 30% (but less than 50%) are likely to occur during the three generation period from 1995\u20132025. This is less than the guideline figure given in Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) for a marked recent rate of decline. However, illegal trade appears to present a constant pressure on the population and given concerns raised through the \u201cReview of trade in animal specimens reported as produced in captivity\u201d, it may be precautionary to list the species in Appendix I. Res. Conf. 12.10 (Rev. CoP15) outlines that inclusion in Appendix I would mean commercial captive IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 178 breeding operations would need to meet the provisions of Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.) to be registered with the CITES Secretariat, and that registered operations shall ensure an appropriate and secure marking system to identify all breeding stock and specimens in trade. This enhanced oversight could help allay concerns over fraudulent claims of captive breeding and continued wild offtake for breeding stock.

As Geochelone elegans was assessed as Vulnerable and not Endangered, declines of >50% were not expected. This echoes separate national Conservation Assessment Management Plan (CAMP) workshop assessments of Indian (assessed 1998) and Sri Lankan (assessed 2000) populations. Wild populations of this species are present in both protected areas and in agricultural landscapes in range States. Substantial wild populations appear still to exist in India and Sri Lanka, but recent detailed field surveys regarding their exact status are currently lacking. Any populations in Pakistan appear to be extremely localised and small, with recent detailed field surveys also lacking. A marked decline in the population size in the wild which has been inferred or projected on the basis of: Recruitment The SS suggests that a marked decline in the population size in the wild can be inferred based on an inferred decrease in recruitment due to the indiscriminate removal of juvenile and adult Geochelone elegans from the wild over multiple generations for exploitation in domestic and international trade. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 179 Primary collectors tend to pick up specimens that are a year old or older, but collection of sub-adults and adults also takes place (D\u2019Cruze et al., 2015). Most of the pet trade involves small to medium-sized animals, few exceeding 10 cm CL (assumed to mean carapace length) (D\u2019Cruze et al., 2016). Due to the long life expectancy of this species, a consequent lack of recruitment may not manifest as a population reduction for several years, masking the impact of offtake (this reference is currently in press). Intrinsic vulnerability The SS suggests that a marked decline in the population size in the wild can be inferred based on a high intrinsic vulnerability of the species to over-exploitation due to late onset of reproduction and slow reproductive rate, behavioural traits that allow ease of capture, and specialised niche requirements (i.e. diet and habitat). Geochelone elegans is long-lived with a low reproductive rate. Data on key life-history parameters in wild populations are incomplete, however mature females (female sexual maturity reported at the age of 10 years (Frazier, 1987), while Das (1991) and Vyas (1997) report sexual maturity at the age of 6\u20137 years) are known to typically produce two clutches (exceptionally up to four clutches) per year, each comprising an average between 2\u201310 eggs. Generation length has been estimated as approximately 10 years. Geochelone elegans is most active during the monsoon season when the majority of wild collection for the international pet trade appears to occur (in D\u2019Cruze et al., 2015 it states that, \u201cCollection is predominantly seasonal, taking place after the local monsoon seasons (March and April; and September, October and November) when tortoises tend to emerge out of hiding to feed on fresh sprouting vegetation\u201d). Extrinsic vulnerability The SS suggests that a marked decline in the population size in the wild can be inferred based on a high vulnerability to extrinsic factors, specifically a decrease in the area and quality of habitat due to deforestation and land conversion for agriculture, and a high threat of accidental mortalities, via road kills, agricultural equipment and deliberate mortalities to protect crops in converted habitats. The SS notes that the species is found in a region with one of the highest human populations in the world and projected to increase, presumably inferring greater habitat loss. Estimates of change in the availability of preferred and/or suitable habitat for Geochelone elegans have not been made. Habitat loss, destruction and/or degradation threaten the continued survival of Geochelone elegans populations in the wild. Scrub forest habitat is being converted to orchards and cash crop agriculture leading to a reduction of available area of the preferred habitat type. The habitat is not reported as being severely fragmented (D\u2019Cruze et al., 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a93f12d-2312-49a2-995c-52b441c4015a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a93f12d-2312-49a2-995c-52b441c4015a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33a31239db9327086800d0d80d7ef5546e70bc0abc91358463c0d6eccf8d3b47"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ddf8b47-e4b4-4bf3-897c-0dd3eda2cfc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22ff15f3f50789756e25259c11f317aebc070b4f781e5e6b7fd9d39c38936ed4"}}, "hash": "c63009f58e4bf875342cb4644b32455f66641eb5ee7d70af8a53ffbc295de219", "text": "It is a relatively adaptable species, able to tolerate anthropogenically altered habitat, continued habitat loss is likely further to impact wild numbers negatively.

Jordon also re-exported 1,916 tortoises: 1,915 of which were wild but the origin was not stated. However, given that Jordan is a non-range State that has only received one shipment of 20 live G. elegans of unknown origin, there are concerns that its founderstock was not bred in captivity in conformity with Res. Conf. 10.16 (Rev.). A total of 8,599 re-exports were reported. Consequently, Jordan has been asked to report on how this founder stock was sourced and how much time was required to build up the breeding population. In a report commissioned by CITES Secretariat, Outhwaite et al., 2014 reported that at the time there was just one authorised breeding facility in Jordan producing captive-bred Geochelone elegans: the facility acquired its original stock of 22 females and nine males (all adults) from the local market in Jordan in 1985, all of which were sold in 1995. The then current breeding stock consisted of 185 females and 62 males, though an additional 72 females and 28 males were added in 2009 and the first clutch from these new animals was expected in 2014. Annual production for the period 2008 to 2012 (around 2,000 offspring per year) was far lower than exports from Jordan of around 4,650 captive-bred specimens per year (2008 to 2011) reported in the CITES Trade Database. The Animals Committee recommended at its 70th meeting in July 2018 that Jordan establish a zero-export quota for the species from all sources and provide evidence of the legal origin of its breeding stock following a \u201cReview of trade in animal specimens reported as produced in captivity\u201d. Ukraine (n=3,962), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) (n=1,797) and Slovenia (n=1,783) IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 180 were the three largest exporters after Jordan. Ukraine and Slovenia reported no legal import records for G. elegans that also bring the legitimacy of their founding into question (although not all intra-EU trade is reported in the CITES Trade Database so Slovenia may have imported tortoises from another EU Member State). Hong Kong SAR reported the import of 7,117 live G. elegans since 2000: 97% (6,876) of these specimens were imported from Jordan. According to (re-) exporters, a total of 2,541 wild live specimens were traded between 2000 and 2015, most were re-exports with no origin specified re-exported by Jordon (1,915). Importers reported a total of 5,395 wild live specimens, >99% from Afghanistan and imported by Japan. Trade was also reported from range States between 2000 and 2015: India (582 exported to Malaysia, source code \u201cI\u201d), Pakistan (5 specimens and 1 live \u201cW\u201d for scientific purposes) and Sri Lanka (9 live \u201cC\u201d for personal/zoo purposes). From 2016 to 2017 7,929 live Geochelone elegans were exported, with 7,619 being reported as being bred or born in captivity. Jordan was the largest exporter, responsible for 96% (n=7,332) of these specimens. These data are likely to be incomplete as countries are unlikely to have reported their trade to date. There are also concerns that \u201clegal loopholes\u201d are being exploited to sell illegally sourced Geochelone elegans in non-range States such as Thailand. Historically, Kazakhstan is reported to have been the main supplier into Thailand even though it is not a range country for this species and has a complete lack of import records for any captive breeding stock.

A total of 8,825 individual live specimens (reported to have an estimated value of USD 3,530,000, based on one live specimen having an estimated market value of USD 400) seized during 2016 and 2017 has been documented. There are concerns that the species is being smuggled from India and Sri Lanka into pet markets in Asia, Europe and the USA. However, the majority appear to be destined for use as exotic pets in Asian countries, such as Thailand and China. Large volume illegal trade pathways for Geochelone elegans for the pet trade are reported from South Asia to Southeast Asia (CITES, 2017). Country specific information is provided below: - In Sri Lanka unpublished data provided by the Customs Department and other enforcement officials (including navy, police and flying squad) state that at least 3,130 individual specimens were seized between 2015 and 2017 alone. - In Thailand, Geochelone elegans was the most frequent illegally traded tortoise seized by enforcement authorities between 2008 and 2013 (5,966 individuals during 15 cases). Geochelone elegans is the most commonly observed tortoise at Chatuchak Market in Thailand (the largest market in Thailand). - Additional seizures of Geochelone elegans occurred in Germany, Indonesia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Slovakia, Spain, the UK and the USA, in most cases from air travellers arriving from Asia, IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 181 as well as some from express mail parcels sent from Asia. The price per specimen in the European pet market may be up to EUR 400\u2013800 (USD 453-906). - Seizure events in India, reported by the media between 2011 and 2015 revealed that at least 8,533 individual live specimens of Geochelone elegans were seized and that it appeared in at least 23% of all such seizure events. - Geochelone elegans was the most commonly sighted tortoise and freshwater turtle species observed in Jakarta, Indonesia, during a three-month study of pet shops and markets in 2015. 937 animals were observed with a median of 74 per week (Morgan, 2018). - Sy (2018) report a minimum of 56 Geochelone elegans observed in 11 posts for sale in Philippine Facebook groups from June\u2013August 2016. This was the third most recorded tortoise and freshwater turtle species in the study. - Sung and Fong 2018 report 486 Geochelone elegans were advertised for sale in 322 \u201cposts\u201d on an internet forum in Hong Kong SAR between September 2013 and August 2016. The average price was USD 274. Additional Information Threats Locally in rural areas, Geochelone elegans is sometimes eaten for subsistence. This species is also collected for use as pets (with owners believing they bring good luck and fortune) and for spiritual use nationally (in some societies they are thought to represent a reincarnation of the Hindu God \u201cVishnu\u201d), although trade for these purposes is likely to be negligible compared with the high volume of the international pet trade. Over 100 have been observed in one urban household in India alone and researchers observed a total of 22 animals at three different Shiva temples in the State of Gujarat, India. In Sri Lanka, some societies consider Geochelone elegans to be a bad omen and unlucky (reported in D\u2019Cruze et al., 2018). Habitat loss is occurring throughout the species' range; scrub forest habitat is being converted to orchards and cash crop agriculture, leading to a reduction of available area of the preferred habitat type. Although this is a relatively adaptable species, able to tolerate anthropogenically altered habitat, continued habitat loss is likely to impact wild numbers further (D'Cruze et al., 2016). Conservation, management and legislation Legislation Geochelone elegans is fully protected by law from commercial exploitation, trade or possession in each of its three range States. In India, Geochelone elegans was placed in Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 in 1980 and for over 38 years it has been illegal to hunt (including take from the wild) this species or trade it domestically without a licence (Sections 9 and 44 of the Wildlife (protection) Act, 1972).

It is not specifically covered by other Conventions or multilateral environmental agreements. Management No official management measures are known in range States for the protection and specific study of Geochelone elegans. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 182 There are several challenges associated with the reactive management and repatriation involving large numbers of seized and confiscated live Geochelone elegans specimens. These include but are not limited to: (1) non- existent national action plans for effective seizure and disposal of live specimens; (2) incomplete understanding of which national agencies are responsible for effective seizure of live specimens; (3) a lack of financial resources for effective disposal of live specimens; and (4) lack of skilled staff for effective seizure and disposal of live specimens. No official in-country population monitoring programmes have yet been established for Geochelone elegans by any of the three range States. Artificial propagation/captive breeding The SS reports that Geochelone elegans does not appear to reproduce regularly or in great numbers even at the best captive facilities. While some small-scale captive breeding may be occurring at some zoos and with some private keepers, few of the offspring are traded internationally, and no large-scale commercial captive production facilities have been documented. Information provided by the global online database Species 360 (2014) confirmed that a total of 765 Geochelone elegans were being held in captivity at 78 different zoos and aquaria in four different geographical regions (Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 Transfer of Pancake Tortoise Malacochersus tornieri from Appendix II to Appendix I Proponents: Kenya and the USA Summary: The Pancake Tortoise Malacochersus tornieri has a unique appearance of a flat and flexible shell allowing it to wedge itself tightly into rock crevices. The species inhabits rocky outcrops in Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania) and northern Zambia, and due to its very specific microhabitat requirements it is discontinuously distributed across its range. While its calculated area of occupancy has been estimated at 72,000 km2, due to the species\u2019 specific requirements the actual area of suitable habitat is thought to be less than 5% of this (and even less to have suitable crevices in terms of dimensions and orientation). The species has low productivity in the wild: maturing at over five years and laying one (sometimes two) eggs per year.

It is thought the Pancake Tortoise spends most of its time inactive in the rocky crevices which provide a thermal buffer; a behaviour which makes it difficult to survey. However, an extrapolation based on population density studies in Kenya suggests a global population of between 4,000 and 32,000 in 2001/2002. Presence in Zambia was confirmed in 2006, and based on a mark-recapture study, the Zambian population was estimated at just over 500 individuals. Opportunities for recolonization of over-exploited areas are limited due to the species' limited movement (limited home range and high site fidelity). A recent assessment accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update categorises the species as Critically Endangered due to observed, estimated and projected population reductions of about 80% over three generations (45 years in total) that will be reached in the next 15 years. The population is believed to be declining: the international pet trade has been identified as the main factor but habitat degradation and loss, particularly from rock destruction and farming, are also significant threats to the species. Low population densities have been observed in otherwise seemingly suitable habitat: surveys in Kenya found the location Voo to have the highest density in 2001/2002 (9/km2) but no tortoises were observed in 2014 during a repeat survey, and this was attributed to the establishment of a commercial farming operation nearby using wild specimens for breeding stock. Other areas in Kenya surveyed in 2001/2002 that had good Pancake Tortoise populations at that time were also noted to be depleted in 2014. In Tanzania, in the early 1990s the average number of tortoises encountered per hour was approximately 90% lower in areas where they have been exploited. The Pancake Tortoise was listed in Appendix II in 1975. Kenya does not permit wild exports, and following inclusion in the Review of Significant Trade in the late 1980s, the Standing Committee recommended a trade suspension for Tanzania for wild specimens which remained in place between 1993 and 2018: this has now been lifted on the condition that Tanzania implements a zero export quota for wild specimens. It is not clear what legal provisions there are for the species in Zambia. All three countries have licensed captive breeding facilities. Concerns have been raised about the ability of these farms to produce the fluctuating numbers reported in trade, particularly for Zambia, which started exporting captive-bred tortoises in 2006 (the year the wild population was confirmed in Zambia, although some wild/ranched specimens had been exported before that time). Fluctuations could indicate ongoing capture from the wild (within Zambia or neighbouring Tanzania) for export and/or parental stock. Zambia\u2019s exports totalled around 23,000 between 2006 and 2016. Significant exports reported as wild have taken place from non-range States, and illegal trade is highlighted as an issue. Analysis: The population size in 2001/2002 was estimated at between 4,000\u201332,000, but on the basis of results from more recent surveys, the slow breeding potential of the species and inferred ongoing wild collection, it seems possible that the current population now meets the definition of being a small wild population that is declining. An IUCN Red List assessment due for publication in March IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 184 2019 has categorised the species as Critically Endangered as it is estimated that the population will have declined by 80% over three generations (two past, one future\u2014through to 2033). If the rate of decline is equal across all three generations this will have meant the species has suffered a marked recent decline of over 50% in the last two generations with the decline predicted to continue. The species is affected by trade, although most exported specimens are reported to be captive-bred, results from surveys indicate wild harvest has continued, which may be being used as parental stock in farms or being exported.

Range Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia. IUCN Global Category Vulnerable A1bd ver (1996 needs updating) 2.3. An updated categorisation of Critically Endangered has been accepted for publication in March 2019 (Mwaya et al., 2019). Biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I A) Small wild population The abundance of this species is generally low. Due to the cryptic nature of this rock-crevice dwelling species, reliable estimates of its population size are difficult to achieve and therefore poorly understood. However, relative population data (such as abundance and the number of specimens per person-hour of searching time) have been obtained from various populations, and comparisons of harvested with non-harvested sites clearly document reduced density at exploited sites. Using the global estimated distribution of 3,600 km2 (see calculation below) and the lowest and highest recorded densities for Kenya, a very approximate estimation of the global population in 2001/2002 was between 4,000 and 32,000. The current population is likely to have decreased as wild harvest appears to have continued and due to the species\u2019 life history characteristics (slow breeder, unable to colonise new areas) it is likely to have been unsustainable. Kenya: Population surveys in 2001/2002 recorded densities in appropriate habitats ranging from 8.86 tortoises/km2 to as low as 1.2 tortoises/km2. Tanzania: In Tanzania abundance was estimated in 1995 (surveys undertaken in 1992) based on the number of specimens per person-hour (ph) of searching time. Encounter rates varied between 8.5 tortoises/ph to 0.23 tortoises/ph. Zambia: In Zambia, 68 animals were found at eight sites in Nakonde District with 2\u201325 individuals per site. Based upon a mark-recapture study, a population size estimate of 518 animals was obtained and a density of 11 individuals/km2. B) Restricted area of distribution Pancake Tortoises have extremely rigid microhabitat requirements and only live in rock crevices of suitable dimensions in small rocky hills (kopjes) in dry savannah in parts of Kenya, Tanzania and marginally in northern Zambia. These microhabitats are sparse and few and separated by large areas of unsuitable habitat. The IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 185 species\u2019 distribution is determined by four limiting factors, namely: geology, climate, vegetation and altitude. Local population size depends on the number of suitable crevices the outcrops provide, the crevices provide buffering against temperature and humidity fluctuations. Suitable rock crevices for the species are easily identifiable by collectors, making populations vulnerable to depletion. Much of the range appears to be comprised of discontinuous and disjunct populations occurring in isolated patches of suitable habitat. Isolation of suitable habitats, coupled with limited dispersal abilities and low recruitment rates, make recovery of depleted populations unlikely. While the calculated area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) appear moderate to large, the actual suitable micro-habitat (rocky areas with appropriate crevices) constitute only a very small proportion of the calculated AOO: estimated less than 5% of the AOO contained the required rocky outcrops, and even within that the area with suitable dimensions is much smaller (P. Malonza, in litt., 2019).The estimated AOO given in the IUCN Red List assessment is 72,000 km2 (Mwaya et al., 2019) using the estimate of 5% being suitable this would equate to 3,600 km2. While the AOO should relate to the area that the taxon is present in, in reality due to the coarse nature used when mapping and calculating the AOO, the actual AOO can be smaller. Zambia: Has only been recorded from a single location in the hilly areas of the northern Nakonde District, an unprotected area bordering Tanzania. It is possible the species used to occur at a lower altitude but may have been pushed out due to habitat destruction (Chansa & Wagner, 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89a2c5c6-7174-4572-a0e7-8de113944659": {"__data__": {"id_": "89a2c5c6-7174-4572-a0e7-8de113944659", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d422b99df7069e434cad971d2011ca78dad0c754d3fd5ff5a5799a97113d3ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "0390679f-cb22-46f8-8b23-e0639b62bdd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa002034df763fa6d715ba92dfc567ba5ccda0ad0d9794769c88724d7aace797"}}, "hash": "b86ce69feafde8f6c2a29981d4533a95fd4af6f6ae34fa1653873369b4652605", "text": "C) Decline in number of wild individuals The status of M. tornieri populations in the wild is poorly known, but many populations are decreasing (Ngwava, 2015).

Habitat for this species is rapidly deteriorating in extent and quality. Habitat degradation and loss from the destruction of its rock crevice micro-habitat, often as a result of collection, is an additional threat to the species. The species is slow to mature; age at maturity in captivity is reported at 5\u20139 years. Life expectancy was estimated at 25 years, and it has very low fecundity, with only one or occasionally two eggs laid annually in the wild at the onset of the wet season (Mwaya et al., 2018). Information on relative declines in ranges States are detailed below: Kenya: It was reported in 2008 that collection of specimens for international trade has been identified as a major threat to populations in a number of sites. Surveys in 2001/2002 took in 98% of the species\u2019 range (P. Malonza, in litt., 2019) (presumably only 98% of the range within Kenya). Densities were recorded at eight sites during these surveys ranged from 8.86 tortoises/km2 in Voo, Kitui County to 1.2 tortoises/km2 at Nguni\u2014the low population density in the Nguni area was reported to be due to past collection. Tortoise collectors have visited most of the areas surveyed in Mwingi district and have had depleting effects in some areas (Malonza, 2003). A repeat survey was undertaken in 2014 which covered at least 50% of the 2001/2002 sites. The total number of tortoises seen (62) (Ngwava, 2015) equates to a very low encounter rate per person hour (4 x researchers, 8 hour days, 52 days): 0.04 tortoises/ph (similar to the encounter rate in exploited areas in Tanzania (see below)). The 2014 survey found no Pancake Tortoises in Voo, but a commercial farming operation for Pancake Tortoises had been established and likely specimens from the local wild population have been collected to provide breeding stock for the farm. Other areas in Kenya surveyed in 2001/2002 that had good Pancake Tortoise populations at that time were also noted to be depleted in 2014, although it was a particularly dry year which may have contributed to low encounter rates (Ngwava, 2015). Tanzania: Results of preliminary surveys indicated that in less than 10 years of intensive collection (1985\u20131995), the Pancake Tortoise had become severely threatened throughout its range in Tanzania. Recent survey data from Tanzania is lacking. Surveys in 1992 compared six unexploited areas with five exploited areas, finding the latter on average was significantly lower (2.42 tortoises/ph vs. 0.27 tortoises/ph) (Klemens & IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 186 Moll, 1995) (which equates to around 90% lower). At the time collectors said it was becoming increasingly difficult to find tortoises because of intensive collection, some collectors noted harvesting large numbers (e.g. 400 in one year for one dealer). Physical evidence of crevice destruction due to collection was observed (Klemens & Moll, 1995). Studies in Tanzania have demonstrated that collection for trade decreased population densities and changed age-class compositions towards a larger proportion of juveniles in wild populations (as adults were specifically targeted), as compared to undisturbed populations. This may suggest that the wild specimens are being used for breeding stock in farms, rather than being directly exported as international trade tends to favour juveniles.

Additional Information Threats Overexploitation for commercial trade is considered the single most important threat to the species in all range States. An additional related factor threatening the species is the destruction of rock crevices by collectors allowing freer access to the crevice inhabitants (Malonza, 2003). Habitat degradation from rock destruction is also an important factor affecting the Pancake Tortoise, especially as related to illegal tortoise collection (range-wide), construction purposes and slab and ballast extraction in Kenya, and kiln building for charcoal production in Zambia. Vegetation removal through slash-and-burn cultivation, wildfires and charcoal burning are also detrimental. In Zambia's Nakonde District, 98% of land area has been reported to be deforested through land clearance for agriculture, firewood collection and charcoal production. Conservation, management and legislation The genus Malacochersus was listed in Appendix II in 1975. A proposal was submitted by Kenya and the USA at CoP11 (2000) to transfer the Pancake Tortoise from Appendix II to I, which was withdrawn following the results of findings of the Animals Committee mission to Tanzania in 1998 (although it is not clear on what basis) and further due to recommendations for development of strict management measures for captive breeding and trade of the species (Kyalo, 2008). The species has been listed on Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 1997 (Species+, 2019). The species was included in the 1988 Significant Trade in Wildlife: Review of Selected Species (IUCN and CITES Secretariat,1988) and subsequently the SC recommended a trade suspension for Tanzania which was in place 1993\u20132018. Since 1998 the suspension was restricted to wild exports, but not to specimens produced from ranching or captive breeding operations, for which the annual export quota has to be agreed between the Management Authority and the Secretariat. The quota increased from 719 in 2000 to 940 in 2017 (Species+, 2019). At SC70 (2018), the Standing Committee agreed to remove the trade suspension subject to the publication of a zero export quota on the CITES website, although it not clear if this relates only to wild or all specimens (SC70 SR, 2018). In Kenya hunting and trade has been prohibited since the late 1970s. However, there is an exception which permits captive breeding. In Tanzania, the species is listed in the Wildlife Conservation (National Game) Order which means it is protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act, 1974 (W. Crosmary, in litt., 2019). It has been estimated that only 23% of M. tornieri habitat is currently protected across its entire range.

Kenya legally discontinued exporting Pancake Tortoises from the wild in 1981, and since then at least three breeding farms have been licensed. At least four farms have been licensed in Tanzania. The Tanzanian Management Authority reported that there are currently two zoos that hold the species in the country, and six breeders (SC70 Doc 29.2, 2018). In Tanzania, commercial Pancake Tortoise farms inspected in 2001 appeared to be conduits for wild-caught animals (Mwaya et al., 2019). Zambia started to regularly export the species as captive-bred in 2006, soon after a study had found the species to exist in one location in Zambia. With no public information available on the operation of breeding facilities in Zambia and only a single Zambian population described in an isolated, unprotected area and an estimated population of 518 animals, concerns have been raised that tortoises may actually originate from other countries. The CITES Secretariat contracted TRAFFIC to visit Zambia in 2014 and inspect three captive breeding facilities, and while no obvious signs of any wild-caught tortoises were found, in some cases the quantity produced was rather high in relation to the known biological capacity of the species (SC66 Doc 41.1, 2016). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 37 188 In captivity, breeding and egg laying have occurred almost all year round, provided there is a good food supply. Reproductive potential in captivity is low: from one to six clutches per year have been reported, with clutches usually contained only a single egg, occasionally two eggs. Larger clutches are reported to have low fertility. Low fertility and hatch rate seem common in captive M. tornieri and was usually far below 50%. In contrast, survival rate of hatchlings appeared rather high between 32 and 100%. There is no consensus on whether it is challenging to raise the animals to sexual maturity in captivity. Potential benefit(s) for trade regulation of a transfer from Appendix II to I Listing in Appendix-I would mean captive breeding operations intending to export tortoises will need to be registered with the CITES Secretariat which may increase transparency.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 38 Inclusion of Glass Frogs of the genera Hyalinobatrachium, Centrolene, Cochranella and Sachatamia in Appendix II Proponents: Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras Summary: Glass frogs (family Centrolenidae) are so called because of their unique transparent abdominal skin. Glass frogs are distributed throughout the Neotropics, from Mexico to Bolivia, with an isolated group of species occurring in southeastern Brazil and northeastern Argentina. After a taxonomic revision of Centrolenidae in 2009, there are currently considered to be 11 (possibly 12) genera included within the family. Only four genera are included in this proposal (Hyalinobatrachium, Centrolene, Cochranella and Sachatamia) comprising over 100 species. Information on the population sizes and trends of many species is scarce, although 30 are considered to be declining and 17 stable. Among the 104 species listed by the proponents, four are assessed on the IUCN Red List as Critically Endangered, 11 Endangered, 13 Vulnerable, four Near Threatened, 27 Least Concern and 23 Data Deficient. The main threats appear to be habitat loss and fragmentation, along with pollution, disease and climate change. It was estimated that the habitat for only seven of the species that have been assessed was stable or undisturbed. Global trade data are not available for any glass frog species. Based on available data on imports into the USA from 2004-2017, international trade appears to mainly be in: - live animals for commercial purposes (1,147 (260 wild)) - bodies for scientific or educational purposes (389 (all wild)) - specimens for scientific or educational purposes (1,408 (all wild); not possible to equate to number of frogs so not detailed further). Live glass frogs have also been observed for sale online in Europe, and some illegal trade has been reported. The following species have been identified as being traded: - Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni was assessed as Least Concern in 2010. The primary threats were identified as deforestation and agricultural pollution. Reported imports to the USA from 2004- 2017 included 842 live (203 wild) and six bodies (all wild). - Espadarana prosoblepon (reported as Centrolene prosoblepon) and Teratohyla spinosa (reported as Cochranella spinosa) were both reported in trade, however, following the taxonomy of Guayasamin et al. (2009) (reflected in the current version of the CITES Standard Reference for amphibians (Frost, 2015)), both species would fall outside the scope of this proposal. They were both assessed as Least Concern in 2008. The major threats were identified as deforestation and agricultural pollution. Small quantities of both species were reportedly imported to the USA from 2004-2017: 57 live and 304 bodies (all wild) of E. prosoblepon, and six live and six bodies (all wild) of T. spinosa. A number of species were assessed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern between 2008 and 2010 (the main threats identified at the time were habitat loss and degradation), and only relatively small amounts of trade in live individuals and bodies into the USA between 2004 and 2017 were reported. This includes: - Cochranella granulosa (12 live and 11 bodies, all wild); - Hyalinobatrachium valerioi (50 live, all captive-bred); - Sachatamia ilex (reported as Centrolene ilex) (20 bodies, all wild).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1e35188-c618-48a1-b09c-c24df5925166": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1e35188-c618-48a1-b09c-c24df5925166", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f11f7520d02aed5c592c11967c040629f1f2de81ce6838fad63408b2e051a24b"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2303cdd-cad7-4b30-a1cb-17a3564f7355", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29e8504cf8a80399e5489997739b73b3d1e5453155335e940b94e1eb9a53c57d"}}, "hash": "17e47ff45b9edaeda382b2176167e44f4cd952a6a16b1d9314b6fef466001f11", "text": "No trade into the USA was reported for most other species, although for a total of 201 live individuals (198 captive-bred and 3 wild-sourced) the specific species was not reported.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 190 The distinction of the species within these four genera is said to be difficult for non-experts, however some identification guides have been developed in recent years. Glass frogs have conserved morphology, and preserved specimens can lose color and distinctive features which poses challenges for identification. Analysis: There is little information on the historical and current size of wild populations for most species of glass frogs. Some species within these four genera appear to have limited ranges while others are considered common.

Based on the information available it therefore does not appear that any species in the four genera subject to this proposal meets the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II. Other considerations: Identification guides have been developed to distinguish live individuals within the family Centrolenidae, however bodies and specimens are thought to be more difficult to identify. Under the current Standard Nomenclature Reference for amphibians, a total of seven (possibly eight) other genera of glass frogs, including some species that appear in trade, are not subject to this proposal and therefore would be excluded from an Appendix II listing should this proposal be adopted. The continual taxonomic changes within the family Centrolenidae may therefore pose implementation challenges, as species may be moved between genera. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Taxonomy According to Guayasamin et al., (2009), within the family Centrolenidae there are 11/12 genera and 146 species, including two subfamilies (* = new genus described in 2009; genera subject to this proposal are underlined): Centroleninae \u2013 Centrolene (23 spp.), Chimerella (1 spp.)*, Cochranella (7 spp.), Espadarana (3 spp.)*, Nymphargus (34 spp.), Rulyrana (8 spp.)*, Sachatamia (3 spp.)*, Teratohyla (4 spp.), Vitreorana (8 spp.)* = Total 91 species Hyalinobatrachinae \u2013 Celsiella (2 spp.)*, Hyalinobatrachium (28 spp.) = Total 30 species The placement of the 12th genus (Ikakogi (1 spp.)*) has not yet been resolved. The placement of further 24 species was not resolved because molecular data were not available, and morphological and behavioural characters did not provide unambiguous evidence for their placement (Guayasamin et al., 2009). Guayasamin et al., (2009) stated that the number of species in the family was unstable with new species and/or synonyms added each year. Their taxonomic revision added seven new genera to the family. Four genera (Centrolene, Cochranella, Hyalinobatrachium and Sachatamia) are subject to this proposal, which according to Guayasamin et al., (2009) totalled 61 species. The proponents consider 104 species to be covered by the proposal: Centrolene (39 spp.), Cochranella (24 spp.), Hyalinobatrachium (36 spp.) and Sachatamia (5 spp.), including species that Guayasamin et al., (2009) had assigned to genera outside the scope of this proposal (e.g. Cochranella armata -> Nymphargus armatus) or that they considered to be unresolved (Cochranella riveroi).

It is estimated that the habitat for only seven species (Hyalinobatrachium crurifasciatum, Hyalinobatrachium eccentricum, Hyalinobatrachium nouraguense, Cochranella riveroi, Centrolene charapita, Centrolene hybrida, Centrolene notostictum) in the four genera is stable or undisturbed; the habitat of all other species is subject to deterioration and degradation. According to the IUCN Red List most species have unknown population trends, 30 are declining and only 17 are stable. The loss of forests in Central and South America reached a rate of more than nine percent between 1990 and 2015, and consequently, the habitat of most species of these genera has experienced a significant decline. Most of the species of glass frogs have only been described in the last 40 years as they are often difficult to find in the wild, since much of their habitat is deemed inaccessible (Kubicki, 2003). Although recent progress has been made in determining the taxonomy, large knowledge gaps on the distributions, natural histories and status of glass frogs remain (Thompson et al., 2018). Of the species estimated to be experiencing population declines, three are listed as Critically Endangered, nine Endangered, 11 Vulnerable, two Near Threatened and 16 Least Concern. For only four species does the assessment include an estimate of decline: - Centrolene ballux: at the time of assessment drastic population decline estimated to be more than 80% over the last three generations (Bolivar et al., 2004a). - Centrolene buckleyi: at the time of assessment population decline projected to be more than 30% over the next 10 years in much of its Ecuadorian range (Guayasamin, 2010). - Centrolene geckoideum: at the time of assessment population decline estimated to be more than 30% over the next 10 years (Bolivar et al., 2004b). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 193 - Centrolene heloderma: at the time of assessment drastic population decline estimated to be more than 80% over the last three generations, inferred from the apparent disappearance of most of the population (Coloma et al., 2004). Of the four genera, Hyalinobatrachium has the widest distribution and is found in tropical forests of Central America, the tropical Andes, the Cordillera de la Costa de Venezuela, Tobago, the Upper Amazon Basin and the Guyana Shield. A total of 20 of the 36 species of Hyalinobatrachium are endemic (according to taxonomy in SS). Ten are native to Venezuela; Costa Rica, Colombia and French Guyana each have two endemic species; and Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana and Peru have one endemic species each.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a312e86e-3231-4ed2-b585-bf78081159b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a312e86e-3231-4ed2-b585-bf78081159b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ddeb1c35f7a7caeaeaa67f2dc318f499bee995baffd33360fe52a3f4efafcdb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5834b78-3786-42ff-a508-ba7b3bf6d41a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3292cf01fd3463237e97d815e641ea2f2fb5c5df5e8176415120569d3258e0c5"}}, "hash": "4bbdf5582330ca514ad82de32c6fdf56b6b68208dd842766209e24d5006fbf1d", "text": "The genus Centrolene is distributed from the Cordillera de Merida in Venezuela, through the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, to the Cordillera de Huancabamba in northern Peru.

Glass frogs are regularly offered via the internet and at European fairs of reptiles and amphibians, mainly the fair in Hamm, Germany, which takes place several times a year. It appears that online trade of Centrolene spp. is difficult to find even on rare amphibian trade platforms. Advertisements for Cochranella spp. and Sachatamia spp. can be found (however they do not appear to be common). Of the four genera it appears that advertisements for Hyalinobatrachium spp. are most commonly seen but advertise relatively low numbers of individuals (J. Janssen, in litt., 2019). Online searches for other genera of glass frogs excluded from this proposal revealed small numbers of Teratohyla spp. and Espadarana spp. advertised for sale (Terraristik, 2019). There is reported to be illegal trade in some of the species from certain countries. There have been no reported cases of legal or illegal trade from El Salvador but there is reported to be illegal trade in Costa Rica, and this could potentially pose a threat if it extends to other range States within the region (V. Henr\u00edquez in litt., 2019).

Reportedly threatened by habitat destruction but has been recorded in a number of protected areas (Sol\u00eds et al., IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 195 2010). Imports were reported as both Centrolene ilex and Sachatamia ilex and included specimens, bodies and eggs for educational and scientific purposes (US LEMIS Database). In 2014, a German citizen was captured in Costa Rica attempting to smuggle species including 20 S. ilex: prior to the seizure the smuggler\u2019s partner announced online several species of glass frogs to be sold at a fair in Germany. Espadarana (Centrolene) prosoblepon: If the taxonomy of Guayasamin et al., (2009) is accepted this species would fall outside the scope of this proposal. Espadarana prosoblepon was assessed as Least Concern in 2008 due to its wide distribution, presumed large population and because the population was thought to be stable. The species occurs in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. At the time of the assessment the species was considered common in some sites, and in others there had been declines. The major threats are deforestation for agricultural development, illegal crops, logging, and human settlement, and pollution resulting from the spraying of illegal crops. Recorded declines in Costa Rica might be due to the disease chytridiomycosis (Kubicki et al., 2010). A total of 57 wild-sourced specimens were imported into the USA between 2004-2017 for the purpose of commercial trade. Other imports included specimens and bodies for scientific and educational purposes (US LEMIS Database). Teratohyla (Cochranella) spinosa: If the taxonomy of Guayasamin et al., (2009) is accepted this species would fall outside the scope of this proposal. Teratohyla spinosa was assessed as Least Concern in 2008 and was considered at this time to have a wide distribution and presumed large population. The species occurs in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. In Colombia this species is considered common and it is regularly encountered in Costa Rica and Panama, whereas in Ecuador and Honduras it is considered uncommon. The major threats are deforestation for agricultural development, illegal crops, logging and human settlement and pollution resulting from the spraying of illegal crops (Coloma et al., 2010a). A total of six live wild-sourced specimens were imported into the USA between 2004-2017 for scientific and zoological purposes. Other imports included bodies and specimens for scientific purposes (US LEMIS Database). Cochranella granulosa: Assessed as Least Concern in 2008 and was considered at this time to have a wide distribution, presumed large population and tolerance to a degree of habitat modification. The species occurs in Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. It is regularly encountered in Costa Rica and considered to be common in Panama although there are few records from Honduras and Nicaragua (Sol\u00eds et al., 2010a). A total of 12 live wild-sourced specimens were imported into the USA between 2004-2017 for scientific and zoological purposes. Other imports included specimens, eggs and bodies for educational and scientific purposes (US LEMIS Database). Hyalinobatrachium aureoguttatum: Assessed as Near Threatened in 2008 and at this time the extent of occurrence for this species was believed to be no greater than 20,000 km2. This species was considered to be very common at the time of assessment but faced localised threats of habitat loss and fragmentation due to expanding agriculture, cultivation of illegal crops and water pollution. The species occurs in Colombia, Ecuador and Panama (Sol\u00eds et al., 2010b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3afbeb4-cf36-4b97-b857-15fa2d450675": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3afbeb4-cf36-4b97-b857-15fa2d450675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "335a568e2ad5bc562caf4ee13383cf449369321b346b589f45e0c7ea5592e5a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c0b6656-19cd-4a08-b0e5-f7848b4544a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a98b63aa55969b10f6fefdae313b66a522f000d9712f8f19477227bb70bf63e4"}}, "hash": "3ffdd29e76d0edadd4450d97e405c29eadf41d73fa18709707922310df4491f0", "text": "The species occurs in Colombia, Ecuador and Panama (Sol\u00eds et al., 2010b).

This species has been observed for sale at the Terraria far in the Netherlands and were offered for USD 50 each, and in Spain online advertisements offered a breeding pair for USD 120. According to the US LEMIS Database, a total of 842 live specimens were imported into the USA between 2004-2017 of which 639 were reported to be captive-bred and 203 wild-sourced, all for commercial purposes. Other imports included specimens and bodies for scientific and commercial purposes. Hyalinobatrachium valerioi: Assessed as Least Concern in 2008 and was considered at this time to have a wide distribution, presumed large population and a tolerance to a degree of habitat modification. The species range occurs in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Panama. It was reported at the time of assessment to be moderately rare and patchily distributed in Ecuador and Colombia although in Costa Rica the population was considered stable. Identified threats included deforestation for agricultural development and human settlement, illegal crops and water pollution (Sol\u00eds et al., 2008a). Between 2004-2017 a total of 50 live specimens were imported into the USA, all reported to be captive-bred (US LEMIS Database). This species has been observed for sale online; live specimens have been offered on Terraristik (www.terraristik.com) and in Spain individuals were advertised online for USD 100 each. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 196 Additional Information Threats The main threat to glass frogs is the loss of habitat and fragmentation due to smallholder and industrial agriculture, including livestock and illegal crops. Habitat loss has also increased due to activities such as logging, mining, construction of human settlements and hydroelectric plants. Moreover, water contamination with herbicides, pesticides and oil spills is also a major threat to glass frogs, along with the disease Chytridiomycosis. In addition, climate change poses a threat to the stability of glass frog populations. Conservation, management and legislation There are currently no management measures or population monitoring schemes for these species. These species are not protected by any international legislation. National legislation within the range States affords varying levels of protection; for most species their extraction from the wild for commercial purposes is either prohibited completely or requires a permit. For example, in Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama, trade is allowed if adequate permits are required. There is legislation that provides varying levels of protection for species within these genera in almost all their range States, however, there appears to be a gap in international efforts to curb illegal trade (V. Henr\u00edquez & F. S. \u00c1lvarez Calder\u00f3n, in litt., 2019). Artificial propagation/captive breeding Of the live individuals reportedly imported into the USA between 2004 and 2016, about 7% were recorded as captive-bred, and many of the individuals advertised on online forums are reported to be from captive-bred sources. The largest exporter of captive-bred specimens to the USA was Canada (74 individuals exported for the purpose of commercial trade). In some range States, captive breeding is taking place to supply commercial trade and benefit in situ conservation efforts. For example, the Costa Rican Amphibian Research Center has government approval which allows for the commercial export of limited numbers of animals to Canada (CRAC, 2019). Half of the proceeds from commercial sales are utilised to support in situ conservation projects (Understorey, 2019). Farms in Ecuador are producing Hyalinobatrachium aureoguttatum in captivity for the purpose of export - Wikiri is a company based in Ecuador which captive breeds some species of glass frogs for commercial purposes and is said to be the only Ecuadorian company that has been authorised to commercialize amphibians for national and international markets. In 2014 Wikiri began the commercialization of H. aureoguttatum in June 2014 and Sachatamia albomaculata in 2017 (L. Guarderas, in litt., 2019). Implementation challenges (including similar species) The taxonomic classification of glass frogs is the result of a very complex combination of 18 morphological characteristics and 7 ecological characteristics. The same attributes of the most obvious characteristics, such as size, dorsal coloration, partial or complete transparency of the peritoneum and the presence of the humeral spine, can be shared by several species of different genera.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fb36e2b-2ad1-4e5b-9c3b-1783910b54ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fb36e2b-2ad1-4e5b-9c3b-1783910b54ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7229fbd3cc889e8bf11f5c067dd72d8674c679de61d2058f6a85efc9e16b0b2c"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f467eaa-f0c7-4bc6-863f-e71af69adc10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d2af62e42a798ea5081a8c76520324fb8ce8c440f84fe39ae6259c733b82e0a"}}, "hash": "12137ce8b17e4d89338d4b77b9bec088133d1a60a8b923ab2209eddd40a1a90e", "text": "Therefore, the selection and distinction of the species of Hyalinobatrachium, Centrolene, Cochranella and Sachatamia is very difficult for non-experts.

One expert reported that many of the species within the family Centrolenidae appear to be morphologically distinct and considering the relatively small numbers that appear in trade, identification may not be an issue in terms of enforcement (L. Coloma., in litt., 2019). Searches for online advertisements of \u201cglass frogs\u201d find adverts for species from several other genera not included within this proposal, indicating there may be problems identifying the four proposed genera from other \u201cglass frogs\u201d. Guayasamin et al., (2009) note that \u201cthe morphological similarity between Centrolene and Espadarana is remarkable. At present, we are unaware of any single morphological character that would unambiguously differentiate species from the two clades\u201d. The genus Sachatamia cannot be morphologically differentiated from Rulyrana - however, the mitochondrial phylogeny indicates that Rulyrana and Sachatamia do not form a monophyletic group (Guayasamin et al., 2009). The continual changes to the taxonomy of Centrolenidae may also pose challenges in terms of implementation, as species may be moved in/out of the genera subject to this proposal depending on taxonomic revisions. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 197 Potential risk(s) of a listing This proposal includes only four of the 11/12 genera within the family Centrolenidae. There is a risk that demand may shift to non-listed genera should the proposal be adopted (or that specimens of species from the listed genera are mis-named as non-listed species to facilitate trade). The listing of species within the family Centrolenidae on Appendix II could halt or hinder conservation efforts, research and sustainable management of species (L. Coloma, in litt., 2019) and has the potential to discourage research and field investigations which could inform and prioritise conservation efforts (Mrosovsky, 1988). Potential benefit(s) of listing for trade regulation There are legal tools for the conservation of these species in most of the range States, however international efforts in regulating trade and regional consistency in the protection of glass frogs could provide potential conservation benefits (V. Henr\u00edquez & F. S. \u00c1lvarez Calder\u00f3n, in litt., 2019). An Appendix II listing could benefit sustainable harvest/captive breeding operations which could deter unsustainable collection and smuggling (S. Chng, in litt., 2019). References BioWeb. (2019).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 Inclusion of Spiny Newts Echinotriton chinhaiensis and Echinotriton maxiquadratus in Appendix II Proponent: China Summary: The genus Echinotriton contains three species of spiny newts: E. chinhaiensis and E. maxiquadratus which are endemic to China, and E. andersoni which is now only found in Japan and is not included in this proposal. Echinotriton chinhaiensis Adult E. chinhaiensis are terrestrial and inhabit forests in low hills. The adult population was estimated to be around 300 mature individuals in 2004, and one of the three known subpopulations (the type locality) may have been extirpated. The habitat of E. chinhaiensis was estimated to total around 50 km2 in 1999 and 30 km2 in 2004 and is greatly fragmented. While part of the species\u2019 range is within protected areas, some of its range is being degraded by human activities (agriculture, pollution, tourism). Echinotriton chinhaiensis was assessed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List (2004) due to its limited distribution, all individuals being in a single location, the low number of subpopulations, and continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat. The number of breeding females reduced from 107 in 1999 to 82 in 2000 and 47 in 2008. The species is vulnerable to weather events such as typhoons and floods, which have caused a decline in the population. A number of attempts at ex-situ conservation have been made; individuals were collected from the wild and more than 800 larvae were released in 1998. The species is protected in the wild, meaning the hunting, catching or killing, as well as the sale and purchase or utilisation of the species and their products, is strictly prohibited within China. Records of the species in trade appear to be limited to low numbers observed for sale (two in a pet store in Japan, and a trader in Hong Kong SAR posting a picture on social media of at least five) and some discussion on online forums which could indicate demand. Echinotriton maxiquadratus This species was only described in 2014 and has not yet been assessed by IUCN. Like E. chinhaiensis, the species is considered to have a very small wild population with a restricted distribution; one expert stated it was known from two restricted areas of approximately 10 to 20 km\u00b2 with populations each estimated to be less than 100 - 150 individuals. It faces many of the same threats as E. chinhaiensis, but due to its recent discovery little is known on population trends.

Little is known about the trade of this species, but due to the species\u2019 rarity it is highly likely to be in demand. One expert is aware of several specimens apparently being kept outside of China. Echinotrition maxiquadratus is morphologically very similar to E. chinhaiensis. Analysis: The endemic spiny newt E. chinhaiensis has a very restricted, fragmented range in China (around 30 km2) and is estimated to have a very small wild population (less than 400 adults) which is decreasing. It is known to be in demand for the hobbyist trade, although the species is protected in the wild. The species may already meet the biological criteria for inclusion in Appendix I and therefore would appear likely to meet the criteria for inclusion in Appendix II under criterion 2aA of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Less is known about the recently described E. maxiquadratus, but it appears to face a similar challenge of a very small wild population and very restricted range and is not yet protected (though part of its range is within protected areas). The possibility of trade seems high due to its recent discovery and rarity, and therefore also meets criterion 2aA for inclusion in Appendix II. Other Considerations: Echinotriton chinhaiensis is protected in its only range State and any trade is already illegal, so if this proposal is accepted China could publish a zero-export wild quota on the CITES website to reflect national legislation. An Appendix II listing may help close the apparent loophole of specimens being illegally exported via Hong Kong SAR where they are not protected. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 200 Japan may wish to list the third species in the genus, E. andersoni, in Appendix III to monitor any potentially increased trade in this species as a result of the other two species being listed. It is reportedly difficult to differentiate Echinotriton and Tylototriton (the latter genus is also subject to a listing proposal (Prop. 41)). If one proposal is accepted then the other could be accepted for inclusion in Appendix II under criterion 2bA for look-alike reasons. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Taxonomy There are three known species in the genus Echinotriton. The proposal includes the two species that are endemic to China, E. chinhaiensis and E. maxiquadratus. Echinotriton andersoni (native to Japan (an old record exists for Taiwan Province of China where the species is now presumed extinct (Kaneko & Matsui, 2004)) is not included in this proposal. The genus of Echinotriton has a disjunct geographic distribution. Echinotriton chinhaiensis was originally named as Tylototriton chinhaiensis when it was discovered and described in 1932. Synonyms include: Echinotriton chinhaiensis: T. chinhaiensis; Pleurodeles chinhaiensis. Echinotriton maxiquadratus was described in 2014, and is morphologically very similar to E. chinhaiensis.

More recently, the population was assessed nationally as critically endangered (Jiang et al., 2016). A new population was discovered in the Shashan Mountains (Ningbo County) in 2014, but this area became a construction site and 80% of it was destroyed in 2015 (Hernandez, 2016). In 2004 the global population was estimated at less than 300 individuals (Feng & Huiqing, 2004). The Ruiyansi population was estimated at 318 to 369 in 1998 and 1999 (in Ruiyansi Forest Park (Hernandez, 2016)): the number of adults was estimated to be 296 with a density of 9.87 individuals/km2 based on capture-recapture of females surveyed from 1997 to 1999. The SS states that the subpopulation in the type locality has gone extinct, although one expert says it has not extirpated and has been protected (J. Jiang, in litt., 2019). More recent surveys place the total adult population at 200 (Hernandez, 2016). The population of E. chinhaiensis has declined due to weather disasters like typhoons in 2007 and freezing in 2008, tourism development and crop planting. The fecundity in 2008 is less than 50% of that from 1998 to 2000: the number of breeding females greatly reduced, with 107 in 1999, 82 in 2000 and 47 in 2008. Recent surveys have shown that the number of nests of eggs found in Ruiyansi Timberland each year varies over 2015-2018 (82 nests in 2015, 33 in 2016, 32 in 2017 and 88 in 2018). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 201 Observations of captive animals suggest that the species is late-maturing, and long-lived with lifespans at least 20 years. Echinotriton chinhaiensis has been found in Hong Kong SAR and Japan in the illegal trade. Two live E. chinhaiensis were found to be sold in a pet store in Japan with prices as high as USD 1,400 per individual. One expert has observed photos of the species on the Facebook page of a Hong Kong SAR exporter, which totalled at least five individuals, apparently all wild-caught (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). The two species are not protected in Hong Kong SAR as they are only found in mainland China, therefore it appears the newts are being smuggled into Hong Kong SAR where they can then be exported legally (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). There is demand for this species as a pet in the USA and EU based on internet searches (detailed in the SS) and also Japan (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). Illegal collection of E. chinhaiensis was reported in 2011. Some scientific institutions and universities both in China and abroad have collected specimens of E. chinhaiensis with the approval of the authorities. Very few individuals have been collected and raised by animal collectors in China (but see the SS which details a case). Echinotriton maxiquadratus Lives in low depressions near the tops of mountains in north-east Guangdong Province. The species was described based on a single holotype, an adult female collected in southern China in November 2013. Echinotriton maxiquadratus is clustered at mtDNA level with E. chinhaiensis, and the two species are geographically separated by 600 - 1,000 km (Hernandez, 2016). Some of the habitats of E. maxiquadratus are located inside a provincial nature reserve and protected areas. However, the habitat quality is reducing, and the habitat area is gradually decreasing due to the effect of commercial plantations and tourism in the surrounding mountains. Increasing climate warming may induce further loss of habitat of the species. Echinotriton maxiquadratus is native to two mountains in south-eastern China: the second locality was found later in July 2015 during a field study, and is considered very sparsely populated (Hernandez, 2016).

This species was unknown to science and even local people for a surprisingly long time despite dense human population and heavy human activity in this region, suggesting a very small population size. Experts believe it is highly likely that the new species will be pursued by hobbyists and pet dealers due to its rarity (Hou et al., 2014). Available information suggests it occurs only in two very restricted areas of approximately 10 \u2013 20 km\u00b2 each with populations of less than 100 - 150 individuals (Hernandez, 2016). The population trend is not clear for E. maxiquadratus since it is newly discovered. The species might face similar threats as E. chinhaiensis, and the population appears to be reducing based on the results of field surveys. The quality and area of habitat are gradually decreasing due to the effect of agricultural pollution, agricultural and forest industry and tourism revealed by surveys in 2011. Human activities are increasing in the surrounding forests of the known distribution sites of E. maxiquadratus. Echinotriton chinhaiensis and E. maxiquadratus are similar in biological characteristics, especially in their reproductive biology such as low fecundity and reproductive success and their specific spawning microhabitat requirements. Although no trade has been recorded for the newly discovered E. maxiquadratus, the possibility of illegal hunting and trade is high. For this reason, authors of E. maxiquadratus concealed the locality information, urged all hobbyists to refrain from collecting and boycott any trade. There have been unverified records of illegal hunting and collection with prices as high as RMB5,000 [USD 736] per individual. One expert noted that a few individuals are apparently being kept by a French amphibian keeper who displayed photos on their Facebook page (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). The only known specimen of E. maxiquadratus (female) which was used to describe the morphology of the species is kept in Shenyang Normal University. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 39 202 Additional Information Threats Along with threats from illegal collection, the decline in habitat quality, fragmentation and the loss of reproductive ponds are the main threats. Natural disasters like typhoons also threaten the species\u2019 habitats. Conservation, management and legislation The hunting, catching or killing, as well as the sale and purchase or utilisation of the species and their products, are strictly prohibited according to the 1989 listing in the second class of the List of Wildlife under Special State Protection of China. There are special exemptions e.g. for scientific research which need permission from the provincial wildlife conservation authorities. A small nature reserve with an area of 8.7km2 around Runyansi Timberland was established in 1996. As E. maxiquadratus is newly discovered it is not included in any conservation list. However, some of its range is within a nature reserve where the illegal harvest of any individuals is prohibited. Artificial Propagation/captive breeding A number of attempts at ex-situ conservation have been made; E. chinhaiensis individuals were collected from the wild and more than 800 larvae were released into the wild in original nature reserves after hatching in 1998. Zhejiang Chaiqiao Middle School have conducted research on artificially assisted hatching and metamorphosis since 2008 and released more than 100 larvae of E. chinhaiensis into the Ruiyansi Timberland. Implementation challenges (including similar species) Echinotriton chinhaiensis was originally named as Tylototriton chinhaiensis. While Echinotriton can be differentiated from members of Tylototriton by having sharp-tipped ribs that penetrate the enlarged dorsolateral warts (they do not penetrate in Tylototriton), it is difficult for non-specialists to differentiate between Tylototriton and Echinotriton (M. van Schingen., in litt., 2019). Echinotriton andersoni, which is not included in this proposal and is not included in the Appendices, is distributed in the Ryukyu Islands (Japan) (and formally Taiwan Province of China (Kaneko & Matsui, 2004)) and has the key feature of two longitudinal rows of warts on each side of the back, inner row small and sparse.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 40 Inclusion of Asian Warty Newts Paramesotriton spp. endemic to China and Viet Nam in Appendix II Proponents: China and European Union Summary: This proposal is for the inclusion of all species of the genus Paramesotriton endemic to Viet Nam and China in Appendix II, with the exception of P. hongkongensis, which is already included in Appendix II. All currently described species in the genus are endemic to southern China and northern Viet Nam. In the past 15 years the number of described species in the genus has doubled and the updated version of the CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference for newts recognises 14 species. Each species is thought to have a restricted distribution and to only occur in a few, small known populations. Sexual maturity is normally reached at between three and seven years (sometimes up to 10 years). They are found in or close to forest streams; the adults of some species can be found in water all year round while others become particularly aquatic during the breeding season. Information on the population size and status of many of the species is lacking. Six of the 14 currently described species have been assessed on the IUCN Red List (one as Endangered, one Vulnerable, two Near Threatened and two Least Concern). Most of these assessments were conducted in 2004 and require updating. Based on China\u2019s Red Data List (2016), of the ten species that were assessed, four were endangered and three vulnerable. Wild populations are threatened by habitat loss (deforestation and infrastructure development) and some species are exploited for the Traditional Asian Medicine, food and pet trades.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e688da4-6722-48ce-a36b-cd33598e73db": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e688da4-6722-48ce-a36b-cd33598e73db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98799fb43e28aedb3137f88c0a7bf5bd817d937f7fe992957362d55c64555a9b"}, "2": {"node_id": "f268f50f-d546-46ed-bab6-544180ec44f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12f822a10d4940ee5e0a4f13e70e60b1d2bbb0abdda2efa05ceef8549611d0e2"}}, "hash": "0f833d5488c50302cd0b2abfed213ee1ef3a01f99052403b5ae0f1613e06f199", "text": "Paramesotriton hongkongensis was listed in Appendix II at CoP17, although no trade has been reported for this species in the CITES Trade Database to date.

At the time of the Red List assessment, Pachytriton labiatus was considered to have a wide distribution and presumed large, though declining, population. Over-exploitation for use in traditional Chinese medicine and for the international pet trade was identified a major threat, as was habitat destruction and degradation. - Paramesotriton chinensis: Endemic to China, recent research has concluded this species actually encompasses a number of different lineages (e.g. P. longliensis, P. yunwuensis, P. fuzhongensis, P. labiatus, P. qixilingensis), and many Paramesotriton species recognised in the CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference still enter the international trade as IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 40 204 P. chinensis. It was nationally assessed as near threatened in 2016. Imports of 1,100 live P. chinensis were reported into the EU from 2009-2017 (source unspecified), and 1,400 live into the USA from 2007-2013 (1,100 wild). Paramesotriton chinensis was assessed as Least Concern in 2004 and was considered common but the population was declining. At the time of assessment, the international pet trade was not reported to be a threat. It is also kept as a pet in China. Other more threatened species were reported in lesser quantities in trade (although they may have been reported under incorrect names either because they were mis-identified or because the species had not been described at the time): - Paramesotriton fuzhongensis: Endemic to China. The species was assessed by IUCN as Vulnerable in 2004 as at the time the extent of occurrence was less than 20,000 km2, with all individuals in fewer than ten locations, and there was a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat and in the number of mature individuals. At the time of the Red List assessment it was considered rare and the population to be declining. Habitat loss and over- harvesting for the pet trade were identified as major threats). However, the current status is unknown. Nationally it was considered vulnerable in 2016. Many specimens reported as P. chinensis in trade were believed to be mis-identified P. fuzhongensis. Although no trade data are available, the species has been observed for sale in Europe. - Paramesotriton guangxiensis: Endemic to China and Viet Nam, P. guangxiensis was assessed in 2004 as Endangered since the area of occupancy was less than 500 km2, none of which was within protected areas. The Chinese population was assessed as endangered in 2016. Wild specimens have been observed for sale in pet shops in Viet Nam (including animals originating from China). Paramesotriton guangxiensis was formerly treated as a synonym of the morphologically similar P. deloustali. - Paramesotriton zhijinensis: Endemic to China, P. zhijinensis is considered to have a restricted range. While it has not yet been assessed by IUCN (it was described in 2008), it was nationally assessed as endangered in 2016. No information on trade could be found, although the species resembles P. chinensis so may be traded under that name. Species identification is difficult - especially if animals are traded in a dried state for traditional medicine. Imports into the EU and USA are reported to be frequently labelled incorrectly (as P. hongkongensis or P. chinensis). Whilst it does appear possible to distinguish P. hongkongensis from other similar species based on morphological characteristics, identification by non-experts may be difficult. The genus is relatively understudied and future taxonomic work is likely to lead to more species being described.

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 40 205 Morphological identification of species in this genus is considered to be difficult or even impossible by a non-specialist. Although it is probably possible to differentiate some species when traded live, this is likely much more difficult for dried specimens. It is reported to be difficult for non-experts to identify some Paramesotriton species from P. hongkongensis, which is already listed in Appendix II, so these species may meet the look-alike criterion in 2bA. The proponents state that they wish to include all species in the genus that are endemic to China and Viet Nam. However, based on past convention it would seem more logical to list Paramesotriton spp. (populations of China and Viet Nam), which would not be expanding the scope of the proposal and would mean that if a species\u2019 range was found to extend outside of China/Viet Nam, the national populations in China/Viet Nam would still be covered. Other Considerations: As some species are nationally protected and thus trade is illegal, the range State concerned could put in place a voluntary zero quota listed on the CITES website for those species and empower re-exporting and importing Parties to assist with enforcing the law. Due to the evolving taxonomy of Paramesotriton, there is potential for the current CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference to become out of date. The CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference used for the newt species currently listed in CITES is Frost (2015). CoP18 Doc. 99 recommends a change to a 2017 version of Frost which recognises all 14 species of Paramesotriton currently described. Summary of Available Information Text in non-italics is based on information in the Proposal and Supporting Statement (SS); text in italics is based on additional information and/or assessment of information in the SS. Taxonomy The CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference for the newts currently listed in the CITES Appendices is the Taxonomic Checklist of Amphibian Species extracted from Frost (2015). As this checklist is an online resource constantly being updated, it is not possible to immediately confirm how many species of Paramesotriton were recognised in 2015. However, one species in the genus Paramesotriton has been described since the checklist was extracted in 2015 (P. aurantius (2016)). The current version recognises the 14 species listed in the table below (Frost, 2019) as does the 2017 version recommended as the new Standard Reference (see AC29. Doc. 35 Annex and CoP18 Doc. 99).

They are relatively slow breeders, reaching sexual maturity on average at three to 10 years. As Paramesotriton spp. generally form large breeding groups in breeding pools, high numbers can be collected from known sites during breeding season with minimal effort. The trade of this genus includes mainly live or dried animals, as well as animals soaked in alcohol. In China they are consumed as food and traditional medicine, and for the domestic pet trade. In Viet Nam they are collected for use as traditional medicine and the domestic pet trade. The international pet trade has been identified as an increasing pressure, although the volume of harvest for pets compared with traditional medicine is unknown but likely to be lower. Species of Paramesotriton have been very regularly available as wild-caught animals in the European pet trade over the past 20 years (although currently far fewer given legislation to restrict the spread of disease (BSal) (F. Pasmans, in litt., 2019). Usually the price for adults is higher than for juveniles; females may reach higher prices than males. Evidence suggests that the level of harvest of Paramesotriton is far higher than the limited numbers in trade statistics might suggest. There is evidence for illegal trade occurring within each range country, between range States and into the international market. Imports to the USA involved just over 38,000 individuals of Paramesotriton between 2000 and 2016, of which 50% were wild caught. The majority of these animals were traded live (90%), for commercial purposes (97%), but also for educational and scientific uses (3%). A more detailed investigation of imports of live Paramesotriton into the USA over a shorter time period (between 2007-2013) showed that of the live animals imported (almost 17,700), the most highly traded species were Paramesotriton labiatus (48%) (reported as Pachytriton labiatus), P. hongkongensis (43%) and P. chinensis (8%), and the remaining 1% comprised P. caudopunctatus, P. deloustali, Laotriton laoensis (reported as Paramesotriton laoensis) and Paramesotriton spp. Around half of imports (54%) were reported as being from the wild, of which the majority were P. labiatus (all of which were reported as wild) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS Database). According to the CITES Trade Database, imports of live Paramesotriton into the EU between 2009 and 2017 totalled 1,621, all of which were reported as P. chinensis (68%), P. labiatus (32%) and P. hongkongensis (<1%). Several species known to be threatened and/or in international trade are discussed further below: Paramesotriton labiatus: Endemic to China. Paramesotriton labiatus was still recognised as Pachytriton labiatus in the most recent IUCN assessment (2004) as Paramesotriton labiatus was only recognised in 2011. The Taxonomic Checklist of Amphibian Species recognises Paramesotriton labiatus as a species, but not Pachytriton labiatus (Frost, 2015). Pachytriton labiatus was assessed as Least Concern as at the time it was considered to have a wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it was unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. It was said to be a relatively common species, although the population was decreasing. Over-exploitation for use in traditional Chinese medicine and for the international pet trade were considered major threats to this species, as was habitat destruction and degradation (Huiqing & Zhigang, 2004). However, current status is unknown. Several protected areas are present within its range. It is consumed in China as food and used as pets locally as well as nationally, and also used in traditional medicine locally. Local inhabitants may sell them as juvenile Chinese Giant Salamander Andrias davidianus (AmphibiaWeb, 2015).

Ye et al. (1993) noted the collection of several hundred thousand P. chinensis and related species for export during a field survey in eastern China, although it is not known what the \u201crelated\u201d species were. The 2004 IUCN Red List assessment notes that small numbers were exported for the international pet trade, though probably not at a level to constitute a threat to the species at that time (Huiqing et al., 2004). According to the CITES Trade Database, imports of 1,095 live P. chinensis have been reported into the EU (predominantly from China and Hong Kong SAR) since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009 (source of specimens not specified). Imports into the USA between 2007 and 2013 included 1,401 live P. chinensis (US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database). In the USA prices for an adult were around USD 10 and rose to USD 40 in 2016, whereas in Europe an adult costs about USD 12. Paramesotriton caudopunctatus: Endemic to central China. Assessed as Near Threatened in 2004 because its Extent of Occurrence was probably not much greater than 20,000 km2, and the extent and quality of its habitat were probably declining, thus making the species close to qualifying for Vulnerable. At the time it was said to be a very common species, but the population was decreasing, although it was reported that it may occur more widely than thought previously (Zhigang & Lau, 2004). Several protected areas are present within the range. In China P. caudopunctatus is collected from the wild to be used both locally and nationally in traditional medicine and as pets. The SS states it to be one of the most commonly advertised species, and wild specimens were offered for sale in the UK. The species is reportedly difficult to breed although it is known to have been successfully bred. This species is affected by habitat destruction and degradation for dam construction and subsistence wood collecting, and also by harvesting for use in traditional medicine and international pet trade (Sparreboom, 2014). In 2004 it was noted that small numbers were exported for the international pet trade, though probably not at a level to constitute a threat to the species at the time (Zhigang & Lau, 2004). Imports into the USA between 2007 and 2013 were limited to two scientific specimens from Viet Nam (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database). Paramesotriton deloustali: Endemic to Viet Nam but may extend into southern China. The species was assessed as Least Concern in 2017 as it was considered relatively widespread, although the population size was not known; however the population was thought to be declining due to habitat loss, logging, collection for trade (traditional medicine and pet) and pollution (IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2017). The species is considered endangered in the Vietnam Red Data Book in 1992 (Sparreboom, 2014). Imports into the USA between 2007 and 2013 totalled eight live P. deloustali reported as originating from Viet Nam (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database). The SS states it to be one of the most commonly advertised species, and in 2018 the species was observed for sale in several pet shops in a number of Vietnamese cities, with new stock available each year around breeding season, and recent online prices were USD 7. The species has also been offered for sale in Germany and has been bred in captivity. Paramesotriton guangxiensis was formerly treated as a synonym of P. deloustali. Paramesotriton fuzhongensis: Endemic to China. Listed as Vulnerable (2004) as at the time its extent of occurrence was less than 20,000 km2, with all individuals in fewer than ten locations, and there was a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat and in the number of mature individuals.

Paramesotriton guangxiensis: Apart from its type locality in China and one other location in Guangxi, China, it has been reported from northern Viet Nam (Sparreboom, 2014). The species was assessed in 2004 as Endangered and the current population is said to be declining. Estimates in 2004 calculated an extent of occurrence of less than 5,000 km2, and area of occurrence of less than 500 km2, but the assessment only included the Chinese populations. The major threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture. The range in China is not included within any protected area, but part of its distribution in Viet Nam is under protection. A recent survey in 2018 found P. guangxiensis for sale at several pet shops in Ha Noi, Ho Chi IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 40 208 Minh City and Bien Hoa, Dong Nai Province with new stock being available every year around the species\u2019 breeding season, when animals can most easily be collected from the wild (the SS details offers for sale in Viet Nam at USD 15 each). In Viet Nam, P. guangxiensis appears less in the trade than the morphological similar P. deloustali and is sold for higher prices. One pet shop in the south of Viet Nam informed that the origin of P. guangxiensis previously in stock had Chinese and not Vietnamese origin, showing a complex trade network (the trade between range countries occurs usually in the direction of China). The SS also states it to be one of the most commonly advertised species. Paramesotriton maolanensis: Endemic to China where it is known only from a single 60 m\u00b2 pool. Paramesotriton yunwuensi: Endemic to China, this species is known only from a single mountain chain. The species has not been assessed on the IUCN Red List; it is considered to meet the criteria of Near Threatened (Wu et al., 2010) although the authors did not state under which criteria. At the type locality (a scenic park) local people collect and sell this species to tourists as juveniles of Chinese giant salamander Andrias davidianus, which is probably not sustainable (Sparreboom, 2014). They are also probably consumed as food. Paramesotriton zhijinensis: This species is endemic to China, and is known from only one artificial pond fed by a subterranean spring of warm water, and also from slow-flowing, shallow streams. It has not yet been assessed by the IUCN Red List, however due to its apparent restricted range it is \u201cprobably very vulnerable\u201d (Sparreboom, 2014). Inclusion in Appendix II to improve control of other listed species A) Specimens in trade resemble those of species listed in Appendix II under Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2 a or listed in Appendix I Non-experts may find it difficult to distinguish P. hongkongensis (Appendix II) from other similar species in the genus (IUCN and TRAFFIC, 2016). At least two species (P. labiatus and P. yunwuensi) are known to be sold locally as juvenile Chinese Giant Salamanders Andrias davidianus, which has been listed in Appendix I since 1975. However, there is no information to suggest that this trade is international. Additional Information Threats The economic development and human population growth in the region has led to an increased consumption of natural resources (e.g. logging), associated with habitat loss and degradation, and increased construction of infrastructures (e.g. water dams, roads). Suitable habitats for Paramesotriton will likely decrease further in the future. Slash and burn practices for substitution with more profitable plants (e.g. paper industry or agriculture), dam constructions and pollution, are also common throughout the distribution range and thus affect habitat suitability for Paramesotriton.

Some species do not occur in any protected area (e.g. P. guangxiensis). Species in the genera native to mainland China but not Hong Kong SAR are not protected in Hong Kong SAR, therefore it appears the newts are being smuggled from mainland China into Hong Kong SAR from where they can then be exported legally to destination countries (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). EU Decision 2018/320 (came into effect in 2018) requires that all members of the order Caudata that are imported into the EU must be held in quarantine post-importation in an appropriate establishment, and that when being moved between EU countries they must be held in an appropriate establishment under the supervision of the competent authority, immediately prior to their exportation. The new rules seek to stop the spread of the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 40 209 fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) which can be spread to native species and cause morbidity and mortality (CEFAS, 2018). In 2016 the USA listed 201 salamander species as \u201cinjurious wildlife\u201d under the Lacey Act due to concerns over importing Bsal, including all species in the genus Paramesotriton. This means importation into the USA is prohibited (there are some exceptions e.g. scientific research, zoos) (USFWS, 2016). Artificial Propagation/captive breeding Although present in the pet trade, accurate information on captive breeding of Paramesotriton remains limited. Paramesotriton caudopunctatus, P. chinensis, P. deloustali, P. fuzhongensis and P. labiatus have successfully been bred in captivity \u2013 however, no published evidence has been found on captive breeding of the remaining species. Most species are reportedly difficult to keep (e.g. P. fuzhongensis) and breed (e.g. P. chinensis and P. caudopunctatus). Animals show aggressive behaviour and sensitivity to stress and need specific environmental conditions. Paramesotriton are problematic in captivity due to their sensitivity to stress (Sparreboom, 2014). One group of experts noted that even when kept in captivity by knowledgeable and conscientious terrarium keepers, many of these animals will die in their first year of captivity, and to their knowledge very few keepers in Europe had managed to establish self-sustaining captive breeding colonies of Paramesotriton \u2013 at least partly because of the availability of cheap wild imports and late age of maturity which means captive breeding is less attractive (Sparreboom, in litt., to Shenyang Normal University, 2015). Implementation challenges (including similar species) Species identification within the genus is difficult due to morphological similarities between species including P. hongkongensis - especially if animals are traded in dried state for traditional medicine. Recent imports continue to misclassify these species, sometimes deliberately since rare and new species can be sold for a high price. In the past, several shipments were imported into the EU and USA with misnamed specimens (e.g. as P. chinensis), where the shipments actually contained a large variety of species, including rare and threatened ones (F. Pasmans, in litt., 2019). Paramesotriton species imported into the EU are mainly reported as P. hongkongensis or P. chinensis (M. van Schingen., in litt., 2019). The genera Pachytriton and Paramesotriton have had a confused taxonomic history, complicated by the fact that a number of these salamanders have long been in the pet trade, identified as Paddle-tailed and Warty Newts, respectively (AmphibiaWeb, 2015). Paramesotriton spp. are difficult (not to say impossible in most cases) to identify from each other without application of genetic tools. Genetic identification is necessary in most if not in all cases, as morphological variation is still poorly understood and not all cryptic taxa discovered. Thus, confusion of very rare, endemic species with more widely occurring taxa is very common (T. Ziegler, in litt., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3a51d87-e4d9-4747-8ed0-15849352ddf9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3a51d87-e4d9-4747-8ed0-15849352ddf9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b26b9b74a6316b4a48bd4af87f7dd522a18a957175c21eff9b7a40efbb2a8f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7f7d72c-9027-406a-915a-122973e069ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c9bebfecf03653f09045f2e72176475a5dd4f093bf2254aed78dce394cd2bb0"}}, "hash": "abe87f000e6bc136aa9393602bb6a8ed943db2b67d8b3ace44d2b2839f062f46", "text": "Paramesotriton can be differentiated from Tylototriton (F.

Their taxonomy is rapidly evolving, and the number of described species has increased threefold to 24 since 2010. Twenty species are thought to be endemic to one country and are mainly considered to be of restricted range and consist of few, small known populations, although it is likely that due to their cryptic nature the range of certain species is larger than currently known. Several currently recognised species are considered morphological complexes that may contain multiple species with smaller ranges. Sexual maturation is reached at between three and five years, and clutches usually consist of less than 100 eggs. Seasonally they accumulate in breeding pools which leaves them susceptible to capture for the domestic and international pet and traditional medicine trades. Outside of the breeding season, adults and juveniles are mostly terrestrial and fossorial. Thirteen of the species have been assessed on the IUCN Red List (two as Endangered, five as Vulnerable, three as Near Threatened, and three as Least Concern). Of the 14 species assessed on China\u2019s Red List (2016), six are threatened and seven near threatened. There is little population information for many species, although most are considered to be declining as a result of habitat loss and degradation (especially around breeding sites), unsustainable harvest and other factors. It appears that at least some of the species are being impacted by international trade. The genus has been listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2009. Available international trade data are restricted predominantly to live animals exported to Europe and the USA for pets,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d498e55-7b84-4042-8853-b9db46f55d56": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d498e55-7b84-4042-8853-b9db46f55d56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34af00dc838c477a7bec1f71b7d315c4ac76b7f9087cbc9d8b76753cc47efa8d"}, "3": {"node_id": "bdd48cc3-6311-463e-8ae9-a1ebdec1a664", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f20f1334b9266159eed1297ff54f614e96affedfda1f0439f5913ab23496bac0"}}, "hash": "57a42bf27c3dfc989f101c2576af9c736c73e09d078af2724e0ffb7c2bde7041", "text": "and do not capture the volume of harvest and trade for traditional medicine in Asia, or the domestic food or pet market, which appears to be significant for some species. Some of the species are protected within range States, and commercial imports into the EU and the USA (two of the major markets for the pet trade) have been prohibited since 2018 and 2016 respectively due to concerns over the spread of disease. Illegal harvest and trade have been reported. Captive breeding is possible for some species, but the extent to which this is happening appears to be limited to date. Key species reported in trade (mainly as live) to the major markets of Europe and the USA include T. kweichowensis and T. verrucosus (considered a morphological complex), which are discussed below: - Tylototriton kweichowensis is endemic to China and was assessed as Vulnerable in 2004 due to a restricted area of occupancy (<2,000 km2) which was fragmented and declining. The number of mature individuals was also said to be declining. T. kweichowensis were imported in large numbers into Europe in the 1990s, and although captive breeding has occurred it is not clear on what scale. T. kweichowensis was the species of this genus reportedly imported into the EU in the greatest quantity (850 individuals) since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009. A further 1,130 wild and 350 captive-bred T. kweichowensis were imported into the USA between 2007 and 2013. Habitat destruction and degradation are major threats to this species, and it is also collected for use in traditional Chinese medicine. - Tylototriton verrucosus was previously considered to be widely distributed but is now believed to comprise other related species with significantly smaller ranges and fewer populations. T. verrucosus was assessed as Least Concern in 2004, but this could change if future taxonomic revisions split the species. It was assessed as near threatened in China (2016). T. verrucosus was the species of this genus reportedly imported into the USA in the highest numbers (5,031 wild and 40 captive-bred live individuals between 2007 and 2013), is IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 212 commonly advertised for sale (in China, Europe and the USA), and was imported into Europe in the 1960s in large quantities for medical research (although these imports likely comprised other species not yet described). Some populations are highly threatened by habitat loss and degradation. A number of other (often newly described) species with limited ranges and/or smaller populations have also been observed in trade. While there is little or no data on imports of these species into the EU or USA (suggesting the scale is less than T. kweichowensis and T. verrucosus, trade but potentially could have a greater impact if they are range-restricted/smaller populations) some specimens may have been traded under incorrect names. Examples of these include: - Tylototriton lizhenchangi is an endemic with a restricted distribution described in 2012, and although not yet assessed on the IUCN Red List, it was nationally assessed as vulnerable (2016). One expert stated that intensive collection following its formal description had reduced the wild populations close to extinction (large adult individuals were already difficult to find in 2014 and 2015). No legal imports were reported into the EU (although it was offered for sale in Germany) or the USA (although it may have been imported under \u201cTylototriton spp.\u201d). - Tylototriton vietnamensis, assessed as Endangered in 2016, has an estimated extent of occurrence of 1,345 km2 and appears to be an uncommon species with small and fragmented populations. Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve and Yen Tu Landscape Protection Area were reported to harbour the largest population of this species, and a survey of all known breeding sites in the Reserve in 2010 found 216 individuals. Unsustainable harvest is reported to be a threat to this species, in addition to intensive deforestation, climate change, and erratic rainfall.

No legal imports were reported into the EU (although it was offered for sale in Portugal and Spain) or the USA (although it may have been imported under \u201cTylototriton spp.\u201d). - Tylototriton yangi is endemic to China and reported to be highly threatened by overharvest for the terrarium trade; a year after its discovery in 2012, specimens were reported to be exported to Europe and the USA in significant numbers, which was greatly reducing wild populations. One expert has observed considerable population declines since 2014, and thousands are reported to be exported illegally. The species has not yet been assessed by IUCN, but is nationally assessed as near threatened (2016). Many Tylototriton species are considered morphological complexes (e.g. T. verrucosus, T. shanjing and T. asperrimus) and morphological identification is considered difficult or even impossible by a non-specialist. In addition, there is great morphological variation between individuals of the same species. Species are frequently traded using an incorrect name, either erroneously or deliberately. It is also said to be difficult for non-specialists to differentiate between Tylototriton and Echinotriton (two species in the latter genus are also proposed for inclusion in Appendix II; see CoP18 Prop. 39). The genus is relatively understudied and future taxonomic work is likely to lead to more species being described. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 213 Analysis: There is little information available on the wild populations of many species of Tylototriton, although they are generally believed to have small and probably declining ranges, and small population sizes. Habitat loss and degradation is a significant threat. Species are used for traditional medicine in Asia, for some species it is thought this could be in significant volumes, although no quantitative information is available. Regarding the pet trade, it was thought that the USA and European markets were the largest, although this may no longer be the case as imports into both are now restricted due to concerns over disease. Some species have shown declines likely caused by overharvest (including but not limited to T. lizhenchangi, T. vietnamensis and T. yangi), and although it is not known what proportion were used domestically for traditional medicine (or pets) versus the international pet trade, significant numbers have been recorded in the latter. There appears to be a pattern of new species being described and then impacted by international trade, although some have likely been in trade previously but under a different name. Certain species already appear to meet the biological criteria for Appendix I (including but not limited to T. lizhenchangi, T. vietnamensis, T. wenxianensis and T. yangi) based on apparent marked declines, restricted ranges and/or small wild populations that are declining, and therefore meet the Appendix II 2a criterion. For other species, there is insufficient information to determine whether the criteria are met. However, since morphological identification in this group is considered to be difficult or even impossible by a non-specialist, and the taxonomy is evolving, for ease of implementation a genus listing seems appropriate. Other Considerations: As some species are nationally protected and thus trade is illegal, the range States concerned could put in place a voluntary zero-export quota for wild specimens which would be listed on the CITES website and empower re-exporting and importing Parties to assist with enforcing the law. Due to the evolving taxonomy of Tylototriton, there is potential for the current CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference to become out of date. The CITES Standard Nomenclature Reference used for the newt species currently listed in CITES is Frost (2015).

Declines have been observed in the extent and quality of habitats, as well as in the number of individuals. Species are harvested from the wild as a food source, for use in traditional medicine and to supply the international pet trade. As current populations appear to be extremely small, they can no longer sustain the high levels of harvest that occurred in the past (M. van Schingen, in litt., 2019). The trade in newts within Southeast Asia appears negligible in comparison to the international trade (Rowley et al., 2016). Wild-caught animals of species of Tylototriton have been very regularly available in the European pet trade over the past 20 years (although currently far less given legislation to restrict the spread of disease (BSal) (F. Pasmans, in litt., 2019). IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 215 The usually predictable high concentration of individuals in small breeding sites during the reproductive season makes most Tylototriton species especially vulnerable to over-harvesting at known localities. At least 12 species are recorded at species level in the international trade and are mainly exported to the European, USA, and Japanese markets, even though many species are protected in their native countries. Reported imports of live Tylototriton into the USA between 2007-2013 totalled 9,701 individuals: 52% of which were reported as T. verrucosus, 21% T. kweichowensis and 18% Tylototriton spp. according to US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database.

Several species known to be threatened and/or in international trade are discussed further below: Tylototriton asperrimus: Native to southern China and northern Viet Nam (although populations in Viet Nam may actually be T. ziegleri or T. vietnamensis (Sparreboom, 2014)), this species was assessed as Near Threatened in 2008 because it is in significant decline (formally a common species) due to over-harvest and is suffering from habitat loss and degradation, making the species close to qualifying for Vulnerable. The major threat to this species in China is harvest for its use in traditional medicine (it is a substitute for Gekko gecko, which is widely used in medicine) (van Dijk et al., 2008). It is also said to be collected in large numbers during the breeding season and sold for the pet trade via Hong Kong SAR. Habitat loss and degradation, resulting from smallholder agriculture and subsistence wood collecting, were also reported as a threat to this species (van Dijk et al., 2008). Threat levels are expected to be underestimated, and T. asperrimus is now believed to encompass other related species with significantly smaller ranges and fewer populations. Population assessments revealed generally small population sizes in investigated species: T. asperrimus has been found in 18 of 103 plots with a total of 68 individuals in Houhe National Nature Reserve, China. The SS details offers for sale in Europe; it is said to be one of the most commonly advertised species. According to the CITES Trade Database, imports of 367 live animals were reported as directly imported into the EU (mainly Germany), predominantly from China and Hong Kong SAR, since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009 (120 were wild and the source for the remainder was not reported); an additional 200 were re-exported from Hong Kong SAR to Spain from China. There are reports of successful breeding of T. asperrimus. Tylototriton hainanensis: Endemic to Hainan Island in South China. Assessed as Endangered in 2008 because its Extent of Occurrence was less than 5,000 km2 and its Area of Occupancy was probably less than 500 km2, with all individuals in fewer than five locations, and the extent of its habitat was probably declining. The species was reported to be uncommon and the population decreasing (Haitao & Chan, 2008). In the Jianfengling National Nature Reserve, its population density was reported as 31 per km2 (Wang et al., 2008), which one expert considered was probably the largest population in existence, facilitated by an environment with a high canopy density and without major anthropogenic disturbances (only eco-tourism) (Hernandez, 2016). Imports into the USA between 2007 and 2014 were limited to five scientific specimens from China (US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database). No imports have been reported to the EU since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009 (CITES Trade Database). Not observed for sale online or in physical markets in Japan in 2017 (Wakao et al., 2018). The SS notes international demand for the species (post on a forum in Canada). Tylototriton kweichowensis: Endemic to China. Assessed as Vulnerable in 2004 because its Area of Occupancy was less than 2,000 km2, its distribution was severely fragmented, and there was a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat, and in the number of mature individuals. There is little information on the population of this species; in 2004 it was reported to be probably common in its known localities but believed to be in decline (Yang et al., 2004). Although its range overlaps with a few small protected areas, habitat destruction and degradation caused by industry (brick factories) and mining are major threats to this species; it is also collected for use in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). A small number of individuals are also traded in the international pet markets (Yang et al., 2004). Tylototriton kweichowensis was imported in large quantities into Europe between 1990 and 1995, but only a few keepers have managed to keep the species. It is bred in captivity in both China and Europe (Datong, et al., 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4e7a5f0-03f7-4783-9a8e-36fa15dec084": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4e7a5f0-03f7-4783-9a8e-36fa15dec084", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51d17642d4f1273d91c45da6537c44fcc7a92c3e44a38e5995593ee76dd880f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "d51d5413-1628-47a5-ba0e-f4475555a8e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf5b0306184a1be82aa85e90edc206a5a5b517475a8f88a0422f85991e3db3b8"}}, "hash": "2f1eb6dddbfd78652e94d195639c2f1fb0c5c12830088e01a8326e15a0cb90f9", "text": "It is bred in captivity in both China and Europe (Datong, et al., 2004).

IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 216 Tylototriton lizhenchangi (or T. lizhengchangi): Endemic to Hunan Province and adjacent areas. The species is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and thousands are said to be exported illegally for the pet trade under the name T. asperrimus (Sparreboom, 2014). Since its recent description (2012) the number of specimens illegally imported into Europe and the USA (via Hong Kong SAR) has risen. Its range is very small, and intensive collecting following its formal description as a separate species has reduced the wild populations to a point where it could become extinct in the very near future; large adult individuals were already hard to find in 2014 and 2015 (Hernandez, 2016). The species has not yet been assessed on the IUCN Red List, although experts indicate it should be considered Endangered (Hernandez, 2016). The SS notes this species to be one of the most commonly advertised in the genus; it was found for sale in Germany and demand was reported in France (post on Facebook). No imports into the EU were reported in the CITES Trade Database or into the USA in US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database. Tylototriton shanjing: Endemic to Yunnan Province, this species was assessed as Near Threatened in 2004 because it was in significant decline (Ohler, 2004), but some populations were more recently reported to face an immediate risk of becoming extinct (Hernandez, 2016). While reported to be common in the past, populations of T. shanjing have shrunk considerably in recent years due to deforestation and habitat destruction, carp farming, mass exports of specimens for the terrarium trade (1990 - 2000), and overexploitation for TCM and food (Hernandez, 2016). Commonly seen in medicinal markets, for instance in Kunming and Chengdu, not many TCM dealers sell T. shanjing, but each dealer usually has a few kilograms stockpiled (mainly wild) (H. Chou, in litt., 2019). One expert reported the confiscation of hundreds of dried T. shanjing destined for the traditional medicinal trade within China (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). Three specimens were observed for sale in a pet shop in Japan in 2017; one reportedly captive-bred specimen was priced at 7,800 JPY (ca. 70 USD) (observations from Wakao et al., 2017). Imports into the USA between 2007 and 2013 included 264 wild live individuals imported from Hong Kong SAR, in addition to 216 captive-bred individuals (US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database). Imports of 20 live individuals (source not specified) have been reported into the EU (Germany) from China since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009, according to the CITES Trade Database. Tylototriton shanorum: Endemic to Myanmar. Currently known only from two populations, and formally described in 2014, although specimens of T. verrucosus that were imported in large numbers into Europe for medical research from the 1960\u2019s -1980\u2019s correspond to the taxon T. shanorum (and others), thus, these newts were commonly found in the terrarium trade under the name T. verrucosus (Hernandez, 2016). The species was assessed in 2016 as Vulnerable due to a low number of threat-defined locations (which take into account that the species probably exists beyond its known limit) its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is only 11,058 km2, and there is a decline in the extent and quality of parts its habitat (IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2017). Forest loss as well as potentially high rates of collection for the pet trade, are very likely causing population declines in this species (IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2017).

The status of individual populations differs geographically, with some being highly threatened by anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, as is currently the situation in China (Hernandez, 2016). Threats include habitat loss and degradation, human-induced forest fires and water pollution, and in parts of its range it is used as bait for fishing and in traditional medicine, as well for as the international and domestic pet trade (van Dijk et al., 2004). One of the species exported in the largest quantities to Europe in the 1960s for medical research (although only four species were known in the genus at that time). One of the most commonly advertised species (examples of offers for sale in China, Europe and the USA are provided in the SS). Imports into the USA between 2007 and 2013 included 5,031 wild live individuals mostly from China and Hong Kong SAR (US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database). Imports of 400 live individuals (source unspecified) have been reported into the EU (Germany) from China since the genus was listed in the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations in 2009 according to the CITES Trade Database. In 2016 a gang in China selling multiple species online were intercepted by police, and 32 T. verrucosus seized (CWCA, 2016). Tylototriton vietnamensis: Assessed as Endangered in 2016 as this species had only two threat-defined locations in northern Viet Nam, its estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) was only 1,345 km2, and there was a IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 217 decline in the extent and quality of parts its habitat. The species was reported to be known only from Bac Giang and Quang Ninh Provinces, northeastern Viet Nam. Although Tylototriton populations elsewhere have been assigned to this species, subsequent phylogenetic investigation has shown that of all reported localities, only those around its type-locality are in fact assignable to this species. The population was reported to be decreasing, although little appears to be known about the population size and trends except that it was only recorded from three surveys (IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2016). It appeared to be an uncommon species (Hernandez, 2016). Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve and Yen Tu Landscape Protection Area were reported to harbour the largest population of this species, and a survey of all known breeding sites in the Reserve in 2010 found 216 individuals (Bernardes et al., 2013). Unsustainable harvest to supply demand is very likely a threat to this species (IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2016). The small fragmented populations are affected by intensive deforestation, climate change, erratic rainfalls and improved access by humans to ponds (Hernandez, 2016). In Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve, northern Viet Nam, researchers found no evidence of human disturbance within the vicinity of T. vietnamensis in 2012, but two years later cattle were using the ponds and trails that had been created, and local people were collecting newts for private medicinal use, selling them at Chinese markets for the international pet trade, or selling to local tourists (Bernardes et al., 2017a). One trader from Hanoi referred to Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve as the origin of his newts. Animals are only available in stock from May to August, during breeding season. A shop in southern Viet Nam offered T. vietnamensis incorrectly labelled as different species (and were possibly being exported to Thailand). One of the most commonly advertised species; SS provides examples of offers for sale in Viet Nam (wild, USD 15-25) and demand in France (social media offers).

Density was estimated at 16 newts/km2 giving a global population of 30,000 in 2008, but the population was reported to have more than halved by 2015 with threats including habitat loss and degradation due to tea plantations and associated firewood collection (Hernandez, 2016). There are reportedly undescribed taxa within T. wenxianensis, meaning the population may be smaller should the species be split. Said to be one of the most commonly advertised species, the SS details offers for sale in Europe (EUR 45 (ca. USD 59)). Successful captive breeding has been reported. Tylototriton yangi: Endemic to South Yunnan Province in China with an estimated extent of occurrence of <20,000 km2, this species has not been assessed on the IUCN Red List but is said to be highly threatened by excessive collecting for the terrarium trade. Researchers have observed a rapid decline in numbers and consider the species endangered (Sparreboom, 2014). A year after its discovery in 2012, specimens were exported to Europe and the USA in significant numbers, which was reported to be reducing the wild populations to a major extent (Hernandez, 2016). One expert has noticed considerable population declines since 2014 (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). Thousands were reported to be exported illegally (Sparreboom, 2014). Tylototriton yangi is said to be collected in large numbers during the breeding season and sold for the pet trade via Hong Kong SAR: one expert witnessed a single poaching incident of 500 individual T. yangi, whereby the newts were smuggled to Hong Kong SAR and ended up in the USA pet market one month later (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). Said to be one of the most commonly advertised species. Wild specimens for sale in Europe and the USA have been reported; the SS details offers for sale in Europe (up to EUR 100 (ca. USD 112)). A shop in southern Viet Nam offered T. verrucosus incorrectly labelled as T. yangi as well as several other Chinese species (and were possibly being exported to Thailand). Other threats include habitat destruction due to mining and pollution with agrochemicals, and the species has reportedly been collected for traditional medicine purposes for some time (Hernandez, 2016). Tylototriton ziegleri: Described in 2013 and known from one location in northern Viet Nam (although these are unlikely to represent the actual limits of the species\u2019 range). Assessed as Vulnerable in 2015 due to an extent of occurrence of only 16,218 km2, it is known from a single location and there is ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The species' population was reported to be likely decreasing due to disturbance at breeding habitats and potential collection for traditional medicine and the pet trade (IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, 2017). Several field surveys of T. ziegleri found only small numbers of adults per breeding site during the breeding season. One expert noted that at sites near the Chinese border they had already found depleted breeding sites, and local people had observed visits from foreign poachers (the SS notes from China), who easily persuade IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 218 locals to help them collect newts in return for a very low payment (M. Bernardes, in litt., 2019). Thirty wild specimens were exported from the USA to Viet Nam via Canada for scientific purposes between 2007 and 2014 (US Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s LEMIS database).

Additional Information Threats Main threats to Tylototriton are habitat loss and degradation especially around the breeding habitats, as these species show philopatry and limited mobility. Another leading threat to Tylototriton is over-harvesting for the international pet trade, food, traditional medicine, and use as baits for fishing. Newts are used for traditional medicine and pets within Viet Nam, Myanmar and Lao PDR. Trade in newts within Southeast Asia appears negligible in comparison to the international trade (Rowley et al., 2016). As specimens accumulate in fresh water habitats during the breeding season, they can be captured with nets and as such entire cohorts may be easily collected (M. van Schingen., in litt., 2019).

Generation time is long (between 4-8 years to mature) (F. Pasmans, in lit., 2019). Conservation, management and legislation The genus has been listed in Annex D of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2009. Detailed information on legal protection is provided in the SS. In summary some species are protected within range States, some appear not to be, and for others the status of protection is unclear. Species in the genera native to mainland China but not Hong Kong SAR are not protected in Hong Kong SAR, therefore it appears the newts are being smuggled from mainland China into Hong Kong SAR where they can then be exported legally to destination countries (K. Wang, in litt., 2019). EU Decision 2018/320 (came into effect in 2018) requires that all members of the order Caudata that are imported into the EU must be held in quarantine post-importation in an appropriate establishment, and that when being moved between EU countries they must be held in an appropriate establishment under the supervision of the competent authority, immediately prior to their exportation. The new rules seek to stop the spread of the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) which can be spread to native species and cause morbidity and mortality (CEFAS, 2018). In 2016 the USA listed 201 salamander species as \u201cinjurious wildlife\u201d under the Lacey Act due to concerns over importing Bsal, including all species in the genus Tylototriton. This means importation into the USA is prohibited (there are some exceptions e.g. scientific research, zoos) (USFWS, 2016). Artificial Propagation/captive breeding There are mixed reports on the success and extent of captive breeding. Captive breeding has occurred in these species for many years (e.g. captive breeding in T. shanjing reported from 1986) and it is likely that some of the trade is in captive specimens (M. van Schingen, in litt., 2019). The SS also notes incidences of captive breeding. However, one expert noted that as Chinese salamanders are easily available as wild-caught specimens, often at a relatively low price, this renders captive breeding to many people unattractive, and while certainly feasible, captive breeding of many of these species requires dedication, expert care and patience (most species require at least 3-4 years before reaching maturity in captivity) (Sparreboom, in litt to Shenyang Normal University, 2015). These are species that in general can be kept and bred in captivity without too many difficulties, but due to inappropriate husbandry, the majority of those traded will probably die quickly (F. Pasmans, in litt., 2019). New rules on importation into the EU and USA may increase the need for captive breeding within these markets to meet demand. Implementation challenges (including similar species) Most Tylototriton species look alike and are considered morphological complexes, like T. verrucosus, T. shanjing and T. asperrimus masking together at least nine known other species. Morphological identification in this group IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 41 219 is difficult or even impossible by a non-specialist, and several of the newly described Tylototriton species were previously confused with T. verrucosus and are likely to have been (and continue to be) traded under this name, erroneously or deliberately (Rowley et al., 2016). Tylototriton spp. are difficult (not to say impossible in most cases) to identify without application of genetic tools. Thus, confusion of very rare, endemic species with more widely occurring taxa is very common. Genetic identification is necessary in most if not in all cases, as morphological variation is still poorly understood and not all cryptic taxa discovered (T. Ziegler, in litt., 2019). To further complicate the identification of Tylototriton species, there is also great morphological variation within individuals of the same species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "588ad40f-3f4d-40bd-b411-5d7607a7fb21": {"__data__": {"id_": "588ad40f-3f4d-40bd-b411-5d7607a7fb21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3cc0ca711aca6c70a575bc0469d0ff5eef9b9f3ff5510a74b7b66bd29a955fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f069c0e4-249a-45ed-a8ef-7423c52d1589", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7fb8057502e1e401b60054f2220568dfa8bd34a705eec6c9bb449dbc34d1569"}}, "hash": "3ca1457f37250ae3751de7ea0b6faac22a3ce0411a4b9b51251e9bef0e3b4f30", "text": "Morphological identification of many species of the genera Tylototriton (and distinguishing species in this genus from Paramesotriton and Pachytriton) is very difficult and needs specialist intervention (Sparreboom, in litt to Shenyang Normal University, 2015).

Phylogenetically, Tylototriton spp. forms a clade with the genera Pleurodeles and Echinotriton sharing also morphological similarities with the latter genus (of which two species are also subject to a listing proposal at COP18), from which it was separated in 1982.

Rowley, in litt., 2019). Given the difficulties in identification, a genus-level listing may encourage trade to be reported at the genus level as Tylototrition spp., which could mask trade in the most vulnerable species. Other comments Many species have proved to be exceptionally sensitive to being caught and confined to narrow enclosures, let alone being shipped long distances. This causes so much stress to the animals that it leads to diseases that mostly prove fatal. Packaging salamanders in large numbers often leads to diseases to which most animals in a shipment will succumb (Sparreboom, in litt. to Shenyang Normal University, 2015).

It can be found in all temperate and tropical ocean waters from 50\u00b0N (60\u00b0N in the North Atlantic) to 50\u00b0S. It is distributed across the following oceans: North Atlantic (14.5% of distribution), South Atlantic (12%), North Pacific (32.5%), South Pacific (22%), Indian Ocean (17.9%) and Mediterranean (1.1%). Longfin Mako Shark I. paucus appears in similar waters, although its complete distribution remains unclear. Very little is known about its biology. The primary threats to Isurus oxyrinchus and presumably I. paucus are directed and incidental catch in multi-specific fisheries found throughout its range. Isurus oxyrinchus is generally retained for its high-valued meat for both national and international markets, whilst its fins are mostly destined for the international market. Its meat is consumed all over the world and is considered a premium product. Fins from I. oxyrinchus have been observed in markets in Hong Kong SAR\u2019s main commercial centre, where this was reported as the fourth and fifth most abundant species in 1999- 2000 and 2014-2015 respectively. Isurus paucus fins have also been observed in this market. Other products from this trade include liver oil, skin and teeth. The form in which species are traded (primarily meat) makes it hard to differentiate between species. Although it is possible to visually differentiate the fins of the two species using macro-morphology based on differences in the dermal denticles, it is reported that I. paucus fins are often combined in I. oxyrinchus and thresher (Alopias spp.) fin categories, due to a similarity in appearance and market value. Isurus oxyrinchus is also the target of sport fishing and at risk of being caught in shark protection nets. Climate change may also be a threat to I. oxyrinchus; warming ocean waters may affect its spatial and temporal distribution. Both species are considered to have low productivity. Global population sizes are unknown but may number in the millions. Various studies and sources have used a range of indicators to examine the trends in each of the ocean areas including spawning stock fecundity, spawning abundance, biomass and mortality. However, due to different datasets and methods used for analysis, these studies are often not directly comparable and therefore a percentage decline is not always possible to calculate. Available information has been examined for evidence of historical and recent declines in relation to the quantitative guidelines contained in the footnote to Annex 5 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) for commercially exploited aquatic species. We take these guidelines to refer to the criterion 2aA. Information has also been examined for evidence of decreasing populations considered in relation to criterion 2aB. The FAO Expert Advisory Panel examined available datasets for robust information on the extent of marked declines for I. oxyrinchus (for which more data are available) to determine if there have been historical and recent declines near to the guideline figures in the footnote to Annex 5 of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). The Panel concluded that in none of the species\u2019 areas of distribution were there historical declines near to the guideline figures, however they did note that there was reliable evidence of historical population decreases in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and North Pacific (combined distribution of 48.1%).

In recent years the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Indian Ocean (33.5% of distribution) populations have been decreasing. In the South Pacific there is general agreement that the population is likely increasing marginally, however in the North Pacific there is a lack of consensus over the trend, with some considering a possible continuing decline whereas others consider there to have been a marginal increase. There is a lack of data for the South Atlantic, but in the most recent IUCN Red List assessment it is accepted that the situation in the North Atlantic (decreasing population) is representative of the South Atlantic. Less information is known on the population size of Isurus paucus, although it is considered the rarer of the two species; expert judgement suggests global declines would be similar to I. oxyrinchus as it is caught as target and incidental catch alongside I. oxyrinchus in offshore and high seas waters. Recent global IUCN Red List assessments due to be published in March 2019 have categorised both species as Endangered. Some range States have adopted a variety of legislative measures including quotas, finning bans, fishing gear restrictions, and area and season bans. Within the distribution of I. oxyrinchus, at least some areas are known to have stricter legislation in place, often in the form of recommendations or resolutions established by Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), including the banning of shark finning or the requirement for live I. oxyrinchus to be released. Analysis: Isurus oxyrinchus and I. paucus are both widely distributed, occurring in temperate and tropical ocean waters. Isurus oxyrinchus meat is utilized both locally and internationally and considered to be high value. Its fins have been observed in some of the largest fin markets. The species\u2019 low productivity place them at risk of overexploitation if stocks are overfished and unable to recover. There is no robust evidence of historic or recent marked declines for I. oxyrinchus that would meet the guidelines for listing under Annex 2aA. However, historical population decreases have been reported for I. oxyrinchus across large parts of its range (78%). Recent data suggest populations are continuing to decrease in 33.5% of its distribution (North Atlantic, Indian Ocean and Mediterranean), and if the condition of the North Atlantic is representative of the South Atlantic, this would add a further 12% of the species\u2019 distribution. The populations in the South Pacific appear to be stable or marginally increasing and there are differing opinions on the trend in the North Pacific. When considering the historic and recent trends in populations in conjunction with one another, overall it would appear that regulation of trade in I. oxyrinchus is required to ensure that the harvest of specimens from the wild is not reducing the wild population to a level at which its survival might be threatened by continued harvesting. Therefore, I. oxyrinchus meets the criteria in Annex 2aB of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Population trend data for I. paucus are limited but it is likely to be undergoing similar decreases to I. oxyrinchus, thus potentially also meeting the criteria in Annex 2aB of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17). Some legislation and regulations are in place in some of the regions where population declines are occurring. The extent to which these are being implemented is unclear. Any CITES listing would reinforce the implementation of any existing legislation and management measures. IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 223 Fins of both species are sometimes mixed in the same market category and although it is possible to differentiate the fins due to differences in dermal denticles, I. paucus is commonly misidentified as I. oxyrinchus. Meat would be less readily identifiable to the species level and therefore enforcement officers who encounter specimens of CITES-listed species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between species.

It appears to be a widely distributed species in tropical and warm temperate waters. However, at present records are sporadic and the complete distribution remains unclear. This is in part due to the confusion with the more common Isurus oxyrinchus. It is found in the following FAO Fishing Areas: 21, 27, 31, 34, 41, 47, 51, 57, 61,71, 77 and 81.

Biological and trade criteria for inclusion in Appendix II (Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17) Annex 2a) A) Trade regulation needed to prevent future inclusion in Appendix I Biology Isurus oxyrinchus is a species of large shark (~ 4 m), that is fast-swimming, reaching 70 km/hour. It is highly migratory and distributed in temperate and tropical ocean waters (50\u02da N to 50\u02da S). Their seasonal movements depend on food availability, water temperature and stages of growth of the species, it can sometimes be found on the coast. Isurus oxyrinchus has low biological productivity according to the criteria of Res. Conf. 9.24 (Rev. CoP17), with a natural mortality lower than 0.2 (0.072 to 0.223), an intrinsic growth rate lower than 0.14 (0.031 to 0.123); a Von Bertalanffy growth constant less than 0.15 (0.05 to 0.266), an average age of maturity greater than 8 years (up to 21 years), a maximum age greater than 25 years (up to 45 years) and a longer generation time than 10 years (25 years). Additionally, this species produces between 4 and 25 pups per litter with a gestation period of 12 to 25 months and reproduces every two or three years. Isurus spp. are ovoviviparous and oophagous, that is, live offspring are born and feed on infertile eggs during gestation. Like other lamnid sharks, Isurus oxyrinchus uses a circulatory heat exchange system to maintain the IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 224 temperature of its muscles and viscera above that of the surrounding seawater, which allows for a higher level of activity. Isurus paucus has a litter size of 2-8 and a maximum size of 427cm (Castro et al., 1999; Compagno, 2001). Population size The global population size for Isurus oxyrinchus is unknown. Different assessments have considered independent stocks. There are oceanic stock assessments available (North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific and Indian) that can provide estimates of biomass and/or spawning stock biomass (Barreto, in litt., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42c6d456-f669-41a3-9378-b96d6eae369e": {"__data__": {"id_": "42c6d456-f669-41a3-9378-b96d6eae369e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4d9f2f16dcb675e80d9975ba66e99a2e18bf535a74f4dd3bc2db91206f103a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "72d51982-1e0c-403b-87c2-f7bb18eaaeeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b249a5c23b2a41b1acb9c6cf8dd6d712164af93c4f650e4f6566c2f16cdec18a"}}, "hash": "3ef39d998de68e0e51c116ddacc56d9b93741710875bcaf8bd97838edc6c6555", "text": "Information on Isurus paucus appears to be even more limited.

The combined probability of all models being in a state of overexploitation while still experiencing overfishing is 90%. Based on the spawning stock fecundity (SSF) generated by the Stock Synthesis 3 model (table 7 of ICCAT, 2017) the SS estimated that there is a historical decrease of 39% (1,126,000 average SSF of 1950-1960 against 686,600 average SSF of 2006-2015), a recent decrease of 32.1% (822,000 SSF in 2006 and 558,000 SSF in 2015) with an annual decrease rate of 4.2%. Using the 4.2% decrease rate and starting at 558,000 SSF, an estimated projected 10-year decrease of 60% of the historical baseline was reported (1,126,000 average SSF of 1950-1960 versus 443,758 average SSF of 2016-2025). In the latest IUCN Red List assessment (accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update) the trend analysis of the north Atlantic modelled biomass for 1950-2017 (68 years) from ICCAT, 2017 revealed annual rates of decline of 1.2%, consistent with an estimated mean decline of 60% over three generation lengths. Satellite telemetry was used as a tool to document fishing interactions and quantify the fishing mortality of Isurus oxyrinchus in the northern Atlantic Ocean.

The outcome of the modelling estimated fishing mortality between 0.19-0.56, 5-18 times higher than the estimated mortality in the maximum sustainable yield ranging from 0.031-0.038. This implies the North Atlantic stock of Isurus oxyrinchus is currently experiencing overfishing (i.e. F > Fmsy). Thus, if the level of fishing mortality observed is representative of the western North Atlantic population, it is likely to be unsustainable (Byrne et al., 2017). A 43% decline in relative abundance has been observed for Isurus spp. between 1986 and 2005 from a logbook data analysis (Cortes et al., 2007). This decline was largely driven by a 21% decline in the first 3 years of the series (1986-1988), followed by an increase in 1989, and a progressive decline from 1989 to 1999, after which the series progressively started increasing until 2005 (Cortes et al., 2007). Isurus spp. standardized catch rates were estimated to have declined, although the trend (instantaneous rate = \u22120.032) equating to a 34% decline (95%CI: 1\u201356%) between 1992 and 2005, was only marginally significant and imprecisely estimated. The estimated decline for Isurus oxyrinchus, which accounted for 79% of all recorded Isurus spp., was slightly greater (instantaneous rate = \u22120.040, 95% CI: \u22120.005 to \u22120.074, p = 0.026) (Baum & Blanchard, 2010). South Atlantic (12% of the total distribution of the species) The ICCAT (2017) carried out the most recent assessment of the South Atlantic stock, with data from 1950 to 2015 and using three models (Bayesian Surplus Production Model, Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment model and Catch only Monte-Carlo). The combined results of the model indicate a 19% probability that the stock is overfished and that it experiences overfishing. The evaluation group of ICCAT SCRS considered that the results of the state of the stock for the South Atlantic are highly uncertain. They concluded that, despite this uncertainty, it is likely that in recent years the number of females in the stock may be below the expected level of maximum sustainable yield and that the fishing mortality already exceeds the expected mortality in the maximum sustainable yield. Due to unreliable stocks assessments, the latest IUCN Red List assessment (accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update) report that the results from the north Atlantic would be representative of the south Atlantic for the trend analysis. Barreto et al., 2016 identified three temporal phases of exploitation of Isurus oxyrinchus on longlines in the South Atlantic. Using generalised linear mixed models to standardise catch rates and identify trends in each of the three IUCN/TRAFFIC Analyses of Proposals to CoP18 Prop. 42 227 phases (1979-1997, 1998-2008 and 2008-2011). Steep declines of 99% in the average CPUE were observed between 1979-1997 and 1998-2008, with a 16.97% increase between 1998-2008 and 2008-2011. They observed extremely low catch rates in 1998-2008 and 2008-2011, suggesting that the population of Isurus oxyrinchus is depleted in the South Atlantic. North Pacific (32.5% of the total distribution of the species) The ISC SWG (International Scientific Committee Shark Working Group) evaluated the stock of Isurus oxyrinchus with the best scientific information available to date, with data from the North Pacific, provided by the USA, Japan, Taiwan Province of China and Mexico of catches (1975 to 2016) that were standardized. They used the Stock Synthesis 3 from which a base model was generated, and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the possible weaknesses of this modelling. Based on this, six scenarios were also modeled that address the identified weaknesses (e.g. increasing catch data for the period with greater uncertainties by 1975- 1993).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bb0234d-0538-4ffd-a003-db55b1281ec5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bb0234d-0538-4ffd-a003-db55b1281ec5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "IUCN and TRAFFIC analyses of the proposals to amend the CITES appendices at the 18th meeting of the Conference of the Parties", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f75f035bf829b0bdb84772d5edf068810917acefae05d817e5f7397e53ba92e"}, "2": {"node_id": "57878723-2b6f-4387-8b1d-9147ed973816", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/iucn-and-traffic-analyses-proposals-amend-cites-appendices-18th-meeting", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b610cc608e387c3dbeb1d35a293087371fae3ac57ae31d73a97fbf6124a4314"}}, "hash": "7f1454f5b9a8343b01fe64a8e16a6a301c0c49a0b97d425d90fd5143addf23e2", "text": "increasing catch data for the period with greater uncertainties by 1975- 1993). As a result of the base model (which is consistent with the different modelled scenarios), it was determined that there is a more than 50% probability that the stock is not in overfishing conditions (the current spawning abundance, 910,000 sharks is 36% higher than the expected spawning abundance in the maximum sustainable yield 633,700 sharks) and overexploitation does not exist (the impact of current fishing, 0.16, is less than the expected impact on maximum sustainable yield, 0.26). The predictive power of the model for the future is limited and uncertain. However, three scenarios were run projecting the behaviour of the stock to 10 years with which it is estimated that if the average catches of 2013-2015 are maintained or reduced by 20%, the abundance of females may increase.

In the latest IUCN Red List assessment (accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update) the trend analysis of the modelled spawning abundance for 1975-2016 (42 years) from ISC, 2018 revealed annual rates of the decline of 0.6%, consistent with a median decline of 36.5% over three generation lengths. Until 2018, the trends and state of the North Pacific stock had been evaluated mainly in a regional manner, with short time series and with different approximations. Based on information from the Taiwan Province of China longline fleet for the years 1990 to 2004, an assessment of the Pacific Northwest stock was conducted through a virtual population analysis. They observed a decrease trend from 2000, finding that the Potential Spawning Rate (SPR) had reached a level of 20% in 2003, being lower than the biological reference point (BRP SPR = 35%) and fishing mortality (F) in 2003 exceeded the BPR of current mortality (F2003 = 0.066/year, BRP F35% = 0.045/year). In this evaluation, it was concluded that the population could have been overexploited and recommended a 32% reduction in fishing efforts. Later, for the same fishery, a different group with the same information, but updated (1995-2005), included an analysis of the uncertainty in their estimates of the BRP and the same group in 2014 used a matrix demographic analysis by stages. They also concluded that the abundance of the stock of the Northeast Pacific was decreasing under fishing conditions during the study periods. A study using generalized linear models to standardize the catch rates of the longline fisheries of the Central and Northeast Pacific and making use of biological indicators, identified a recent rate of significant decrease in the catch rate for Isurus spp. of 7% per year during 1996-2009 (equivalent to approximately 69% for the 15-year period analyzed). However, the study indicates that the performance of the standardization model for Isurus spp. (North and South Pacific), was the worst compared to the models for the other shark species studied; therefore, the trends are less reliable. A study published in 2015 concluded that, based on CPUE data, catch rates were relatively stable in the North Pacific during 2000 and 2010, although they acknowledge the lack of data in some years, without being able to infer during the last 4 years. Conversely, a study published in 2017 developed a linear delta-generalized disaggregated by size and space-temporarily mixed model to analyze the catch rates of Isurus oxyrinchus in the Japanese Pacific Northwest and Central Pacific fishery during 2006-2014. They found that, as of 2008, the capture rates showed an increasing trend. South Pacific (22% of the total distribution of the species) In the South Pacific, changes in abundance for Isurus oxyrinchus were not significant (1996-2009) and the performance of the standardization model for the species (north and south) was worse than for the other shark species studied; therefore, their tendencies are less reliable. A study published in 2015 indicated that Isurus oxyrinchus in the South Pacific may have been decreasing for the past five years (2009-2013), however, the same authors argue that they are based on relatively few data and therefore, the trend estimated can be unreliable. In Francis et al., 2014 population trends of Isurus oxyrinchus in New Zealand waters are based on logbooks from the domestic fishery (north and south), logbooks from the Japanese fishery in the south and observer data.

With this information they applied generalized linear models, with which they estimated a decrease greater than 96% of the baseline. The meta-analytical estimate of the rate of decline was >99.99% for biomass (IRD: \u20130.15; CI 95%: \u20130.21, \u20130.10; time range: 106 years) and abundance (IRD: \u20130.12; CI 95%: \u20130.22, \u20130.03; time range: 135 years) (Ferretti et al., 2008). It should be noted that catch rates were very low even at the beginning of the data series, with an average of 0.2 sharks per 1,000 hooks (Walls & Soldo, 2016). The species Isurus oxyrinchus was classified as Critically Endangered in a 2016 regional assessment, based on (i) inadequate management resulting in continuous (or increasing) fishing pressure, (ii) the high value of its meat and fins, (iii) the sensitive life history of the species, (iv) absence of records of some areas located in the Mediterranean Sea, (v) evidence of large declines in other regions and (vi) captures of juveniles in a probable area of nurseries. Isurus oxyrinchus was considered common throughout the Mediterranean Sea, currently the species is rarely found. The last known sighting of the species in the Mediterranean was in Malta in 2005 and it was reported that the species has not registered in the Adriatic Sea since 1972. A decrease of the regional population of at least 80% in the last three generations (75 years) was calculated according to the available data and it was expected that this trend would continue given the lack of management and current fishing levels. Indian Ocean (17.9% of the total distribution of the species) A preliminary stock assessment was conducted using reduced information, mainly catch rates of the longline fleet of European Union countries. Two models were applied, a Bayesian Schaefer-type production model and another one analyzing only the trends of the catches, reporting that the current exploitation rate exceeds the exploitation levels where the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) obtained since 1990 estimated that the rate of fishing mortality F has a value much higher than the expected fishing mortality rate in the maximum sustainable yield Fmsy (F2015 / Fmsy = 2.57). It was concluded that Isurus oxyrinchus in the Indian Ocean has overfishing (its fishing mortality is 2.57 times greater than the Fmsy value), but it is not overfished. Based on the proportions of Biomass / Bmsy generated by the Schaefer model (Figure 6B of the publication Brunel et al., 2018) the SS estimated that there is a historical decrease of 26% (1.6 B / Bmsy average from 1970- 1980 against 1.1 B / Bmsy average from 2005-2015), a recent decrease of 18.8% with an annual decrease rate of 2.1% (1.31 B / Bmsy in 2005 against 1.06 B / Bmsy in 2015). Using the 2.1% decrease rate and starting from a value of 1.06 B / Bms, a projected 10-year decrease of 41.6% of the historical baseline was estimated (1.6 B / Bmsy average of 1970-1980 against 0.93 B / Bmsy average of the 2015-2025). In the latest IUCN Red List assessment (accepted for publication in the March 2019 Red List update) a trend analysis of the biomass for 1971-2015 (45 years) from Brunel et al., 2018 revealed annual rates of decline of 0.9% consistent with a median decline of 47.9% over three generation lengths (72 years). A study examined the incidental catch of longlines during a research program on longline fisheries of tuna in the western equatorial Indian Ocean (1964-1988).

The authors found that the available standardized CPUE data suggested a variable abundance, but that there was little evidence of a significant population reduction. However, they noted that there was evidence of decreases in the average size of individuals in countries such as Oman, and estimated that, given the intensive pelagic fishing in the region and the high susceptibility of the species to the longline fishing gear, purse seines and drift nets, it was suspected that Isurus oxyrinchus had presented population decrements of 20-30% in the last three generations (75 years). B) Regulation of trade required to ensure that harvest from the wild is not reducing population to level where survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences The main threat to Isurus oxyrinchus is fishing, since it is caught as a directed and incidental catch in multispecific fisheries throughout its range, particularly in pelagic longlines, targeting tuna, billfish and swordfish in national and international waters. Isurus oxyrinchus is valued for its high-quality meat, and fins. Because of this, it is discarded less frequently than other pelagic sharks. Its liver oil is considered of average quality. Isurus oxyrinchus is a target of sport fishing in the USA, New Zealand and some European countries. Fins Estimates of the average declared value of global imports of shark fins have been reported. These were ~ USD 22.5 /kg from 2000 to 2011, reaching USD 25.6 /kg in 2011. Isurus oxyrinchus is the fourth (in 1999-2000) or fifth (in 2014-2015) most abundant species observed in the shark fin trade through Hong Kong SAR's main commercial center. Isurus paucus has also been observed in this market, although only making up 0.08% of the sample (Fields et al., 2018). Isurus oxyrinchus fins are found in the \u201cQing lian\u201d fin category which Isurus paucus was sometimes mixed with (Clarke et al., 2006). Isurus paucus was also found in the \u201cWu gu\u201d fin category which was supposed to be for thresher shark species Alopias spp. (Clarke et al., 2006). Using commercial data on weight, fin sizes marketed and trade name of Isurus oxyrinchus, together with statistical and Bayesian analysis of DNA to obtain missing records, it was estimated that Isurus oxyrinchus fins represent at least 2.7% of the world trade in fins from 1999-2001, may be higher given its presence in other commercial categories, reaching up to 1 million mako sharks (Isurus spp.= 40,000 t of the two species combined) captured annually. Between 2014 and 2015, a genetic analysis of processed fin clips and by products of fin preparation in Hong Kong SAR found that 0.2 to 1.2% of reported samples were Isurus oxyrinchus. Regarding the global volume of shark fin trade reported in Hong Kong SAR, in 2012 it decreased by 22% from the average recorded between 2008-2010, but the reported total average of fin volume traded in Hong Kong SAR remains at least 6,000 metric tons between 2012-2015. Meat Isurus spp. meat is of high quality (it is known as \"veau de mer\" in Europe) and it is used fresh, dried, salted, frozen and smoked for human consumption all over the world. Its price is USD 22-44 /kg in American supermarkets and it is a premium product in Japan. In Spain, Isurus spp. meat in wholesale markets is double the cost of blue shark meat (~ USD 14.17 /kg fresh, versus USD 7.63 /kg for blue shark, and USD 5.21 /kg versus USD 4.42 /kg frozen). This is considered high-end in Venezuela. In some areas, Isurus spp. meat is used as animal feed and fish meal. In Mexico, the highest commercial value of Isurus spp. products is reflected in the meat, which is more valued compared to that of other sharks in the market (~ USD 1/kg), followed by the caudal peduncle (for export) and subsequently the rest of the fins of the species, it is also registered that all the derivatives of the species are used, including the jaw and the heads for decoration and ornament.
