Review Report IFinal Report 25 1.Introduction 1.1 Objectives and methodology of the review This review of Myanmar\u2019s legal framework and its effect on access to health and HIV services for people living with HIV and key affected populations was conducted through a partnership of UNAIDS, UNDP and Pyoe Pin in the period August\u2013 December 2013. The objectives of the National Legal Review were: 1. To review the existing legal environment (including laws and related policies, law enforcement practices and access to justice) and its impact on HIV responses in Myanmar; and 2. To propose specific recommendations to improve the legal environment for HIV responses for consideration by the Government of Myanmar, United Nations agencies and civil society partners. The review involved the following steps: 1. A literature review was conducted that considered relevant laws, policies, peer reviewed articles and press reports. The findings of the literature review have been integrated into this report. 2. Consultation meetings were held with NGOs and community network1as follows: \uf0b7 NGO consultation in Yangon on 23 October 2013 with 21 representatives from international and local NGOs; \uf0b7 Community consultation in Yangon from 2\u20133 September 2013 with participation of 40 individuals representing key populations and national networks of key population groups; \uf0b7 Community consultation in Mawlamyine from 15\u201317 September 2013 with participation of 38 individuals representing key populations and self-help groups of key populations from Mon, Tanintharyi and Kayin states, and Bago region; and \uf0b7 Community consultation in Yangon from 4\u20136 October 2013 with participation of 47 individuals representing key populations and self-help groups of key populations from Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway, Bago regions, and Shan (North), Shan (South) and Kachin states. \uf0b7 Summaries of these consultations are contained in Annex VI. 3. A National Legal Review Meeting of 93 participants was convened in Naypyitaw on 25\u201326 November 2013. Participants included government, Supreme Court, parliamentarians, community networks, NGOs and United Nations agencies (see Annex V). 4. Analysis was conducted of all inputs to prepare a draft report with key recommendations. 5. Finalization of the report. This report also includes conclusions from a Roadmap Workshop convened by UNAIDS in May 2014 that describes the next steps to implement priority recommendations (see 10.5). Introduction 26 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 1.2 Rationale, background and context The National Legal Review was conducted to support the Government of Myanmar in meeting its international commitments, in particular: \uf0b7 The commitments made at the High-Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS as set out in the United Nations General Assembly Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (2011), which commits States to reviewing laws and policies that adversely affect the successful, effective and equitable delivery of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes to people", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7d12fa6-96d6-44df-8d4b-dee317442cad": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7d12fa6-96d6-44df-8d4b-dee317442cad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa3db13658e9100bcbc569cf773bf9367fc57ebfd62966d3bc65b8ae7a6c526d"}}, "hash": "fa3db13658e9100bcbc569cf773bf9367fc57ebfd62966d3bc65b8ae7a6c526d", "text": "living with and affected by HIV;2 \uf0b7 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which commit States to support universal access to HIV services (MDG6); and \uf0b7 Resolutions of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which commit States to conduct national reviews of HIV- related laws and policies.3 ESCAP Resolution 66/10 of 2010 commits States to \u201cground universal access in human rights and undertake measures to address stigma and discrimination, as well as policy and legal barriers to effective HIV responses, in particular with regard to key affected populations\u201d. ESCAP Resolution 67/9 of 2011 commits States to \u201ca review of national laws, policies and practices to enable full achievement of universal access with a view to eliminating discrimination against people at risk of infection or living with HIV, in particular key affected populations\u201d. The National Legal Review also supports the Government of Myanmar in strengthening implementation of the Myanmar National Strategic Plan on HIV and AIDS 2011\u20132015 (NSP II). Guiding Principles of NSP II include the protection of the human rights of people living with HIV and those vulnerable to HIV, and the creation of a favourable legal and policy context. A cross-cutting priority of NSP II is creation of a favourable environment for reducing stigma and discrimination. The findings of the National Legal Review will contribute to the mid-term review of the NSP II and inform the priorities of the National Strategic Plan III. The National Legal Review was informed by the principle of human rights, which is described in NSP II as follows: The protection of human rights, both of those vulnerable to infection and those already infected, is not only right, but also produces positive public health results against HIV. In particular, it has also become increasingly clear that: \uf0b7 National and local responses will not produce intended results without the full engagement and participation of those affected by HIV, particularly people living with HIV; \uf0b7 The human rights of women, young people, and children must be protected if they are to withstand the impact of HIV; \uf0b7 The human rights of marginalized groups (sex workers, people who use drugs, men who have sex with men, prisoners) must be fulfilled for the response to HIV to be effective; \uf0b7 Supportive frameworks of policy and law are essential to an effective HIV response.4 In formulating recommendations, regard was had to the United Nations International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights,5 and the recommendations of the Report of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2012).6 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 27 2. People living with HIV 2.1 Context The Department of Medical Research (Lower Myanmar), the Burnet Institute and the Myanmar Positive Group conducted a survey of people living with HIV in 2012 to explore the effect of HIV on socio-economic status including experiences of discrimination. The survey found that: the majority of people living with HIV report discrimination from society at large, are prohibited from collective work in wards and are barred from employment in food manufacturing; 39.2 per cent reported being treated negatively in their own neighbourhoods; and many people living with HIV have been subject to discrimination at their workplaces. The study found that people living with HIV have to cope with significant workplace discrimination, with many employers firing workers known to be HIV-positive, whereas 22.5 per cent said they had been denied employment due to their condition. Some changed their workplace because of hostility from co-workers. Eleven per cent of people who moved home did so because of social discrimination. People stayed away from the funerals of those with HIV and it was difficult to arrange cremations.7 Another survey of 324 people living with HIV in Myanmar conducted in 2009 as part of the People Living with HIV Stigma Index also revealed a high level of stigma and discrimination. Among the nine Asian countries where the survey was conducted, Myanmar ranked first in the prevalence of incidents such as exclusion from social gatherings and activities (31 per cent); being gossiped about (78 per cent); verbal insults, harassment, and threats (45 per cent); and physical assaults (16 per cent). Some 15 per cent reported to have been forced to change or unable to rent places of residence due to their HIV status, and 27 per cent lost employment or other form of income in the past 12 months. Among those who lost their jobs, 57 per cent attributed the reason to discrimination or a combination of discrimination and poor health.8 Human rights laws and policies There are no HIV-specific protective laws in Myanmar or laws", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "953ff2d0-2dd0-4955-90e2-4c0042a4bab4": {"__data__": {"id_": "953ff2d0-2dd0-4955-90e2-4c0042a4bab4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd1ed80ceaa06a883bc804c2ba748ea5b9123f53dbfa98609aa258266167bb8c"}}, "hash": "bd1ed80ceaa06a883bc804c2ba748ea5b9123f53dbfa98609aa258266167bb8c", "text": "that specifically address the human rights aspects of HIV. There are no laws that specifically: People living with HIV 28 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report \uf0b7 Protect people living with HIV from discrimination in employment, health care, education or other areas of life; \uf0b7 Protect people living with HIV from breach of confidentiality or non- consensual HIV testing; \uf0b7 Define the rights of people living with HIV to treatment and care including antiretroviral therapy (ART) and treatments for opportunistic infections (OIs); or \uf0b7 Define the rights of people living with HIV and key populations to prevention including condoms, lubricant, needles and syringes, opioid substitution therapy (OST), or HIV-related information and education. There are some general human rights protections in the 2008 Constitution of the Union of Myanmar. Article 367 of the Constitution provides: \u201cevery citizen shall, in accord with the health policy laid down by the Union, have the right to health care.\u201d In theory, people living with HIV can complain to government that this constitutional right has been breached if access to essential medicines such as ART is denied, given that ART availability is supported by national policy. People living with HIV may submit a complaint to the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission if fundamental rights (e.g. right to life or to privacy) are violated.9 There are also constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination by the government on the grounds of \u2018status\u2019 and requiring equal opportunity in employment and equality before the law.10 However, it is unclear how these general constitutional rights would be applied in relation to violations of the rights of people living with HIV. Further, the Myanmar Human Rights Commission has limited resources and its powers to resolve individual complaints are limited. A Bill clarifying the powers and mandate of the National Human Rights Commission has been drafted, but it is yet to be considered by parliament. An anti-discrimination agreement was signed jointly in 2012 by the Ministry of Health, the Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, UNAIDS and the Myanmar Business Coalition on AIDS. The agreement commits 72 employers to provide safe workplaces with policies that prohibit HIV-related discrimination with support from the business community in Myanmar. Although this was a positive step, it is unclear how compliance with the agreement is being monitored. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 29 Public health law The Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law 1995 defines AIDS to be a disease in the same category as cholera, plague and dengue haemorrhagic fever, which are collectively described as \u2018principal epidemic diseases\u2019 (see text of the law, Annex III). As a result of this categorization, sweeping public health powers (such as powers to make compulsory orders and impose quarantine) apply to AIDS. These provisions include powers to issue orders restricting the rights of the person living with AIDS to leave and return to the person\u2019s home, residential quarters, village or township and orders to place the person under quarantine for medical examination. The Act requires revision to ensure compliance with the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, which recommend that States should reform public health laws to ensure that provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations.The Guidelines recommend that public health legislation should ensure that people are not subjected to coercive measures such as isolation, detention or quarantine on the basis of their HIV status.11 Penal Code Section 269 of the Penal Code 1860 creates a criminal offence for transmission of life-threatening infection. This provision could be used to prosecute people living with HIV who transmit disease to others. There are no reports of any person with HIV being charged with this offence in Myanmar. It should be noted that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law recommended that cases of malicious and intentional HIV transmission be addressed under general criminal provisions (such as existing provisions of the Penal Code), rather than creating new HIV-specific offences. The Global Commission recommended that law enforcement authorities should not prosecute people in cases of HIV exposure where no intentional or malicious HIV transmission has been proven to take place. Invoking criminal laws in cases of adult private consensual sexual activity is disproportionate and counterproductive to enhancing public health.12 Prisons Act The Prisons Act 1894-1909 Chapter VIII establishes rights of prisoners to request to see a medical officer and the obligation of the prison authorities to provide a hospital or proper place for the reception of sick prisoners. 2.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting Stigma", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a5a5e98-abcf-4ccd-b737-134b705c1f87": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a5a5e98-abcf-4ccd-b737-134b705c1f87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69cce3f8026ff7fee4ea31c37e5e70ac041b9936da0e930bc33ad80dbff1b48f"}}, "hash": "69cce3f8026ff7fee4ea31c37e5e70ac041b9936da0e930bc33ad80dbff1b48f", "text": "and discrimination are reportedly widespread in employment, education and the provision of health services. Workplace issues Participants of consultations reported that pre-employment testing for HIV and hepatitis B is required by many employers, with no provision for pre- or post-test counselling. Some employees are not given sufficient leave to enable them to access health services. Forms of workplace discrimination include denial of application for a position, bypassing for promotion and dismissal. Some people living with HIV report denial of workplace entitlements such as medical pension. Participants of consultations provided examples of people living with HIV who were excluded from employment as teachers, bank employees, hotel employees, private hospital employees and people in food handling roles. Applicants for positions abroad such as domestic helpers are often required to submit to an HIV test and denied employment if the test result is positive. Participants suggested that the welfare of people living with HIV would be improved if the Ministry of Labour made special provision for health insurance rights for employees living with HIV. People living with HIV 30 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report The Union of Myanmar Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (UMFCCI) has signed an agreement with UNAIDS on workplace policies. In 2012, many private sector employers signed the United Nations Global Compact, which requires action on human rights. UMFCCI have an important role in ensuring promotion of and compliance with the United Nations Global Compact and action on HIV in the workplace. Participants stressed the importance of active monitoring of compliance. Without a monitoring or evaluation system it is difficult to assess whether voluntary agreements to develop anti-discrimination workplace policies have been effective. Although some voluntary workplace agreements have been entered into, it is not mandatory for employers to have an HIV workplace policy that addresses discrimination. Concerns were raised that even some companies such as private hospitals that have signed agreements or commitments to address HIV-related discrimination in the workplace still permit discriminatory practices to occur. Another example is the testing of taxi drivers. Transport authorities in different States/Regions apply varying testing policies so it is still reported in some places that taxi drivers are required to be tested for HIV and if they test positive are denied their taxi driver\u2019s licence. Access to comprehensive and quality HIV treatment and care Participants were of the view that people living with HIV require improved access to a comprehensive and quality package of services under a continuum of care model. Selection of eligible patients for ART is sometimes hastily done in order to meet treatment targets, which can result in lack of informed consent. There is poor quality of HIV counselling, treatment and care services in public health facilities because of lack of infrastructure and a high staff / patient ratio. Access to OI medicines is inadequate, leading to sickness and unnecessary deaths. Even in Yangon hospitals, OI medicines except Septrin (an essential antibiotic to protect against OIs) are not available free of charge. Participants outside Yangon area complained that even Septrin is occasionally unavailable. Centralization of HIV treatment services, the government\u2019s limited health budget and geographical limitation of NGOs restricts access to ART and OI medicines. There is no systematic nationwide quality assurance system to monitor and assess quality of HIV services. Conditions at treatment sites are generally poor with overcrowded waiting areas, poor lighting and ventilation, lack of privacy and space for counselling, and long waiting times. There is inadequate attention to the needs of patients for privacy and confidentiality when attending clinics. This deters some people from attending clinics due to fear of disclosure. People living with HIV are often segregated from other patients in public hospitals. Confidentiality of HIV status is often not respected by nurses and other health care workers. Disclosure of HIV status leads to stigma and discrimination from their own family and community. In health care settings, the practice of testing patients for HIV and hepatitis B and C without informed consent or counselling is commonplace. Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms including additional fees, segregation and denial of services. There are many accounts of people being refused care or receiving substandard care in hospitals. For example, an HIV-positive pregnant woman was placed next to the toilet when she was admitted for delivery of her baby, and HIV-positive sex workers have been attended to last when they sought care for post-abortion complications. Private hospitals charge HIV patients double the fees of other patients. In public hospitals, HIV patients are segregated from other patients.

Denial of surgical operations is unreasonable and discriminatory because use of infection control procedures prevents HIV transmission to health care workers. High-level Ministry of Health instructions, directives and Standard Operating Procedures should underscore the legal rights of all citizens to health care (as established by the 2008 Constitution, Article 367) and address quality of HIV treatment and care, including the importance of addressing stigma, discrimination and confidentiality in health care settings. Disciplinary action should be taken when instructions or standards are breached. In response to reports of some private hospitals refusing to admit HIV-positive patients, the MoH issued a directive that if a patient wishes to be in hospital, that patient can stay in hospital even though the doctors are of the opinion that the patient need not be in hospital. Although the directive does not specifically refer to HIV, the reason for the directive was to prevent hospitals refusing treatment to HIV patients. However, HIV patients are often still segregated from other patients. Peer-to-peer education and peer counselling are very effective in HIV prevention. Stigma and discrimination occurs in health services in part because the involvement of people living with HIV themselves in delivering HIV services is inadequate. Provision of support to people living with HIV to engage more effectively in planning and delivering HIV-related services can help reduce stigma and discrimination. Similarly, to ensure HIV-related health care services provide quality care it is important to have a monitoring and evaluation system for the services that involve people living with HIV. Mobile populations face particular problems. In the past, MSF and the MoH National AIDS Programme (NAP) had provided six-month supplies of ARV medicines for migrant workers from Myanmar who were working in Thailand. However, currently only a supply for two or three months is available. It is difficult for migrant workers to return frequently for their appointment and medicines. However, this issue has been addressed by the Thai Government with a new policy to provide ARV medicines to all those residing in Thailand, including migrant workers from neighbouring countries. Prisoners\u2019 rights There is a need for systematic referral linkages to ensure uninterrupted treatment for people living with HIV in prison or police detention, and upon release from prison or police detention. Security regulations of the prison department require transporting of prisoners out of the prison to access health services. This is a major deterrent for HIV-positive prisoners to access HIV-related health services because they have to inform their HIV status to access these services and they fear breach of confidentiality and discrimination by other prisoners and prison officials. Participants suggested that this barrier could be reduced if prison doctors were trained and equipped to provide HIV care, and given permission to provide HIV-related health services. Some HIV-positive prisoners are held separately from other prisoners, at Kyar Ni Kan in Mandalay and Toon Tae Baung Taw Gyoke in Yangon. Access to justice Participants noted that people living with HIV require improved access to legal aid services and information about their rights so they can assert their rights through the courts or negotiate resolution of complaints with the assistance of a lawyer. The Myanmar Legal Aid Network (MLAW) is a good example of collaboration among lawyers to provide legal aid services although the focus and expertise of MLAW is on issues other than HIV. 32 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report Impact mitigation services for people living with HIV and their families Although NSP II mentions impact mitigation as a key strategy, implementation falls short in areas of psychosocial, economic and nutritional support for people living with HIV and impact mitigation for orphans and vulnerable children. 2.3 Recommendations The Government of Myanmar should: 1. Introduce a law and supporting policies prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of HIV status in health care, employment, and the provision of education and other services, and providing accessible complaints procedures and meaningful remedies such as compensation, admission to school, reinstatement of employment, and disciplinary sanctions for violations. 2. Allocate a specific budget for stigma and discrimination interventions in the NSP. Health care 3.

Sex workers13 3.1 Context The Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949 provides offences for: \uf0b7 Soliciting;14 \uf0b7 Living on the earnings of prostitution; \uf0b7 Procuring persons to engage in prostitution;15 \uf0b7 Owning or managing a brothel, or renting premises for use as a brothel;16 \uf0b7 Aiding and abetting prostitution. Penalties for soliciting include imprisonment for between one year and three years, and female sex workers may be detained in a \u201cprescribed centre\u201d.17 Soliciting is defined very widely to include the conduct of sex workers in public or private places that seeks to attract clients.18 Section 7 of the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949 enables police to arrest sex workers merely on the basis of their reputation for illegal conduct (kyawzaw). The Ministry of Home Affairs issued an Administrative Order in 2000 directing police not to use condoms as evidence in prosecutions of sex workers.19 The Law Amending the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949 was enacted in 1998 to broaden the definition of a brothel to include any place used habitually for sex work. This was in response to new sex work businesses being established at massage parlours and beauty parlours. Public order offences that may be applied to sex workers include Section 268 of the Penal Code 1860 (public nuisance), Section 35 of the Police Act 1945 (loitering) and Section 30 of the Rangoon Police Act 1899 (loitering, in relation to conduct in Yangon). Under these laws, police have wide powers to detain persons loitering after dark (see Annex III). A magistrate or judge may make an order under the Code of Criminal Procedure requiring a sex worker to stay away from specified areas and to attend the police station each day for a given period.20 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 35 There is no law against buying sex.

This in turn hinders their access to HIV prevention, treatment and social protection services.25 It is reported that sex workers face widespread discrimination and abuse, and some are required to pay up to two thirds of their income to police: Many opt to use middlemen, such as madams or pimps, to navigate the corrupted elements of Burma\u2019s police force. But this option is not open to transgender sex workers, who face additional stigma and legal obstacles due to the criminalisation of homosexuality. Those who refuse or are unable to bribe the police face arrest and incarceration, sometimes in so-called \u201crehabilitation centres\u201d intended to reform immoral behaviour. But while prostitution is a criminal offence, buying sex is not, which leaves sex workers largely at the mercy of their clients. Cases of rape and sexual assault are a daily occurrence. \u201cBecause clients know that sex work is criminal, they can be violent or refuse to use a condom and the sex worker can\u2019t say no,\u201d says Thu Thu. To make matters worse, police often use condoms as evidence of prostitution, even though the government formally banned the practice.26 The police have a duty to report monthly statistics of arrests. Sex workers are relatively easy targets for arrest. It has been reported that in the final two months of the calendar year, more sex workers are arrested as police try to improve yearly figures.27 Sex work occurs in increasingly diverse settings. Law enforcement efforts have led to closure of most brothels over the last decade and continue to target street-based work. An independent team reported the following to the Ministry of Health in 2005: The law and its enforcement greatly influence the organization of sex work. Over recent years, the number of brothels has decreased and their operations are more transient and clandestine, to avoid police action. As a result, there is an increasing shift from brothel-based to indirect sex work, and most commercial sexual services in Myanmar are now provided in informal settings such as karaoke bars, nightclubs, hotels and guesthouses. Our impression is that most sex workers have chosen this occupation, as part of their limited livelihood options. All types of sex workers are extremely mobile, moving regularly between establishments and townships, and frequently switching Sex workers 36 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report categories. This implies a relative freedom of movement across geographical boundaries and across different sex work settings. This also signals some ability to negotiate terms of contract with entertainment establishment owners. We have not received reports that trafficking is a major issue in Myanmar, though prostitution of under-age girls is practised.28 In 2008 it was reported that numerous brothels based in guesthouses were appearing in Yangon. The police and local authorities license guesthouses. According to reports, a licensed guesthouse owner generally pays neighbourhood police annual \u2018levies\u2019 ranging from 300,000 kyat to 1 million kyat. The money buys advance warnings from the local police if superior officers have planned a raid.29 A study on the impact of law, policy and enforcement practices on sex work, which drew from interviews conducted in Yangon, Mandalay and Pathein in 2011, made the following observations: Female and transgender sex workers in Myanmar are subject to extortion, arrest and incarceration which is continual and systematic. Female sex workers can reduce their chances of arrest by working in a venue for a boss who provides protection from police but who may exploit or abuse them. Transgender sex workers do not have that option and are therefore even more exposed to the cycle of extortion, arrest and jail. Sex workers[\u2019] HIV vulnerability is driven by lack of access to safe workplaces and lack of access to services. All health care other than ARVs for HIV and TB antibiotics must be paid for so poverty is a significant barrier to accessing services... the key legal barriers are the laws and enforcement procedures that prevent sex workers from earning, retaining and managing their money. Violence also contributes to vulnerability.

Police are clearly under instructions to operate a zero tolerance policy towards brothels and street work and there is some evidence that they have quotas of arrests to fill. There are times when sex workers cannot bribe their way out of arrest but can get charges reduced by informing on other sex workers or third parties leading to their arrest as well\u202631 Law enforcement is linked to both lack of access to services and to lack of access to safe workplaces. Unprotected sex, when it happens, occurs at the behest of police, clients or sex venue bosses whose power over sex workers is entrenched by the law and by a justice system that sex workers say is indifferent to justice and human rights.32 Violence clearly emerged as routine and most sex workers experience it as a constant threat. It also contributes to vulnerability in a range of direct and indirect ways. For example rape presents a direct threat to all sex workers mental and physical health.33 In 2011, the government announced a ban on massage parlours and restrictions on National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 37 restaurants and karaoke lounges in Naypyitaw. Restaurants and karaoke lounges were ordered to install transparent glass in their rooms and beauty parlours were required to install adequate lighting.34 It has been reported that compliance with the Order prohibiting use of condoms as evidence of sex work is inconsistent.35 There continue to be reports of police arresting sex workers who are found with condoms in their possession. A press report quoted a sex worker as follows:36 We bribe local policemen so we can work. When other police come they call us and warn us that there will be a raid and to hide. We pay them a monthly fee between 30 \u2013 50 US dollars, sometimes it\u2019s 150 [US] dollars. We have to give them whatever they ask. I never carry condoms because if they see the condom they know that I am a sex worker. Interviews conducted at three sites in 2011 found that the practice of condom confiscation \u2018has declined to different extents in each site\u2026(but) has not been entirely eliminated.\u201937 A behaviour surveillance survey conducted in 2008 found that 36 per cent of female sex workers in Yangon and 37 per cent in Mandalay gave money earned from their last client to a madam, pimp or police officer.38 Some sex workers reportedly pay protection money to corrupted elements in the police force. Some sex workers also report sexual exploitation and violence perpetrated by police.39 In 2010 there were press reports of sex workers arrested who were selling sex to the military.40 The 2006 review of the National AIDS Programme noted that in some localities the military are a major source of clients for sex workers:41 A behavioural assessment is done with all new recruits in order to better understand and address risk behaviours. It was reported that young servicemen in isolated postings were especially vulnerable and at high risk to HIV, and were routinely clients of sex workers. 100% Targeted Condom Programme (TCP) The 100% TCP commenced in 2001 and has expanded to 170 townships. A WHO review of the National AIDS Programme described the 100% TCP as follows:42 The main activities include advocacy, training of township staff, formation of condom core groups, geo-social mapping, condom distribution and programme monitoring... The review teams were informed in several townships that the police force supports 100% TCP by active participation in the [condom core groups]. Sex workers undergo regular physical and serological check-ups, including [syphilis] testing. HIV testing is reported to be voluntary. They did not have to carry a card indicating whether they had complied with check-up requirements or the result of tests\u2026 A key barrier to effective implementation of the programme is the continued disruption caused by police arrests of sex workers. INGOs reported that this happens particularly towards the end of the month when the police have to meet their monthly targets as part of the programme to control sex work. At that time, attendance by sex workers to drop-in centres declined. In one district, stakeholders and the divisional AIDS/STD officer reported that sex workers are harder to access now due to (a) the shift of sex work from brothels to other entertainment establishments and freelance work; and (b) the continual movement of sex workers due to police activity and migration. The divisional AIDS/STD officer estimated that consistent condom use in entertainment establishments was less than 50 per", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8b66645-45f6-4f91-b04f-eab7421aa971": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8b66645-45f6-4f91-b04f-eab7421aa971", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "968332c68a9c18fe898cbf2b819fd45fed94126252f80286196d55ea5c5e18b9"}}, "hash": "968332c68a9c18fe898cbf2b819fd45fed94126252f80286196d55ea5c5e18b9", "text": "cent in that state/division. Sex workers 38 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report The 2010 UNGASS Country Report of the Ministry of Health stated:43 The Ministry of Health is in full support of prevention programmes for groups with high risk of HIV transmission. However, the law enforcement agencies in the areas where the services are provided are not always fully aware of prevention programmes. The 100% Targeted Condom Programme of the National AIDS Programme will continue to address this through advocacy with local authorities including law enforcement. 3.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting Confiscation of condoms Police harassment of sex workers when they find condoms on them or in their premises is an on-going problem that deters sex workers from carrying condoms. Condoms are important both for HIV prevention and contraception. Most police in large towns comply with the government Directive in that they do not submit condoms as evidence in court. However, not all local police in the field are fully aware of the Directive and in what context it was issued. The Directive is of limited assistance to sex workers because police continue to use possession of condoms as a basis of harassment. As a result, freelance sex workers who commonly carry six or seven condoms with them discard the condoms if they see the police coming. There is therefore a need for a more comprehensive police instruction that prohibits police from interfering with the right of all persons to carry condoms for HIV prevention or contraception, as well as prohibiting use of condoms as evidence of prostitution offences in court proceedings. Harassment, violence and other police abuses Arrests of sex workers generally occur under provisions of the Prostitution Suppression Act 1949 relating to soliciting or selling sex (Sections 3(a), 3(b)) or having a reputation of being a prostitute (Section 7). Section 5(2) of the Prostitution Suppression Act prohibits certain conduct that promotes prostitution. Sex workers raised concerns that this Section could be used by police to prevent sex workers meeting as a group either for safer sex, HIV and other health education or self-help group activities or simply for socialization as they can be construed as exchanging information to encourage sex work. Police sometimes have used peer education meetings as opportunities to identify sex work places and subsequently arrest sex workers.Sex worker representatives at the consultations raised the concern that peer educators should be able to conduct group peer education sessions at the sex work places without worrying about police monitoring, harassment or arrest. Sex workers reported one case in which police shadowed peer educators as they were working, and then later raided the premises and arrested the sex workers. Since then, no sex work venue in the area wants to have peer educators come to their place. Sex workers are also commonly charged or threatened with arrest for the public order offence of loitering after dark (Police Act and Rangoon Police Act) and less commonly for public nuisance (Section 268 of Myanmar Penal Code). Abuse of the laws by the police is reported as common especially in relation to arrest under Section 35 of the Police Act (loitering) and Section 54 (arrest without warrant) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 34(7) of the Police Act (causing disorder by drunkenness) is also sometimes used to charge sex workers. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 39 Reported examples of police abuses include: \uf0b7 Extortion of bribes to reduce the charge to a lesser offence, or release without charge. Police abuses include verbally and physically abusing sex workers to confess to the crime of soliciting and extortion of bribes either from sex workers or pimps to either reduce the charge to one with a lighter sentence or release the sex workers. \uf0b7 In some cases, police have threatened a sex worker with arrest unless she provides free sexual services for several days to a visiting police officer or official. \uf0b7 Police use entrapment methods to secure arrests, such as undercover police who pretend to be clients seeking the services of sex workers. Undercover police then arrest the sex workers during or after exchange of sex for cash. Manipulation of evidence by the police has also been experienced. \uf0b7 Sex workers reported not being able to practise safe sex and use condoms when they encounter clients who are police as they do not have the same bargaining power as they have with other types of clients. Police have the power to arrest and shut down their sex work businesses. \uf0b7 Sex workers have been denied the right to inform either family", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "355d026e-f253-49d8-a522-af2663d38fed": {"__data__": {"id_": "355d026e-f253-49d8-a522-af2663d38fed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1abbca1d13f8604239be727ed7d2f59634e91fb0807033c61af59141c693f54a"}}, "hash": "1abbca1d13f8604239be727ed7d2f59634e91fb0807033c61af59141c693f54a", "text": "members or a lawyer of their arrest. \uf0b7 Charges of being \u2018suspected of prostitution\u2019 are brought arbitrarily. The offence of having a \u2018reputation as a prostitute\u2019 is applied arbitrarily against people who are no longer practising sex work (Prostitution Suppression Act Section 7, kyawzaw). Arrest for reputation as sex worker enables the police to harass current or former sex workers any time and in any place as they see fit. Section 7 also inhibits sex workers from openly participating as sex workers in HIV prevention activities as they worry about becoming known or associated with the reputation of \u2018sex workers\u2019. \uf0b7 A quota system operates within the police department and some police target sex workers to fulfil arrest quotas. Police engage in periodic crackdowns targeting sex workers. No peer education sessions can be conducted during these periods. Peer educators are afraid to meet with other sex workers for peer education and condom distribution purposes at their street or brothel workplace at night. Sex workers are reluctant to challenge police abuses because they worry about further aggravating the police. Sex workers generally lack awareness about their arrest rights, which leaves them vulnerable to the vagaries of the local police. Many sex workers do not know their rights and have little or no legal literacy, which makes them an easy prey to police intimidation and harassment. Sex workers who experience violence including rape by their clients are not confident to report such incidents to police for fear that no action will be taken or they will be charged with prostitution offences. Police often change the section of the law under which sex workers are charged, so as to rely on charges that are easiest to prove, such as loitering after dark. At the court, sex workers are often prosecuted based on flimsy evidence. Accounts of biased practices by the magistrates or judges in the court regarding cases of prostitution are also common. In some locations, public order measures constrain health promotion. Rules that require permission from several government offices for gatherings of people for health related activities create obstacles. Local authorities should aim to encourage wider health education among sex workers and other key populations to prevent HIV more effectively. Sex workers 40 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report The application of criminal laws against sex workers fuels stigma and discrimination against sex workers, acts as a deterrent for them to seek HIV information and health services, and fosters a clandestine sex work environment. CWC and Sex Worker Rehabilitation detention facilities There are two types of detention centres (apart from prisons) where sex workers may be held. The Centre for Women\u2019s Care (CWC) is a special centre established for HIV-positive female prisoners in Yangon (Toon Tae Baung Taw Gyoke) and Mandalay (Kyar Ni Kan). CWC is a quasi-prison facility under the Ministry of Home Affairs operated as a collaboration between the Department of Prisons, Department of Health and Department of Social Welfare. CWC is regarded by some as a preferable alternative to a prison. However, it is also regarded as stigmatizing and a form of discrimination by some sex workers. Sex workers who are sent to prison are tested for HIV and may be sent to a CWC if found HIV-positive. However, there is inconsistency between prisons as to whether women have the opportunity to be transferred to CWC. For example, HIV-positive sex workers who are sentenced to Mandalay Oh-Bo prison are said to be transferred to CWC but that practice is not common across all prisons e.g. HIV-positive sex workers from Shwe Bo prison are not transferred to CWC. The other type of facility is the Vocational Training Centre for Women (VTW Centre), which focuses on sex worker rehabilitation. Sex workers are sent to VTW centres prior to their release from prison. Vocational training offered to women is usually literacy skills, knitting and basket making rather than more marketable skills. There are VTW centres in Yangon and Mandalay. Police detention When sex workers are held in police detention or jail awaiting a bail decision or the outcome of their court case, personal belongings including ARVs are confiscated and can only be retrieved by a family member. Since in most cases their families do not know they are sex workers, this is often not an option. Even if sex workers are willing to contact their family, they are often refused a phone call. HIV-positive sex workers commonly miss at least two to three days of doses of ARVs while in police detention. It is reported that payments of financial incentives to police are required: when sex worker peer educators", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d4ede4d-cdec-476c-9f28-247b21afae99": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d4ede4d-cdec-476c-9f28-247b21afae99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af33d27e62549657f6b73db2b9c9d2cc78f8cdbb9419faf7ee7a86f7f8029ea1"}}, "hash": "af33d27e62549657f6b73db2b9c9d2cc78f8cdbb9419faf7ee7a86f7f8029ea1", "text": "want to send ARV and OI medicines; food, other medicines and basic items to sex workers in jail (the more important and urgent the item, the larger the payment) Sometimes payment is also required to maintain confidentiality of HIV status of sex workers. Sex workers are often reluctant to disclose their positive HIV status when in prison for fear of discrimination by prison personnel and other inmates due to their HIV- positive status in addition to being a sex worker. Some prisons require HIV testing of all persons who are serving sentences for a prostitution offence and there is little or no pre- and post-test counselling. Some are offered voluntary testing. Prisons Access to any form of health care services in prisons is limited and these are often of poor quality. All prisoners have a range of general health care needs that are exacerbated by poor prison conditions. Prisoners living with HIV have additional health care needs. Tuberculosis (TB) spreads easily in prison conditions and TB-HIV co-infection is a particular problem for prisoners. When HIV-positive sex workers on ART are sentenced to prison, a peer educator may be able to liaise with the NGO or government ART provider and the prison doctor to arrange for continuation of ART. Peer educators refill the prescription at the clinic and deliver the medicines to the prison doctor, who then provides the sex workers with their medication. In some cases, an NGO or government service provider and the prison doctor directly cooperate to continue the ARV supply. If sex workers are found to be HIV-positive National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 41 and needing ART during imprisonment, prison doctors also make referrals to outside service providers. However, these systems are not operating in smaller prisons (e.g. Shwe Bo) and prison staff do not allow visitors to bring in medicines or peers to send ARV medicines for their friends. Workplace conditions Many sex workers at community consultations argued that the law should treat them as workers with employment rights, rather than as prostitutes, and that the government should recognize sex work as an occupation or profession so that sex workers can enjoy workplace health and safety rights and protection from exploitation. Employment conditions for sex workers are sometimes exploitative. Exploitation of their earnings by the brothel owners is reportedly fuelled by the police practice of asking for a fee for protection or permission to run the business. The owners of sex work establishments sometimes restrict movement of sex workers. Many places have rules restricting sex workers from leaving the premises for more than an hour per day. If the sex worker does not return during that hour, she has to pay a hefty fine, which is taken out of her pay by the owners. This makes it very difficult for peer educators to encourage the sex workers to go for regular testing or treatment. Some residential quarter authorities refuse to issue an overnight guest permit if they know or suspect a woman to be a sex worker. This practice of not giving an overnight permit is more common in smaller cities and towns where sex workers are easily identifiable. Many sex workers do not have a National Registration Card, which is required to apply for an overnight guest permit. When the local authorities conduct the check of a residence, sex workers can be fined and/or arrested if found without a valid overnight guest permit. Health care services Sex workers experience discrimination, poor quality of care, insensitivity and lack of confidentiality at public health facilities such as hospitals and STI services which makes them reluctant to attend health services. The Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949 and the threat of arrest further inhibit female sex workers to come forward for family planning, reproductive health, and HIV services. Examples of sex worker complaints relating to health care include: \uf0b7 Access to sex worker-friendly services, peer counsellors and other service providers vary greatly, depending on the personality and attitude of regional NAP/STD officer. Sex workers report poor confidentiality standards at the hospitals, segregation of HIV-positive patients in a different residential quarter (ward), and brash and insensitive approach of health staff. \uf0b7 Sex workers experience rude and condescending behaviour of service providers when they seek treatment for STI or reproductive tract conditions. Fear of judgmental attitudes and discriminatory behaviour from health care providers inhibitssex workers from openly discussing their STI symptoms and their occupation, leading to ineffective investigation and treatment of STIs. \uf0b7 There is usually no peer counsellor and inadequate privacy and space for counselling at township hospitals and STD team premises.

Abortion is not legal in the case of rape unless the abortion is necessary to save the mother\u2019s life. There are very limited opportunities for sex workers to access safe abortion services for unwanted pregnancies that often happen as a consequence of sexual violence. \uf0b7 Confidentiality is not respected at STI services. Some sex workers do not want to go to STI clinics for HIV testing or ART because sometimes police officers also attend the same place for their tests. Sex workers avoid attending health services because of the concern that the police will find out they are sex workers and HIV-positive. ART eligibility requirements are difficult for many sex workers to fulfil because they require documentation such as Household Registration (form 10) and endorsement from the residential ward authority (vouching that this person is living in the ward), and require a family member to act as treatment supporter. Participants were concerned that ART eligibility criteria need to be more flexible, taking into account recommendations of the national ART assessment conducted in 2013. Health care providers are reluctant to prescribe ART to sex workers due to the mobility associated with their work, which means they are living away from their native place and family. The need to go for frequent appointments for counselling before initiating ART is also a challenge for many establishment-based sex workers who have very limited amount of time off from their employers or pimps. In many cases it is not a realistic option to disclose the reason why they need to go frequently to a clinic, due to the lack of confidentiality and negative repercussions of disclosure of HIV status on their work and income. Access to justice Participants noted the importance of a fair process to address police abuses and other unlawful conduct affecting the rights of sex workers, and that free legal aid services for sex workers (e.g. similar to Equal Project) should be made available in other areas outside Yangon.Sex workers should be educated on their arrest rights and the laws protecting women against physical and verbal assault (e.g. Section 354 and 509 of the Penal Code). There are no dedicated services to provide welfare and legal support to sex workers who experience violence. Focal department or civil society organizations should be identified, trained and sensitized to handle such complaints so that sex workers can seek justice without fear of discrimination because of their occupation. Legislative models for sex work legislation At the national review meeting, a representative of UNFPA presented different international models for sex work legislation, including criminalization, decriminalization and regulation. Data from Australia was presented indicating that decriminalization had delivered greater public health benefits than criminalization or regulation. To assess whether different legal models have an impact on the delivery of health promotion services to sex workers, researchers compared health promotion programmes in three cities. The study concluded that the decriminalization of sex work is associated with better coverage of health promotion programmes for sex workers.44 Other countries in the region have introduced various models of regulation of the sex industry. Thailand and the Philippines have introduced health regulations relating to condom availability, STI testing and peer education for entertainment venues. Indonesia and Singapore have designated \u2018red light\u2019 areas where sex work is tolerated and regulated by local government.45 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 43 3.3 Recommendations The Government should review the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949. This review should consider the international evidence of the public health benefits of alternative legislative approaches to sex work, including models of health and safety regulation and decriminalization. To ensure sex workers are not driven underground and away from health services, legislative models should avoid punitive or compulsory measures such as compulsory testing and compulsory rehabilitation.

The Act should be re-titled to remove reference to \u2018suppression of prostitution\u2019 and instead emphasise \u2018protection of the rights of sex workers\u2019, including violence protection, and access to condoms and confidential health services for HIV and STI prevention, testing and treatment. 2. Include in the Act a supportive framework for implementation of the 100% Targeted Condom Programme to prevent sexual transmission of HIV and other STIs. 3. Include in the Act violence protection provisions for sex workers. 4. Remove penalties for soliciting (Section 3). If a penalty is to be imposed for sex work, this should be a fine rather than a custodial sentence. 5. Remove the offence of \u2018reputation\u2019 (kyawzaw) (Section 7). 6. End the practice of detaining sex workers in rehabilitation centres. Attendance at rehabilitation or vocational training centres should be voluntary rather than compulsory. In advance of the review of the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949, the following measures should be taken: Police instructions 1. The Directive to police to not use condoms as evidence of prostitution offences should be revised. In addition to not using condoms as evidence in court, police should be directed to not search for condoms when arresting sex workers and not harass sex workers, accuse sex workers of offences or arrest sex workers based on the finding of condoms on their person or premises. 2. The Directive should be promoted and enforced to ensure police comply with instructions prohibiting the use of condoms as evidence for prosecution or as a basis of arrest or harassment. 3. Police instructions should prohibit use of the \u2018reputation\u2019 offence (kyawzaw) and public order offences (such as loitering at night) against sex workers unless exceptional circumstances exist and should prohibit the police practice of entrapment of sex workers using people who pretend to be clients. Police responsibilities 4. Collaboration between MoH and the MoHA/Myanmar Police Force should be strengthened to support effective implementation of HIV prevention among sex workers including 100% targeted condom promotion. 5. The Government should ensure sex workers have access to independent and confidential complaints procedures if they experience police harassment, extortion, unfair treatment or violence from the police. There should be a confidential mechanism for sex workers to report exploitation and abuses without having to share their sex work status with police. 6. If ARV or OI medicines are found on a sex worker during a police search, these medicines should be returned to the sex worker and police should help the sex worker to inform a peer educator, family member or service provider for continuation of treatment. Sex workers 44 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report Vocational training 7. The existing VTW Centres should be remodelled as voluntary centres that provide training for skills that are marketable and relevant to running a small business including how to find capital, how to identify the market and how to market your product. There should be creation of employment opportunities for sex workers who want to find alternative viable livelihoods. Legal aid 8. Legal aid services should be available to sex workers for representation in violence protection cases and complaints against police or health care services. Health and HIV services 9. Health service policies should support non-discriminatory services that respect the human right to health of everyone including sex workers and ensure provision of sex worker-friendly health services including HIV, STI and reproductive health and family planning services to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. 10. ART eligibility criteria should be relaxed so that mobile sex workers are referred to the nearest ART provider, and have flexibility to refill their ART prescription from any ART distribution site.

The Myanmar Excise Act 191747 prohibits the possession, sale or distribution of hypodermic needles without a license. Section 33 of this Act prohibits the making, selling, possessing or use of hypodermic syringes or any other apparatus suitable for injecting any intoxicating drugs without licence. Contravention of this section is punishable with six months imprisonment and/or a fine. Needle and syringe distribution programmes have been implemented in Myanmar for over ten years. To facilitate establishment of needle and syringe programmes, a Directive from the Myanmar Police Force Headquarters was given not to make arrests for possession of needles and syringes in 2001. However, this Directive has had a limited impact because in practice needles and syringes are confiscated by police and submitted to the courts as evidence when people are arrested for drug People who inject drugs 46 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report possession.48 Police continue to refer to Section 33 of the Myanmar Excise Act to justify confiscation of needles and syringes, although subsequent prosecutions usually proceed under the narcotics legislation. Compulsory treatment and rehabilitation The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law 1993 creates a system of registration and compulsory treatment of drug users. A drug user is required to register at the place prescribed by MoH or at a medical centre recognized by the Government for this purpose, to take medical treatment. MoH is required to provide programmes for medical treatment for registered drug users. A registered drug user undergoing medical treatment is required to abide by the directives issued by MoH.49 A drug user who fails to register or who fails to attend medical treatment as required shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend from a minimum of three years to a maximum of five years.50MoHA is required to provide for the teaching of means of livelihood as may be necessary to persons serving sentences for failing to register.51 Treatment centres for registered drug users are either Drug Treatment Centres or Hospitals under MoH. There are 26 major and 40 minor drug treatment centres. Major centres are 200 or 300 bed hospitals. Minor centres are small hospitals or centres managed by the Township Medical Officer. Services available differ depending on the location and may be detoxification alone or detoxification plus methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) services. ART is not integrated at drug treatment sites. Duration of stay varies but it is common for drug users to stay 42 days for detoxification and 14 days for MMT induction. Many people who use drugs who have not sought treatment are subject to prison sentences. The Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR) is required to provide for rehabilitation and care of drug users, including: \uf0b7 Rendering assistance and protection as may be necessary to persons undergoing medical treatment and the families dependent on them; \uf0b7 Providing for rehabilitation, teaching of means of livelihood as may be necessary, resettlement and aftercare to enable persons who have undergone medical treatment to resume their normal lives; \uf0b7 Conducting expertise training courses for the relevant persons in order to implement systematically and effectively the work of rehabilitation of drug users.52 The MSWRR\u2019s rehabilitation centres are for people who have already undergone drug treatment at a DTC. There are seven rehabilitation centres but not all are operating due to funding constraints. Clients are required to remain for a minimum of six weeks. Services offered include sports, vocational training, counselling, meditation and arts. Costs must be covered by family members or NGOs/drug demand reduction organizations. The MoHA and MoH also operate three youth drug rehabilitation centres for young people who use drugs who are serving prison sentences. Methadone maintenance therapy Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) commenced in 2006 and in 2012 over 2,900 people were receiving MMT. MoH issued Guidelines on Methadone Therapy and Treatment of Drug Dependence in Myanmar in 2012.53 The Guidelines promote harm reduction interventions as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing drug dependence. Harm reduction is described by the Guidelines as follows: National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 47 In the context of harmful use of and dependence on opioids, harm reduction means preventing the transmission of HIV and hepatitis B and C through the practice of using sterile injections, reducing injection-related injuries through safe injection techniques, and reducing engagement in illegal activities through the use of methadone and another OST called buprenorphine, which is used in some countries.

Law enforcement issues Conflict is reported to occur between operational policing and the implementation of harm reduction services. Police crackdowns impede the access of outreach workers and NGOs to people who inject drugs, disrupting needle and syringe programmes and other services. Police crackdowns can result in the \u2018conversion\u2019 of smokers into injectors because during crackdowns the price of drugs increases, with the result that poorer users resort to injecting as a more efficient mode of administration of drugs than smoking. Advocacy with State and Division level authorities has reportedly been successful in avoiding police crackdowns at some harm reduction intervention sites.56 A review of harm reduction in Myanmar conducted in 2010 made the following observations:57 Mandatory registration of drug users, including those who seek to access drug treatment and MMT remains in force and is a major barrier to the utilization of drug treatment and to the organization of drug-user networks...the legal environment in Myanmar is a major obstacle to the achievement of HIV control in this population. Like most other countries in the region, the national drug laws are punitive\u2026 Failure to register is punishable by three to five years of imprisonment. (Section 15) Possession of three grams of heroin, 100 grams of opium, three grams of ATS, or 25 grams of cannabis is considered to be in possession of narcotic drugs and is punishable by five to ten years imprisonment. (Section 16 (c)) The Anti Narcotics Law is a constraint for HIV control given compulsory registration requires drug users to enter treatment. Because of this, many drug users and injecting drug users are driven underground for many years. 4.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting Criminalization of drug possession means that PWID are viewed as criminals by society, rather than as people with health problems and complex social welfare needs. The view of PWID as criminals is widespread in society at large as well as among police and health care workers. Fundamentally, PWID would like to see the legal and policy framework for drug dependence changed so that it is primarily focused on public health and services that address individual health care and welfare needs, rather than the existing punitive criminal justice approach. Participants at community consultation argued that such a public health approach and attention to health care needs should also inform law enforcement practices. People who inject drugs 48 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report Police abuses PWID report police harassment and physical abuse if police find PWID carrying needles and syringes. This deters PWID from either buying or carrying needles and syringes. They report that police initially justify arrests under the Excise Act 1917, Section 33, which leads to later charges of drug possession under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law 1993. The Directive from the Myanmar Police Force Headquarters in 2001 not to make arrests for possession of needles and syringes was regarded as a positive step towards addressing drug use as a public health problem rather than a criminal problem. However, accounts from PWID participants revealed confiscation of needles and syringes for laboratory investigations and use of needles and syringes as evidence in prosecutions is still common practice. Although possession of needles and syringes is not charged directly by the police, possession of injecting equipment leads to further investigations and drug possession charges. Sentencing of PWID for possession when only trace evidence of drugs are found in the laboratory traps PWID in a cycle of imprisonment and drug use, without affording a reasonable opportunity to progress through treatment. Advocates for PWID argued that drug users who have registered for treatment under the law should not be prosecuted as they have admitted their health problem and are trying to seek help to overcome addiction. They pointed out that according to medical literature, relapse can happen anytime among ex-drug users or users on drug treatment. Threat of arrest for carrying needles and syringes affects the willingness of people to work as outreach workers to distribute clean needles and syringes. Threat of arrest for carrying syringes also hinders overdose treatment (Naloxone injection). Administration of Naloxone to PWID who have overdosed requires syringes to be available to drug users or their peer educators.

Arrangements at the local level between police and harm reduction services were effective in some areas under MOUs entered in 2008\u20132009. NGO participants at the consultations proposed that these arrangements be revived. Police harassment leads to PWID avoiding purchasing new syringes. Instead, some PWID resort to the unsafe practice of hiding used syringes at the shooting places for re-use at a later time. Police harassment and scrutiny of drop-in centres deters PWID from accessing the services provided at centres. Police also conduct surveillance of known PWID. In a typical scenario, PWID purchase three to five new syringes per person at the market. After PWID leave the shop and use their syringes, the police arrest them under Section 33. While they send the syringes to the laboratory for chemical analysis, PWID are detained in police jail. Sometimes it takes six months for the laboratory result to be provided. If the result is positive, the charge is then changed to drug possession or failure to follow directions regarding abstinence. Police occasionally conduct crackdowns, arresting many PWID to fulfil quotas. Police apply public order offences against PWID, particularly loitering after dark (Section 35 of the Police Act), drunk and disorderly (Section 47 of the Police Act) and behavioural bonds under the Restriction and Bond Act 1961 (Section 5(1)). Under the Restriction and Bond Act 1961, if police claim they have information that a person is likely to commit a criminal offence, they can apply for bond to be placed on the National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 49 person to require the person to report to the police, to be on good behaviour and to not travel. Conspiring or abetting the commission of a crime is an offence under Section 21 of the Narcotics Law 1993. Police reportedly use this offence to justify arrests for possession of drugs merely on the grounds of someone else\u2019s word. This sometimes leads to accusations from peers within the community of PWID (\u2018finger pointing\u2019) and creates more secrecy among the drug using community. This makes it challenging to build the trust and relationships required to do outreach for harm reduction. Some police entrap drug users by cultivating a group of drug user informants, which contributes to the atmosphere of fear and secrecy. The community consultations heard accounts of corruption including officials taking bribes, planting evidence, and using street children as informers. There were accounts of law enforcement officers targeting PWID rather than suppliers for arrest. Section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law 1993 is intended to provide protection against police misconduct such as taking bribes or switching or planting evidence. Usually, such a complaint is investigated and handled internally within the Myanmar Police Force and the harshest punishment is dismissal from the position or demotion. Participants were concerned that police misconduct should be taken more seriously and receive more severe penalties. Even though the law requires mandatory registration for treatment, lack of treatment facilities means that most PWID receive prison sentences rather than proper treatment for their drug dependence. Criminalization also reduces the capacity of PWID to be involved in decisions in relation to HIV policy and planning of services, and to participate in delivery of health and HIV services. In most areas, participation of drug users in HIV responses is minimal or non-existent and it is very difficult to reach out to drug users in the community for HIV prevention activities because of danger of disclosure to the police. It was reported that PWID were reluctant to attend consultation meetings for the National Legal Review because of concerns that disclosure of drug use history could result in arrest based merely on suspicion. ART services PWID report that they are denied access to ART unless they have registered as drug users and have undergone MMT initiation. Although it is not written policy, being an active user is a de facto disqualifier for ART. Access to treatment services is impeded due to the prejudice of health care workers regarding the reliability of PWID to adhere to treatment, and lack of PWID-targeted treatment services. The perception of PWID as criminals or potential criminals has influenced the perspective of many health care providers. As a result, discrimination against PWID is common in medical settings. Drug users are given low priority by ART providers in the public and NGO sectors. Some PWID do not disclose their drug use problem to the doctors or counsellors because of the perception that providers are prejudiced against prescribing ART for drug users. For those who disclose their drug use,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1154120-dd66-496c-a895-9a866c09a809": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1154120-dd66-496c-a895-9a866c09a809", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e728ae001a45571d37e1db86d1ad965016e3053689cfe46aa95dcaeb5cf082f7"}}, "hash": "e728ae001a45571d37e1db86d1ad965016e3053689cfe46aa95dcaeb5cf082f7", "text": "they are more likely to receive ART if they are on regular methadone maintenance as providers consider it as a proxy for treatment adherence. Methadone sites are located in areas with high levels of injecting of heroin. Many drug users in other areas cannot access methadone, which means that they are also unable to access ART (e.g. Southern Shan) because MMT initiation is considered a precondition for ART. While those users do not inject heroin, they inject other drugs such as Diazepam and this injecting behaviour facilitates transmission of HIV and other blood borne infections. People who inject drugs People who inject drugs 50 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report MMT services There is an unmet need for MMT due to difficulty with registration and lack of legal protections from arrest for registered drug users, and low coverage of methadone service provision. There are an estimated 75,000 PWID in Myanmar. However there are only 28 centres prescribing methadone. Availability and quality of counselling for methadone patients is also an area of unmet need. The National MMT Guideline describes many supportive features such as proper counselling before initiating MMT and transportation allowances for drug users to come for daily dose at the centre. However in reality, there is inadequate pre-treatment counselling and no travel support for the drug users registered for treatment. PWID also report difficulties in obtaining take-away doses of methadone for the purpose of traveling. There are very few methadone treatment centres in the country and it is very inconvenient for people to travel daily to get their daily doses. In Yangon, there are two centres for methadone treatment: Sanpya General Hospital and Ywarthangyi Hospital. The eligibility criteria for MMT are problematic for many PWID. For example, the requirements that a PWID must live in the particular geographical location, must have household registration for that location and possess a National Registration Card are prohibitive. Many PWID do not have a National Registration Card because they come from isolated villages and cannot afford the cost involved in obtaining a card or because they are migrants. The requirement to report occupation is also a barrier to register, because confidentiality of information is often not respected and PWID risk dismissal if employers know that the employee is registered for MMT. The proximity of MMT centres to law enforcement offices is another access barrier. Some MMT centres are located close to offices of the anti-narcotics police. The PWID network expressed concern at consultations and the National Legal Review Meeting that registered drug users are not protected from arrest. There is little incentive to register if to do so bring drug users to the attention of police and increases the chances of arrest and imprisonment. Registered users are required to carry a treatment registration card, and are required to attend regularly for medical follow-up. The PWID network is seeking legal protection for PWID who are registered and admit themselves to treatment. The current situation is that if PWID relapse during treatment and their home is searched for evidence of possession, the person can be charged for possession if the police find even an extremely small amount (trace evidence) of drugs in used injecting paraphernalia. In this regard, there is no legal protection from punishment if a PWID relapses during their treatment. The registration system is regarded by international NGOs as out-dated and counterproductive. Guidelines in relation to prescription of methadone are unduly restrictive and exclude NGOs from providing MMT. Guidelines require methadone to be provided at a drug treatment centre or under supervision of a psychiatrist at a township hospital. Buprenorphine as an alternative to methadone is not available due to narcotics and drug registration laws. Access to analgesics for pain management is also restricted. Access to analgesics is important for PWID undergoing withdrawal because they are more likely to share injecting equipment if they do not have access to pain killers. The representative of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) at the National Legal Review Meeting made the following points: \uf0b7 The Government accepts that the law requires revision and the legal requirement to register (Section 15) is already being reviewed. It is expected that revision of Section 15 will mean that if a person is found by a police officer to be using drugs, the PWID will be encouraged to register for treatment and will be sent to National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 51 a hospital. The revision may also address the circumstances in which a PWID who relapses and re-offends may be sent to a rehabilitation centre or prison. \uf0b7 However, lack of health", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5119b7d3-550b-484b-983a-ff3494fb9ef6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5119b7d3-550b-484b-983a-ff3494fb9ef6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c9d84d9b3c88ffd6b00aee093013e7bd9a89db7bb27bf52448ee77470eaacb7"}}, "hash": "9c9d84d9b3c88ffd6b00aee093013e7bd9a89db7bb27bf52448ee77470eaacb7", "text": "infrastructure is a problem. If we find a drug user in an area where there is no hospital with a drug treatment centre, how can we send him to hospital? How can we treat him? Even if we can treat him, he will be sent back home after nine months, and then who will give aftercare? Therefore the participation of the whole community is needed. \uf0b7 The Government has considered experiences of decriminalization of drug use in other countries. In a European country, the model of decriminalization involves assessment of a person who uses drugs by a board comprising a doctor, a lawyer and a police officer. After the assessment is conducted, the person is sent to a hospital to receive treatment and they are linked with community groups to help find employment. This approach requires health infrastructure and CCDAC\u2019s view is that Myanmar does not yet have sufficient infrastructure for this approach. Access to MMT in prison or police detention A PWID who is charged for drug possession or use usually has to spend time in police detention while the prosecution case is being prepared. Treatment for withdrawal from drugs is needed during the first few days in jail. Depending on the severity, police inform family members and may refer the user to be hospitalized under police custody. PWID typically spend two weeks in police holding cells and it is in this period that it is critically important that access to ARVs, methadone and tuberculosis antibiotics are made available without interruption. Lack of access to methadone inside the police jail or prison is a serious problem for those who are taking MMT as they suffer from severe withdrawal symptoms. Currently there are very limited MMT services inside prisons. When a drug user is sentenced to prison, he often loses his access to MMT, even though the National MMT Guideline refers to provision of methadone in prison setting. In practice, the senior medical officer prescribing methadone will only provide a one to two week supply of methadone to the prison doctor to taper off treatment (depending on level of cooperation between the police and methadone centre). However, in many cases police do not take any initiative to arrange for MMT to be provided to PWID in their custody. Medical officers prescribing MMT can arrange to send methadone through the police if they are informed by PWID or their families about the situation. On-going access to methadone is only provided if a family member or friend takes responsibility and bears the cost of delivering the methadone to the jail. Beyond this period, there is no treatment provided from the public sector. Access to condoms is also important in prisons. 4.3 Recommendations Criminal laws and police abuses 1. The possession of needles and syringes should be decriminalized (Myanmar Excise Act 1917, Section 33). The Myanmar Excise Act should be amended to provide exceptions for distribution and possession of needles and syringes for HIV prevention and harm reduction purposes. 2. Partnerships between CCDAC, Myanmar Police Force, MoH, UN, NGOs, and community networks to support harm reduction service provision need to be revitalized and local arrangements between police, NGOs and PWID communities to facilitate needle and syringe programmes need to be re- established. People who inject drugs 52 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 3. The Directive by Police Headquarters (2001) not to arrest for possession of needles and syringes should be widely promoted to police at all levels and strictly followed. 4. The MoHA/Myanmar Police Force should issue updated directives or police instructions prohibiting the use of needles and syringes as evidence for prosecution or as a basis of arrest or harassment. Police instructions should also prohibit police harassment of PWID attending or in the vicinity of drop-in centres or other sources of clean needles and syringes. Law enforcement efforts should focus on drug manufacturing, sale and supply, not use. 5. The Narcotics Law should be amended to include specific provisions on harm reduction services including MMT, needle and syringe programmes, and peer education and outreach, including in detention centres and prisons. 6. Harm reduction should be a standard part of the police curriculum. Sensitization and advocacy should aim to educate police of the public health reasons for providing clean needles and syringes, peer education and MMT to PWID. Registration of drug users 7. The system of compulsory registration of drug users should be phased out because it is stigmatizing, drives PWID underground and away from services, and fails to effectively address relapse.58 Instead, voluntary community-based treatment options should be provided. 8.

Police should take a health-oriented view to encourage more drug users to come forward to access counselling and treatment for drug use, VCCT and HIV prevention information.

If the registration system continues, registration for drug treatment should only be under the MoH and personal information should be confidential and used solely for the purpose of treatment, not for police monitoring or criminal prosecution. This will encourage PWUD to register early for treatment and receive VCCT and HIV prevention education and services. Prisons and detention centres 10. A prison MMT programme should be established. Procedures should ensure continued access to MMT for people in police detention or prison. 11. Treatment and rehabilitation services should be offered to people convicted of drug use or possession offences so as to divert PWUD from the prison system. 12. Rehabilitation centres for drug users should be offered as a voluntary option and include effective evidence-based services for drug treatment and counselling in addition to physical, psychosocial and livelihood rehabilitation. Health care services 13. Community-based voluntary drug treatment services should be expanded. The National MMT Guideline should be fully implemented. Access to MMT and quality drug treatment counselling services should be expanded. 14. PWID should not be denied access to ART only on the grounds that they have not registered as drug users or undergone MMT initiation. 15. Drug use should be taken out of the criminal context and a new law and national policy for drug use should be developed that promotes harm reduction and treats drug dependence as a health condition.

People who inject drugs 54 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 5. MSM and transgender people 5.1 Context Criminal laws Sodomy is criminalized by Section 377 of the Penal Code 1860, which defines the \u2018unnatural offence\u2019 of carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal. The penalty for \u2018unnatural\u2019 sex is imprisonment for up to ten years, and a fine. Although this offence in theory can be applied to all genders and is not restricted to sodomy between men, the offence in effect is interpreted by police as criminalizing male consensual homosexual conduct (as well as other forms of sex considered \u2018unnatural\u2019).59 The Penal Code 1860 was inherited from the British colonial era and is based on the Indian Penal Code. Myanmar is the only country in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region that criminalizes sex between consenting adult males. The other countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam) were not British colonies so did not inherit the \u2018unnatural sex\u2019 provision from the British penal code. For example, in Cambodia and Lao PDR age of consent to sex is 15 for both heterosexual and homosexual sex.60 Protective laws There are no specific laws addressing the legal status of transgender persons and their ability to change gender on identification documents. This contrasts with other Asian countries including Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Singapore, which provide legal recognition to transgender or \u2018third gender\u2019 people. There are no laws protecting MSM or transgender persons from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity. For example, some cities in the Philippines prohibit discrimination on these grounds in employment and access to health care services.61 Law enforcement issues Police use public order laws against MSM and transgender people, particularly if they are suspected of involvement in sex work. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 55 Although the \u2018unnatural sex\u2019 law is rarely enforced, the existence of the offence complicates the delivery of effective HIV prevention services because it prevents community-based organizations (CBOs) from being registered with the state and discourages programme beneficiaries from accessing basic HIV services.62 The existence of the offence also makes MSM and transgender people vulnerable to abuse by the police. In 2013, an NGO (Asian Human Rights Commission) reported that police in Mandalay had been conducting an operation against MSM and transgender people who had been congregating in public places in the city: \u2026a group of around 20 (non-uniformed) men\u2014some police, others local administrators or other unidentified persons\u2014descended on the area outside the Sedona Hotel in Mandalay and assaulted a group of gay and transgender people there, pushing, hitting, handcuffing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a2d9395-2b4f-4b5b-b7aa-dce67e41fb22": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a2d9395-2b4f-4b5b-b7aa-dce67e41fb22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e3713ddbe069da8655afcf9a6b45508562243fd82709a23fb6e995124576aaa"}}, "hash": "8e3713ddbe069da8655afcf9a6b45508562243fd82709a23fb6e995124576aaa", "text": "them and pulling off their garments in public before loading them on to a number of vehicles. Once in custody, police continued to abuse the group of 11 detainees, hitting and kicking them constantly, stripping them naked in the public areas of the Mandalay Regional Police headquarters, photographing them, forcing them to hop like frogs, forcing them to clean shoes and tables, to walk up and down as if on a catwalk, uttering obscenities at them, and otherwise physically and psychologically demeaning them. One of those detained said that a police officer interrogated her at length about her sexual activities and preferences, where she usually hangs out, and later tried to lure her to come back with him after leaving the police station. Although many of those detained are later being released without charge, some have been threatened with, and others charged under, the 1945 Police Act, section 35(c), which stipulates that, \u201cAny person found between sunset and sunrise having his face covered or otherwise disguised, who is unable to give a satisfactory account himself\u2026 may be taken into custody by any police- officer without a warrant, and shall be punishable on conviction with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months\u201d. In one case, the details of which have been obtained by the AHRC, two accused each had to pay bribes of around 400,000 Kyat (about USD 420) to be released from a case under this section lodged by the police in the Aungmyay-thazan Township Court. They were informed that for a lesser amount of money they could be held for just one week instead of the full three-month period. Equally disturbing is that some of those who are being released are being forced to sign pledges beforehand that they will not go to public places as before or wear women\u2019s clothing.63 The police reportedly use the law to intimidate and extort bribes. In one such case in Yangon, a man who has sex with men was accused of soliciting and was arrested. Unable to pay a bribe, he was locked up and sexually assaulted by police. In another case, several MSM were arrested during the annual TaungByone festival near Mandalay, which attracts hundreds of MSM. They were eventually released without charge.64 In 2006, a study of 828 MSM and male sex workers found that 13 per cent of MSM and 30 per cent of male sex workers reported police harassment in the past 30 days; and 15 per cent of MSM and 26 per cent of male sex workers reported being beaten or forced to have sex in the past year. Police are reported to misuse existing laws to extort money from MSM, transgender people, and sex workers.65 In 2008, the 3rd National MSM Consultation and Capacity Building Meeting in Myanmar reported that HIV behaviour change communication cannot be explicit MSM and transgender people 56 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report because of government censorship policies. The meeting recommended that advocacy work be done with the government and police, and that censorship rules be changed to enable provision of sexual health information. In relation to male sex workers, the meeting participants recommended that advocacy be undertaken with law enforcement agencies and personnel to reduce levels of harassment and abuse, including male-on-male rape and sexual violence.66 5.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting Police abuses Section 377 of the Myanmar Penal Code in practice is only referred to by police in reference to sexual intercourse between two males, and this interpretation of the law enables the police and law enforcement officers to extort money from MSM and transgender people and commit verbal as well as physical and sexual abuse of arrested MSM and transgender people. Although actual prosecutions under Section 377 are rare (with the exception of cases involving children), the existence of this criminal offence adds to stigma and drives MSM and transgender people to live in a secretive and unprotected environment where access to HIV prevention information and opportunities to practise safer sex behaviour are constrained. MSM and transgender participants of the consultations expressed concern that Section 377 fuels negative attitudes and behaviour towards them, makes them vulnerable to police abuses and violates their human rights to expression of sexual orientation and gender identity. Section 377 is very well known among MSM and transgender people. As a result of fear of police abuses, MSM and transgender people either do not carry condoms or hide condoms on their person.

Transgender people in particular have concerns for their safety and vulnerability to police harassment. Transgender people experience frequent physical and verbal violence from the police. Many transgender people rely on sex work for income due to lack of alternative livelihood options. Transgender people report that sometimes the police have unprotected and unpaid sex with transgender sex workers. The police frequently harass transgender people if they are found walking on the street after dark and they are particularly vulnerable if they are carrying condoms or suspected of engaging in sex work. It was reported that some policemen extort money from MSM and transgender people and some require sex to be provided under threat of arrest. Section 377 is used as the basis to threaten jail if money or sex is not provided because the offence carries a heavy prison sentence. MSM and transgender people who are held in police detention are reportedly subject to harassment and assaults including sexual violence. Transgender detainees also face threats of sexual violence from other inmates and some police are said to turn a blind eye or even encourage this practice by telling the other inmates to \u2018teach a lesson to this achautma\u2019 (transgender persons). Inside police detention and prison, there are reports of humiliating treatment such as MSM and transgender persons being forced to strip naked and dance, beaten with a rod (Nan-Bat-Dote), ridiculed while they are naked, pressured to have sex and burnt with cigarettes. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 57 Criminal charges create difficulties for MSM and transgender people including maintaining their jobs, interruption to education, and financial hardships due to the need to pay bribes or fines. The negative experiences of MSM and transgender people with the police practices have led to mistrust in the judicial system. As a result, not many MSM and transgender people are willing to use legal aid services even when these are available (e.g. through the Equal Project). There was disagreement during the consultations and National Legal Review Meeting as to whether Section 377 should be completely repealed, or amended so that it does not apply to consenting adults but still applies to non-consensual conduct and to protect minors. MSM and transgender people are usually detained under Section 30(d) Rangoon Police Act or Section 35 of the Police Act for loitering or suspicious activity, or under Section 54 Code of Criminal Procedure which gives police the power to make an arrest without a warrant, or under Section 5(1) of the Restriction and Bond Act 1961. It was also reported that if a bribe is provided to the police, the charge is reduced to Section 47 Police Act (public nuisance), which has a lighter penalty than other public order offences. Freedom of movement is severely affected by police enforcement of public order provisions including Section 54, Section 30 Rangoon Police Act and Section 35(a)-(e) Police Act. Threat of arrest prevents MSM and transgender people from leading a regular life and enjoying freedom of movement at all hours. Transgender people and MSM cannot go to certain areas in towns that are more frequently associated with police raids. In some towns, police selectively enforce Section 268 of the Penal Code (public nuisance) against MSM and transgender people. Stigma and discrimination MSM and transgender communities do not enjoy equal rights to education, health care and livelihoods. Participants expressed the concern that young MSM and transgender people need to be supported to understand and safely express their sexual orientation and gender identity, and require access to non-discriminatory education and health services. Compared to more masculine MSM, transgender people face stronger stigma and discrimination both within their own families, communities, education institutions and work places. Transgender people face discrimination from a young age. Verbal teasing, abuse and harassment especially from male members of the community are a daily reality for openly homosexual and transgender people. Transgender people face discrimination in their dealings with government offices. In one example, a transgender person was snubbed several times at the immigration office when he went to renew his National Registration Card because he was wearing women\u2019s clothing and hairstyle. In Mandalay, religious authorities reportedly placed a warning notice stating that homosexual men are not allowed on the upper level of the place of worship, where only men are allowed. Society\u2019s attitude and behaviour towards MSM and transgender people should be non-discriminatory. Promotion of non-discrimination can be achieved through education, awareness raising, sensitizing mainstream media, and introduction of protective laws and policies.

The law itself is considered to be discriminatory in that there is no legal recognition of transgender or \u2018third gender\u2019 status. The National Registration Card, as a basic identity document for a citizen, should allow people to be photographed as they MSM and transgender people MSM and transgender people MSM and transgender people MSM and transgender people 58 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report prefer to present themselves, rather than having to revert back to a male persona to fit the \u2018male\u2019 description under \u2018sex\u2019 category. The Penal Code includes the offence of rape (Sections 375, 376) but this does not apply to sexual assault of males by males. MSM and transgender persons who are sexually assaulted by police are unable to claim rape under the Penal Code. MSM community networks identified the need for constitutional recognition of transgender status and constitutional protections from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. It was proposed that the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (2006) should be adopted as national policy by the State. Health services and representation in national health and HIV policy bodies Most health services are not sensitive to the specific needs of MSM and transgender communities. Many health care workers display prejudicial attitudes and behaviours towards these communities and do not treat them with respect or dignity, including at public health facilities. MSM and transgender communities are not represented in the governance of health service providers and do not have regular opportunities to provide inputs and feedback on the needs of their community to influence how health services are provided. Counselling sensitive to the needs of MSM and transgender people including for voluntary and confidential HIV counselling and testing (VCCT) is not yet available across the country. Representatives of the Myanmar MSM Network felt that the needs of MSM and transgender people are not adequately addressed by NSP II. MSM participants were critical of the content of NSP II. NSP II includes MSM only under the sexual transmission category and there are no specific targets or activities to address the wider health, human rights and social welfare needs of the MSM and transgender community. NSP II does not address the sexual orientation and gender identity rights of MSM and transgender people beyond their status as target groups for HIV prevention. There is inadequate, visible representation of MSM and transgender people at the national level to provide feedback and influence priorities of HIV and health policy coordination and planning. It is important to provide MSM and transgender people with opportunities for official representation in the national level health coordinating and decision-making bodies. The transgender community also face challenges when they try to become involved in implementing HIV prevention activities at local level. Transgender people face difficulties in applying for an overnight guest permit because of the way they dress and look. Education There is considerable pressure on MSM and transgender people to conform to the mainstream gender and sexuality norms when attending schools or colleges. Bullying or mistreatment is reported from other students as well as from teachers. Discrimination includes not being considered for scholarship opportunities abroad. Current teaching curricula do not address issues relating to sexual orientation, gender identity or stigma associated with MSM and transgender people. Employment Many transgender and openly gay men have limited work opportunities in the mainstream labour market because of stigma and discrimination and stereotyping of suitable work for MSM and transgender people. Openly homosexual and transgender National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 59 people often encounter financial hardship. MSM and transgender people are also constrained from expressing their sexual orientation and gender identity in workplaces due to existing gender norms and workplace regulations (e.g. dress codes for males and females). 5.3 Recommendations Criminal offences and police abuses 1. Section 377 of the Penal Code should be repealed or amended as it violates human rights to privacy and equality, fuels stigma and discrimination, encourages abuses by the police, impedes HIV prevention efforts and is an obstacle to access to health care. Section 377 should not apply to consensual sexual conduct between adults in private. 2. The police should be trained on the harmful impacts of law enforcement practices that interfere with HIV prevention. Police should support health promotion efforts to promote condom use instead of harassing MSM and transgender people for possession of condoms when they are searched during investigation or arrest. 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46c9823d-383d-4121-a770-b2ae09ba3e08": {"__data__": {"id_": "46c9823d-383d-4121-a770-b2ae09ba3e08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14e99c3d7d300ae8cf1fccfa19153ffce99b655f10036893978afcc5554af296"}}, "hash": "14e99c3d7d300ae8cf1fccfa19153ffce99b655f10036893978afcc5554af296", "text": "Police instructions should direct police not to enforce public order offences (e.g. loitering after dark) against MSM and transgender people unless they are implicated in genuinely criminal activities.

Disciplinary action should be taken against persons who commit acts of discrimination. 5. The law should enable transgender people to change their legal gender on identity and registration documents. One option is to enable transgender people to identify as a \u2018third gender\u2019 on legal documents, with equal rights as enjoyed by other citizens. Capacity building and inclusion in NSP II 6. Health care workers should be sensitized to the needs and human rights of MSM and transgender people to increase access to HIV testing, treatment, and sexual health services for MSM and transgender communities. 7. NSP II should recognize the sexual orientation and gender identity rights of MSM and transgender people as a fundamental principle of effective HIV prevention. 8. NSP II should support comprehensive responses to the needs of MSM and transgender people including action against stigma and discrimination in delivery of health services, and sensitization and training of health personnel to increase access to VCCT and sexual health services. 9. MSM and transgender voices should be heard though representation at national health coordinating and decision-making bodies to ensure interventions are tailored to their specific needs. MSM and transgender people 60 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 6 Women and girls 6.1 Context Legal and policy framework for gender and HIV Article 22 of the Constitution of the Union of Myanmar (2008) states that all citizens shall be equal before the law, regardless of race, religion, status, or sex, enjoy equal opportunities, enjoy the benefits derived from his labour in proportion to his contribution in manual or mental labour and have the right to inherit according to law. Article 32A of the Constitution states that the Union shall care for mothers and children. Myanmar has acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and is a signatory to the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action.67 However, domestic laws do not yet offer comprehensive legal protections of the rights of women and girls in general, or in the context of the specific gender issues raised by the HIV epidemic including violence protection. NSP II is informed by the principle of gender equality, and requires that interventions be gender-sensitive and informed by gender analysis.68 The National Strategic Plan for the Advancement of Women (2012\u20132021) is intended to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action. It includes the following actions relevant to HIV under the priority area of \u2018Women and Health\u2019: \uf0b7 Research and surveys on the role of women in decision making for HIV prevention, care and treatment, and women\u2019s access to and utilization of HIV prevention, care and treatment services. \uf0b7 To raise awareness of not only women but also men and teenagers on basic health, sexual and reproductive health, HIV and sexually transmitted infections, treatment, care and support, and to implement community-based initiatives by collaborating with women\u2019s organizations. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 61 \uf0b7 To reduce and eliminate customs, superstitions and beliefs that are obstacles to women\u2019s access to, and use of basic health, sexual and reproductive health care. \uf0b7 Expand rural area-oriented activities for basic health, sexual and reproductive health care, prevention, treatment, care and support of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The Government is developing a national Social Protection Strategy focused on the needs of women, children, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. A National Committee for the coordination of social protection is led by the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. The Penal Code Section 312 criminalizes abortion except when it is necessary to save the woman\u2019s life. There is no exception for women who have been raped. There is a large unmet demand for modern family planning methods. Unsafe abortions are a major contributor to high maternal mortality rates. Violence protection Myanmar does not have a domestic violence law. The only laws concerning sexual violence are sections of the Penal Code1860 and provisions against sexual exploitation in the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Law (2005). A process is underway led by the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement to develop a law on \u2018Anti- Violence Against Women\u2019. The Penal Code contains some provisions for crimes of violence against women including rape, abuse, and seduction and sex with under-age women.

Trafficking or trading women for prostitution, or enticing for sexual purpose are also crimes. Spousal rape is not considered a crime unless the wife is younger than 13 years (Section 375). Property and inheritance For Buddhist citizens, Myanmar Customary Law applies in the areas of marriage, succession and inheritance. Traditional understandings of gender roles influence the application of Customary Law. The rights of Buddhist women to gender equality are protected by the Buddhist Women's Special Marriage and Succession Act 1954. Under Myanmar Customary Law, a spouse can be automatically divorced if she/he has a sexually transmitted infection as it is considered as a sign of infidelity. A court has to decide who the injured party is, and that injured party may ask for compensation. Muslim Law and Hindu Law are applied by the respective communities in respect of marriage, succession and inheritance.69 The Christian Marriage Act, Burma Divorce Act and the Succession Act (regulating matters of inheritance) govern the rights of Christian women. Inheritance practices can vary according to local customary laws and in some remote areas women are denied inheritance rights.70 6.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting Financial disadvantage Women bear the burden of care for children and HIV-affected family members. Women living with HIV are ostracized from communities and are particularly disadvantaged in finding employment. \u2018Low-risk\u2019 women (who typically acquire HIV from husbands who engage in high-risk behaviour) are not well served by HIV prevention, care and support services.Women living with or affected by HIV often experience financial hardship, which can be addressed by social protection. Women and girls 62 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report Health care Representatives of Myanmar Positive Women\u2019s Group raised concerns at the community consultation of key populations from Mandalay and the north71 that pregnant women face difficulties in accessing prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMCT) services outside of big cities and towns. PMCT services are not well known in some areas and women report poor quality of counselling, lack of confidentiality, and poor antenatal care due to lack of skills and interest of service providers. Participants were also concerned that insufficient funding leads to HIV- positive pregnant women having to pay prohibitively expensive delivery fees. HIV- positive pregnant women face higher delivery charges at public hospitals (either for normal or caesarean delivery) compared to negative women. Women report stigma and discrimination by staff including midwives, nurses and other health care providers, and cleaners. Many HIV-positive pregnant women stay away from health services because of fear of breach of confidentiality and insensitive treatment by nurses and midwives. Many women deliver at home in rural and remote communities, and only find out about their HIV status when they fall sick. HIV-positive women experience difficulties in accessing reproductive health and family planning services. There is limited information on options for free or subsidized reproductive health and family planning services for HIV-positive women to enable them to make informed health decisions. Reproductive health care providers are not well informed about universal infection control procedures and many have unreasonable fears regarding the risk of infection from providing care to patients. There were reports from HIV positive women of cases where some of their peers were possibly pressured by counsellors, midwives, nurses and doctors not to have children, to undergo permanent sterilization or to take contraception. HIV-positive mothers are kept in a separate ward with infectious disease patients, rather than with other mothers. Property and inheritance Women are blamed for bringing HIV into the family and the shame associated with a stigmatized disease. In practice, the legal rights of HIV widows to inherit property from their husband are often denied. This may be because of lack of access to legal representation to ensure inheritance rights are enforced, or because customary inheritance rules are applied so as to benefit relatives of the deceased husband rather than the widow. 6.3 Recommendations 1. Violence protection laws and policies should address the needs of women and girls to be protected from violence in domestic and non-domestic contexts (e.g. sex workers). Marital rape should be criminalized. 2. Laws and policies should prohibit discrimination on the grounds of gender in the delivery of health and HIV services. 3. Policies should ensure gender-sensitive HIV services including the right of HIV-positive women to PMCT services, family planning and reproductive health services. Women and girls should have the right to decide on their family planning and reproductive health choices.

Women and girls 64 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 7. Children and young people 7.1 Context A recent study of the needs of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Myanmar found a high incidence of social and psychological consequences among HIV OVC. A much greater number of HIV OVC than their neighbouring children experienced family displacement from their original homes, child/sibling displacement and family dispersion. The study recommended establishment of community support programmes, creation of job opportunities to minimize social impact on affected families and provision of counselling and psychological support to HIV OVC.72 Another study on HIV orphans in Myanmar documented a range of adverse socioeconomic consequences such as school discontinuation, family dispersion, adverseeffects on family economies, stigma and discrimination.73 The Child Law 1993 (which is currently being updated) addresses child protection and guardianship issues. The Department of Social Welfare is revising the National Plan of Action for Children in collaboration with UNICEF and national partners. This revision includes a section on HIV OVC. Adolescent sexual health Myanmar\u2019s Strategic Plan for Reproductive Health (2008\u20132013) states the goal of the attainment of a better quality of life by improved reproductive health status of women, men, adolescents and youths. The Plan supports provision of contraceptives and reproductive health services to unmarried persons and adolescents.74 The National Strategic Plan for Adolescent Health and Development in Myanmar 2009\u20132013 states: \u201cUnmarried girls and young women are especially vulnerable to unwanted pregnancies because currently the services are not targeted to them and are limited to married women\u201d. To encourage young people to access services: \u2026service environments and health staff attitudes need to be adolescent friendly. Providing services alone is not sufficient to increase access and utilization. It is necessary to create demand among young people by both informing them that comfortable and convenient services are available and ensuring they understand the benefit of such services...Existing primary health National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 65 care services are to be reoriented with introduction in a phased way [of] adolescent friendly standardized service package...75 The Myanmar National Plan of Action for Children 2006\u2013201576 addresses HIV as follows: Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and Care of People Living with HIV/AIDS Activities such as dissemination of relevant health information regarding HIV/AIDS to adolescent boys and girls, provision of reproductive health services, voluntary testing for HIV/AIDS and counselling, and prevention of mother to child transmission will be carried out. Activities will also include establishment of youth friendly services for capacity building of health personnel and the community, surveillance of risk behaviour, counselling and care for people with risky behaviour, and for people who are at risk of getting HIV/AIDS. Age of consent issues The age of consent to sex is 14 years for females (Section 375, Penal Code). There is no specific age restriction on males engaging in sex. Sodomy is prohibited for all ages. There is no specific law or policy defining the age at which a young person can obtain an HIV test independently, without their parent\u2019s consent. It is important to clarify the legal age of capacity to independently request an HIV test, because young people who are at risk of HIV may be reluctant to test because of fear that their sexual or drug use conduct will be disclosed to their family. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child issued a General Comment in 2013 recommending that countries consider allowing children to consent to HIV testing and education and guidance on sexual health.77In other countries of Asia and the Pacific, laws or policies have been developed to clarify the age when young people can access HIV testing without parental consent. For example, in Viet Nam it is 16,Lao PDR 14,Nepal 14 andPapua New Guinea 13 years.78 The Child Law 1993 defines a child as under 16 years of age (this is currently under revision with the intent to raise the age to 18 so as to be consistent with the Convention on the Rights of the Child).

The views of the child shall be given due weight in accordance with his age and maturity, by those concerned.79 Section 89 of the Penal Code states that a guardian may consent to medical treatment for a person under 12 years of age.80 Reading the provisions of the Penal Code and the Child Law together suggests that persons over 12 years may exercise their own independent right to consent to testing or treatment, if they are of sufficient maturity to understand the nature and implications of the test or treatment. However there are no official guidelines confirming this interpretation. Account also needs to be taken of the Majority Act. No minor can enter into a legal contract until 18 years, which is the legal age of majority (Majority Act).81 Some medical practitioners may take the view that they should not test or treat a person under 18 years without parental consent. This points to the need for guidance to clarify the legal rights of children between the age of 12 and 18 years to consent to medical treatment independent of their parents. People under the age of 18 require parental consent to marry. Most marriages are conducted under religious laws.82 There are no age restrictions for access to methadone or needles and syringes.83 In practice, professional norms determine whether a minor can access HIV testing independent of their parents / guardians. These vary across the country.84 Children & Young people 66 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report There are no specific laws regarding the rights of minors to privacy or confidentiality of medical records or other personal information disclosed to health care workers. Information regarding a minor\u2019s health status or behaviours may be disclosed to parents at the discretion of health care workers. 7.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting Child protection Participants of the Mawlamyine community consultation raised concerns that there are very few care and support options for orphans and vulnerable children of HIV. According to participants, there are no government-run services for HIV orphans. Services are provided by small local civil society, self-help and religious groups. Such services have very limited resources and face constant risk of discontinuation due to lack of funds. Participants of the Mandalay and northern areas community consultation noted that the burden of caring for OVC usually falls to relatives or other community members who are often already struggling with their own financial issues. Participants shared the common challenge of not having a functioning guardianship system or other formal state mechanism to tackle this issue in many communities across the country. Lack of appropriate guardianship arrangement for orphans is a common problem. The Child Law exists for adoption and guardianship of orphans. However the law is not evenly enforced and many OVC lose their identity and links to their family and relatives. Although street children are the responsibility of the State under the law, most street children lack any support or care. Cases of neglect in caring for HIV orphans are common. Children of sex workers who are sentenced to prison, and who have no other family members to look after them often must rely on the goodwill of other sex worker families or local humanitarian groups or religious leaders for assistance and care. There is no formal mechanism or support from the government offered either at the court or throughout the legal process for the children of sex workers. OVC experience stigma and discrimination from the community. Many HIV orphans work as scavengers on the street or long hours at tea shops for less than a minimum wage. Participants were of the view that parents and the wider community should receive education on the rights of children and the laws protecting their rights, and that civil society organizations and local authorities should work together to raise awareness about the rights of children in the communities, especially targeting parents and guardians. There is currently no effective representation at the national level for raising the child protection, treatment, care and support issues of OVC. National registration Many OVC are unable to obtain a National Registration Card (NRC) when they come of age because they are unable to supply the information required for the NRC application. The NRC is required to obtain access to services from the State, to attend school, travel freely within or outside the country and to apply for employment. Household registration is also important for accessing services. Children who have lost both parents face difficulties in obtaining an NRC.

HIV-positive orphans without any guardian or care taker cannot access ART, because an adult care taker or guardian is regarded as necessary to ensure the child is adhering to treatment and monitoring side effects. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 67 The lack of free OI medicines in public hospitals is a problem for children who cannot afford the cost of treatments. ART medicines are generally not yet available in child formulations in Myanmar. Breaking the adult pill into a child\u2019s dose is common practice with no guarantee of the correct dosage. The National Guideline on treatment of HIV infection among children is not consistently implemented. Education Access to education can be difficult for children from HIV-affected households, regardless of their own HIV status. They experience discrimination from teachers and other students. Children living with HIV face problems in obtaining leave to go for health appointments, and they may be more frequently absent from school due to their health conditions. Private schools generally refuse to accept HIV-positive children as their students. The main reason for this is ignorance about the lack of HIV transmission risk through casual contact. The Ministry of Education does not have law, policy or directives on this issue yet. Discrimination experienced in private schools includes being forced to move schools, denial for school admission, and refusal to give sick leave to children who need to attend HIV treatment centres. Many parents do not want their children to play with children of sex workers or children suspected of having HIV. Teachers ask HIV-positive children of sex workers to sit at the back of the class or not to play with other children. The children of sex workers are discriminated against in schools to the point that these children no longer want to attend school and some drop out. 7.3 Recommendations 1. The Child Law 1993 should be updated and enforced to ensure OVC have access to protection, guardianship, care and support. Orphans, street children and other vulnerable children should be cared for by the State in an appropriate setting (either community or institution based) and educated to their full potential. Regulations and guidelines should be established on procedures for HIV-positive children and children from HIV-affected households including orphans to access health, education, protection and care including shelter. 2. Children should be provided with education about their rights so that they can demand fulfilment of their rights including the right to health, and the voices of children and young people should be heard in policy-making processes. 3. The Government should ensure systems are in place to support all OVC including children in HIV-affected households to have birth registration, household registration and a National Registration Card. 4. The Ministry of Health should issue Guidance confirming that sexual and reproductive health services including HIV and STI testing can be provided to young people who are 12 years or older without parental consent, if they are assessed by the health care provider to be sufficiently mature. 5. Policies on HIV prevention, care and support should include specific provisions for young key affected populations including young MSM and transgender people, young female sex workers and young PWUD as well as young internal and foreign migrants. 6. The Ministry of Education should issue a policy prohibiting discrimination against children living with HIV by public or private schools. 7. The MoH should revise the ART eligibility criteria to remove the requirement that an HIV-negative adult be available to provide treatment adherence support to the child. An HIV-positive parent should be sufficient to provide adherence support to the child. MoH policy should guarantee the uninterrupted supply of ARVs in child formulations to ensure treatment efficacy and prevent unwanted side effects.

The proposed new patent law will provide a monopoly to the patent holder for twenty years, which means that the pharmaceutical company that owns the patent for a drug can determine the price of the patented drug during the twenty-year patent term. This has particular relevance to third-line ARVs and new ARVs that come on the market. It also has relevance to new drugs for other diseases for which many people living with HIV require treatment, such as hepatitis C, cancers and opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) website states as follows:85 In Myanmar, there is presently no law or at least no law in operation on patents and industrial designs. This means that production, (commercial) use and trade in goods is possible without permission of the people/companies who may hold the patents or design rights outside Myanmar... Having repealed the Patent and Design Act of 1945, the only law relating to patents and designs still in force is the Burma Patents and Designs (Emergency Provisions) Act 1946... nothing has been applicable since the replacement of the substantive Act of 1945. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the national Drug Law has been promulgated since October 1992 and notifications were issued in August 1993 pertaining to drug registration, drug manufacturing, importing, selling and distribution, labelling and advertisements... However, these laws do not include National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 69 patenting in the field of pharmaceutical process and products.Therefore, it is currently not possible to apply for patent and design registration in Myanmar. Drafting the new legislation for patents\u2026 to come into line with the TRIPS Agreement has been carried out by the Attorney General\u2019s Office in cooperation with Ministry of Science and Technology. However, patent protection in the pharmaceutical area may not be possible at least until the year 2016. Under the World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of International Property Rights (TRIPS), least developed countries (LDCs) are not required to have patent laws in place that comply with TRIPS until July 2021.86 Myanmar is regarded as an LDC by WTO. Therefore, WTO does not require Myanmar to introduce or enforce patent protections for pharmaceutical products until 2021. Although a patent law may be introduced before 2021, to enable importing of generic medicines to continue, a decision could be reached not to enforce patents that relate to pharmaceuticals until 2021. The TRIPS Agreement allows countries to take measures to ensure that the approach taken to implementing TRIPS requirements in domestic laws does not interfere with public health objectives. These are known as \u2018TRIPS flexibilities\u2019. The WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health (2001) affirms the right of poor countries to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities to protect public health and to enhance access to essential medicines. To ensure ongoing access to generic medicines, it is important that any new national patent law incorporates mechanisms to allow the Government to exercise TRIPS flexibilities such as compulsory licensing, parallel importing, and a mechanism to import generic versions of patented medicines. A Core Working Group has been established to ensure TRIPS flexibilities are included in the new draft patents law. Members of the group include concerned Ministries (Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Information and Ministry of Commerce), United Nations agencies (UNDP, UNAIDS, UNICEF and WHO), NGOs, civil society and a law firm. A national consultation meeting with all stakeholders including Ministries, United Nations agencies, NGOs and civil society was held in December, 2012. The Core Working Group meeting for TRIPS flexibilities was convened in August 2013 and an information session for parliamentarians was convened in October 2013. In 2014, upon receipt of the current draft of the Patent Section, UNAIDS on behalf of the Core Working Group organized a technical review of the draft law. Subsequently, the Core Working Group then relayed the comments from the review to the Ministry of Science and Technology. 8.2 Issues raised during consultations and the National Review Meeting The drafting of the new law on patents is underway and it is understood that the Government is keen to introduce the law soon because it will encourage foreign investment in the economy. The need for flexibilities to be included in Myanmar\u2019s new patents legislation was confirmed during the National Legal Review Meeting.

Ensure that TRIPS flexibilities including compulsory licensing and parallel importing are fully addressed in the new patents law so that access to medicines is not restricted when Myanmar commences recognition of pharmaceutical patents. 2. Consider extending the date of exclusion of pharmaceutical products from patent protection until 1 July 2021, unless Myanmar graduates from Least Developed Country status before that date. 3. Not agree to enter trade or investment agreements that impose \u2018TRIPS-plus\u2019 requirements that could restrict future access to generic medicines. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 71 9. Cross-cutting issues The literature review, consultations and National Legal Review Meeting identified key areas requiring action, including in relation to: \uf0b7 Law and policy reform priorities; \uf0b7 Police practices; \uf0b7 Capacity building; and \uf0b7 Access to justice, through legal aid services, legal literacy and legal empowerment programmes. Law and policy reform Most of the key laws that affect the rights of people living with HIV and key populations are old laws from the nineteenth and mid-twentieth century that need to be updated to reflect contemporary social contexts and the realities of the HIV epidemic. Some laws date back to the British colonial era (such as the Penal Code 1860, Prisons Act 1894, Rangoon Police Act 1899 and Myanmar Excise Act 1917). There was interest from some parliamentarians attending the National Legal Review Meeting in developing a new national HIV law for Myanmar. Several countries in the region have enacted comprehensive national HIV laws that address the human rights and public health aspects of the HIV epidemic in one piece of legislation (e.g. China, Cambodia, Fiji, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Viet Nam).87 India and Nepal are also considering comprehensive HIV/AIDS Bills. In considering law reform options, other approaches also require consideration, such as inclusion of HIV within general laws and policies relating to human rights, public health, gender equality and social protection. It should be recognised that law reform is a long-term strategy. Myanmar is currently undergoing a period of significant change with multiple laws and diverse areas of social and economic policy undergoing significant reforms concurrently. It may be several years before laws relating to people living with HIV and key Cross-cutting issues Cross-cutting issues 72 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report populations are given priority in parliament. However, much can be achieved in advance of law reform, for example through policy innovation, capacity building and partnerships between community-based organizations and law enforcement bodies to promote a shared understanding of how a rights-based approach supports HIV prevention objectives. Police practices A major theme arising from consultations was the difficulties created by police conduct that impedes HIV prevention efforts. Punitive police practices that were reported included harassment, extortion and arbitrary detention, which deter key populations from accessing the means of HIV prevention (condoms and clean needles and syringes) and drive key populations underground and away from services. Police instructions require updating to address the role of police in supporting HIV prevention with key populations. This can occur immediately while also pursuing the longer-term objective of reforming the laws on sex work, drug use and homosexual conduct. Capacity building Consultations identified the need for capacity building of the justice sector and health care workers in HIV and human rights. Myanmar should consider examples of good practice in capacity building from other countries in the region, for example:88 \uf0b7 In Thailand, a sex worker-led organization (SWING) has delivered HIV training to police cadets and works in partnership with tourist police to improve responses to violence directed at sex workers. \uf0b7 The PoroSapot project in Papua New Guinea delivers sensitization to police on HIV and human rights using MSM and sex workers as educators. In 2011, the project reached over 500 police in three provinces. \uf0b7 India\u2019s Human Rights Law Network convened a National Judicial Colloquium on HIV/AIDS and the Law in 2007, which brought together over 50 judges from the various High Courts and the Supreme Court of India. \uf0b7 People living with HIV networks in India have worked with medical associations to train health care workers to reduce stigma and discrimination in health care settings. Legal aid, legal empowerment and access to justice Lessons from the existing legal aid services provided by NGOs such as the Equal Project, MDM and Myanmar Legal Aid Network (MLAW) can be applied to inform approaches to reaching communities with legal services, including paralegal services and human rights education.

Recommendations 1. Capacity building is required to strengthen the role of lawyers, police, judges, health-care workers and parliamentarians in supporting human rights-based HIV responses. Each of these actors needs to understand the public health and human rights rationale for developing protective legal frameworks for people living with HIV and key populations. It is particularly important to provide training for police on HIV and human rights to address police abuses and to ensure that police act to protect and promote the rights of key populations. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 73 2. The Government and donors should support community legal empowerment and \u2018access to justice\u2019 programmes that provide key populations with expanded access to free legal information, advice and representation,paralegal services, legal and human rights education, legal advice hotlines and access to rapid response teams to address incidents of violence or other serious rights violations. Key populations should be made aware of their rights and empowered to demand justice if their rights are violated. 3. Key populations should have access to independent and confidential complaints procedures if they experience harassment, extortion, unfair treatment or violence from the police, prison guards or other law enforcement officials. The capacity of the National Human Rights Commission to address HIV-related complaints should be strengthened. Staff of the Commission should be trained on HIV-related human rights issues and the nature of rights violations commonly experienced by key populations. Cross-cutting issues 74 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 10 Options for the way forward 10.1 Mechanisms for defining priorities and on-going planning Mechanisms at the national level need to be established to agree priorities and strategies to drive forward the legal and human rights agenda for HIV. These should be located within the existing architecture of the national HIV response (e.g. a Working Group of the Technical and Strategy Group for HIV of the Myanmar Health Sector Coordinating Committee) and within parliamentary committee processes. For parliamentarians, at the beginning of 2014, a separate joint Parliament and Community Network Consortium Committee on HIV and Human Rights has been established. In addition the Parliamentary Committees on Population and Social Development, Rule of Law, and Human Rights may be appropriate bodies for discussion of HIV issues. 10.2 Immediate priorities: 2014\u20132015 A manageable number of priorities should be identified where progress could be achieved within a two-year period. For example, the following issues could be pursued, with progress monitored by a national committee with government, civil society and United Nations representation: Options for the way forward National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 75 Law reform Possession of needles and syringes MoH should give immediate priority to amendment of the Excise Act 1917 to decriminalize possession of needles and syringes to support the scale-up of the national needle and syringe programme. Patents Bill A Patents Bill was drafted in 2013 and is due to be considered by parliament in 2014. A 2013 WTO decision sets the deadline for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) such as Myanmar to comply with TRIPS as 2021. Myanmar could maximize access to ARVs and other medicines by delaying commencement of patent provisions relating to pharmaceuticals until 2021. NAP should be actively monitoring progress of the Patents Bill including the commencement date for provisions relating to pharmaceuticals to ensure that all TRIPS flexibilities are incorporated in the draft.89 Policy reform National guidance on non-discrimination and confidentiality NAP (preferably in partnership with the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission) should develop guidance on non-discrimination on the grounds of HIV status and confidentiality of HIV status for endorsement by relevant sectors e.g. MoH and the ministries responsible for education and employment. Initially this guidance could focus on the priority areas of health care, employment, and the provision of education. Other issues such as insurance, finance, funerals and housing could be addressed at a later stage. Although such guidance would not by itself be legally binding, it could provide a clear indication of conduct considered acceptable by government. The government could direct all public sector bodies to comply with the guidelines and also encourage private sector bodies and professional associations to endorse the guidelines. The relevant public sector agencies could also be required to report within a given period on measures taken to establish a process to enable people living with HIV to lodge complaints if guidelines are breached, and options for making responsibilities legally enforceable.

ARV eligibility criteria ARV eligibility criteria reportedly disadvantage PWID, mobile populations (including sex workers), and children, either through the wording of the criteria or the way the criteria are understood and enforced. To address concerns, NAP should clarify that: \uf0b7 PWID should not be denied access to ART only on the grounds that they have not registered as drug users or undergone MMT initiation. This is particularly an issue for PWID seeking access to ART in areas where no MMT programme exists. \uf0b7 Children with HIV should not need to be supervised by an HIV-negative parent to be able to access ARVs. Criteria should permit the adult who provides treatment support to the child to be HIV-positive. The presence of an HIV-positive parent should be sufficient to provide support to ensure the child adheres to treatment regimens. 76 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report \uf0b7 Mobile populations (including sex workers) should have a right to refill their ART prescription at any ART distribution site in Myanmar. Access to medicines for people in police detention or prisons Procedures should be established to ensure continued access to ARVs, medicines for OIs (particularly TB), and MMT for people in police detention or prison. MoH and MoHA should collaborate to ensure police instructions are issued and enforced to address access to treatments and MMT while in police custody, and to ensure that a prison MMT programme is established consistent with the national MMT Guidelines. Reproductive health rights of positive women NAP should issue guidelines for health care workers which stresses the rights of HIV-positive women to family planning and reproductive health choices and for health care workers to provide counselling, information and support to HIV positive women to make their own choices. Law enforcement Policing of key populations Interventions should be designed to address the role of police in supporting HIV prevention with key populations in specific \u2018hotspot\u2019 localities. This will require national and local level leadership from within the Myanmar Police Force, and a willingness to work through partnership approaches involving local health authorities, key populations and local police at township level. Activities could include: \uf0b7 Revision and updating of police instructions: A comprehensive instruction relating to HIV prevention and policing of all key populations could be developed. Police instructions need to address: o Not harassing/arresting sex workers, MSM and transgender people for carrying condoms; o Not harassing/arresting PWID or peer educators for carrying needles and syringes; o Not arbitrarily enforcing public order offences, Section 377 of the Penal Code or prostitution offences to harass or extort money from key populations; o Not interfering with HIV prevention delivered through peer education and outreach; and o Ensuring access to ARVs, OI medicines and methadone for people after arrest. \uf0b7 Pilot sites could be selected with a focus on epidemic hotspots to monitor how police instructions are enforced. This may involve reviving local arrangements that were in place for needle and syringe programmes and extending this model to other key populations. For example, this could require health authorities working with local law enforcement bodies in the following activities: o Convening of regular coordination meetings of representatives of police, the local health authority, local HIV NGOs and key populations. The objective of these meetings would be to strengthen coordination of responses to HIV prevention among key populations in each district or township. o Lessons learned from evaluation of pilot sites could be used to inform a scaled-up \u2018national police-community HIV partnership\u2019 programme. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 77 Capacity building Implementation of the new laws, policies and police instructions described above will require targeted capacity building efforts. For example, police will need to be trained on new or updated police instructions that require them to work in partnership with health authorities to support needle and syringe programmes and condom distribution efforts. Training of health care workers will be important to ensure new policies on non-discrimination, confidentiality, reproductive rights and ARV eligibility/access are understood and applied. Resources should also be available to enable community networks to educate people living with HIV and other key populations about their rights under these new policies. Access to justice Ensuring that existing legal aid services are maintained is an immediate priority.

The review also identified existing provisions of laws that should be reviewed and amended / repealed to support HIV responses, including provisions in the Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949, Narcotics Law, Penal Code, Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases Law, Prisons Act and the Excise Act 1917.It may take a decade or more to address all issues through parliament. However, some laws may already be subject to reform processes, so intervention to ensure HIV-related factors are taken into account may be feasible in the next one to two years. For example, the Patents Bill and a National Human Rights Commission Bill are currently being drafted and some aspects of the narcotics legislation are also undergoing review. Anti-discrimination legislation A national law prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of HIV status (particularly in employment, health care and education) should be an overarching priority for government, but it is unclear how or when an opportunity to introduce such a law will arise in parliament. Possibilities for anti-discrimination legislation include: \uf0b7 A provision in the National Human Rights Commission Bill or regulations that clarify that the Commission has a mandate to accept complaints for HIV- related discrimination; \uf0b7 A provision in a new law on disability discrimination; \uf0b7 Inclusion of non-discrimination provisions in the Labour Law or Penal Code that extend to health status and disability generally, or HIV status specifically; \uf0b7 A general provision in the Constitution relating to non-discrimination on the grounds of health status and/or disability, which is defined to include HIV, or a general provision on the right to health; \uf0b7 Enactment of a stand-alone national HIV law. 78 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report Comprehensive national HIV law and other laws affecting key populations The National Legal Review identified the option of enacting a comprehensive rights- based national HIV law following the models of other countries such as Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR. However, this is probably a long-term project for Myanmar noting that it is an ambitious undertaking and other countries such as Nepal, India and Pakistan have been discussing HIV Bills for five to ten years with little progress. Parliamentarians should also consider other models for achieving rights-based law reform such as the inclusion of rights to confidentiality and consensual HIV testing in the Communicable Disease Law or a new general health law, rather than enacting a new HIV-specific law for which it may be difficult to garner support. For these and other legislative enactments / amendments (such as reform of the laws on prostitution, narcotics and \u2018unnatural sex\u2019 and introduction of legal recognition of \u2018third gender\u2019 status) it may take some years before an opportunity for parliamentary action arises without undue risk of a backlash potentially resulting in a more punitive outcome for key populations. At this stage it is important that parliamentarians and officials are equipped to identify opportunities for proposing changes to relevant legislation as they arise, so they can intervene with proposals in an informed and timely manner. For example, opportunities are likely to arise for revising the Penal Code in coming years. Parliamentarians and the NAP should be fully briefed to make the public health and human rights case for amendment of Section 377 of the Penal Code, enabling HIV prevention interventions to reach MSM. Law enforcement The longer-term law enforcement agenda should focus on enforcement of the new protective laws introduced to advance the rights of people living with HIV and key populations. Enforcement may require intervention of police or prosecutors in the case of serious violations of rights. The Myanmar National Human Rights Commission may have a role in providing redress for some rights violations. Other cases may be more appropriately dealt with through establishing new administrative mechanisms for handling complaints. Processes for addressing complaints of rights violations need to be developed that are low cost, accessible, speedy and confidential. This is a priority particularly in the health care sector. For example, hospitals could establish patient complaints offices to receive and respond to complaints of discrimination or breach of confidentiality of HIV status. Developing mechanisms to address health care complaints is a broader health systems issue that goes beyond HIV and will need to be sustainable for the long term.

Communities will need to be educated about their rights under the new laws and policies that are introduced. Integrating HIV-related issues into the curriculum for police training and law schools would ensure improved understanding of the role of the law and law enforcement in providing an enabling environment for HIV responses. This should include education about the importance of harm reduction approaches in addressing HIV acquired through injecting drug use. Judges would benefit from opportunities to learn from their peers. In India, judicial training on HIV-related issues has been provided and national meetings have been held on HIV-related issues for the judiciary. A similar approach could be considered in Myanmar. The Judicial Handbook on HIV, Human Rights and the Law published in 2013 by UNAIDS could be translated into Myanmar language and used as a resource for training. Capacity development of parliamentarians may include study tours (e.g. to observe how community-based models of harm reduction operate in Malaysia) or attendance at regional events such as HIV-related meetings of the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development (AFPPD). AFPPD provides a range National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 79 of resources and access to a regional network of parliamentarians interested in human rights and HIV. Access to justice Provision of legal services to people living with HIV and key populations needs to be part of the broader effort to establish a sustainable legal aid system for low- income populations in Myanmar. This will require engaging the mainstream legal profession on HIV-related human rights issues, for example through the Bar Council, and potentially also international law firms with an interest in providing pro bono services such as DLA Piper. International legal assistance may also be available for specific issues such as litigation to challenge controversial laws such as Section 377 from legal and human rights NGOs such as the Human Dignity Trust. It should be a longer-term objective to include HIV in clinical legal education models that use the law departments of Myanmar\u2019s universities to train students to provide paralegal support for marginalized populations. 10.4 Indicators of success Actions to improve the legal and policy environment for HIV responses Issue Examples of indicators of success for priority actions Leadership and coordination Multi-sectoral HIV legal and human rights working group established / number of meetings held.

Legal Review Report IFinal Report 111 Annex VI Summaries of NGO & Community Consultation Meetings 1. NGO consultation 21 participants from INGOs and local NGOs attended the meeting on 23 October 2013 in Yangon. 1. Policing of people with inject drugs Police practices impede drug users access to needles and syringes. Intensification of police activity in the last two years means more drug users are being arrested. Ten per cent of MDM\u2019s HIV-positive drug users on ART in jail. Although possession of needles and syringes is not charged directly by the police, possession of injecting equipment leads to further investigative efforts. More rigorous enforcement of restrictions on import and use of pain relief drugs is a problem. Peer outreach workers do not face much problem with police harassment unless the peer educators are using drugs at the time of police raids of shooting galleries. Even with the availability of more funds for harm reduction, programmes are constrained to expand coverage and meet targets because of the current legal environment. 2. Sex workers and possession of condoms Possession of condoms is less of a police concern than possession of syringes. There has not been any noticeable increase in police activity regarding condom possession or sex work. Increase in sex work business along the north-east corridor from Tachileik to Myawaddy has been noted with higher frequency of trafficking and rotation of sex workers. Anti-trafficking law is not enforced properly. If sex workers fear carrying condoms, this concern stems more from the overall legal environment of criminalization of sex work rather than the police practice of arresting sex workers on the basis of condom possession alone.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94d6f9e6-51ad-4d30-bcff-ca23ca70cbc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "94d6f9e6-51ad-4d30-bcff-ca23ca70cbc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f28833f088303c3d0df0034c1cf112b737f0b029207ef4296b505c482b3f3547"}, "2": {"node_id": "e585e8d9-367e-4e81-b7f9-063e134f503f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "307b4757a43b84bd7f918d280e8e6535edd1db71025e9c8361ab8534b77cad87"}}, "hash": "1b9c04c18b853aeb5b2923fd99b205dea46972a56557fa2af47950e3db94815f", "text": "Abuses of sex workers by police and military personnel happens because of illegal status of sex work, lack of access to legal aid for sex workers and power imbalance between sex workers and law enforcement.

Quality of health care in public sector PSI & UNDP conducted a survey of MSM and transgender community. Findings indicate challenges at health facilities of double charging, stigma and discrimination. While not a written policy, current provider practice does not favour active drug users for ART, and being an active user is a de facto disqualifier for ART. Myanmar does not follow international guidelines on treatment of HIV-positive drug users. Referral of HIV-positive prisoners or detainees to public hospitals under MoH is a process fraught with many difficulties as the prison department cannot provide security and has to request the police department which can take considerable time with uncertain outcome.

Community Consultations (These are summary notes: full copies of Consultation Reports are available from 3N) 1. Yangon Community Consultation The community consultation was conducted in Yangon from 2\u20133 September 2013 attended by 40 individuals representing key populations and national networks of key population groups. 1. Female sex workers Sex workers are hesitant to attend health services because of lack of confidentiality, poor quality of care and discrimination. Access to services is restricted due to stigma and discrimination against sex workers. Health care providers are reluctant to prescribe ART to sex workers due to the mobile nature of their work. When sex workers are held in prison or police detention, they miss doses of ARVs. Lack of compliance among the local police at township level with the Administrative Order (2000) directing police not to use condoms as evidence in prosecution of sex workers: Local police still searched and used the possession of condoms as grounds for police harassment or extortion. The Suppression of Prostitution Act1949 and the threat of arrest inhibit sex workers to access services relating to reproductive health and HIV. Many sex workers do not have a National Registration Card. Police arbitrarily arrest women merely based on their \u2018reputation as a prostitute\u2019. Laws and police practices fuel society\u2019s existing stigma and discrimination against sex workers, encourages acts of violence and fosters a clandestine sex work environment, which is counter to the health goal of HIV prevention. By 2030, sex work should be viewed and treated like any other job. Sex work should be accepted by the society as a livelihood. The Suppression of Prostitution Act 1949 should be abolished, so that the 100% Targeted Condom Programme can be implemented, violence against sex workers can be reduced, stigma and discrimination against sex workers can be lowered, and sex workers can confidently 114 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report access health services. If the Act is not abolished, suggestions were made for a less punitive approach to law enforcement including to reduce penalties, provide legal aid, reduce police abuses, and provide access to ART in prisons / detention. Rehabilitation centres should offer marketable skills on running a small business. 2. People who inject drugs (PWID) Even though there is a directive from Police Force headquarters not to make arrests for possession of needles and syringes, PWID still face challenges in accessing clean needles and syringes openly and safely. Confiscation of needles for lab investigation and submission as evidence is still commonly practised by the police under Section 33 of the 1917 Excise Act. Law enforcement views drug users as criminals and this view has influenced the perspective of health care providers to a large extent. As a result, discrimination against drug users (injecting or otherwise) is common in medical settings. Drug users are given less priority when considering ART eligibility in both public and NGO sector. If PWID relapse during our registered treatment process, they are still charged under Section 16 for possession. The information requirement to register for methadone treatment such as household registration form (Form No.10) and occupation of drug user is a barrier to register. Drug users in prison lose access to MMT. Section 33(d) Excise Act should be abolished; coverage of methadone services should be expanded and the National MMT Guideline should be fully implemented; Registration for drug treatment should only be under the Ministry of Health and information should be confidential and used solely for the purpose of treatment, not for criminal prosecution. This will encourage drug users to register early for treatment and receive VCCT and HIV prevention education and services; Section 16(c) Narcotics Law 1993 should be amended to provide protection for a registered drug user from being charged with criminal offence due to relapse; access to comprehensive treatment services should be assured once a drug user has registered for treatment under Section 15. Prophylaxis and treatment of hepatitis B and C, and TB among drug users should also be prioritized. Drug use should be taken out of criminal context and a new law or policy for drug use should be established from the viewpoint of drug", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1308aa3-59e3-4c46-9d92-1188103d4f0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1308aa3-59e3-4c46-9d92-1188103d4f0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National HIV Legal Review Report: Review of Myanmar's Legal Framework and its Effect on Access to Health and HIV Services for People Living with HIV and Key Affected Populations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-hiv-legal-review-report-review-myanmars-legal-framework-and-its-effect-access-health-and-hiv-services-people", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb40071823975bc1875dfe5b5dbe037c8fbc516dc7a3125da283f3819f7f2c42"}}, "hash": "eb40071823975bc1875dfe5b5dbe037c8fbc516dc7a3125da283f3819f7f2c42", "text": "use as a health condition. Quality of drug counselling services should be improved. 3. Men who have sex with men (MSM) & Transgender (TG) Section 377 Penal Code in practice applies only to sexual intercourse between two males, and this loose interpretation of the law enables the police and law enforcement to extort money and commit verbal as well as physical and sexual abuse on MSM & TG, and drives these people to live in a secretive and unprotected environment where access to HIV information, condoms and opportunities to practice safer sex are constrained.NSP IIincludes MSM only within the sexual transmission category but does not address their human rights issues, only their status as target group for HIV prevention. Participation of TG in national level coordinating bodies is not yet visible. Anti-discrimination laws and policies should be developed for sexual orientation and gender identity in education, health, work and social settings. Section 377 of Myanmar Penal Code should be abolished as it directly violates the right of the person to express his/her own sexual orientation and gender identity in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, fuels society\u2019s stigma and discrimination towards their community, and encourages abuses by the police; or should be amended to apply only if the act is not consensual between adults or if it is between an adult and a child. Extortion and other police abuses should be prevented. The Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (2006) should be adopted as a national policy by the State. The Constitution should address transgender identity and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 115 identity. Police/law enforcement, health, education, labour etc. should be made fully aware of sexual orientation and gender identity rights. TG and MSM community should also be made aware of their rights and empowered to demand justice if their rights are not being met. 4. People living with HIV (PLHIV) There is no specific HIV law and no mandatory HIV workplace policy in Myanmar to give protection to an HIV-positive person for his/her rights to health, education, livelihood, and a life free from stigma and discrimination. Discrimination including mandatory HIV testing is widespread. Quality of care and counselling is poor. Access to OI treatments is unreliable. An HIV law should be enacted to protect the rights of PLHIV including from discrimination, to explicitly assign the accountability for protection and ensuring their rights, and to establish a justice mechanism that provides remedies for any breach of the rights of PLHIV. Awareness should also be raised among PLHIV about their protection rights. A responsive and reliable feedback mechanism should be designed and set up for HIV-affected community to provide feedback on quality of services, service providers, programme or intervention on HIV implemented by public, private and NGO sectors; and to seek redress for any violation of their rights or malpractice. Raising awareness and capacity building of law enforcement and judiciary should occur so that they understand the human rights aspect of PLHIV and key populations affected by HIV, and the public health imperative of working together with these communities rather than suppressing them. Other priorities include: specific implementation plan and budget for stigma and discrimination reduction; regulations and guidelines should be established on procedures for HIV-positive children and children from HIV-affected households, including orphans, to access health, education, protection and care including shelter. HIV-positive women and women affected by HIV must be assured of equal rights like any other HIV negative woman to access PMCT services, family planning and reproductive health services; and they must have the right to decide on their family planning and reproductive health choices without any coercion. Clear policies and regulations concerning the quality of health service provision in both public and private sector including jails, prisons, and detention/rehabilitation centres should be established. Workplace policy for HIV should be enforced in both private and public sector so that workers can access HIV prevention services such as health education and confidential HIV counselling and testing, and HIV-positive workers can be protected from stigma and discrimination in the workplace and dismissal or forced retirement on the ground of HIV-positive status, and have the right to access necessary health care. Human rights defenders and legal counsels for HIV-positive people, including the key affected populations, should be made available and accessible. 2.

Female sex workers By 2030, we want ourprofession to be legal and sex workers to become registered professionals; to be free from stigma and discrimination and have equal rights to education, social and economic opportunities as any other citizen and equal access to health care; everyone to be treated equally in front of the law; and judiciary and 116 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report law enforcement to follow the rule of law; legal literacy and legal aid services are required. The Suppression of Prostitution Act should be rewritten, but if it is not possible to repeal it entirely it should be reviewed and revised to prevent unnecessary punitive acts against sex workers. Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 7, which are the most commonly used Sections, should be reviewed and clarified to prevent varied interpretation and application by the police. The Police Directive on not using condoms as evidence at the court for prostitution offences needs to be more comprehensive and explicit to protect sex workers against police harassment on the grounds of condom possession, as this still frequently occurs. Police practices regarding sex workers should be regulated and disciplined, e.g. abusing Code of Criminal Procedure Section 54 on arrest without warrant, detention based only on reputation without evidence of solicitation in public, not following procedures during arrest, fabricating or falsifying evidence, coercing and forcing a confession of guilt, misusing and failing to return valuable personal items upon release from jail/prison, taking bribes and manipulating the case in favour of the ones giving bribes. Liberal use by the police of loitering after dark offences of the Police Act should be curbed when sex workers are not committing any crime or harassing anyone in public. Having to give small bribes to the police at the jail or security personnel at the prison to send food or medicines inside jail/prison should no longer happen. Sex worker peer educators should be able to conduct group peer education sessions at the sex work places without worrying about police harassment or arrest. Police have taken advantage of such gatherings in the past to either harass or arrest sex workers, which made it difficult for peer educators to get the trust of the sex workers. Relaxation of ART access criteria should be done so that mobile HIV-positive sex workers are referred to the nearest ART provider outside of the initial ART site, and have flexibility to access and refill their ART prescription as they move from one place to another. For example, HIV-positive sex workers should be issued a treatment ID card that they can use to access treatment at ART service providers anywhere in the country. Jailed sex workers require continuing access to ART inside the jail. Ministry of Home Affairs as a focal for prisons department should arrange to provide PLHIV inside the prison including HIV-positive sex workers with ART adherence support. Stigma and discrimination against HIV-positive sex workers inside the prisons need to be addressed. Sex workers should also be given an avenue to complain against irregularities and unlawful practices by the police, law enforcement and judiciary. Free legal aid services for sex workers (e.g. similar to Equal Project) should be made available in other areas outside Yangon. There are laws and conventions to protect the rights of women such as the 2005 Anti-trafficking in Persons Law and CEDAW to protect the rights of women against trafficking and all forms of discrimination, including rights of sex workers to be protected from trafficking and exploitation. These laws should be fully adopted and enforced to protect the sex workers from exploitation by their employers, agents and even by persons close to law enforcement who are sometimes involved in human trafficking. Sex workers should be educated on all laws protecting women including assault provisions of the Penal Code and where to complain to seek redress. Focal department or civil society organization or a body should be identified, trained and sensitized to handle such complaints so that sex workers can seek justice without fearing negative repercussions on themselves because of their occupation. National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 117 2. People Who Inject Drugs and People Who Use Drugs (PWID and PWUD) Section 33(d) Excise Act should be revised not to be applicable to drug users since their access to clean needles and syringes for harm reduction is being affected by this law.

Methadone centres should be opened more widely across the country as there are drug users who want to break their habit but are unable to do so due to lack of counselling and treatment options. Registered drug users who are undergoing treatment should be treated leniently by the law if they have a relapse during treatment and re-use drugs. Police or law enforcement should take a more health-oriented view in this regard to encourage more drug users to come forward to access counselling and treatment for drug use, VCCT and HIV prevention information. When drug users are arrested, they should not be charged for \u2018possession\u2019 in addition to using illicit drugs (as is currently practised by the police). They should be charged only for using and sentenced not to do a prison term but to do a treatment registration at a proper treatment facility. 3. Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) & Transgender people (TG) The State should recognize equal rights of MSM & TG to live a life free from harassment by law enforcement and authorities, and have freedom of movement, and ultimately opportunities to become members of parliament. MSM should have equal rights and opportunities to participate in health, education, labour and social life. Section 377 of the Penal Code should be repealed as it violates the right of consenting adults to have sexual intercourse in privacy and creates an environment where MSM/transgender persons are seen as criminals committing abnormal acts, therefore making them fair game for harassment and abuse by the police and law enforcement and discriminatory treatment by lay people, health service providers and employers. Use of the Police Act loitering offences and Code of Criminal Procedure Section 54 to arrest MSM should no longer be practised by the police unless there is intention to commit a serious crime. Police should not abuse their power to harass and abuse gay and transgender people. Police and law enforcement should collaborate to promote condom use to prevent HIV transmission instead of harassing people for possession of condoms when they are searched during investigation or arrest. Space and opportunity should be created for more meaningful participation of MSM and transgender community in the HIV response in the country. Rules and procedures remaining to this date from the previous military government\u2019s rule such as seeking prior permission through several government offices in order to gather people (in group of more than five persons) for health-related activities should no longer apply. Local authorities should aim to encourage wider health education among people including MSM to prevent HIV more effectively. MSM and TG should have the right to a family life like any man or woman. Non-discrimination and protective laws and policies for MSM and transgender people should be enacted. National Registration Card should recognize a right of transgender people to be photographed as he or she looks in present life rather than having to revert back to a male persona to fit the \u2018male\u2019 description under \u2018sex\u2019 category. Awareness-raising of the public on human rights of sexual minorities and sensitizing media to prevent denigrating portrayals of MSM is important. 4. People living with HIV Stigma and discrimination in health care and work settings, families and community, and in schools are common. Workplace HIV testing is becoming more common. HIV- positive pregnant mothers delivering babies face pressure to undergo permanent sterilization and the practice of expediting the approval process for sterilization of HIV-positive women was noted. Stigma is especially strong for HIV-positive sex workers. Stigma and discrimination by health personnel especially at public facilities 118 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report including segregation should be addressed effectively and immediately. The health care providers should treat PLHIV equally to other patients. They should follow strict procedures to maintain confidentiality of patients\u2019 HIV status. Mandatory HIV testing for job applicants and in workplaces should be regulated through HIV workplace policy or guidelines to ensure proper pre-test and post-test counselling, to ensure an informed decision to test, and to prevent negative consequences for the PLHIV. 3. Third Community Consultation (Mandalay and the North) The community consultation for key populations and self-help groups from Mandalay, Sagaing, Magway, Bago regions, and Shan (North), Shan (South) and Kachin states was conducted in Yangon from 4\u20136 October with participation of 47 persons. 1.

If possible, the Prostitution Suppression Act should be abolished or amended to that effect. If the Act is not abolished, punishment for prostitution should be lighter and only a fine instead of prison. The law should protect sex workers from police harassment or arrest if they are meeting for health education purposes. The police should protect peer educators from harassment and arrest while they are engaging in peer education activities. Police harassment, extortion and arrest of sex workers on the grounds of reputation without strong evidence should be curbed. If the police do not have evidence, sex workers should be released, instead of sentenced to one to three months of prison for loitering. Unlawful police practices should be addressed by making free legal aid services available to sex workers. There should be a confidential channel or system for sex workers to report exploitation and abuses without having to share their sex work status with police. HIV prevention and treatment knowledge among sex workers should be promoted through expansion of sex worker-friendly services e.g. drop-in centres and peer outreach services. Peer counsellors should be made available in all health facilities offering HIV prevention and treatment. HIV and PMCT counselling and services, quality counselling and services for STI, reproductive health and family planning should be made easily available to sex workers to improve their health and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality from induced abortion. NSP II should be revised to improve sex workers\u2019 access to HIV information and treatment. 2. People Who Inject Drugs and People Who Use Drugs (PWID and PWUD) PWID require full access to drug treatment and to be able to easily access ART and a society that does not stigmatize and discriminate PWUD. Section 33(d) Excise Actshould be revised to add exceptions for harm reduction purposes. Police should not arrest drug users for carrying new needles and syringes under Section 33. Police should follow strictly the Directive from Police Headquarters not to arrest PWID for possession of new syringes. Drug treatment such as MMT should be made more easily and widely available for drug users and its availability should be advertised and its use promoted through billboards so that both drug users and community members know about MMT. Police and law enforcement personnel should be fair and just:they must not plant evidence of drug use such as injecting paraphernalia or drugs during their searches; should not liberally use loitering and public order offences against PWID when they need to fill quota; when searching drug users without a warrant in a public place, police National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report 119 should observe proper procedures to maintain the dignity of drug user as a person.Drug users on treatment when traveling should not be harassed by the police for carrying methadone. If necessary to question the drug users, police should respect the dignity of the person.People on methadone treatment should be allowed to live their life without harassment or scrutiny by the police and law enforcement.Police should not treat drug users as criminals or criminals-in-the-making and pull them in for questioning without due reason or evidence anytime there is a petty crime like theft in the area. Section 15 and 16 of the Narcotics Law should not be applicable for people on methadone treatment and who are not engaging in selling or supplying drugs. If a drug user on methadone reuses drugs before his treatment has stabilized, instead of charging him under Section 15 and/or 16 and a prison sentence, he should be sent to treatment and a centre with MMT and counselling services. Drop-in centres for drug users should be opened in areas where PWID live. Police harassment and scrutiny of drop-in centres interferes with access to services by the drug users. Free legal education and legal aid services (e.g. Equal Project) should also be made available outside Yangon. Police should not arrest and charge a person who is on treatment for carrying and taking provider-prescribed analgesics and mood stabilizers to cope with their withdrawal symptoms. Rehabilitation centres for drug users should include effective evidence-based services for drug treatment and counselling in addition to physical, psychosocial and livelihood services. 3. Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) & Transgender (TG) Stigma of homosexuality is stronger in small towns and rural communities compared to cities. MSM/TG face stigma and discrimination in all spectrums of their lives. MSM and TG seek equal rights under the law and in the society including to have a family and to field members of parliament, to take part in executive, judiciary and legislative bodies and in national level institutions.

NSP II should be revised to convey a strong message on recognition of sexual orientation and gender identity required to achieve HIV prevention, and strengthen programming for HIV prevention and treatment among MSM and transgender community. Sufficient budget allocation and targeting of MSM and transgender in HIV treatment provision, along with sensitizing of health personnel especially in public health facilities should be emphasized. MSM & TG should be given positions in the national level health decision-making bodies (e.g. Myanmar Health System Coordination Committee). Approaches used to health education among MSM and TG should be empowering and respect autonomy. \u2018Third gender\u2019 should be included in the revised Constitution. Section 377 should be abolished as there is no \u2018unnatural sexual act\u2019 between consenting adults, or 377 should be revised to say \u2018non-consensual\u2019 in the clause to make sure consensual sex in whatever form is legal and to protect men from non-consensual same sex intercourse. MSM and transgender people should also have protection under the law from sexual assault or rape as Section 375-376 protects only women against rape by men. The \u2018Yogyakarta principles\u201990provide a comprehensive set of principles for sexual minorities and should be adopted in Myanmar. Anti-discrimination law should address sexuality, gender identify and HIV status. The National Human Rights Commission should be strengthened in skills and resources to address MSM, TG and HIV-related complaints. Free legal aid should be made widely available so MSM and TG can seek redress against injustice and police abuses. Police Act and Police Procedures should be reviewed and revised. School curricula should include life skills education (including human rights, civic education, sexual health, sexual orientation and gender identity, HIV prevention) as one of the main subjects in the basic education curriculum. Capacity of teachers in 120 National HIV Legal Review Report IFinal Report life skills education should be strengthened. Degrading and stereotypical MSM descriptions in the media should be banned. 4. People living with HIV (PLHIV) Implementation of the Continuum of Care framework should be monitored and assessed. MOH should consult with PLHIV for the most appropriate care model. Quality of health care should be improved; supply chain systems should ensure uninterrupted supply of ARVs and OI medicines in the public health sector; decentralization process should be planned carefully in advance with regard to a package of services and quality of service/care at decentralized sites; Sufficient health personnel should be assigned at the HIV treatment sites and continuous skills building and refreshing in the areas of HIV counselling, treatment and care including maintaining confidentiality; quality control of laboratory equipment and supplies should be emphasized and regular monitoring of lab quality should be done. MOH should issue policy directives and inform various levels within the public health system to fully collaborate and support any health education activity conducted by I/LNGOs, CBOs and PLHIV groups and networks in the community. There should be a specific law against stigma and discrimination against PLHIV that includes concrete terms for compensation and punishment, and the public should be made aware of such law. The punishment such as suspension of a medical practitioner\u2019s licence, clinic licence or company licence would protect PLHIV from discrimination in health facilities and workplaces. HIV-positive women\u2019s rights to comprehensive and free health care should be promoted by policies for HIV counselling and testing, reproductive health and pregnancy care, PMCT (counselling, testing, medicines, free surgical delivery & post-delivery care), and ongoing HIV treatment for the mother.Qualified health personnel should be available especially with regard to PMCT counselling and services. Prohibition of stigma and discrimination against HIV- positive women by the health sector should be strengthened by a written policy directive and follow-up action. Government should protect the rights to access affordable medicines through TRIPS flexibilities whenever they negotiate and sign trade agreements. Schools and education institutions should include in curricula a subject on HIV. In health care worker education, teaching should not only focus on the medical aspect but also on psychosocial aspects including counselling, confidentiality, stigma and discrimination. Government should strengthen child protection for orphans and vulnerable children under the State\u2019s own facilities and also to monitor, regulate and support the orphanages or childcare centres in the community run by NGO/CBO and religious organizations.

Special thanks to Pramod Kumar, UNDP Senior HIV Programme Advisor and Bhagya Ratnayake (UNDP Colombo) for facilitating the Symposium\u2019s media outreach during the 9th ICAAP, and Ian Mungall (UNDP Bangkok) and Milinda Rajapaksha (UNDP Colombo) for supporting the design and editing of the Symposium report. During the recent 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (9th ICAAP) held in Bali, Indonesia, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) working in close collaboration with government, non government and United Nations partners helped raise the policy profile on key issues affecting the HIV epidemics in the Asia Pacific Region with a series of cross cutting, high level sympo- siums. This symposium report aims to highlight the key messages conveyed by panelists, issues raised, and points to the way forward for further action. The \u201cOvercoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific\u201d Symposium was jointly convened by UNDP and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM) to discuss how effective and comprehensive HIV pre- vention among men who have sex with men and transgender people can take place in a conducive and enabling legal environment. Under the dramatic rising tide of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men and transgen- der people in the region, the high level panel demonstrated that developing strategic partnerships and alliances between the legal profession, human rights bodies, academics, parliamentarians and affected communities is critical to successfully address discriminatory legal and structural barriers that impede effective and comprehensive HIV services for these populations. A strategy of comprehensive prevention requires bold and effective policy measures to reach out to communities and individuals at risk. It is here that enhanced social protection and the removal of puni- tive laws, policies and practices concerning men who have sex with men and transgender populations must be seen as affording important steps in the path of reducing the impact of HIV on these highly marginalized populations. In order to achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and realize the Millennium Development Goals, we must facilitate an enabling legal environment and human rights based HIV policies and programmes for men who have sex with men and transgender people. This will mean stepping up our joint investment in social and legal programmes which effectively address dis- crimination and stigmatization among men who have sex with men and transgender people.

The UNDP HIV/ AIDS Group is responsible within the UNAIDS system for leadership on hu- man rights, gender and sexual diversity; governance of HIV responses; and development planning and mainstreaming. The Group also manages and supports UNDP involvement in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, for which UNDP serves as Principal Recipient in 26 countries, as well as UNDP involvement in other health partnerships such as Roll Back Malaria. Jeff has 25 years of experience in public health and development, including almost 20 years of inter- national leadership on HIV/AIDS. Prior to joining UNDP, Jeff worked as Country Director for India with PATH, an international public health NGO. Between 1993 and 2004 Jeff established and led the Interna- tional HIV/AIDS Alliance, an international development NGO specializing in HIV and AIDS. Jeff has also worked for the Harvard School of Public Health and for the World Health Organization. He is originally from Canada. Shivananda Khan formed Shakti, the first South Asian LGBT organisation in the UK in 1988, and in 1991 established the first South Asian HIV organisa- ton, The Naz Project. In 1996 Mr Khan formed the Naz Foundation Interna- tional (NFI) focusing on male-male sexualities and HIV in South Asia, which since then has assisted in the development of four national MSM and HIV organisations in the region, as well as helping to establish some 70 locally MSM community based HIV service providers. He is the Interim Chairperson of the Asia Coalition on Male Sexual Health APCOM and is on the Steering Committee of the Global Forum on MSM and HIV. In 2005 he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2005 New Year\u2019s Honours List of the British Queen for his services in HIV prevention and care with males who have sex with males in South Asia. CO - CHAIRS Symposium report: Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among MSM and TG in Asia Pacific Nusa Indah, Bali International Conference Center (BICC), Westin Hotel, denpasar, Bali date and Time: Tuesday, 11 August 2009, 16:00 \u2013 17:30 2 AN ImPorTANT momENT This session of the ICAAP Congress is addressed to one of the most important issues for a suc- cessful strategy in tackling the spread of the HIV virus that causes AIDS. The strategy is the prevention of more infections. That strategy will not succeed without carefully targeted policies aimed at affecting the behaviour of individuals and groups especially at risk. Amongst these, MSM (or men who have sex with men) is a key target1. Research shows, not only in developed countries, that this cohort of the most vulnerable populations at risk, is largely ignored in many nations where AIDS presents its greatest challenges. The result is that MSM are generally placed outside the essential messages both of prevention and of access to treatment. This is a predica- ment that needs to be changed quickly2. Until recently, it was rare to see leaders of the international community addressing this vulner- able group. Sadly, many of such leaders fell victim to the kind of feeling described by Nelson Mandela in the words of Maire Bopp Dupont at the opening plenary session today. President Mandela told her that, on his release from Robben Island, many leaders of the population in South Africa recoiled from addressing the communities most in need of support. Nelson Man- dela would become an important voice. But until recently, there were few heads of state and few heads of government who would lift their voices. At this ICAAP Congress, the President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, lifted his voice at the opening ceremony. So did his wife. Both of them referred to the crucial communities who have to be brought into the strategy if the struggle against HIV/AIDS is to succeed: MSM, IDUs (drug users) and CSWs (sex workers). It is difficult to overstate the importance of the Presi- dent\u2019s willingness to refer to these groups and to acknowledge their human rights and dignity in addressing the AIDS pandemic. So many other leaders have been silent. Ronald Reagan, a great communicator, could not bring himself in his first term as President of the United States of America, to mention AIDS or MSM and other groups in the front line.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e590419f-8f18-4ec9-87f9-974c5e50d580": {"__data__": {"id_": "e590419f-8f18-4ec9-87f9-974c5e50d580", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1451571c82f94dd22a0071b91cf2e670a9dafc767ed18371f0fd28f49498561d"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cb22e3f-6e3b-49a2-8800-f38e85d24fd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "715d7aa98d13048a66ac330bb05a5b0eb3690ea0fdbfe0723b11694c1fc6b410"}}, "hash": "fb2336a18e58229b23ad47aa500dd0a16f7b8deca53fb30c313845294f3ebf4f", "text": "How precious therefore it is to have the President of Indonesia acknowledge the importance of reaching out to vulner- able groups, and specifically MSM.

PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 3 I acknowledge the work of the organisers of this Congress. I also acknowledge the crucial work that United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has performed. Its publications, often jointly with UNAIDS, constitute an institutional recognition in the United Nations family of the importance of communicating with MSM both as a human rights strategy and as one that is central to the ef- fective public health outreach to a crucial community at risk3. I acknowledge the important work performed by Mr. Jeffrey O\u2019Malley, Director HIV/AIDS Practice within UNDP and by Dr. Mandeep Dhaliwal, UNDP leader on Human Rights, Gender and Sexual Diversities. They have been cham- pions of the involvement of MSM in the forefront of the international effort to turn the epidemic around. IN THE BEGINNING Of the thousands of participants in this ICAAP meeting, few will have been engaged in the HIV/ AIDS pandemic longer than I. This is no boast; just a fact. My involvement began very soon after the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised the significance of AIDS. The first director of the Global Programme on AIDS, Dr. Jonathan Mann, secured my appointment to the Global Commission on AIDS in the mid-1980s. Other members of that Commission included Professors Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo, the two scientists credited with isolating and describ- ing the virus, HIV. At the time, the scientists told the Commission that the world would probably have a vaccine against HIV within ten years. Within twenty years, we would have a cure. Neither of these predictions has proved accurate. A vaccine remains elusive. Although anti-retroviral drugs have been developed to give significant relief to persons infected with HIV, a cure to rid the body of the virus is not yet available. We must therefore continue with the difficult strategies of education and behaviour modification. As one who served in the judiciary of my country for thirty-four years, I can attest to the fact that laws, and even education, are only partly successful in altering human behaviour. What is essential to achieve this end is a full realisation by those most at risk of the urgent necessity to change their conduct so as to protect themselves and thereby to protect others. As I listened to the speeches at the opening plenary of this second day of the Congress, I reflected on the messages that were expressed and how similar that many of them were to the lessons that Jonathan Mann taught in the earliest years of AIDS: 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "035ae37f-3e79-483e-b52a-f6424d064a3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "035ae37f-3e79-483e-b52a-f6424d064a3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3834440753250471cf55302570e030faf466d1d1bb4381b526d221a02ff6ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "ded630d5-559b-4fe7-a023-21c89461bc15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dda8fcbe75c8ce0b3f5d22758e7b0172e47d9681872d54b0571d0c17944ba94"}}, "hash": "6ab4c39be3a94355174f30b5ff880dc7951413d838ee5ef70ab415f6abfc75f5", "text": "AIDS is a women\u2019s issue: Dr. Mann repeatedly taught this lesson.

Already, in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and elsewhere in the United Nations, HIV has forced even the most reluctant to address, and acknowledge, how universal prin- ciples of human rights must be accorded respect for all persons at risk, including MSM, IDUs and CSWs. 3. AIDS demands engagement with the vulnerable: This was another insight that Jonathan Mann taught us twenty-five years ago. It was repeated today in our plenary. Dr. Michael Tan of The Phil- ippines and Dr. Jon Yungphakom once again described the importance of outreach to vulnerable groups and of the impediments so often put in the path of such endeavours. We were witness to the fulfilment of one of the principles upon which Jonathan Mann always insisted, namely the participation and involvement of people living with HIV and AIDS. Maire Bopp Dupont spoke for positive people as a member of the Pacific Island AIDS Foundation from Cook Islands. Her tears, when she reflected on the children who suffer in the epidemic, were precious to this Congress. They brought home to us the human dimension. AIDS is not over. And it is not about mere statis- tics. PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 4 THE PAIN oF VULNErABILITY As I listened to these speeches, I also reflected on my own experience as a member of a group vulnerable to HIV, namely MSM. I grew up in Australia when being a member of this community exposed one to illegality and criminality. It was a time of irrational denial, of isolation, of stigma, of vulnerability and of shame. MSM were forced to consider themselves second-class citizens. In most countries, they still are. Yet when AIDS came along, fortunately in Australia, we had political leadership on both sides of politics that addressed the AIDS paradox. Paradoxically, the most ef- fective strategies to contain and treat HIV/AIDS are those which involve the making of laws and the taking of other measures to protect those at risk. It is paradoxical because the knee-jerk reaction is to punish, not support, the risk-bearers. But punishment alienates people from self-protective messages. Outreach and engagements is the only hope of influencing their minds and hence their behaviour. Reform of the law on MSM has come very slowly. Sixty years after Dr. Alfred Kinsey published his trail-blazing research; fifty years after the Wolfenden report in Britain proposed reform; forty years after reform of the law was achieved in Britain, the fact remains that in eighty countries of our world, MSM are still exposed to severe criminal sanctions. Just as I was when I was a young man. There are two paths to reform. One is the path of the legislature. This was the strategy that Wolfen- den proposed in the United Kingdon. It was achieved forty years ago in Britain. It was also the strategy observed in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many other countries. Yet eighty lands still remain with criminal sanctions. This says nothing about the other laws and policies that dis- criminate against people on the basis of their sexual orientation. Forty-one of the fifty-three countries of the [British] Commonwealth of Nations retain the old crimi- nal laws four decades after the United Kingdom had repealed them4. In twenty countries of the Asia-Pacific region, these relics of colonial rule remain in place5. Many of the countries in our region opposed the endeavour of France and Brazil and other lands at the end of 2008 to secure from the General Assembly a statement calling for the repeal of criminal laws against MSM. This level of inactivity and opposition from countries that know the burden of unjust discrimination is a sad reflection on the past failures of leadership in the Asia-Pacific region that we must turn around. In the face of such unyielding opposition, it is natural that proponents of reform would seek alter- native redress in the courts.

PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 5 rEForm IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC In the Asia-Pacific region there has been bad news in recent times. Bad news that none of the many lands with the equivalence to s377 of the Indian Penal Code have seen fit to repeal such provisions. Bad news in Singapore. There, although a committee of the Law Society of that State recommended repeal of the local s377, the measure was opposed by an appointed member of the Singapore parliament who is a professor of law in Singapore, no less. Her association with an opposing Christian denomination led her to denounce legislative reform with talk of \u201cSodom and Gomorrah\u201d. In Singapore! It is a tragedy that her opposition succeeded on this occasion. And this in the face of statements by the original Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kwan Yu, sug- gesting that the time was ripe for reform. In other states of our region, notably Cambodia, steps have been taken to turn back the clock on the measures adopted to help prevent the spread of HIV, specifically to empower sex work- ers and other vulnerable groups in the community. There seems to be an element of inaction, moralising and hypocrisy abroad that impedes successful strategies for legal policy. As against this bad news, there is good news. A number of decisions of the Hong Kong courts have asserted the right to equality of MSM8. Likewise, a decision of the Supreme Court of Nepal has insisted on equal rights to sexual minorities. A recent decision of the courts in Pakistan has upheld the right of transgender citizens to be recognised as a special category. The decision of the Delhi High Court is a shining example of what can be achieved through legal process where the courts are independent and strong and open to persuasive arguments that draw on international wisdom. And in China and other lands, UNDP has taken initiatives to study MSM communities and to draw inferences on the need for legal and policy changes. It has done so partly for a successful strategy against HIV/AIDS and partly because this is warranted by univer- sal principles of human rights. On the whole, in the balance of good and bad news, it must be acknowledged that, for the mo- ment, the balance favours the bad. Endless conferences, countless speeches and persuasive logic, good precedents from courts and fine examples of reforming legislation mean nothing to those who are locked in their ignorance of science and who blindly repeat the errors of an uninformed reading of religious and scriptural texts. The victims of this ignorance include MSM throughout our region. It has been estimated that only ten percent of MSM in the region has access to treatment of HIV and to effective measures for protection and prevention of the spread of the virus. This is why the issue of MSM is one of the most pressing issues in the epidemic as well as an issue of fundamental human rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b319b8c8-00c4-44eb-bf8d-94b2349a1ab9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b319b8c8-00c4-44eb-bf8d-94b2349a1ab9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec1853659a66d10d0bbb610f5732d550c065032ea889dc2e02893272979ee73f"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f0168d2-b834-4b7c-a3a7-8d743dcc83c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "826a37766ce55d87c2c31f6d25de12f108948162ffc2ba8b9f45d604d04e2d60"}}, "hash": "772493c7a7525d5dc5a73b1e1668f4fcd51cabe9d39520f7b29a24bc2bed28b3", "text": "THE THIrd PHASE oF AIdS The injustice to MSM in our region takes on a special urgency in the current phase of the global response to the AIDS pandemic.

The second phase, under UNAIDS, led by Dr. Peter Piot, involved an urgent strategy to provide access to treatment, including to MSM infected with HIV. The creation of the Global Fund has brought life and hope to millions, including many in the MSM community. But now we face the third phase. It is a phase when prevention will be the central strategy of the global community. The world cannot afford to continue to fund the costs of an ever-increasing cohort of persons infected with HIV. At present, this group increases by 2.7 million persons ev- ery year. Particularly in the context of the global financial crisis, the world will not pay the great costs of providing for the expanding needs for the anti-retroviral drugs. This is why prevention is now at the top of the agenda of UNAIDS led by Michel Sidib\u00e9 and the Global Fund, led by 8 See e.g. Leung T.C. William Roy v Secretary of Justice (HK) [2006] HKCA 106 at [48]. PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 6 Fortunately, the leadership of the world community on the HIV/AIDS epidemic is now speak- ing with a single voice. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon has said, in memorable words11: \u201cIn countries without laws to protect sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men, only a fraction of the population has access to prevention. Conversely, in countries with legal protection and the protection of human rights for these people, many more have access to ser- vices. As a result, there are fewer infections, less demand for anti-retroviral treatment and fewer deaths. Not only is it unethical not to protect these groups; it makes no sense from a health perspective. It hurts all of us.\u201d These words, spoken in August 2009, resonate in this Congress. They resonate with the words of UNAIDS, of the Global Fund, of UNDP, of the High Commissioner for Human Rights12 and of the President of Indonesia. Never has there been such a unanimity of leaders embracing the previously unmentionable and acknowledging the necessity to respect and uphold the fundamental human rights of all human beings as a strategy to help contain HIV/AIDS. We will never have another mo- ment like this in history to tackle the issues of MSM and of other vulnerable groups. These groups include prisoners, refugees, detainees, and women disempowered by reason of their gender. It behoves us all to make sure that words are turned into action, and that action springs to the help of the vulnerable. That is why this session on MSM is so important for the successful strategy against the further spread of HIV. And why we must all embrace the wisdom of the Secretary- General of the United Nations and the courage shown by the President of Indonesia at the opening of the 9th ICAAP Congress in Bali. 9 UNAIDS, Policy Brief, HIV and Sex Between Men, August 2006, p.4. 10 Commission on AIDS in Asia, Re-defining AIDS in Asia: Crafting An Effective Response (OUP, 2008, New Delhi) 48. 11 Extract from the speech of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in August 2008.

So long as MSM and other vulnerable groups are criminalised, marginalised and excluded from their societies, effective strategies of prevention are unlikely to be devised. It is not only irrational, it is unjust and harmful. Sadly, the laws that many countries now seek to pass are those that criminalise consensual adult transmission of HIV. What is needed most is repeal of oppressive laws; the adoption of protective policies; and the stepping up of education to assure respect for all those in the front line of this epidemic.

Article 17 prohibits arbitrary interference with an individual\u2019s privacy, and this has been interpreted to include consensual sexual activity between adults in private \uf077The Constitution of Papua New Guinea enshrines a set of fundamental rights that should be accorded to all citizens. The recognition of some of these rights conflicts with legislative provi- sions that criminalise consensual male to male sex. These include the right to privacy (Section 49) and the right to equality (Section 55) \uf077The HIV and AIDS Management and Prevention Act, 2003 has provided an effective enabling environment for HIV prevention, treatment, care and support.

In 2007, he was one of the co-chairs of the Yogyakarta Principles drafting committee. The Yogyakar- ta Principles was developed in response to well-documented patterns of abuse targeted toward persons because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. Professor Muntarbhorn has served as the Nations Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography from 1990- 1994, and from 2005 has been the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea). In 2004, he was awarded the UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education. His work includes Human Right issues, including the rights of sexual minorities. THroUGH HUmANE LAWS ANd PrAC- TICES One of the key challenges for overcoming bar- riers to the prevention of HIV/AIDS is to pro- mote the formulation of humane laws and policies which enable people to participate in addressing the disease in a cooperative manner, rather than driving those living with HIV/AIDS underground. The latter approach is counterproductive, as it makes the disease more difficult to control. For this reason, it is essential to advocate the adoption of laws which do not lead to discrimination and mar- ginalization, and to provide space to respect sexual activities between consenting adults in the private sphere in their diversity. Paradoxically, there are many laws, policies and practices worldwide which create the op- posite effect. For instance, some 80 countries criminalize some form of sexual behavior be- tween men who have sex with men (MSM). On this front, some 20 countries can impose very serious sanctions ranging from long term pris- on sentences to capital punishment. Many of these laws are in the guise of anti-sodomy laws dating from the colonial era, while there are also various anti-debauchery laws and other criminal laws which are at times used to curb behavior associated with those who express their sexual orientation and gender identity. Various practices such as hate crimes have led to an array of attacks on gays, lesbians, bisexu- als and transgendered persons (LGBT). Fortunately, international human rights law has increasingly provided protection for LGBT and this sets the tone for the preferred laws, policies and practices at the national and lo- cal level. For instance, under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Hu- man Rights Committee has indicated that the prohibition against discrimination in regard to \u201csex\u201d includes the call for non-discrimination in regard to sexual orientations. Various UN investigators have consistently monitored violations of human rights affecting LGBT, in- cluding attacks on their right to life, such as summary executions and extra-judicial kill- ings, and have called for improved protection of their human rights, including their right to privacy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58eb311f-6b80-4122-aa97-333e2543a43e": {"__data__": {"id_": "58eb311f-6b80-4122-aa97-333e2543a43e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1b5d004b4bd3d6eba4a78989675e1edc41d305d162e3c73f548c7e76f89440c"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ada4a7d-fa32-4c29-8934-8da76dbdab68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01c1b3e1637cb5a8e41c0a5efddaba21a1cddd9c45ced1cd3e6f26cc5fce5340"}}, "hash": "b5a6ce9ad8c15d6fe22e4a9ef6de5ec7b28f1ad25c84ab94e463a352239064cc", "text": "In 2007, a number of human rights experts from all corners of the globe came together in Yogyakarta to summarize the state of inter- national law on the issue of sexual orientation and gender identity and to offer greater clarity to guide States and other actors in their con- duct towards LGBT.

While the Principles are not tantamount to a treaty, they encapsulate, in a succinct and liberal manner, international human rights law drawn from international practice, including the jurispru- dence of human rights committees under var- ious UN-backed human rights treaties. oVErComING BArrIErS To THE PrEVENTIoN oF HIV ANd AIdS: PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 12 The Principles provided value added in a number of ways: First, they provide a definition of sexual ori- entation and gender identity. Basically, the former refers to one\u2019s capacity for attraction towards other persons (including those of the same gender), while the latter refers to a person\u2019s inner sense of identity which is not necessarily that assigned at birth, thus open- ing the door to transgendered persons. Second, the Principles list a variety of rights to be protected as part of the universality of human rights premised on non-discrimina- tion \u2013 varying from civil and political rights, such as the right to security of the person, to economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to work, education, housing and highest attainable standard of health. Third, the Principles provide a checklist of actions which are needed to ensure the re- alization of human rights, for example, the position that laws which criminalize LGBT sexual behavior (impliedly including MSM) need to be reformed. They also advocate a comprehensive approach based on commu- nity awareness to counter stereotypes and to build a sense of understanding for human biodiversity. Fourth, the Principles underline the pro- tection needed for human rights defenders working in this field and call for remedies from and accountability of those who harm LGBT. Fifth, they target the UN, the courts, national human rights commissions and other stakeholders to adopt follow up mea- sures to help implement the Principles. They have been bolstered by a recent UN resolu- tion which refers, for the first time, to MSM as an issue requiring responses from health and other services. International human rights law, especially as concretized by the Yogyakarta Principles, has thus had a catalytic effect, resulting in a number of good practices in recent years which can be further advanced. First, last year nearly 80 countries under the UN issued a joint statement condemning human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and advo- cated the need to decriminalize laws which undermine respect for sexual orientations. Second, the courts in Nepal and more re- cently India have been instrumental in pressing for reform of criminal laws which give rise to injustices in this field, particularly anti-sodomy laws. Third, a court in Pakistan has upheld the rights of transgendered persons. Fourth, a number of countries, including In- donesia and South Africa, now allow identity documents to be changed so as to reflect a person\u2019s preferred gender identity. Spain and the United Kingdom have gone further by adopting new laws to enable persons wishing to change their gender to do so and to be recognized as such by the State, even without gender reassignment surgery. Fifth, national human rights commissions from the Asia-Pacific region held a meeting this year to address the question of sexual orientation and gender identity under the umbrella of the Yogyakarta Principles. At the recent World Out Games 2009, which was a global venue for LGBT held in Copenha- gen, an international conference took place which launched the Copenhagen Catalogue of Good Practices on this issue. This booklet documents constructive actions based on non-discrimination drawn from all over the world. They include such examples as busi- ness indexes monitoring non-discrimina- tion, religious leaders and trade unions with a liberal approach, campaigns against hate crimes (in South Africa), LGBT film and art festival (in Indonesia), humane health policy to develop HIV programmes for MSM (in Ke- nya), and school curriculum to promote an understanding of sexual diversity under the notion of Social Justice (in Canada).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5ef84b9-58b1-4799-83bf-14c2b659e674": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5ef84b9-58b1-4799-83bf-14c2b659e674", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Overcoming legal barriers to comprehensive prevention among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific - Symposium Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3adeb000add0d816e0341f83bb034ff04ede59016c7b9a2f452a0b18ed08cf1d"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc66202b-a9c5-4fc3-8673-48b09aca20da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/overcoming-legal-barriers-comprehensive-prevention-among-men-who-have-sex-men-and-transgender-people-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61615af9ed2d064571450193ecdb1f3cf8cc083fe76dabfb23347bcc1d79f1cb"}}, "hash": "517da8db68cecf1df209a5217eb61d6fed0deaedb52e8b84bcc72735a422da27", "text": "On a more sensitive front, even though the Yogyakarta Principles do not go as far to stipulate the obligation of States to register the marriage of LGBT, they do affirm that \u201cin States that recognize same-sex marriages or registered partnerships\u201d, any benefits available to different-sex married or regis- PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 13 tered partners should be equally available to same-sex couples.

From a human rights angle, while laws and policies are important for reflecting inter- national standards, it is equally essential to promote a sense of values and empathy, through an educational, participation and mobilization process, that opens the door to acceptance of human biodiversity.

PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 21 Way Forward... The time for action is now! The Commission on AIDS in Asia has construct- ed a grim picture of how HIV epidemics among men who have sex with men have developed in the region, and how these are likely to accelerate exponentially in the future if effective and comprehensive responses are not dramatically scaled up. The regional projections show large increases in new infections among MSM if risk behaviour stays at current levels of low condom use with many concurrent male partners. In the worst case scenario, by 2020, some 50% of all new infections will be linked to male to male sex. To achieve universal access and to reverse the rates of HIV infection among men who have sex with men and transgender people, the United Nations, governments, affected communities and a broad range of actors must intensify efforts to devise and deliver targeted and evidence-informed interventions. The UNAIdS Action Framework: Universal Access for mSm and TG People, recently endorsed by the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board (June 2009), aims to assist the UN system to accelerate efforts, guided by the following principles: \u2022 Action must be grounded in an understanding of, and commitment to, human rights, the cornerstone to an effective response to HIV \u2022 Action must be based on, and informed by, an evidence-base on HIV among MSM and TG people \u2022 Action is required by a broad range of partners, simultaneously addressing both short- and long-term needs and opportunities to ensure broader and better responses to HIV among MSM and TG people While the promotion and protection of human rights protection is a public good and essential to trans- forming society\u2019s approach to AIDS, it is not enough in and of itself. Effective HIV programmes must challenge punitive laws, policies, practices, stigma and discrimination which impede access to services, in particular access for key populations such as men who have sex with men and transgender people. This symposium effectively highlighted the efforts of parliamentarians, the legal community, academ- ics, community advocates and the UN in overcoming the legal barriers hampering effective responses for men who have sex with men and transgender people in the Asia Pacific region. The presentations highlight the importance of advancing human rights commitments, establishing broad partnerships, and mobilising communities \u2013 especially communities of those most vulnerable to HIV in challeng- ing punitive laws, policies, practices, stigma and discrimination. One of the most powerful messages from this symposium is that a real difference can be made in the lives of men who have sex with men, transgender people and those people living with and vulnerable to HIV through embracing diversity, challenging pernicious inequalities and by bringing together the collective knowledge and resources of governments, academics and communities. Jeff O\u2019Malley Director, HIV Group United Nations Development Programme PANELIST PRESENTATIONS & STATEMENTS 22 9th International Congress on AIdS in Asia and the Pacific 90 per cent of men having sex with men have no access to HIV prevention and care Nusa Dua, Bali, August 11: More than 90 per cent of the men having sex with men in Asia Pacific do not have access to HIV prevention and care services and if interventions are not urgently intensified, the spread of HIV among this marginalized population will be steep in a short period of time, said speakers at a high level symposium here at the 9th ICAAP today. Due to the increased availability of epidemiological data on HIV among MSM in recent years, there is a better understanding of the magnitude and nature of the epidemic amongst MSM and TG within the Asia Pacific region, they said.

A 2006 survey of the coverage of HIV interventions in 15 Asia-Pacific countries estimated that targeted prevention programmes reached less than 8% of MSM. The Symposium was organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (ACPOM) and was titled \u201cOvercoming legal barriers to compre- hensive prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TG) in Asia and the Pacific\u201d during the 9th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP). This ground breaking symposium discussed how effective and comprehensive HIV prevention among MSM and TG can take place only when a conducive and enabling legal environment is created that allows unimpeded dissemination of prevention messages and services, appropriate provision of treat- ment, care and support services, and the creation of confidence among the most marginalized and vulnerable to seek essential information and access services. According to Jeffrey O\u2019Malley, the Global Director of UNDP\u2019s HIV Group, \u201cin order to achieve univer- sal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and realize the Millennium Development Goals, we must facilitate an enabling legal environment and human rights based HIV policies and pro- grammes for MSM and TG. This will mean stepping up our investment in legal and social programmes which effectively address discrimination and stigmatization amongst MSM and TG.\u201d Currently 20 countries in the Asia Pacific Region criminalize male to male sex behavior, and these laws often take on the force of vigilantism, leading to abuse and human rights violations. Even in the ab- sence of criminalization, other provisions of law which violate the rights of MSM and TG are arbitrary and in appropriate enforcement obstruct HIV interventions, advocacy and outreach, and service de- livery. These structural barriers significantly increase the vulnerability of MSM and TG to HIV and have an immense adverse effect on their health and human rights. This very debate was at the heart of the recent landmark ruling by the Delhi High Court that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code unfairly dis- criminates against MSM and consenting adults in general. \u201cA strategy of prevention requires bold and effective legal and policy measures to reach out to the vulnerable communities and individuals at risk,\u201d stated Honourable Michael Kirby. \u201cIt is here that reform of laws concerning MSM must be seen as affording important steps in the path of reducing the isola- tion, stigma and vulnerability felt by MSM communities and individuals. Enhancing their self-respect and dignity as citizens; and protecting their legal rights, including receiving information on safer sex practices.\u201d PRESS RELEASE 23 PRESS RELEASE Developing strategic partnerships and alliances between affected communities, the legal profession, human rights bodies, parliamentarians and policy makers is critical to successfully address discrimina- tory legal and structural barriers that impede effective and comprehensive HIV services for MSM and TG populations. \u201cThe recent case of the reading down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code that the Delhi High Court addressed is a shining example of such an approach, where education and sensitization of these different sectors was central to the success of the case,\u201d said Shivananda Khan, APCOM chairperson. He added that, \u201cOther key rulings in the region include the 2007 Nepal Supreme Court ruling recogniz- ing the rights of sexual minorities, and the June 2009, Pakistan Supreme Court ruling that hijras are a minority community.\u201d In circumstances of the current global financial and economic crisis and the ever-increasing bill for life- saving anti-retroviral treatment, the impetus for effective comprehensive prevention becomes even stronger. Only a strategy of comprehensive, right based prevention - supported by an enabling legal environment offers a possibility of reducing the numbers of persons infected with HIV each year. In this context, it is both cost-effective and imperative to implement legal and social programmes which counter discrimination and stigmatization for MSM and TG.

It then goes on to outline the key features of the international human rights framework, including the human rights obligations of States in the context of trade agreements, the responsibilities of business enterprises, and the need for greater access to remedies. To further illustrate the connection between trade and human rights in Pacific Island Countries, the report includes a number of case studies. The topics examined include: structural reform; tariff reform and government revenue; trade policy, nutrition and public health; and, intellectual property and traditional knowledge. The overall message is that a human rights-based approach to trade helps to ensure that the processes and outcomes of negotiating and implementing trade and investment agreements protect, respect and fulfill the rights of affected individuals and communities to a greater extent. Human rights help to balance the focus on economic growth with the concerns and impacts on affected stakeholders. A human rights-based approach requires that the trade policies, interventions and processes are guided by human rights standards and principles, including participation and inclusion, equality and non- discrimination, and accountability. Where potential negative impacts on workers or communities are foreseen, the human rights-based approach can help to address these risks and maintain the necessary policy space to develop trade measures that also protect individuals, workers and communities. Human rights also highlight the importance of consultation with affected stakeholders while negotiating and implementing trade agreements. Key recommendations to governments and policy-makers in Pacific Island Countries include: enhancing government capacity to address trade-related human rights issues; consider the impacts before entering into binding trade agreements by for example conducting human rights impact assessments of proposed trade agreements; ensuring public participation, non-discrimination, consultation, accountability and transparency in trade negotiations; strengthening the legal and institutional framework for linking human rights and trade through adoption and implementation of relevant international human rights treaties; and, actively engaging with global support networks to supplement capacity not currently present at national levels. ii PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS acknowledgments Lead authors: Lloyd Lipsett Miranda Forsyth Selim Raihan Wesley Morgan With contributions from: united nations development Programme (undP): Ahmed Moustafa Carlos Correa (University of Buenos Aires/UNDP) Ferdinand Strobel Simone Troller Tenu Avafia Office\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdHigh\ufffdCommissioner\ufffdfor\ufffdHuman\ufffdRights\ufffd(OHCHR): Erik Friberg Mika Kanervavuori Simon Walker Susan Mathews The World Health Organization (WHO): Anjana Bhushan Britta Baer Katrin Engelhardt Ki-Hyun Hahm Peter Hoejskov iii acronyms ACP African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States APEC Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation EPA Economic Partnership Agreements EU European Union FTa Free Trade agreement GDP Growth Domestic Product HRIA Human Rights Impact Assessment ILO International Labour Oragisation IMF International Monetary Fund IPR Intellectual Property Rights MDG/s Millennium Development Goal/s MSG Melanesian Spearhead Group MSGTA Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement NaFTa North american Free Trade agreement NCD/s Non-Communicable Disease/s OHCHR Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights PACER Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations PICs Pacific Island Countries PICTA Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement SIDs Small Island Developing States SPARTECA South Pacific Regional Trade & Economic Cooperation Agreement TK Traditional Knowledge TRIPS Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights UNDP United Nations Development Programme UPOV International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants VAT Value Added Tax WHO (The) World Health Organization WTO (the) World Trade Organization 1 1. Overview of the report This report provides an overview of the human rights issues and impacts related to the liberalisation of trade in Pacific Island Countries. The report has been commissioned by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to build greater awareness of the connections between human rights and trade in the region, and to highlight the responsibilities of States and other actors to take human rights into account as they negotiate and implement trade agreements. For the purposes of this report, Pacific Island Countries have been defined as the 14 members of the Pacific Islands Forum: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji (suspended), Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

These countries face particular challenges\u2014including small land masses, small populations and remote locations\u2014for developing their economies, for negotiating beneficial trade agreements and for protecting human rights. Therefore, the realities of Pacific Island Countries often test the limits of contemporary economic theory about the benefits of trade. As such, a human rights analysis can help focus attention on the potential impacts on affected stakeholders. \u25aa Second, many Pacific Island Countries are currently and will continue to engage in the process of negotiating trade agreements at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels. Although their governments may be under significant domestic and international pressures to finalize trade agreements, the fact that negotiations have not been completed means that there is still an opportunity for Pacific Island Countries to consider their individual and collective policy options from a human rights perspective. In other words, in some instances, the trade agreements are not a \u2018done deal.\u2019 After an overview of key trade policy issues for Pacific Island Countries, as well as the relevant international human rights standards, the report includes a number of brief case studies that provide illustrations of the relationship between trade and human rights in the region. Recognising that the human rights analysis of trade measures is relatively nascent, the case studies do not offer definitive findings and conclusions, but rather seek to outline the main policy implications and insights for decision-makers. The case studies were developed based upon a prioritization of human rights issues that are considered most likely to arise in relation to the negotiation and implementation of trade agreements in the Pacific Island Countries. These are based on a review of the literature and the authors\u2019 experience. While human rights may sometimes be presented as being opposed to trade liberalisation, the authors have attempted to take a balanced approach and acknowledge that trade agreements may result in both positive and negative impacts on human rights. The ultimate objective of the report is not to oppose free trade, but rather to show how trade, development and human rights can be brought together in a more integrated and inclusive manner, and to ensure that negative impacts on individuals and communities in Pacific Island Countries are more fully considered and addressed. 2 PACIFIC TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS Trade liberalisation is often promoted as a key component of development. Human rights should also be understood as an integral part of equitable development and as such to reinforce the effort of governments to pursue development objectives such as the Pacific Plan and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Development efforts are more likely to be successful if everyone affected is included in the process. The involvement of individuals and communities enables them to have a say and allows the government to better understand their real needs. As a result, policies will be more responsive to the people and governments will be more accountable.1 As we approach 2015, which is the \u2018finish line\u2019 for the MDGs, the international community is engaging in a new conversation about how to improve development cooperation and outcomes. Strengthening our common understanding of human rights as a key component of trade can help governments, business enterprises, individuals and communities ensure better processes and outcomes: in other words, a rights-based approach to trade can ensure that strategies for sustainable development do not harm human rights. 3 2.\ufffdOverview\ufffdof\ufffdtrade\ufffdpolicy\ufffdand\ufffdagreements\ufffdin\ufffdPacific\ufffd island countries Figure\ufffd1:\ufffdStates\ufffdand\ufffdterritories\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdPacific\ufffdregion PW GU MP VU AU NZ MH KI PF PN TK US TV WS AS CK TL NC FJ WF NR PG SB FM TO NU [ID] [TW] [CN] [PH] [BN] [MY] 0 0 1,500 mi 1,500 km Members\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdPacific\ufffdIslands\ufffdForum:\ufffdAU-Australia, CK-Cook Islands, FM-Federated States of Micronesia, KI-Kiribati, MH-Marshall Islands, NR-Nauru, NZ-New Zealand, NU-Niue, PW-Palau, PG-Papua New Guinea, TO-Tonga, VU-Vanuatu, WS- Samoa.

Factors such as small and dispersed populations, a narrow economic base, distance from external markets, and an acute vulnerability to natural disasters all serve to restrict options available for the effective development of domestic resources and constrain opportunities to benefit from international trade on an equal basis.

With small populations, Pacific Island Countries have a small domestic market for all goods and services. This limits opportunities for local production and renders most island states to be heavily reliant on imports. The countries also tend to have higher per-capita public infrastructure and governance costs than more populous countries. Furthermore, many of the countries have a \u201cvery limited pool of specialised and competitive domestic human resources.\u201d3 \u25aa Pacific\ufffdIsland\ufffdCountries\ufffdlack\ufffdeconomically\ufffdsignificant\ufffdland\ufffdarea\ufffdyet\ufffdhave\ufffdlarge\ufffdocean\ufffdterritories.
