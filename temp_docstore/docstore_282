INTRODUCTION The framework for representation and the electoral processes are among the most important mechanisms that shape local democracy. Decisions on the modalities for representative participation1 and the choice of electoral system \u2013 the rules and procedures through which votes cast in an election are translated into representation \u2013 determine the extent to which local decision-making bodies are genuinely democratic, inclusive and gender-sensitive. They can influence other aspects of the political system, including the development of political parties, and are important to other issues such as linking citizens and their leaders for more political accountability, representation and responsiveness. In addition to the direct impact on empowerment, they influence the social and economic outcomes of decentralised governance. As such, electoral representation and the different forms it can take have a direct bearing on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their attainment. In themselves, local electoral systems are of great importance in the overall governance agenda, but because they can strongly influence the nature of representation and accountability, they also impact upon wider public outcomes. In the Asia and the Pacific region, local representative institutions constitute for many citizens one of the most important avenues for participation in governance and for influencing decision-making of direct relevance to their livelihoods. However, the question of fair representation has often received insufficient attention. Whether political parties formally constitute the basis for local politics or not, local-level \u201cdemocracy\u201d is often an arena where political parties and powerful individuals have ample opportunities to use their money and influence to marginalize their competitors. Across Asia and the Pacific it has often proven easy for the strong candidates in local politics to win, leaving behind candidates who represent minorities/ethnic groups or who have less muscle and money power. In societies that are deeply divided on ethnic, religious, caste and class bases, it is essential to devise a system that is fair and representative, and contributes to the future of a stable democracy. To date, the collective evidence from the design of systems for representation and elections in divided societies suggests that an appropriately crafted framework can help to nurture the accountability and commitment of political parties, whilst an inappropriate system", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1f06dcf-95ea-498e-b1bd-5b9dc1cb38db": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1f06dcf-95ea-498e-b1bd-5b9dc1cb38db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7218436e65b1fd21f6885ef5df7571debdd8c81d81688356f8e986876cf4d886"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3129212-78a3-4546-9fcd-0f8b4f75dacb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f93e0a6acda8bac075c66960c16edf6b01c7432692fc97f9b4f80ec89d2264c"}}, "hash": "73a10b8547fb526eba607c226fc4182aaa99de527bbfbac7304b56226d1bb9ca", "text": "can severely harm the process of democratisation. This Background Paper is part of a wider UNDP regional initiative that focuses on a number of core issues related to representative systems and local elections. Most UNDP interventions have traditionally focussed on direct participation2 in local governance, notably the involvement of citizens and community-based organisations in planning and implementation, the empowerment of citizens and strengthening of civil society to participate directly in governance and to hold their local governments (LGs) accountable. In contrast, remarkably little attention has been paid to the ways in which formal electoral processes at the local level lead to appropriate (or inappropriate) outcomes in terms of representation and accountability. The aim of this practice initiative, then, is to strengthen UNDP\u2019s ability to provide policy advice and support for capacity development related to the \u2018first layer\u2019 of participation. The first step of the practice development initiative (launched in 2004) was to analyse the various approaches applied in the countries in the region and develop an overview of the issues and principles. The first draft of this Background Paper was the end result of this \u2013 and provided the documentary basis for a two day workshop (June 22-23, 2005) on 1 A distinction is made between three elements of participation: (1) representative (usually but not necessarily elective) government; (2) direct participation either at community or project level; and (3) the mobilisational form of participation (see e.g. Richard Crook and Alan Sturla Sverrisson (2001): Decentralisation and poverty-alleviation in developing countries: a comparative analysis or, is West Bengal unique?, IDS Working Paper). 2 See distinction above. 4 Representation in Decentralised Local Governance held at Hua Hin, Thailand (see Workshop Report). At the workshop the country evidence that laid the basis for the Background Paper was taken up and discussed in greater detail. The current draft has been revised and refined in the light of workshop discussions, as well as expanded to cover additional countries and updated in the light of recent developments in a number of countries. This Background Paper has been written by Henrik Fredborg Larsen, Policy Advisor on Decentralisation and Local Governance, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok (Lead Author), Linda Maguire, UNDP Electoral Systems and Processes Policy Adviser, Nils Taxell, Research Officer, Democratic Governance Practice Team, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok and Mike Winter, Consultant. Substantive contributions and comments have been made by Durafshan Chowdhury, Jill Donahue, Andrew Ellis, Jill Engen, Lenni Montiel, Marie Pedersen, Nicolas Perrin, Dessislava Raykova, Alessandro Righetti, Leonardo Romeo, Chandra Roy, Roger Shotton and Neil Webster. In addition, the revised draft has benefited greatly from input from participants at the Hua Hin workshop. The revised Background Paper includes a detailed review of the systems in place in eight countries in South/West Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), five countries in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam), and three Pacific region countries (Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands). The paper has three basic objectives: (i) to summarise findings to date about LG electoral processes and representation arrangements in a range of countries in South/West Asia, South East Asia, and the Pacific region. (ii) to highlight, on a thematic basis, some of the key issues related to representation and electoral processes at the local level, in terms of trade-offs, incentives and implications. (iii) to put forward some hypotheses on possible ways forward in further developing practitioner-relevant knowledge about electoral representation at sub-national levels. In addition to the Background Paper, the first phase of the practice development initiative has also provided the basis for a number of other UNDP knowledge products (DLGUDNet Digest No. 18, summer 2005, and two Human Development Viewpoints: \u201cPresidentialism in Decentralised Governance: More Local Leadership but at What Cost?\u201d and \u201cInclusive Local Governance \u2013 Representation and Affirmative Action\u201d.

Building on the work undertaken for the Background Paper, this will require studying the ways in which representation has been made more accountable through electoral reforms and affirmative actions in the different countries and an analysis of the types of accountability mechanisms in place and asking what works to secure better representation where, when and how. Accordingly, the next step in the practice development initiative will include an important research component. The objective of the research is to explore the different types of mechanisms that can affect the degree of accountability present in local governance and with respect to LG in particular. The analysis of these mechanisms in the different country contexts will contribute significantly to policies that aim to develop inclusive system of representation. The over-arching objective of the research component will be to seek answers to the following question: in what ways can representation be made more accountable in decentralised local governance? The research will seek to achieve its objective initially through a set of country studies conducted by the country offices of UNDP and their partners in the Asia region and coordinated by the Regional Centre in Bangkok. Guiding questions for these country studies will be: \u2022 Which actors can hold LG to account? \u2022 What mechanisms can they draw upon? \u2022 Under which conditions do these mechanisms work best and when are they un/under- utilised? \u2022 Which mechanisms have lead to a greater responsiveness on the part of LG to citizens? \u2022 What other actors, mechanisms and measures could increase LG\u2019s accountability and responsiveness in the future? The country studies will provide the basis for a comparative analysis of the ways in which different systems of representation in LG affect its accountability and as to how accountability instruments might be used to achieve a more effective and equitable system of decentralised local governance. 2. ELECTORAL SYSTEMS The LG electoral systems summarily presented and described at the end of this paper show how bewilderingly variable representational procedures can be. This section of the paper tries to undertake a cursory synthesis and analysis of different representational arrangements by examining them in terms of: \u2022 whether they are direct or indirect; \u2022 whether they include appointed positions; \u2022 the basic electoral procedures that underlie both direct and indirect methods of representation. In this section, reference is made both to the specific country case studies and to other sources of information. 6 7 2.1. Direct/indirect elections and appointments Table 1 below summarises the country case studies in terms of direct/indirect and appointed representation. (1) Direct and indirect elections for councils Whether or not direct elections are held for all levels of LG varies from country to country. In South Asia, this is the case in India and Sri Lanka but not in the other four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan) where there are higher levels of local administration but with no directly elected bodies. In Bangladesh, this is simply because the Constitutional provisions have not been implemented (aside from the brief Upazila Parishad experiment in the 1980s) and in the Maldives because there are no elected members at Atoll level; for the other three countries, indirect elections take the form of either (i) lower level leaders (who have usually been directly elected by their constituencies) automatically becoming members of higher level units, or (ii) of a combination of (i) alongside an electoral college system, with lower level council members constituting the electoral college, as in the cases of Pakistan and Nepal. In South East Asia, and where they exist, upper level LG councils are generally made up of directly elected members: this is the case for both Indonesia and Vietnam. In the Philippines, however, upper level LG councils are composed of both directly and indirectly elected members, the latter usually being the representatives of lower level councils. In the cases of Cambodia and Timor-Leste, there are, as yet, no upper LG levels. A number of issues arise here. Firstly, are directly elected officials more accountable to their constituents than indirectly elected officials? For example, in India, where all councillors, at all levels, are directly elected, can it be said that they are more accountable then their Nepali counterparts on the District Councils,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90cad620-6aab-461d-849a-20eedb3f6757": {"__data__": {"id_": "90cad620-6aab-461d-849a-20eedb3f6757", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d41bfb42b9cb7558fe6d36de3d900683131e968c7b196e7ce4721a49a1201375"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a2f782e-9e8b-44c9-8dd0-4e0bd7862c84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "968637c99ff116348ca693d0c0d0fff4fb19f2d48e42d6fc2da75a7e9717cd39"}}, "hash": "03f7858eaf6fc7f5d66879e35d614e2e406fa98a1e709405b1f823c6464fdf08", "text": "who are largely drawn from Village Councils? There is no hard and fast evidence on this \u2013 but common sense would tend to indicate that directly elected officials in upper level LGs would be more accountable to their constituents for overseeing activities/functions specific to that level.

Clearly, more research is needed on this.

Where upper tier LG Councils are not drawn from members of lower level LG Councils but are instead directly elected, political differences between levels may emerge. How far this can be problematic depends, of course, on what the organic linkages between upper and lower tiers are. In Indonesia, for example, each level of regional government is legally autonomous \u2013 thus, any political \u201cdifferences\u201d between the directly elected DPRDs and regional heads of provinces and regencies/cities should not, in principle, be a problem given their functional autonomy and differing responsibilities. However, where there are organic links between different levels of LG, as in India (where upper levels of the Panchayat system play a \u201ccoordination\u201d role with regard to lower tiers) or in Sri Lanka, then political differences between directly elected bodies at different levels may be more of a problem. In addition, much depends on the nature of fiscal relations between LG levels, on how far upper levels (rather than central government) are responsible for transfers to lower levels \u2013 but this is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. On the other hand, in an LG system where elections to upper tiers are indirect, and most of the members of higher level councils are drawn from the ranks of lower tier councils, there may \u2013 for obvious reasons \u2013 be less potential for conflict. But this may be problematic in other ways, especially if upper tiers are expected to play some kind of \u201csupervisory\u201d role with respect to lower level LGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1b88505-79f5-4d82-b0e8-69f3ffbccfd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1b88505-79f5-4d82-b0e8-69f3ffbccfd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "525057686de00227123400a5bf0b47cd2e811c7d1aa80eb3606129416fc0b394"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee1fc95d-3121-40d4-9817-d546eb7f24e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54e4a627215bfc8f2e31727c7c2d4302bfd3ec86ab3bdb5765e40393009a5d6f"}}, "hash": "a73747aacc79992ffdf632d23bb9bcf356503a9ae7836f828c18e9571f428348", "text": "In Nepal, for example, it is the District\u2019s Internal Audit section that is expected to audit the accounts of constituent VDCs \u2013 but given that VDCs are represented at the District level by their Chair- and Vice-Chairpersons, how effective can one expect such internal audits to be?

This is by no means unimportant given that countries like Nepal are fiscally strapped and may not be able to afford the luxury of direct elections for all levels of LG. Needless to say, the trade-off for greater economy may well be weaker electoral accountability in higher level LG councils. (2) Direct and indirect elections for Council Chairpersons How Chairpersons/Mayors and Vice Chairpersons/Deputy Mayors are elected also varies from country to country but in many cases also between the different levels of LG within each country. In the particular case of India, the mode of election of Panchayat and Municipal leaders can also vary from State to State, depending on State Legislatures. In most (but not all) countries the heads of the lowest level of LG are directly elected in one way or another. In the majority of cases, council heads are elected as such \u2013 a VDC Chairman in Nepal, for example, stands for that position in direct elections. In Sri Lanka and Cambodia, however, where elections are carried out on the basis of proportional representation (see Section 2.2), councils are headed by the leaders of the parties with the most votes/seats \u2013 they are not, in that sense, directly chosen by the electorate. In the case of the three Pacific region countries (Fiji, PNG and the Solomon Islands), however, lower tier council heads are indirectly elected by their fellow councillors. In the cases of Pakistan and Indonesia, the heads and deputy heads of lower level LG Councils are directly elected, but on the basis of a joint ticket \u2013 in Pakistan (at UC level) on a non-party basis and in Indonesia on a party basis. At higher levels of LG, council heads are often elected by the members of that LG from amongst themselves or by the members of the subsidiary levels. In Bhutan, for example, the DYT Chair is selected by DYT members from amongst themselves. In Nepal, on the 11 other hand, DDC Chairs and Vice-Chairs are elected by the members of the Village and Municipal Councils that make up the district as a whole. Pakistan is (since 2005) somewhat different in that the nazim and of any tehsil/town or district/city is elected indirectly by an electoral college consisting of all the union councillors in their respective constituencies. They are thus indirectly elected by all union councillors (including the Union Council leaders \u2013 Union nazims and naib nazims) in their respective jurisdictions \u2013 but cannot themselves be union councillors. Naib nazims at the tehsil/district levels, however, are indirectly elected by their respective councils (from amongst themselves) \u2013 and not by a wider electoral college. Pakistan is clearly a hybrid case of indirect elections for local council leadership. In other cases (Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam), higher level council heads are directly elected by ordinary voters. This would appear to be the case only where upper level councils are themselves directly elected by voters (and not by electoral colleges) \u2013 where upper level councils are indirectly elected, council chairpersons are generally also indirectly elected. There are a range of issues linked to the ways in which council leaders are elected: \u2022 a system whereby council chairpersons are indirectly elected by their councils does, in principle, offer the singular advantage of a more collegial and consensual form of local governance. Under such systems, mayors/chairs need to ensure regular support from their councils \u2013 and this may imply a tendency towards broad-based decision-making. Where councillors represent wards, this \u2013 in turn \u2013 implies that decision-making may be more likely to take into account the interests of many constituents. \u2022 however, indirectly elected mayors or council chairpersons \u2013 unless they can ensure the allegiance of their councils and councillors \u2013 may become \u201clame ducks\u201d as they fall victim to party politics or to internal disputes within their councils. \u2022 increasingly, indirect elections for council leaders are seen as being problematic in terms of accountability. Indirectly elected council chairpersons may see themselves as more accountable to their immediate constituency (i.e. the individual electoral college that has selected them) than to local citizens at large. The following inset hints at some of the accountability issues (and their consequences) related to Pakistan\u2019s indirect electoral system for nazims. 12 Indirectly elected district nazims in Pakistan \u2013 accountable to whom?

Indirect elections such as these raise the potential for abuse. Nazims are very conscious of the need to keep their \"electoral college\" (i.e. the Union councillors) on board. Thus, they have sometimes decided to use funds by parcelling out small sums to councils in order to try to secure support. However, as a result, all Union administrations may have sums that are inadequate to carry out the sorts of schemes that their constituents are demanding, particularly for rural areas in water and sanitation. Conversely, where nazims have used other criteria to allocate development funds between union councils, those who have received no funds have accused the nazim of being partisan. Source: Manning et al. 2003 \u2022 conversely, there is an increasing extent to which direct elections of council leaders are seen as being more appropriate than indirect elections. A number of advantages are cited in favour of direct elections for mayors or council leaders4, inter alia: - greater legitimacy for LG as a whole \u2013 a mayor who is directly elected is more clearly the preferred individual choice of local citizens than one who has been indirectly elected by a limited number of councillors. S/he more manifestly expresses local preferences, which in turn contributes to strengthening and legitimating local democratic practice; - clearer separation of powers and functions between the executive and the legislative branches at the local level \u2013 enabling mayors or leaders to operate more independently of the partisan interests of their councils and enabling the latter to more clearly and unequivocally provide oversight of the directly elected mayor or council leader; - greater accountability \u2013 in the sense that a directly elected council chairperson or mayor is more clearly seen as being individually responsible for delivering public goods and services as well as for honouring electoral commitments; - more effective LG\u2013 in that directly elected mayors can \u201cget on with their jobs\u201d more effectively than indirectly elected leaders. A \u201cgood\u201d directly elected mayor is likely to be more effective than a \u201cgood\u201d indirectly elected mayor, all other things being equal. \u2022 that said, the direct election of council chairpersons or mayors (as with all such \u201cpresidential\u201d figures) may also have its downsides, inter alia: - excessive power being wielded by the directly elected mayor \u2013 in that directly elected leaders may see themselves (and be seen) as much more than a primus inter pares. Council chairpersons who are directly elected may overshadow fellow Council members by virtue of their much stronger electoral mandate, and may thus stifle democratic debate in Council.

In most cases, the Upa Sarpanch or Vice President of the GP is indirectly elected from among the panches. Direct election of Sarpanches has placed them above the panches rather than in a coordinating role. In Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and many other states, Sarpanches are accused of acting arbitrarily, and not consulting the rest of the GP systematically. The common view of Sarpanches, apparently reconciled to by the panches, is that Sarpanches were above panches, because they had been elected by the entire GP constituency rather than only by a subset \u2013 the ward \u2013 as in the case of the panches.

The person elected as the vice-president has the majority support in the village Panchayat. The no-confidence motion makes the position of the Sarpanch president vulnerable within the village Panchayat. This, among others, is one of the factors that has encouraged the Sarpanches to keep the village Panchayat at abeyance, if not for anything else, at least, to keep their positions secure. Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, the no-confidence provision has, in most instances, been used against Sarpanches who have been elected from \u2018reserved\u2019 positions i.e., women, members of scheduled castes/tribes. Source: adapted from Debrprasad Mishra (n.d.) (3) Appointments to councils In some cases, provisions are made for the representation or appointment of \u201cnon-elected\u201d members in LG. For the purposes of this paper, this category of member does not include lower level LG representatives who are either automatic members at higher levels or selected through electoral colleges made up of lower level LG councillors. In the Asia-Pacific region, such \u201cappointed\u201d members are often deemed to be the representatives of special interest groups. Representatives from special interest groups (such as women, disadvantaged groups, and the youth) are either appointed by their respective Councils in Nepal and in the Philippines or (in the unique case of the Youth Councils in the Philippines) are automatically considered to be council members by virtue of being the elected representatives of their special interest groups. In the case of PNG, councils include representatives nominated by the Trades Union Congress and the Employers\u2019 Federation. In the case of India the government can provide for the representation of persons with special skills or knowledge relevant to LG, particularly in the case of municipal governments. The extent to which all such categories of non-elected council members enjoy full voting powers varies from country to country. In some cases, members of national assemblies are ex-officio members of the LGs of their constituencies (e.g. in District Councils and DDCs in Nepal, LSGA 1999, article 172). This is most evident in PNG\u2019s provincial assemblies, which are led by provincial MPs and include all National Parliamentarians from the province. In other cases officials from the local administrations are also represented on councils, although they then often act as observers without voting rights. This is the case in Bhutan, and in Nepal, where the interim local bodies in place since 2002 have been chaired by the Local Development Officer (the previous secretary to the District Development Committees appointed by the Ministry of Local Development). Also, representatives of sectoral ministries at the level of LG are in some cases represented \u2013 Nepal is probably the best example with the line agency representatives constituting all members in the interim local bodies (district as well as village level). Several issues concerning such appointments merit attention here: \u2022 who does the appointing? Where appointments to councils are or can be made by institutions or other local councils, the legitimacy of the appointment may be 15 questioned. The power of State Governments in India to appoint council members as \u201cresource persons\u201d is a case in point. \u2022 parliamentarians as ex-officio members of local councils \u2013 evidence shows that the ex- officio involvement of national-level MPs in LG bodies is almost always a distorting influence, tending to cater to local elite and factional interests, or national party concerns, much more than do LG councillors. And they also tend to overwhelm locally elected councillors, as the following inset shows The presence of MLAs and MPs as members of Zilla Panchayats (ZPs) and Panchayat Samitis (PSs) overwhelms panchayats.

However they seem to overwhelm local decision-making. Source: adapted from World Bank (2000) The case of PNG\u2019s provincial assemblies is even more revealing of the problems associated with national politicians being included in LG councils, as the following inset demonstrates. 16 Provincial Assemblies in PNG and the representation of Parliamentarians The reformed political structures outlined in the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments of PNG were designed to ensure that Parliament plays a strong role in sub-national governance. For example, members of Parliament who represent district electorates in a province are members of the provincial assembly. These members also serve as provincial governors and chairs of provincial executive councils. In addition, joint district planning and budget priorities committees are chaired by the members of Parliament representing each district electorate, and provincial administrators are nominated by members of Parliament in the provincial executive councils. Because provincial administrators also chair the joint provincial planning and budget priorities committees, members of Parliament essentially control all planning and budgeting at the provincial and district levels. Furthermore, to the extent that a joint district planning and budget priorities committee is responsible for LG planning and budgets, members of Parliament control local planning and budgeting as well. Such high parliamentary involvement in the affairs of sub-national governments presents several problems. First, members of Parliament have too many responsibilities and so cannot fulfill all their roles adequately. For example, a number of joint district and joint provincial planning and budget committees have not been established-largely because of the absence of the members of Parliament involved in those committees. Provincial governors have also been absent from provincial headquarters. The general feeling in the provinces is that provincial governors are spending too much time in Port Moresby and are neglecting their provincial responsibilities. Second, the pervasive involvement of Parliament in the affairs of sub-national governments reduces political accountability and responsiveness to local concerns. When national, provincial, and local priorities conflict, local officials are likely to respond to local concerns, while members of Parliament are likely to side with national interests. Source: adapted from Edmison (2000) \u2022 non-elective appointment of interest group representatives \u2013 although this is often for laudable reasons (such as affirmative action), it does raise the issue of how and on what basis such representatives are selected \u2013 and how representative they really are. In Nepal, where Village and District councils (as well as their corresponding committees) are expected to choose representatives of women, of the poor, and of other disadvantaged groups, it is frequently thought that, more often than not, they are elite members, selected for less than laudable reasons. The same comments apply to the pre-1997 LG representational arrangements in Bangladesh, under which women members of Union Parishads were selected by UP Chairmen. How far such appointees \u201crepresent\u201d their interest groups is a moot point. \u2022 appointments that are not intended to be \u201crepresentative\u201d of a particular group \u2013 this is uniquely the case in India where members of the Municipal bodies may be appointed because they have special knowledge or experience of municipal management.

But clearly the electoral system has important implications for the way in which local councils will conduct their political affairs, and the roles and functions which they can perform.

One of the most important issues to consider is the balance between representation and accountability. Representation ensures that those who are elected reflect the choice of the electorate in terms of who will speak for it and the extent to which they actually do so. Concerns for representation focus on proportionality \u2013 that is, ensuring that political, gender, minority, regional, population and other concentrations are equitably represented. Accountability, on the other hand, ensures that voters can call their representatives to account for decisions made in their name. In a democratic society, representation would normally be inclusive and accountability vertical and horizontal \u2013 however, the type of electoral system in place usually means some kind of trade-off between these (and other) considerations. It is generally thought that proportional representation electoral systems favour representation because they tend to produce electoral results that are more reflective of actual voting patterns, whereas plurality- majority systems are thought to enhance accountability because they give voters a representative with which to identify. This may not always be true; however, as proportional systems can concentrate power in parties rather than voters\u2019 hands, and having an identifiable representative in a plurality-majority system may not necessarily translate into greater accountability from this person to the electorate. As shown in table 2 (below), there are three major \u201cfamilies\u201d of electoral systems: Plurality- Majority; Proportional Representation; and Mixed. Plurality-Majority systems focus on the person or persons who win the most votes \u2013 if the margin of victory is 50 + 1%, it is an absolute majority and if the victory is simply based on the most votes but not a majority, it is a plurality (for example, if candidate A wins 30% of the vote, candidate B 30% and candidate C 40%, candidate C wins despite not securing an absolute majority of the votes). Plurality-majority systems tend to be candidate-focused and often geographically specific \u2013 which perhaps explains their apparent dominance in LG systems. 18 Table 2: Electoral Systems in Local Governance Majoritarian Proportional Representation/-Semi- PR Systems Mixed Systems Key features \u2022 usually one candidate elected per constituency * \u2022 \u201csmall\u2019 constituencies/wards \u2022 FPTP system, i.e. winner in each constituency/ward is the candidate with most votes.

Advantages \u2022 usually translates votes into seats, i.e. leads to fewer votes being \u2018lost\u2019. \u2022 improves election opportunities for women \u2022 can be inclusive for minorities Disadvantages \u2022 does not identify any candidate with special local geographic base (accountability) \u2022 re-enforces influence of party over candidates and councillors Examples: Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Indonesia Key features \u2022 variants used to combine parts of Majoritarian and Proportional Representation (e.g. 60 percent of seats allocated through PR system and 40 percent as majority ward seats) Advantages \u2022 combines some advantages from both systems Disadvantages \u2022 relatively complex to implement and communicate \u2022 can create two \"classes\" of elected councillors Examples: Afghanistan *Single member constituencies are usually applied to local electoral systems (although Pakistan and Vietnam are glaring exceptions).

Mixed systems are a combination of plurality-majority with proportional representation, usually with the intention of correcting some of the disproportionality that can result from plurality-majority systems. The two most popular electoral systems used for local level elections in the Asia-Pacific region are First-Past-the-Post (FPTP), which is in the plurality-majority family and based on single-member constituencies, where the person with the most votes wins (used in India and other countries \u2013 see table); and Proportional Representation (PR) List, where parties put forward lists of candidates that are then voted into office based on their \u201cvote share\u201d. Block vote systems, which are part of the plurality-majoritarian family of electoral systems, are also used for local elections in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 in the case of barangays in the Philippines and IDCs in the Maldives. Under the block vote system, electoral districts are multi-member and voters are given as many votes as there are open seats in a legislative chamber or local body; voters can cast the full number of votes or as few votes as they like; and the candidates with the most votes overall win election. It should be noted that different models of electoral representation can be used for different types of election in the same LG system. In Indonesia, for example, current electoral arrangements for LG use: \u2022 a proportional representation system as the basis for the election of provincial, regional and city DPRDs (or councils); \u2022 a \u201ctwo-round or run-off\u201d, majoritarian system for the election of the heads of LGs. These types of election, provided for under new laws enacted in 2004, were scheduled to take place in mid-2005. In Sri Lanka and Cambodia, on the other hand, where councils are also elected on a PR basis, council leaders are selected from parties that dominate local councils. The following table provides a summary of the underlying principles in local electoral systems in the countries covered by this paper. 20 Table 3: summary of local electoral systems for councils in the Asia-Pacific region Electoral system Country Directly elected lower tier LG Councils Directly elected upper tier LG Councils Afghanistan District Councils: Mixed \u2013 SNTV Mixed \u2013 SNTV Bangladesh UPs: P-M, FPTP, single-member ward constituencies N/A Bhutan GYTs: P-M, FPTP N/A India All LG Councils (rural and urban, all tiers): P-M, FPTP, single- member ward constituencies Maldives IDCs: P-M, Block Vote N/A Nepal Village Councils: P-M, FPTP, multi-member ward constituencies N/A Pakistan UCs: P-M, FPTP, using the entire UC as a multi-member constituency N/A Sri Lanka Pradeshi Sabhas, Urban and Municipal Councils: PR List N/A Cambodia Commune Councils: PR List N/A Indonesia All DPRDs (provincial, regency and city): PR Open List Philippines Barangay Councils: P-M, Block Vote Municipal and City Councils, Provincial Boards: P-M, FPTP, single member district constituencies Timor-Leste Suco Councils: P-M, FPTP, single member aldeia (ward) constituencies for aldeia representatives and multi- member Suco constituency for other members Vietnam All People\u2019s Councils (commune, district and province): P-M, FPTP using multi-member electoral units Fiji All Municipal and City Councils: P-M, FPTP, multi-member ward constituencies PNG LLG Councils: P-M.

For this reason, many local electoral systems feature a \u201cward\u201d (small district), neighbourhood, or sub-municipal system of electoral boundary delimitation \u2013 with a specific councillor or set of councillors representing the ward.

In that respect, such local electoral systems are relatively well-suited to countries where literacy amongst voters is limited and where the administrative resources for electoral management are scarce. Whilst ward-based electoral systems can be beneficial in terms of ensuring accountability and being relatively simple, they can also be problematic when minorities or politically weak groups within ward or sub-municipal boundaries are not fully represented. Clearly, the extent to which this can be problematic depends largely on the definition of electoral districts \u2013 where they correspond closely to geographical concentrations of otherwise minority or disadvantaged groups, then the ward system does allow for their representation. However, this is not always the case and it is perhaps not surprising, then, that many of ward-based systems (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam) also include some form of affirmative action policies to ensure representation of minorities or disadvantaged. On the other hand, there is some evidence that local elections that are based on ward representation may improve women\u2019s chances of being elected, as women candidates are more likely to be known to voters in their local communities than in an at-large election across a much larger electoral district. Wards can also enable more women to stand for election as campaigning costs are not as high as in a district- or city-wide election. One of the main disadvantages of ward-based, plurality-majoritarian, electoral systems is the likelihood of wasted votes. This is perhaps somewhat less marked in majoritarian systems, where winners must garner at least 50% of the vote \u2013 the maximum proportion of \u201cwasted\u201d votes is 50% or less under such systems. Indonesia\u2019s two-round electoral system for DPRD heads is a case in point, ensuring that elected heads have received a majority of the votes \u2013 but such majoritarian methods can be costly, time-consuming, and sometimes create instability or uncertainty between rounds. However, where plurality dominates (as it tends to), the potential for wasted votes can be high \u2013 ward councillors can be elected who have garnered considerably less than half the vote. This has been especially marked in PNG, where councillors (and MPs) \u2013 through the FPTP system - have been elected with as little as 5-10% of the vote, thus encouraging them to cater uniquely to very small core constituencies. A high number of wasted votes matters not only because it means that elected representatives may actually represent very few voters, but also because it can discourage voters who may feel their vote does not count and thus reduce popular participation and confidence in the local electoral process. This has obvious implications for the perceived legitimacy of the system. Another key issue in ward-based systems is the definition of electoral jurisdictions. This can be a lengthy and complex process that can be highly political and open to charges of \u201cgerrymandering\u201d, wherein electoral wards or districts are drawn to include or exclude or otherwise split the voting power of certain groups such as ethnic minorities. Finally, plurality-majoritarian systems are often thought to favour fewer and larger political parties, which are able to deploy more resources to mobilise votes for their candidates. 22 Whether this is a \u201cgood\u201d or a \u201cbad\u201d outcome depends on one\u2019s perspective. At the same time, because P-M systems (especially FPTP) tend to be candidate-focused, they are also thought to favour independent (or non-partisan) candidates \u2013 again, how far this is desirable depends on circumstances and somewhat ideological considerations. (3) PR systems PR systems, in contrast, offer the chance of greater plurality in representation \u2013 by assigning council seats to parties on the basis of the proportion of the vote they obtain. In many respects, PR systems seem intrinsically more \u201cdemocratic\u201d. They are also better able to handle the issue of minority and politically weaker groups than are FPTP systems \u2013 women and other disadvantaged groups can, however modestly, usually ensure some degree of representation through PR. Not surprisingly, then, PR systems (such as Indonesia, Cambodia and Sri Lanka) tend towards few or weak affirmative action provisions that are intended to safeguard the interests of such groups. PR systems, significantly, lead to many fewer wasted votes. Beyond a certain threshold, all parties that contest an election will end up being represented on local councils. This \u2013 in theory \u2013 means that almost every vote really does \u201ccount\u201d and thus increases the likelihood of popular participation and confidence in the local electoral process. However, PR-type systems (such as those used in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Indonesia) tend to have several drawbacks:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ddbdf3a-342f-41dc-a634-8319096bf190": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ddbdf3a-342f-41dc-a634-8319096bf190", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "648ce2fbe259ac5fcf8643a67ae520a45f6edbca5546f2514d42fe38d05a9a9a"}}, "hash": "648ce2fbe259ac5fcf8643a67ae520a45f6edbca5546f2514d42fe38d05a9a9a", "text": "\u2022 a limitation on the ability of councillors to represent the specific interests and needs of their constituent geographic communities to government at higher levels, and to communicate planning outcomes and other information to the community level, in a balanced and consistent fashion; \u2022 a somewhat diluted accountability on the part of individual councillors, since each councillor will not represent a specific village or cluster of villages, and since individual citizens do not and can not know who \u201ctheir\u201d representative is; \u2022 this is compounded by the need for PR constituencies to be relatively large (in order for proportionality to have any meaning), which further reduces the links between those who are elected and their constituents; \u2022 in party list systems, individual councillors may feel greater loyalty to their central party organization (to whom they are beholden for their place on the list) than to the locality that they supposedly represent; \u2022 a tendency not to accommodate independent candidates, given the need to submit electoral lists rather than stand as individual candidates; \u2022 a potential for gridlock in decision-making, especially when large numbers of parties are able to ensure only limited representation. These drawbacks of PR-based systems can be partly remedied in a number of ways: \u2022 there can be stipulations that all listed candidates must be (longstanding) local residents, and be locally vetted; and that Council members be replaced or sanctioned if there are citizen complaints regarding failure to fulfil their representational duties, etc; 23 \u2022 lists can be made open (as in Indonesia), thus allowing local voters to express particular preference for specific candidates on party lists. The inset below provides a summary illustration of the key differences between closed and open lists in PR systems. Closed vs. Open PR Lists Closed Lists \u2022 Order of candidates elected is fixed by the party \u2022 Voters are not able to express a preference for a particular candidate \u2022 Voters vote only for the party \u2022 Voters have no choice between candidates, and therefore no say in who will represent their party \u2022 Easy to count Source: adapted from Ellis (2004) Open Lists \u2022 Voters can indicate not just their party, but their favoured candidate within that party \u2022 The number of candidates elected from a party is determined by the total vote for the party \u2022 The order in which candidates are elected depends on their individual vote total \u2022 Voters have more influence over who will represent them \u2022 Candidates can build a following outside their party identification \u2022 More difficult to count As can be seen from the inset, open list PR electoral systems make the relationship between voters and candidates considerably more direct than is the case under closed list systems \u2013 and allow voters to indicate much more clearly who their preferred candidates are. The principal drawback of open list PR systems, however, is their relative complexity, both for voters and for vote-counting purposes. \u2022 \u201ccompensating arrangements\u201d can be introduced whereby councils are obliged by law or regulations to undertake a wider set of consultative activities and interact with area committees, community groups, NGOs, traditional community leaders, village representatives etc., as part of normal business, in order to ensure more effective representation of local views and interests. This is illustrated for Cambodia in the inset below. 24 Taking into account the local dimension in Cambodia One feature of the Commune-level governance system in Cambodia is the emergence of complementary forms of \u201cterritorial representation\u201d and their articulation with the formal political/party-based, representation system embodied by the Commune Councils. Each Commune consists of a number of villages, but the local electoral system does not ensure that every village in a Commune will have a representative in the Commune Council. This highlights the risk that the attention and resources of the Council may be biased in favour of only those villages where the elected Councillors live, or from which they originate. Village-based representative structures, playing both an extension and advisory role vis-\u00e0- vis the formal Councils, are essential to address the above risk and improve local governance overall. One such structure, whose establishment is mandated by the Commune planning regulations, is the Commune Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC). This is an advisory body, which has a critical function in local public expenditures management and in which each village is represented by two persons (one man and one woman). These representatives may be able to voice the concerns of their villages, learn about, and assess, higher-order, commune-level priorities and both influence Commune- level resources allocations and play a political education role back in their own communities.

ROLE OF POLITICAL PARTIES Political parties are among the main actors in governance, influencing the nature of democratic polity in a country, and the coherence of their programmes, their ideologies and leadership has a major impact on local democratic development. Political parties play an important role in enabling and limiting representation at the local level and have important implications for centre-local relations. This section of the Background Paper will try to synthesise what little is known about the dynamics of political parties at the local level. (1) The logic of political parties The growth in political parties over the last century or so has coincided with the increase in elections. The prevailing theory is that with elections there arise a number of needs beyond what traditional executive and legislature structures can provide but which must be met to make elective democracy work. The functions that political parties typically serve in a democratic system, albeit to varying degrees at the national versus local level, are: \u2022 The aggregation of interests: a fundamental goal of political parties is to win power and to do so, they must persuade voters to support them on a variety of issues. This is one way in which political parties differ from both civil society organizations that do not compete for power and lobbying groups that represent a single issue. \u2022 Structuring the vote: this entails giving coherence to voter choices beyond the selection of individual candidates per se. \u2022 Integration and mobilization of the mass public: this includes the organization of election campaigns but also spills over into fostering non-election-related civic engagement and participation. \u2022 Fostering future political leaders: political parties serve as a training ground for future political leaders\u2014both within the party and in future governments. \u2022 Organization of government: this refers to when a party wins executive power and its expectation that the party representatives in the legislature will support its policies. \u2022 Influence or formation of public policy: akin to civil society organizations, parties can serve as a significant source of new policy ideas that then become or influence government policy. As noted above, these are functions that political parties in a democratic system typically serve. The roles and functions of a political party in a non-democratic system (or of a group acting like a political party in a non-party or one-party system), might touch on some of the above functions but will not cover all. The fundamental distinction of parties in a non- democratic system is that these groups do not compete for power in free and fair elections, and they are far closer to the state in terms of their policies, messages and dependence. At a local level, parties are far more likely to aggregate interests, foster future political leaders, mobilize voters and public opinion, and influence the formation of local policy, than they are to impact on the national agenda or influence the formation of a government. (2) Where there are no parties Political parties also raise distinct issues at the local level vis-\u00e0-vis the national level. First there is the question of whether political parties are needed or add value to local governance at all, or whether other forms of aggregating and expressing political interests \u2013 such as direct democracy or town hall style meetings \u2013 would serve small communities 26 just as well if not better. This is certainly an issue that has emerged in one-party or no-party states where local governance is perhaps more dynamic than at the national level (e.g., Vietnam). This embodies somehow the idea that contestability can take many forms (e.g., local contestability in China or Vietnam can exist without national contestability). At the same time, if one accepts the premise outlined above that political parties do more than aggregate society\u2019s interests and are also in the business of seeking and exercising power on the people\u2019s behalf, then they should also play a crucial role in the formation and running of LGs. In one-party States, such as Vietnam, local elections do indeed take place \u2013 and do provide a framework for political competition.

As can been seen from the Vietnamese case study, independent, non-party, candidates can stand for local (and, indeed, national) elections. But all candidates (whether Party on non-Party) must initially be screened by a range of institutions, such as the Fatherland Front, that are closely linked to the Communist Party of Vietnam. This effectively ensures that all candidates \u201cspeak\u201d more or less the same \u201cpolitical language\u201d (that of the Party) and thus implies a limitation on any variation in the political programmes of candidates. (3) Party politics and local elections \u2013 tensions? At the same time, in several multi-party democracies there have been explicit attempts to \u201cdepoliticise\u201d LG, by formally proscribing party candidacies at the local level. This is the case in the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Bhutan. Table 4 below provides baseline information on whether political parties are (or are not) allowed to contest local elections, for each of the country case studies covered in this Background Paper. How far this formal exclusion of partisan candidacies actually \u201cdisconnects\u201d local politics from national political parties is a moot point \u2013 and it is also debatable whether such disconnection is anyway healthy or not. Of course, in countries such as Bhutan, the current absence of any political parties whatsoever does make for any and all elections being non-partisan. In some countries, there is an understandable concern that parties can over-ride local accountabilities and thus break the link between citizens and their representatives at the local level \u2013 although this is much more pronounced in countries with electoral systems based on PR principles. This was apparently one of the reasons for the recent changes in the Indonesian electoral system (at both national and local levels) \u2013 from a closed to an open list form of PR, thus providing voters with the opportunity to make their preferences for individual candidates clearer. Moving towards an open list PR system in 2004 in Indonesia was very much about trying to reduce the power of party executives to select candidates and providing local citizens with rather more say in which individuals (as opposed to which parties) represent them in DPRDs at national, provincial, regency and city levels. As such, the new system represents a \u201cvictory\u201d for those who wished to partly \u201cdepoliticise\u201d the local electoral process. In other cases, it can be argued that depoliticising LG elections reduces the potential for tensions between different LG tiers \u2013 however, in the case of upper tier LG Councils being largely elected indirectly by lower tier Councils (e.g. Pakistan, partly in the Philippines), this should not be as much of an issue as in situations where upper tiers are directly elected (e.g. Indonesia). 27 Table 4: Provisions for political parties Country Political parties allowed/not allowed When political parties are allowed \u2013 independent candidates allowed/not allowed Special provisions Afghanistan Political parties are allowed Bangladesh Political Parties are not allowed.

In countries where national political contests are open to parties, the \u201cde-politicisation\u201d of LG elections can be particularly controversial. In Pakistan, for example, the Local Government Ordinance does not allow political parties to contest local elections \u2013 even though political parties are a vibrant component of national political life. In practice, however, local elections in Pakistan have clearly been contested by the parties. In the 2005 local elections, for example, the Commonwealth Expert Team noted that although the local bodies\u2019 elections were, by law, held on a non-party", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "172c2d2e-6b9b-47f2-979f-5c454addef95": {"__data__": {"id_": "172c2d2e-6b9b-47f2-979f-5c454addef95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7edfe66dbcbe9213a0f56cfc07ebb1c06a315c82311d8d80fcfc4c71467eb23f"}}, "hash": "7edfe66dbcbe9213a0f56cfc07ebb1c06a315c82311d8d80fcfc4c71467eb23f", "text": "basis, in reality the political parties were at the heart of the process \u2013 candidates were openly supported by political parties and the media reported extensive party involvement. The issue in Pakistan, moreover, is one of the extent to which certain parties (i.e. those dominant at the national level) are able to exploit this situation, by tacitly providing substantial support to \u201ctheir candidates\u201d, 28 through the machinery of government, whilst at the same time decrying any involvement/support by other parties. This does not amount to a level playing field \u2013 and certainly does little to foster independent candidacies. In the case of Pakistan, there are reasonable grounds for recommending (as did the Commonwealth Expert Team) that the law be amended to permit the involvement of political parties in local elections, whilst at the same time taking measures to ensure full protection of the rights of independent candidates to stand unhindered (see Commonwealth Expert Team 2005). In general, the overall consensus seems to be that in countries where there are political parties, they should be allowed to contest local elections \u2013 excluding them from LG loses more than it gains, and is usually unrealistic anyway. Perhaps more important, then, is the need to ensure political space for independent local candidates, thus avoiding a complete politicisation of the local electoral process. (4) National-local linkages The second question that arises is what expression political parties take at the local level\u2014 their dynamism, their variation, their ability to perform their role\u2014and how this impacts on local governance. Given that an increase in elections can help catalyze the development of political parties, local party structures of national parties or parties with local appeal might not have benefited from the opportunities provided by LG elections to solidify their bases, develop their ideologies and learn how to govern. Local elections are typically the last priority of transitioning countries and this is particularly true in post- conflict societies, where local elections took place many years after the general elections (e.g., Cambodia) or have still not taken place at all (e.g., Timor-Leste and Afghanistan) in the interests of consolidating politics at the national level. Still, in other contexts, political parties are allowed to contest national elections but not local elections (e.g., Pakistan). (5) National, regional, local and \u201cspecial interest\u201d parties? In more developed democracies, such as India, some parties may be particularly strong at the regional and local levels and may not be represented well or even at all at the national level. This is a situation that is more likely to prevail in democracies that are further developed or in a highly decentralised state where local governance is well rooted. The spectrum of regionally significant but not nationally represented (or weakly represented) parties can be much richer in these contexts and this will impact on the range of policies and ideologies that are brought to bear in local governance. In some countries, however, the legislative framework more or less proscribes the emergence of regional or local parties. This is, for example, the case in Indonesia, where political parties must (in order to be able to contest elections) be registered in at least half the country\u2019s provinces. This legal provision, clearly motivated by the perceived need to counter regionalism, effectively means that local parties cannot develop in Indonesia. By the same token, in countries where the legal framework does not allow for official party involvement in local elections (see above), the emergence of local parties is effectively forestalled. On the other hand, the legal framework in other countries offers few obstacles to the development of local or regional parties. This is certainly the case in India and in Sri Lanka. It is also, de facto, the case in those countries that allow for independent candidates to stand in local elections on the same basis as parties. A final issue worth noting here concerns the ability of special interest groups (such as farmers, or other occupational groups) to contest local elections. In theory, this is not precluded by any electoral system. In practice, however, there appears to be little evidence 29 of this kind of \u201cparty\u201d contesting local elections in the Asia-Pacific country case studies included in this paper. (6) Strong national parties On the flip side of the above, parties that are very dominant at the national level\u2014 particularly those in new democracies where the party in power benefits from state resources and machinery \u2013 also typically have strong local cells. It is not uncommon in such contexts to see, for example, that the one or two big national parties have local offices in the regions while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "298f4c9c-e4a1-4d19-9d90-106416d0ed80": {"__data__": {"id_": "298f4c9c-e4a1-4d19-9d90-106416d0ed80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90bfc4d2e11d50c2d2d2cf878cc94a17b2296d692b9eba7846da0696cfc9ab81"}}, "hash": "90bfc4d2e11d50c2d2d2cf878cc94a17b2296d692b9eba7846da0696cfc9ab81", "text": "the other \u201cnational\u201d parties, even if they are represented in the national legislature, are unable to do the same either because of genuine lack of support or familiarity among potential constituents or because of lack of resources. This phenomenon can result in a replication, in miniature, of national policies and ideologies at the local level. This would certainly appear to be the case in Cambodia, where the three major national parties thoroughly dominated the 2002 Commune elections \u2013 with the party in power, the Cambodia People\u2019s Party (CPP) winning 61.2% of the votes and 68.4% of all Commune Council seats, thus extending its dominance in national politics to the local level as well. (7) Electoral systems and political parties at the local level The extent to which party machines can translate their dominance at the national level into hegemony at local levels, seems however to be influenced by the type of electoral system that is in place. In PR systems, political parties would appear to exercise greater local influence than is the case in majoritarian systems \u2013 the latter, in principle, provide greater opportunities for smaller, more local, parties to successfully contest elections, especially in contexts where multi-party political systems that have only recently emerged. Assuming that there are competitive, multi-partisan elections, the type of electoral system used will directly impact on the relative importance afforded to the party. For example, in FPTP systems, regulations will tend to involve individual candidates for office rather than political parties per se. This is because elections take the form of a set of contests in single- member electoral districts. FPTP systems thus tend to attach greater importance to the candidate, his/her interaction with and responsibility to constituents, and his/her competition with the other candidates. Nonetheless, FPTP does tend to influence the nature of contesting political parties, which usually need to have a fairly wide appeal in order to get elected. In general, then, FPTP tends to favour fewer parties, and often gives raise to a limited number of strong parties, rather than a larger number of small parties. Under proportional representation, on the other hand, elections are primarily a contest between parties. Hence, parties will need to be registered, and their central and regional organizations will tend to have a greater influence over the selection of candidates (see discussion above on \u2018open\u2019 vs. \u2018closed\u2019 lists), while proportional representation systems focus more on party coherence and positioning vis-\u00e0-vis other parties. PR is generally thought to be \u2013 par excellence \u2013 the electoral system for encouraging the formation of political parties, particularly in societies where political parties are a new phenomenon. In its List variety, PR encourages parties to think through their ideology and strategy in contesting elections, because it is the party rather than individuals on the list that the voter is passing judgment on (unless the lists are entirely open or free). At the same time, PR can minimize the \u2018penalty\u2019 that parties would otherwise need to take for poor performance, in that poorly performing parties can be returned to office time and again because they achieve the threshold of representation. PR can therefore artificially sustain poorly performing or otherwise fringe ethnic or regionally based parties that would 30 disappear under a more ruthless electoral system \u2013 and lead to a plethora of small parties. To try to ensure that parties are \u201cnational\u201d or \u201cwider\u201d in nature, some countries place a requirement on parties in order to contest elections. For example, in Indonesia parties must have offices in at least nine provinces in order to contest local and national elections. Beyond FPTP and proportional representation, there are also other models of representation such as collective committee-based systems and systems where LGs or their leaders are selected by a higher level of government, rather than systems of directly elected executives at the local level. (8) Beyond party politics and electoral systems Finally, partly in response to the poor performance and perception of political parties and their failure in many countries to play a constructive role in democracy, there has been a rise in the popularity of alternative measures that can also spill over to the local level. These include allowing independent candidates for office, forming special interest parties and anti-party movements, or focusing more and more on direct democracy\u2014by use of referenda, citizen initiatives and recall options. 31 4.

Different systems try to do this in different ways \u2013 majoritarian systems generally try to do so on the basis of relatively small, ward-based, constituencies, whilst PR systems seek to ensure representation of as many parties (or the interest groups that they represent) as possible, but on the basis of larger constituencies. How far they succeed in providing for fair representation for all categories of citizens varies, depending on a range of circumstances. However, it is generally assumed that PR (as opposed to majoritarian) systems yield outcomes that allow for more equitable representation, especially for women (at least 50% of the electorate). However, the evidence for this is equivocal \u2013 and a great deal depends on political parties and how they establish their electoral lists, as well as on the ways in which society at large views women. In Indonesia, under the old (pre-2004) electoral system, closed list PR did remarkably little to ensure adequate or equitable representation for women, as the following inset shows. Pre-2004 Indonesia, PR and women\u2019s representation Despite Indonesia having a PR-based electoral system, the percentage of women members of the then DPR (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, House of Representatives), MPR (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat, Consultative People\u2019s Assembly) or Regional Councils (DPRDs) was extremely low. Approximately nine per cent of members of the DPR were, and an even lower percentage in the DPRD I (province) and DPRD II (district or regency) were women. There were no women members in some DPRD II in several provinces. No woman held the position of provincial governor, and only 1.5 per cent of regents/mayors, or six individuals, were women. Source: IDEA International (2002) Clearly, PR \u2013 as an electoral system \u2013 is no guarantee of adequate representation for \u201cminorities\u201d, let alone women in societies where the position of minorities or women is such that political parties remain elite-dominated or patriarchal. Direct and indirect electoral systems for LG councils also strive, in different ways, to ensure adequate representation for all. Here, however, it seems reasonable to argue that whilst indirect systems may provide for better \u201cgeographical\u201d representation, direct systems are probably better equipped to ensure a more equitable \u201csocio-political\u201d representation. As one goes \u201cup\u201d the LG system, indirect elections seem to inevitably favour greater elite representation. This is clearly brought out in the case of Pakistan\u2019s LG system (based, as has been seen, on indirect elections), where \u201c[e]stablished families dominate a greater proportion of elected offices as one moves up the tiers of local government.\u201d (Manning et al. 2003: 27); the tendency becomes yet more marked with regard to indirectly elected nazims at tehsil and district levels, where \u201c[t]he majority of nazims are experienced politicians from established political families. According to one media survey, 30% of 32 district nazims in Punjab were former MNAs or MPAs, and approximately 90% belonged to established political families.\u201d (ibid.) Direct elections for higher level councils (whether based on majoritarian or PR principles), on the other hand, are probably more likely to yield somewhat less elite-biased results \u2013 although the inevitably higher costs of political campaigning in larger constituencies probably inhibit the successful involvement of poorer candidates. However, direct (as opposed to indirect) elections would certainly, a priori and all else being equal increase the chances of non-elite representation. In sum, although elections to LG are intended to lead to a fair representation of the constituents in the respective localities, this may not be the case. In many cases minorities, indigenous people and disadvantaged groups are not given adequate representation or are unable to translate their demographic \u201cvoice\u201d into electoral representation. Local elites, of one kind or another, can project their power and resources into disproportionate levels of political representation. In order to address this issue, countries may introduce specific mechanisms to ensure the representation of these groups in the various LG bodies. The two most common methods for ensuring the representation of these groups are (i) through putting in place electoral systems that ensure better representation or (ii) through the introduction of quota systems and reserved seats. 4.2.

The one drawback with this system is that it generally requires literacy on the part of voters (to be able to read and distinguish between the names of candidates) and is a relatively costly mode of election (especially if photos of candidates are used instead of names). In Asia-Pacific 5 The Lund Recommendations on the Effective Participation of National Minorities in Public Life & Explanatory Note, 1999, Foundation for Inter-Ethnic Relations, http://www.osce.org/documents/hcnm/1999/09/2698_en.pdf 33 34 countries, minority or disadvantaged groups may be disproportionately illiterate, thus making preferential voting problematic for them as a way of selecting candidates; in addition, the costs of implementing preferential voting systems may be too high for poorer countries, particularly for local elections where millions of candidates may be standing. \u2022 Lower numerical thresholds for representation in the elected body, which would imply that minorities or disadvantaged groups face fewer hurdles in being represented. Again, the success of this as a measure to ensure representation on locally elected bodies is predicated on the existence of parties that uphold their interests or are clearly identified with them. These measures \u2013 despite the caveats \u2013 do nonetheless increase the likelihood of minority or disadvantaged groups being represented. 4.3. Affirmative action through quotas and other mechanisms However, of the countries which have been covered in this paper, most have put in place some provision for affirmative action of one kind or another \u2013 the exceptions being Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. In the countries where provisions have been made for the inclusion of minorities, indigenous peoples and disadvantaged groups, quotas and reserved seats appear to be the preferred method. Of the countries which have been detailed in this report the majority do have provisions for affirmative action \u2013 although which groups are targeted by these provisions vary from country to country. The provisions for ensuring the representation of minorities, indigenous peoples and disadvantaged groups may also vary between the different tiers and types of LG in a country. In general the systems for filling reserved seats fall into a number of categories \u2013 direct or indirect elections of different types (with quotas or reservations in one form or another), appointments, etc. Some systems focus on candidates, others on seats. The following sections explore some of these different ways of handling direct affirmative action in local electoral systems. Table 5 below provides a summary of the affirmative action measures that are provided for in the various LG representational arrangements in the sixteen countries covered by this paper.

This contributed to the fact that 37 percent of the local councillors elected in 1992 were women. In 1997, the Local Authorities Act was amended to allow for a second round of local authority elections to take place in 1998 using the party list system instead of changing to a ward-based system as stipulated by the Act. At this time, the affirmative action measures were further strengthened, specifying that party lists had to include a minimum of three women on councils with ten or less members, and at least five women on larger councils. This resulted in an increase of women\u2019s representation in LG up to 41 percent. More women have since entered office through by-elections, such that Namibia currently has 45 percent women at the local authority level, while 40 percent of mayors are women. The current president of the Association of Local Authorities in Namibia is a woman \u2013 two other female presidents preceded her. Source: IDEA International (2004) Another example from outside the region comes from France, where a law passed in 2000 requires that each party have at least 50 percent women candidates on its list in certain races, like municipal elections, otherwise they will not be registered. In other cases, incentives rather than regulations are applied: in France, in the case of parliamentary elections, the law does not enforce non-registration for failing to comply, but instead reduces state subsidies to parties with fewer than 50 percent women candidates (obviously, some parties prefer to \"take the penalty\" rather than meet the 50% threshold in these elections). 38 (2) Reserved seats Although there are no documented cases of quotas being applied to candidate/party lists in the countries studied in the Asia-Pacific region, several countries have used reserved seats as the basis for quotas in LG elections. India is one country where far-reaching provisions for affirmative action have been made \u2013 which are also enshrined in the constitution. Seats in LG bodies at all levels are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Tribes according to their proportion of the population and at least one third of the seats are reserved for women. In addition, similar quotas apply to local council leadership positions. In some countries the number or composition of reserved seats are not predetermined. In the case of the Philippines a decision has to be made (prior to the holding of the elections) on which segments of society are to fill the three reserved seats at each level, one of which is always reserved for a woman. A further example is Timor-Leste where two women, two young people of each gender and one elder are to be elected \u2013 by direct elections \u2013 to the Suco Council. Sri Lanka is also a country where provisions are made for seats to be reserved for the young, in addition to rather vague (and weak) constitutional provisions for promoting women\u2019s representation. Nepal is an example where varying systems are applied at the different levels of LG. At the lowest level (the Ward) one out of five, directly elected, seats is reserved for women. A similar system is in place in Pakistan although the number of reserved seats is considerably higher, in particular with regard to women. In contrast to the Nepali case, however, in Pakistan women are either directly elected (to Union Councils) or indirectly elected by the entire electoral college (all the councillors of constituent Unions) of the upper level LG unit in question (tehsil, town, district). Pakistan\u2019s local electoral system also ensures that minority religious groups are represented. Prior to 2005, this was done by having a separate electoral roll for such groups, who then elected their representatives. Since 2005, however, minority and majority electoral rolls have been unified, but reserved seats have been maintained. Vietnam also presents an interesting case in that no provisions are made for reservation of seats. However, when establishing the composition of the People\u2019s Councils and the list of candidates to stand for election, consideration is given to ensuring that an appropriate number of women are represented, and that when part of the population is made up of ethnic minorities an appropriate number of ethnic people are represented.

Finally the Hill Tract Parishads in Bangladesh are designed specifically to ensure the representation of the indigenous peoples. Seats are reserved for the Hill Tribes in relation to their proportion of the population in the Hill Tracts. Non-indigenous people are however also elected to the Parishads. 39 (3) Appointments Another way of ensuring some degree of representation on the part of minorities or socially disadvantaged groups is through appointment, rather than election. Several examples of this can be cited. In Nepal, at higher levels of the LG system (Villages, Municipalities and Districts), seats are reserved for the poor, tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous peoples, of which a certain number must be women. These seats, however, are not filled by direct election. Instead the ordinary members of the respective LG body (most of whom are indirectly elected by lower level electoral colleges) are the ones who elect the representatives to fill these seats. In PNG, women representatives are appointed to both the provincial assemblies and to Local-Level Government (LLG) Councils. Interestingly, two women are appointed to rural LLG Councils, but only one to urban LLG Councils. This would appear to be in recognition of the reduced likelihood of women being directly elected to Councils in rural (as opposed to urban) areas. In the Philippines, steps have been taken beyond merely reserving seats for the young in that a separate LG body (the Youth Council) has been established for which only those over 15, but under 21 years of age may stand for election as well as vote. A member of these bodies also serves in the other LG units. In addition, municipal and provincial councils in the Philippines are required to appoint three \u201csectoral\u201d members, representing women, workers and other disadvantaged groups as necessary. Whilst such appointments do serve the purpose of ensuring some kind of representation for marginal or socially disadvantaged groups, it remains the case that they are probably a less satisfactory way of doing so than through direct elections with quotas. The legitimacy of appointees is likely to be considerably less than that enjoyed by elected members. In addition, the representativity of appointees may also be an issue, as well as the manner of their appointment. (4) Outcomes How far do such affirmative action procedures lead to the intended outcomes? In this section, this issue is briefly looked at, firstly with regard to women\u2019s representation (for which there is considerable documentation) and secondly with regarded to other marginalized groups (for which there is less documented evidence). (a) Women and affirmative action Firstly, it should be pointed out that Sri Lanka provides a striking example of representational outcomes in the absence of strong affirmative action measures. In 2000, less than 2% of LG seats in Sri Lanka were occupied by women \u2013 in marked contrast to other South Asian countries (especially given the relatively high rates of schooling enjoyed by women in Sri Lanka). This low level of women\u2019s representation appears to be a direct function of the electoral system and of there being no reserved seats for women. In addition, the electoral system for LG in Sri Lanka is not ward-based, but is \u201cat large\u201d. In Sri Lanka, it is interesting to note that while quotas for women have so far been rejected, wards have been recommended instead \u2013 to help more women get elected (source: \u201cWomen in Local Government in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 A comparative analysis of thirteen countries\u201d, Jean Drage, Paper presented to the Asia \u2013 Pacific Summit of Women Mayors and Councillors Phitsanulok, Thailand 18-22 June 2001). 40 The same can be said of Cambodia (where no formal provisions for ensuring women\u2019s representation in Commune councils exist). While 16.2% of the candidates in the 2002 Commune elections were women, the share of elected female councillors is just 4.5%. In the end, 448 women were elected on CPP party lists, 35 on FUNCINPEC lists, and 30 on SRP lists. Broken down by parties, this represents 5.8%, 1.6%, and 2.2% of elected councillors from the respective parties. Very clearly, Cambodian women are under-represented in relation to their electoral or demographic importance. Where affirmative action measures are in place, the outcomes in terms of women\u2019s representation in elected LG units are generally much better. In Nepal, where legal provisions ensure women\u2019s representation, some 24% of all elected members were women in the previously elected local bodies. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, roughly a third of all seats in LG are occupied by women. The case of India is perhaps the most striking in terms of the absolute outcomes of affirmative action in favour", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2790e092-aa2b-4088-8d2b-51b52108efc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "2790e092-aa2b-4088-8d2b-51b52108efc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afb714bc124bb15922b8881326f937a1a8d957841cb46fb5b3af95f07a2ae1d6"}, "3": {"node_id": "58e5d2a1-3c66-4ecd-baf2-1073104d2751", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85082ecdca3fd955a3699e2d1911837993d7e5cdac3ef2179c4295ef09c0328c"}}, "hash": "7b51427839437a2f88a4b2219523fd5cf6f8bd2ef53c6189e4c19426522c1bf6", "text": "of women\u2019s representation in LG \u2013 with over 1,000,000 women serving as councillors in LG.

To begin with, reserved seats for women may not actually be filled, through a lack of candidates or voter antipathy to affirmative action. The case of local elections in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan is a good example of this. Elections were held for all union councils from December 2000 to July 2001, and over 36,000 women were elected to fill mainly the reserved seats. This represented almost 29% of the total 126,462 seats available. In NWFP, women were elected to 3,963 union council 41 seats representing only 69% of the 5,742 seats reserved for them. Approximately 1,779 seats were left vacant, most of which were in four districts (Upper and Lower Dir, Batagram and Kohistan) where anti-woman campaigning made it difficult to fill them. In the tehsil councils, 175 women were elected to the 201 seats reserved for them (87%) and 26 were left vacant. In the town councils, women were elected to all 30 seats reserved for them. At the district level, 278 women (88%) were elected to 315 reserved seats; 37 were left vacant. In addition, provisions for the representation of women in councils do not necessarily translate into adequate representation in upper levels of the LG system (see previous chapter) or in executive or leadership positions. In Nepal in 1997, for example, more than 100,000 women participated in the VDC elections, and 36,000 were elected. However, in other branches of LG, women were only marginally represented. For example, only 289 women were elected ward chairs out of a total of approximately 36,000 wards. Of the 26 women who ran for membership in the District Development Committees, only 8 were elected, and only 1 woman was elected vice-chair. The same pattern emerges in Pakistan. As a result of the reservation system, about 36,000 women are now members of LG institutions \u2013 approximately 32,000 in union councils, 1,800 in tehsil councils, and 2,000 in district councils. However, such relatively high levels of women\u2019s representation on LG councils are not replicated when one looks at locally elected leadership: a total of only 11 women were elected as nazims (two district council nazims, one tehsil council nazim, and eight union council nazims), out of a total of over 6,400 nazims (at all levels). Thus, while affirmative action procedures in local electoral systems go a long way towards ensuring representation, still more needs to be done to ensure representation at high levels, and to translate representation into influence and political voice. Finally, it is perhaps also worth looking very briefly at how affirmative action procedures can have sometimes unhelpful consequences. The special electoral arrangements that are often needed to ensure women\u2019s representation may sometimes create particular problems for women, as is made clear from Bangladesh.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58e5d2a1-3c66-4ecd-baf2-1073104d2751": {"__data__": {"id_": "58e5d2a1-3c66-4ecd-baf2-1073104d2751", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afb714bc124bb15922b8881326f937a1a8d957841cb46fb5b3af95f07a2ae1d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "2790e092-aa2b-4088-8d2b-51b52108efc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b51427839437a2f88a4b2219523fd5cf6f8bd2ef53c6189e4c19426522c1bf6"}}, "hash": "85082ecdca3fd955a3699e2d1911837993d7e5cdac3ef2179c4295ef09c0328c", "text": "In Union Parishads (made up of nine wards in all), the 1997 legislation provided for affirmative action for women representatives.

This means that elected women have three, elected, usually male counterparts. This situation has created a problem on the Councils as the males often do not want to recognize the women as legitimate representatives of their wards. The fact that women have much larger constituencies than their male counterparts also poses particular problems, for example, the difficulty of meeting the expectations of such a large group.

Yet, all that said, the elected women members have much greater legitimacy and acceptance than the earlier (pre-1997) nominated women members, beholden to the Chairman for his patronage. And there are signs that these women members are being given more specific responsibilities as Chairpersons of specific Parishad standing committees. Also, through training, they are gradually assuming a greater role in UP affairs in general. Another case in point is in India, where Article 243D of the Constitution clearly directs that the reserved seats, both for women, as well as for scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST), shall be allotted by rotation to different constituencies in a panchayat. This has generally been interpreted to mean that such a rotation should take place at the end of every five years. If this interpretation is given effect to, then no woman, SC or ST member is ever likely to get the opportunity of occupying the same seat for a second term, as it is improbable that these persons would be allowed to contest from the same constituency 42 when the reservation is removed. Given that most of the women members in the panchayats do not have any prior experience and will therefore find it difficult to occupy positions of power in the initial period, it seems somewhat \u201cunfair\u201d that they should not be allowed to continue in such positions, beyond one term. Since this provision of rotation applies to the SC/ST/woman chairpersons also, it is possible that the local bureaucrats may take an upper hand in some places, as they can be fairly certain that the chairperson has no chance of getting re-elected. Finally, affirmative action in the form of reserved seats may have perverse consequences for minority or socially disadvantaged candidates for non-reserved seats. The recent 2005 elections for Bougainville\u2019s Autonomous Government (a more autonomous form of the usual Papuan Provincial Assembly) are a case in point. In Bougainville, while 3 of the 39 seats in the Assembly were reserved for women and were contested by 25 women candidates, there were apparently no women candidates for the 33 regular constituency seats, for which they were also entitled to stand. Commonwealth observers of the Bougainville elections were given the impression that because of the reserved seats for women, many women did not feel that they were \u201csupposed\u201d to contest the regular constituency seats. Reserved seats, then, may actually discourage minority or socially disadvantaged candidates from contesting open seats. (b) Marginal groups: scheduled castes and tribal groups in India Under the Indian constitution, seats and the offices of chairpersons in all the three tiers of panchayats are reserved for the SC and ST members in proportion to their population. In addition to this, provisions are in place for the state legislatures to make reservations for any other backward caste (OBC) people. In accordance with this provision, at least 10 states have made reservation provisions for the OBCs. However, in spite of the statutory and administrative efforts to provide political space to such communities, it cannot be said that the panchayats have been able to take effective measures for entirely compensating for the economic and social deprivation of the marginalized people. In places where the grip of the dominant caste over the social system is very strong, many of the elected officials from the weaker communities apparently feel powerless. One low caste person summed up the position succinctly: \u201cEven if a low-caste pradhan (chairperson) is elected, he will be able to function as per the dictates of the jats. If he works differently, it will be difficult for him to stay in the village\u201d. The position of women belonging to the SC/ST communities is even worse. For example, a tribal woman, elected as sarpanch in Thikiri village of Dausa district of Rajasthan, was manhandled and prevented from hoisting the national flag on Independence Day, because the upper caste male villagers were unwilling to tolerate the idea of the flag being hoisted by a tribal woman. Such anecdotal evidence indicates the extent to which reserved seats and the like; whilst they may translate into impressive quantitative outcomes, they cannot be a \u201cquick fix\u201d solution to the problematic of deeply engrained hierarchy in much of Indian society. Notwithstanding such disquieting anecdotes, reservation provisions have clearly made a major contribution towards the inclusion of marginalized communities in the power structure of LG institutions. However, before perceptible changes can take place in terms of their effective involvement in the local decision making process, much needs to be done to enhance their capabilities.

One of the key concerns here, of course, is the prescribed minimum age of both voters and candidates: where the age of candidates is relatively high, the youth are unlikely to be 43 represented. In Afghanistan, the relatively high minimum age for councillors (who should be 35 or older) effectively eliminates the likelihood of the youth being represented. The Philippines has arguably the most outwardly \u201cpro-youth\u201d local representational system in the world. There, the Local Government Code provides for the organisation of Youth Councils in every village and barangay, whose members are elected by those between 15 and 21 years old. At every level of the Philippines\u2019 LG system, these Youth Councils and their federations are represented, thus ensuring that LG decision-making is at least partly attuned to the needs of the younger part of the electorate. 4.4. Special electoral and representational arrangements In a number of Asia-Pacific countries, special arrangements have been made to deal with highly specific local issues \u2013 demands for greater autonomy (often linked to conflict or post-conflict issues), problems of social and cultural identity for indigenous peoples, and the like. Such arrangements are generally exceptional to the wider representational systems within which they have been developed \u2013 and have usually combined enhanced devolution (more widespread powers at the local level) with special arrangements for political representation. Here, a few examples will be explored. The examples illustrate the principle that one size does not necessarily fit all, and that LG systems and their accompanying representational arrangements do not have to be uniform across the board. They can be, so to speak, \u201casymmetric\u201d and thus able to deal with very particular circumstances in a sensitive way. 44 (1) Tribal Panchayats in India In addition to the quotas reserved for the scheduled tribes in proportion to their population in all the tiers of regular Panchayati Raj Institutions, certain special provisions were considered necessary for the Panchayats of certain tribal enclaves within nine states, in addition to the north-eastern states of India. These are known as the Schedule V areas. The 73rd amendment to the Indian Constitution specifically stated that its provisions would not be directly applicable to these areas. The Panchayats in tribal areas of these nine states have been given a special legal dispensation. This special law is called The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Area) Act 1996 (commonly referred to as the PESA Act), enacted in accordance with an enabling provision in the Constitution. The PESA Act recognizes the specific rights of tribal communities over natural resources, respects their traditional institutions and gives substantial powers of self-governance to the tribal communities. The PESA Act is also the first law to empower people to redefine their own administrative boundaries. The powers that are vested in the village assembly \u2013 the Gram Sabha \u2013 authorize it to approve all development plans, control all functionaries and institutions in social sectors as well as manage water bodies and other natural resources, have ownership of minor forest produce, prevent alienation of land, manage village markets and resolve disputes. The village assembly and Panchayat are required to be consulted prior to any move to acquire land or grant any mineral concessions. In electoral terms, the PESA Act provides that at least 50% of the members in these Schedule V Panchayats are tribals and that the Chairperson is always a tribal. As such, PESA gives the scheduled tribes the necessary level of political representation to ensure that any and all decisions taken in the Panchayats are not indifferent to their traditions and customs. The PESA Act should be seen as an important legislative measure that tries to introduce local self-government in the tribally dominated Schedule V areas, without disturbing the tradition, culture and lifestyle of the local people. However, because the Act requires further legislation on the part of the nine states involved, its implementation has not always been entirely consistent.

(3) Special autonomy for Aceh in Indonesia Aceh, the northernmost area of Sumatra, has been in conflict with Indonesia\u2019s central government since the 1950s over its demands for greater autonomy. These demands are founded on Aceh\u2019s strong Islamic traditions (in a constitutionally secular Indonesia) and on a sense of being discriminated against in terms of its share of natural resource revenues. Violent conflict and unrest has been the norm in Aceh for almost five decades. In an effort to bring an end to secessionist conflict, Aceh was granted \u201cspecial autonomy\u201d in 2002. This special autonomy is much broader than the \u201cregional autonomy\u201d enjoyed by most other Indonesian provinces and includes the local implementation of Shariah law and the retention of a greater share of royalties from the exploitation of its natural resources. The law maintains central government authority over Aceh's foreign political relations, external defence and monetary affairs, while all other responsibilities fall within the sphere of competence of the provincial government7. The law allows Aceh to retain over 70 % of the royalties derived from local oil and gas exploitation and to over 60 % of the royalties levied on the exploitation of other natural resources; these proportions are significantly larger than the respective 20 and 15 % that other provinces retain. Special autonomy also provides Aceh with more freedom to run its internal affairs, to re-design LG in line with local traditions, and to base the legal system of the province on Shariah law. The law also provides for local electoral reform, giving the people greater control over their own affairs. The governor, regents and mayors are to be elected directly by the people, rather than by their local legislators.8 (4) Special autonomy for Bougainville in Papua New Guinea From 1988 until 1997-98, the island (or province) of Bougainville in PNG experienced serious armed conflict between separatists and government forces, during which an estimated 20,000 people died. At the heart of the conflict were issues linked to traditional land tenure arrangements, the environment and control over the use of natural resources (most notably, the Panguna mine). A cease-fire between the PNG government and the rebels was signed in April 1998, and a full peace agreement in August 2001. Under the eyes of a regional peace-monitoring force and a UN observer mission, the government and provincial leaders established an interim administration and made significant progress toward complete surrender/destruction of weapons. The agreement provided for greater legal autonomy for Bougainville (as an autonomous region within PNG), with a locally-elected administration having the power to 7 The special autonomy for Aceh is close to the \"comprehensive autonomy\" offered by Jakarta to East Timor, which the East Timorese rejected in their August 30, United Nations-supervised ballot. 8 See e.g. Decentralized Governance in Conflict and Post Conflict Situations: Is Decentralization a Workable Solution to Manage Diversity within a Country?

ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND LINKAGES TO THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS This section of the paper briefly explores a range of issues linked to the organisational structure and the administrative context within which LGs in the Asia-Pacific region operate. It touches upon them insofar as they have implications for representational and accountability issues. 5.1. Population, representation and related issues The size of LG units in the Asia-Pacific region varies enormously. When considered in conjunction with electoral arrangements (direct/indirect elections, majoritarian/PR systems, etc.) and the size of representational bodies, the size of a jurisdiction\u2019s population may have considerable implications in terms of \u201cproximity\u201d and accountability. Table 7 below summarises the information available about the populations and other key features of LGs in the 16 countries which this paper has tried to focus on. Tier 1 LG units vary considerably in size from country to country \u2013 with those in Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Timor-Leste generally being the smallest (with average populations of 2,500-3,500). By far the largest Tier 1 LGs are those in Sri Lanka \u2013 although if one classifies Indonesian regencies as being Tier 1, then they are considerably larger. Tier 1 LGs in India, Cambodia and Vietnam occupy the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d, whilst Bangladeshi Ups, Pakistani Unions and PNG\u2019s Local-Level Governments tend to be relatively large. Afghanistan\u2019s districts, assuming that they can be classified as Tier 1 LGs, are also (on average) relatively large. Tier 2 LG units, where they exist, are also highly variable in size \u2013 the largest (on average) being Indonesian regencies and Afghan provinces, and the smallest (on average) being Bhutanese Dzongkhags. Nepali districts, although relatively small on average, vary enormously among themselves in terms of population. Vietnamese districts, with an average population of 125,000, occupy the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. Tier 3 LG units, where they exist, also vary greatly in demographic size. Indonesian provinces are, on average, bigger than some Asian countries (e.g. Bhutan, Timor-Leste). The smallest Tier 3 LGs are, somewhat surprisingly, Indian Zilla Panchayats. Once again, Vietnam\u2019s provinces occupy the \u201cmiddle ground\u201d. Of the three countries that operate PR systems for local elections, Cambodia is exceptional in that its LG units are relatively small. In Sri Lanka and especially Indonesia, jurisdictions/constituencies tend to be large. In contrast, where majoritarian systems are in place (i.e. in most countries), the size of commensurate LG units tends to be smaller (with, of course, the exception of Cambodia). Levels of representation vary from country to country (see Table 6). Among Tier 1 LGs, Nepali Village Councils appear to be the most highly representative in this respect \u2013 on average, each member of the Village Council represents 70 people (and even fewer voters). In contrast, UP members in Bangladesh and Union councillors in Pakistan (on average) represent some 2,000 people. 49 Table 7: size and other features of non-urban LG jurisdictions Local government levels Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Country Name Population* # of council members Elect- oral sys- tem Name Population* # of council members Elect- oral sys- tem Name Population* # of council members Elect- oral sys- tem Afghanistan District 60,000 5-15 D Mixed Province 630,000 9-29 D Mixed Bangladesh Union Parishad 27,000 13 D Maj Bhutan Geog 3,000 Variable Min.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "553ea9fc-2f3b-4f7c-a315-fcd547e1e51d": {"__data__": {"id_": "553ea9fc-2f3b-4f7c-a315-fcd547e1e51d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "826bb8267bdc81ea9de01a835bfa7419d2512ab2a6aab7a6845aaec4fd1e5681"}, "2": {"node_id": "a45e0a6b-6e7d-4f1f-b2ee-29a7c5dfd78d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0843d0d95ecef828339198e76925086268efdb61a2ade4f853d6a5621f4530a9"}}, "hash": "0a30a5007c8ad52d7d0d62d9d47a7809ce6ea0299cd03f02e8a6834248bceca2", "text": "3 D Maj Dzongkhag 30,000 Variable I India Gram Panchayat L = 20,000 S = 670 Variable Avge = 13 D Maj Panchayat Samiti L = 330,000 S = 3,000 Variable Avge = 25 M Maj Zilla Panchayat L = 800,000 S = 100,000 Variable Avge = 27 M Maj Maldives Island 1,000 7-15 Maj Atoll L = 87,000 S = 1,700 10-20 Maj Nepal Village 3,500 53 D District Maj 30,000 L= 700,000 S = 16,000 Variable I Pakistan Union 25,000 13 D Tehsil Maj N/a Variable I Maj District N/a Variable I Maj Sri Lanka Pradeshiya Sabha L = 265,000 S = 14,000 Variable D PR Provinces 2,000,000 Variable D PR Cambodia", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40584088-353e-4202-8c00-125d56ea5872": {"__data__": {"id_": "40584088-353e-4202-8c00-125d56ea5872", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f29a70136ffd5983c4d1716a183e073d26d0b10aa416f7059d2081db3f083811"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d0a1611-347c-4726-92f0-1616b130bae3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37ac1e48efedf704780ab3ac5504815427a5547551ea7b6ec63a7343a51855a5"}}, "hash": "681ce5e554998a816a52663b38cf9ae427bdc9ef1e67c9bed7efaf2896f9bbf8", "text": "Commune 7,000 5-11 D PR Indonesia Regency 500,000 20-45 D PR Province 7,000,000 L = 35,000,000 S = < 1,000,000 35-100 D PR Philippines Barangay N/a 9 M Maj Municipality N/a Minimum 12 M Maj Province L = 3,300,000 S = 16,000 Min. 9-13 M Maj Timor-Leste Suco 2,500 Variable Min. 7 Vietnam Commune 8,000 19-35 D District Maj 125,000 30-40 D Maj Province 1,250,000 50-95 D Maj Fiji Town L = 80,000 S = 1,100 8-21 D Maj City 50,000 16-20 D Maj Papua New Guinea LLG 16,000 7-43 D Maj Province 270,000 Variable I Solomon Islands Provinces 51,000 9-30 D Maj Notes: * wherever possible indicates average; D = direct; I = indirect; M = mixed I/D; Maj = majoritarian; PR = PR; L = largest; S = smallest; Min = minimum Not surprisingly, and as can also be seen from Table 6, levels of representation decline as one goes up the tiers \u2013 in India, by far the easiest case to interpret, there are approximately 1,000 people for every councillor at the Gram Panchayat (Tier 1) level, but roughly 25,000 people per councillor at the Zilla Panchayat (Tier 3) level. The pattern is repeated for all countries with multi-tier systems, but to different degrees. In that sense, then, the \u201chigher\u201d up the LG, the less its council is \u201crepresentative\u201d of its citizens. This reflects the inevitable trade-off between \u201crepresentation\u201d and efficiency \u2013 a Zilla Panchayat that had, for example, one councillor for every 1,000 people in the district would, in most cases, constitute an entirely unwieldy and over-sized body. It is perhaps worth noting here that in order for LGs to be significant and efficient providers of services, they generally need to be of a certain size. The range of services that can realistically be provided by small, Tier 1 LGs is necessarily limited. And yet, it is precisely at these levels that \u201crepresentational density\u201d tends to be highest \u2013 and that upper tiers (which can provide a wider range of services) tend to be rather less \u201crepresentative\u201d. Electoral mandates for councillors are relatively uniform across the region, varying from three years (in the case of Bhutan) to five years (in most cases). 5.2. Remuneration and frequency of meetings In most countries, council members tend to be elected and seen as \u201cvoluntary\u201d representatives of the public. As such, they are usually not paid regular salaries. Nonetheless, being a council member is not without its costs \u2013 council members must dedicate time, travel to meetings, arrange meetings with their constituents and the like. The following examples shows how some countries help meet these costs: \u2022 in many cases (e.g. Nepal), council members are provided with sitting fees for the days that they are in council; \u2022 in the Philippines, Barangay Council members receive allowances (defined by ordinance) as well as a number of other benefits, such as insurance, free medical care and exemptions from tuition fees. Members of Municipal Councils and Provincial boards are provided with monthly allowances; \u2022 for the more \u201cexecutive\u201d arms of councils, special provisions are often made for members\u2019 remuneration. Thus, in Vietnam, members of the People\u2019s Councils\u2019 Standing Committees are actually considered to have full-time jobs and are remunerated accordingly. In Timor-Leste, Suco Chiefs are paid a regular monthly allowance of US$ 50 by central government, intended to cover transport and other costs. The payment of sitting fees and the like has implications for representation \u2013 where no remuneration whatsoever is provided, poorer citizens may either be deterred from standing for election (in the knowledge that they will be ill-placed to participate in council deliberations) or, in the event that they do become elected, may find it difficult to afford the costs of being a representative. Wealthier citizens do not face the same constraints under such circumstances. The frequency of council meetings varies both between countries and between tiers.

However, in all cases, committees need to meet on a more regular basis in order to oversee the implementation of the policies and budgets endorsed and approved by their respective councils. In Nepal, this is clearly recognised in legal provisions. Given that such committees do meet more frequently and effectively manage day-to-day LG business, it is obviously important to carefully craft the ways in which they are constituted (membership) and the extent to which their members are remunerated. 5.3. Councils and Local Administrations (1) Appointed administrative executives and local government staffing LG councils are usually unable by their nature to manage the day-to-day affairs of their jurisdictions. Even when elected mayors or council leaders assume more executive powers, there is generally a need to establish some kind of a \u201cdedicated\u201d local administration. In somewhat extreme cases, appointed executives can be heads or members of the councils. Thus, in the Maldives, the Island Development Committees and Atoll Development Committees are chaired by centrally appointed Island/Atoll Chiefs. In Nepal at the moment, although admittedly under rather specific circumstances, VDCs and DDCs are chaired by officials who are appointed by central government \u2013 respectively, the VDC Secretary and the Local Development Officer. In some cases, LGs include appointed executives, with varying degrees of power with regard to elected councils. Sri Lankan provinces, for example, have governors who are appointed by the President of the Republic: they are responsible for executing the policies of their respective Provincial Councils through a board of ministers headed by a chief minister and no more than four other ministers. The governor appoints the chief minister, and the other ministers on the advice of the chief minister. In India, the Chief Executives of upper tier LGs are usually senior civil servants of their respective states (see also the previous section on appointment in local councils). In such cases, where local executives are appointed by institutions other than the LG that they are expected to serve, the issue is almost always one of accountability and the relative power of elected representatives. The following inset provides some insight into the overall problematic in Indian rural LG. 51 India \u2013 are local bureaucrats accountable to elected representatives? The Government of Madhya Pradesh characterised the relationship between the Zilla Panchayat (ZP) CEO (Chief Executive Officer, appointed by the State Government) and the elected ZP President as similar to the relationship between the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary of the State. However this was not the relationship observed in the field. The ZP CEO is accountable to the Collector, not to the ZP Chairperson. The situation was similar in Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Only in Kerala was the situation different \u2013 there, due to specific legislation, the ZP President was fully in charge \u2013 but, as a result, the government of Kerala had a lot of difficulty keeping the slots filled with Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers. Source: adapted from World Bank (2000) The practice of central or state governments appointing the chief executives for LGs often creates divided loyalties among LG personnel and potentially dilutes local political control. In many formerly colonised countries, the practice appears to have been inherited from the deep-rooted colonial mistrust of local native administrations and the resulting wish to install a colonial functionary to guard against the possible misuse of power and wasteful expenditure. Accordingly, most locally elected officials in Asian countries see the practice as undermining the principle of local democracy and empowered local bodies. In Indonesia, on the other hand, LG executive branches are nominated locally: the Regional Secretary is nominated by the (elected) Regional Head (at provincial, regency or city levels) and appointed by the President, whilst the Regional Secretariat is appointed by the Regional head with approval from the DPRD (or Regional Council). The Indonesian model, although it clearly runs risks of \u201cpolitical\u201d appointments, does allow for a much greater degree of control over executives by locally elected representatives. The issue of LG council control over staffing is often a thorny one \u2013 and, in many countries, mirrors many of the tensions inherent in systems where central government appoints local executives. Three basic options exist for LG staffing arrangements: \u2022 separate, meaning that each LG body appoints and controls its own staff. This is, in theory, the case for a large proportion of civil servants in Indonesia since reforms in 2000 and onwards \u2013 in the period immediately after January 2001, it is estimated that some 2.3 million Indonesian civil servants were", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5909ac9e-0c39-49e5-ba4d-32047bd5c25c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5909ac9e-0c39-49e5-ba4d-32047bd5c25c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9039e09e23017026421ba964735a5333007e5418fece740549d35d0e0bdb0455"}, "3": {"node_id": "772bcbcc-d4cb-4ecc-be18-266283556c05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a23fee4bb4ee2b76225d2e36a0f548fc93b696b37f239dc75bc571c64ccf9fbe"}}, "hash": "4c1f7c332366cd832231386b025ff64c09474f30be95d8ffcb608b455e586815", "text": "administratively transferred to the regions. In practice, given the recentness of reforms, regional authority over civil service management remains somewhat blurred. \u2022 unified, in the sense that the senior management posts are filled from a central cadre of service for local authorities. This has historically been the case in Nepal, where VDC and DDC secretaries are appointed by the Ministry of Local Development, working alongside more junior, locally recruited and locally paid Village/District employees. In addition, line agency staff in Nepal continue to be largely accountable to their parent ministries, rather than to local bodies. This is also the case in India. \u2022 integrated, meaning that the staff of central and LG agencies form a common cadre, and are exchanged freely between levels of government and localities according to central posting policies. This would appear to be the case in Bangladesh, where virtually all service delivery staff at local levels are directly employed by central government ministries. 52 How far local councils are effectively the employers of locally posted staff is an important determinant of their ability to shape service delivery \u2013 and thus of their ability to translate popular representation into accountable LG. (2) Supervision of councils Whilst local councils enjoy varying degrees of autonomy, they are generally subject to some kind of upward accountability \u2013 to higher tier councils/LGs or to central government. In some LG traditions, notably the francophone one in Africa, this control can be fairly proximate, as well as being ex-ante. The degree to which LG councils are subject to supervision is important in two fundamental respects. Firstly, too much external control or supervision effectively disenfranchises locally elected bodies, turning their \u201crepresentative\u201d role into one that can be denuded of accountability \u2013 simply because they have little authority to make binding decisions. Secondly, too little external control/supervision means that locally elected bodies are not held upwardly accountable for a range of public sector responsibilities (such as service delivery standards or the management of financial resources transferred from central or upper tier LGs. Finding the right balance is challenging. In the case of Asia, the situation varies from country to country. In Vietnam, where the \u201cRussian Doll\u201d fabric of LG means that lower tiers are generally subordinate to substantial ex-ante and ex-post controls by upper tiers, supervision over lower levels is very much the norm. The decisions and actions of Commune People\u2019s Councils and Committees are thus closely supervised by District People\u2019s Councils/Committees, whilst the latter are \u2013 in turn \u2013 very much beholden to the authority of Provincial People\u2019s Councils/Committees. In Indonesia, by contrast, regional governments \u2013 by law \u2013 enjoy considerable autonomy from upper tiers; indeed, elected regency and city authorities have argued that they are in no way subject to the authority of provincial authorities. However, they (as well as the provinces) are subject to national supervision, in two ways: \u2022 \u201crepressive\u201d supervision, which amounts to supervision over regional regulations and decrees, promulgated by DPRDs. This is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). MoHA has the responsibility to review regional regulations and declare void those that are contrary to \u201cpublic interest, higher regulations, and/or other regulations\u201d. The Minister of Home Affairs has formed several teams to review regional regulations: different review teams for financial regulations and organizational regulations, and for the election of heads of region. The national government review teams have, to date, found numerous irregularities in those regulations examined \u2013 generally concerned with regional finances or organization. As a result, the Government has refused to confirm the election of several heads of region, or postponed confirmation, and has issued many written requests to the regions to amend regulations on taxation, charges, and organizational structure to comply with national legislation. \u2022 \u201cfunctional\u201d supervision: according to Government Regulation 20/2001, functional supervision is carried out by line ministries and by BPKP (the Financial Comptroller). However, detailed regulation of functional supervision awaits the development of minimum service standards (MSS) for each of the eleven obligatory service sectors that are managed by regional governments. In theory, the national Government is responsible for preparing guidelines for the standards, provincial governments set the actual standards to be applied in each locality, and the national Government then supervises the district governments\u2019 performance. 53 6.

(1) Building on traditional structures Many LG systems in South and South East Asia have been built quite explicitly on the basis of traditional governance structures, usually at their lowest levels. In the Philippines, for example, the smallest unit of LG is the Barangay, which has its origins in the pre-colonial era \u2013 the term actually traces its origins to \u201cbalangay\u201d, a type of Malay boat used by sea-faring settlers. The Barangay, then, refers to a historical community, to which local citizens are attached and with which they identify. The legitimacy of the Barangay as a traditional community structure thus serves to complement the more \u201cmodern\u201d legitimacy of electoral representation. In Timor-Leste, it seems clear that any LG system will be based on the foundation provided by the Sucos. The Suco, a traditional community, is the only institution that has remained more or less intact during the history of the territory. The Suco and its legitimacy provide an opportunity for a base unit of local governance and representation that reflects local identity. The Suco constitutes the only level of \u201cLocal Power\u201d as provided for in the constitution. Recent laws have clearly signalled a \u201cmodernisation\u201d of the Suco, through the holding of direct elections for the position of Suco Chief and for the members of the Suco Council, as well as through legal provisions ensuring that women, the youth and the elders are represented. However, the Suco remains a recognisably traditional structure, upon which have been grafted more modern democratic principles. Building on traditional structures, then, can provide the basis for units of local representation with which citizens readily identify themselves. This implies that modern LG systems are not based on entirely imagined political communities. (2) Returning to traditional structures Indonesia provides one interesting, if unique, example of re-constructing a system of LG that is based on traditional structures, of bringing \u201cmodern\u201d administrative units into line with more \u201ctraditional\u201d ones, and thus perhaps contributing to a more legitimate basis (in the eyes of local citizens) for representation. In the province of West Sumatra the process of decentralisation has been particularly dynamic and idiosyncratic. Along with the general decentralisation of central political authority and economic resources to the regencies, a fundamental restructuring of local village government has been initiated. The policy of regional autonomy has been taken up \"to return to the nagari\". Nagari is the name of the traditional, pre-colonial political units of Minangkabau political organisation. Despite all changes and transformations during the colonial period and since Independence, the nagari and nagari government have remained firmly associated with Minangkabau political identity. This changed rather dramatically, when the Law on Local Government of 1979 introduced the uniform model 54 of the desa as the lowest level of LG. The former nagari were split into several desa, administered by desa-heads embedded in the strictly hierarchical administrative system. When decentralisation became a major issue in Indonesia under the \"orde reformasi\", this was taken up in West Sumatra to abolish the desa system and \u201cgo back to the nagari\u201d. Draft legislation has been prepared to re-establish the nagari as the lowest level of LG, with nagari councils made up of desa representatives as well as representatives of traditional Minangkabau institutions (the elders of matrilineages, clerics, and the like). (3) Co-habitation, Co-option or Competition? In many countries, both developed and developing, traditional governance institutions manage to co-exist alongside their more \u201cmodern\u201d counterparts. At the national level, the remaining monarchies in Europe are good examples of this. At the local level, some of the most poignant examples of co-habitation between traditional and modern systems of governance are to be found in sub-Saharan Africa. There, traditional chiefs (and sometimes monarchs) retain considerable powers over, for example, customary land tenure regimes and often continue to play an important role in dispute resolution as well as in the organisation of ritual activities. For that reason, they have often needed to be brought into local governance \u2013 as the institutions that \u201crepresent\u201d important functions at the local level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16b2e15e-59f5-4d8e-877e-6c7437095665": {"__data__": {"id_": "16b2e15e-59f5-4d8e-877e-6c7437095665", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fc8284aedbf112cc2768b1879975ad59f0d8059c27f4036e18e2ef6beb9a775"}, "2": {"node_id": "05f4a18f-0293-407c-bc83-ad7c04a8dd7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e966fcaa772f458dada06926de37a8ffe1c3bc5e754a3840741275b826250350"}}, "hash": "7c3595b9d05437f2e016cbbe7ff38fa9bf164cc4f418e0b536f55bad68b2aa66", "text": "Several examples of this type of co-habitation between tradition and \u201cmodernity\u201d can be briefly cited: \u2022 in post-apartheid South Africa, customary chiefs have continued to play an important role in a variety of areas, most importantly in dispute settlement. In recognition of the importance of traditional chiefs, the Government of South Africa passed a piece of landmark legislation in 2003 \u2013 the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill (Ministry of Provincial and Local Government, Pretoria) \u2013 recognising and codifying the functions of traditional chiefs, \u201cmodernising\u201d them (women can now become chiefs), and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b47808b-0f77-46b3-8d2d-73c68e3756bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b47808b-0f77-46b3-8d2d-73c68e3756bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11a12a1a8146e6052fa1af78ece16c8733387aeebbd89c02b5504512dfbcb385"}, "3": {"node_id": "96bcf4ca-c521-4313-b338-c685a8ba2171", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9074e4ee2c862e24c9297f3c4e76a47d4cad989b825f4854eebe80ab53a544c0"}}, "hash": "354785e551a908178bb617b57d4d8b96a6481123306a168ac433ac5c8cf7589f", "text": "formally defining their relations with LGs through traditional councils which the LG must consulted on a range of issues. \u2022 during the late 1990s, as Mali undertook major decentralisation reforms, it was early on recognised that new Communes would need to take into account traditional village and \u201cfraction\u201d (nomadic) chiefs. Such chiefs not only exercised considerable political authority over their communities, but were also key players in land tenure arrangements. As a result, the Local Government Code that was eventually enacted stipulated that Commune Councils had to consult all traditional village chiefs prior to voting on development plans, annual budgets and other LG actions. \u2022 in Ghana, traditional chiefs enjoy considerable political and juridical authority and play a vital role in the management of customary land tenure arrangements. Ever since the colonial period, traditional Ghanaian chiefs have been organised into regional and national Houses of Chiefs. These institutions are necessarily consulted by Ghanaian LGs about a range of issues. In such African cases, traditional chiefs \u201crepresent\u201d custom \u2013 and custom is considered to be of importance. Hence the need for elected LGs to co-habit with them in a constructive way. 55 In the Pacific region, there is clearly a degree of co-habitation between traditional chiefs and LG systems. As in the African cases, this reflects the continued socio-political significance of traditional leadership. This co-habitation takes several forms: \u2022 in PNG, the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments makes explicit provision for customary chiefs to be represented in provincial assemblies. According to the Law (Section 10), provincial assemblies include \u201cwhere the chieftaincy system is in existence and is accepted in a province, paramount chiefs from the province not exceeding three in number or their duly appointed nominees, who shall be appointed by the Minister responsible for provincial government and local-level government matters on the recommendation of the Provincial Executive Council\u201d. Chiefly representatives in PNG\u2019s provincial assemblies enjoy full voting rights. \u2022 in Fiji, customary institutions continue to play a significant role in local administration. Outside of the municipal system of government, most rural areas are administered through a combination of \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d arrangements. Rotuma Island, which enjoys a special constitutional status in Fiji, is administered by its own council, made up of 14 voting members \u2013 seven of whom are the traditional chiefs of the island\u2019s seven districts, chosen according to customary principles. For South and South East Asia, there are fewer cases of this kind of officially and legally sanctioned co-habitation between traditional authorities and modern LGs. There are, however, a few examples (although they are not necessarily \u201clocal\u201d): \u2022 in Bhutan, of the 150 members of the National Assembly (Tshogdu), 10 are representatives of the monastic body, nominated by the Central Monastic Body in Thimphu and the 8 district monastic bodies. This representation of the Buddhist clergy reflects the importance of religion in Bhutan. \u2022 in Malaysia, 9 of the 13 constituent states of the federation, are headed by hereditary monarchs or sultans \u2013 one of whom, on a rotating five-year basis acts as Head of the Federation. Although these are clearly constitutional monarchies, they do demonstrate how the traditional and \u201cmodern\u201d can co-habit. Customary Panchayats (CPs) continue to thrive in many parts of rural India. CPs have a number of important local functions, inter alia: \u2022 CPs are expected to maintain law and order in the villages and to act as custodians of \u2018traditional\u2019 norms and rules defining the social order. \u2022 the most important function of CPs is arbitrating disputes in the village. \u2022 in addition, CPs also act as support structures in specific situations. \u2022 CPs play a significant role in informal resource mobilization, which may be utilized for village development activities. CPs are village-based, male-dominated, and are usually led by the leaders of the different castes that make up the village. The CP is an extension of caste, albeit one of the more inclusive forms. 56 CPs are not recognized in any legislation on LG and are thus entirely informal \u2013 despite their obvious importance in local governance. Moreover, recent research in Karnataka9 indicates that CPs exert a powerful influence over Gram Panchayats, formal LG institutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96bcf4ca-c521-4313-b338-c685a8ba2171": {"__data__": {"id_": "96bcf4ca-c521-4313-b338-c685a8ba2171", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11a12a1a8146e6052fa1af78ece16c8733387aeebbd89c02b5504512dfbcb385"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b47808b-0f77-46b3-8d2d-73c68e3756bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "354785e551a908178bb617b57d4d8b96a6481123306a168ac433ac5c8cf7589f"}}, "hash": "9074e4ee2c862e24c9297f3c4e76a47d4cad989b825f4854eebe80ab53a544c0", "text": "This influence manifests itself in a number of ways: \u2022 deciding the choice of candidates: CPs decide on who should contest elections or influence the type of members that are represented in the Gram Panchayat. \u2022 unanimous elections: At times CPs may exercise influence to the extent of ensuring that the candidates of their choice are elected unopposed, in other words cause \u2018unanimous\u2019 elections. \u2022 overlap of leadership: Often CP leaders and/or members themselves", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3562a554-7d95-48e2-a3d0-162deea0a170": {"__data__": {"id_": "3562a554-7d95-48e2-a3d0-162deea0a170", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92faf551f557907a541f908178bcd3e1fa59ea085e242f990ef273535431246f"}, "3": {"node_id": "f993b186-b355-4305-b9b5-b8de4b6e12f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df6e2b2afb3632826b00b776c168d512c40e510f6689d2f1d9c3139227ed5d9c"}}, "hash": "f4abcf5fe2ba71b7fe750db7196f8a562a738c3ec6eeb2b6324beedc5fb39ebf", "text": "contest GP elections.

In such circumstance, \u201crepresentation\u201d must be qualified given that CPs play such a big role in determining who are to be the representatives. 6.2. Evolutions In many new or emerging countries, particularly those that have experienced serious conflict (e.g. Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Afghanistan), LG and local elections may well be low on the list of national political priorities. But if and when those countries do begin to establish locally-elected councils and LG systems, can we see any pattern to that process? How far do newly implanted systems of local electoral representation build on tradition, if at all? (1) Top or bottom? In Cambodia and Timor-Leste, elected representation has begun at the lowest level in the LG system \u2013 communes in Cambodia (in 2002) and Sucos in Timor-Leste (ongoing). In both cases, there are plans to gradually establish higher level LG bodies \u2013 although Cambodia is probably further ahead than Timor-Leste in this respect. In Timor-Leste\u2019s case, as has been seen (above), it seems clear that the process will be anchored in the Sucos, as traditional institutions \u2013 but themselves \u201cmodernised\u201d through the introduction of competitive elections for Suco chiefs and Council members. In the case of Cambodia, on the other hand, it would seem that the Communes have been created ex- nihilo, although it may well be that they do have antecedents in colonial administrative constructs. In Afghanistan, however, there would be appear to be a preference for beginning with the establishment of elected councils in the 32 provinces (at the apex of the LG hierarchy), and then perhaps move on to district level elections. By all accounts, village councils as envisaged in the Constitution appear to have been \u201cforgotten\u201d in Afghanistan. 9 see \u201cInterfaces in Local Governance - A Study in Karnataka\u201d, Kripa AnanthPur, May 2004, Working Paper No. 187 Madras Institute of Development Studies, Chennai 57 (2) Big bangs or incremental reforms? Two of the countries covered by this paper \u2013 Indonesia and Pakistan \u2013 have recently undertaken major overhauls of their LG systems. In both cases, the reforms have included major changes to electoral processes and representational arrangements, as well as a significant devolution of powers and responsibilities to LGs (especially in the case of Indonesia). These have been bold reforms \u2013 but it is still too early to know how far their \u201crepresentational\u201d ambitions have succeeded. Other countries, notably Bangladesh, appear to have taken a much more incremental approach to reforms. The lowest tier, the Union Parishad, is still the only level at which elected bodies operate \u2013 although it is conceivable, depending on political considerations, that the system will \u201cgrow\u201d upwards to encompass Upazilas. Nepal has actually taken significant steps backwards as a result of military conflict and political crisis: in 2002, elected local bodies were dissolved and have yet to be replaced through elections. 58 7. CONCLUSIONS AND NEXT STEPS This Background Paper makes no pretence at being exhaustive. In addition, and given the rapidly evolving nature of arrangements for electoral representation at the local level in the Asia-Pacific region, it is inevitable that the paper includes inaccuracies. Further practitioner input and dialogue will help to improve the paper and our understanding of representational issues at the local level. That said, it can only be hoped that this paper does provide practitioners in the local governance field with food for thought by: \u2022 bringing into the foreground (in section 2) some of the basic electoral principles that underlie the diversity of electoral systems and how they may affect representational outcomes.

A great deal about local representational systems in the Asia-Pacific region remains undocumented, uncharted and not very well understood. In particular, a number of issues require more empirical research and an improved conceptual understanding, inter alia: \u2022 the concrete outcomes of different electoral systems, in terms of who gets elected and how, how different systems are subject to manipulation, how they affect the machinery of day-to-day LG, and so on; \u2022 the ways in which political parties interface with local electoral systems, and what the representational outcomes of that encounter are; 59 \u2022 the options that are available in the context of different electoral and representational systems for implementing measures that genuinely result in the weak being able to wield power that is proportionate to their numbers. Perhaps most importantly here is to find ways of \u201cmainstreaming\u201d affirmative action such that it becomes less contentious; \u2022 the wider bottlenecks and constraints that limit the extent to which local representation translates into local actions of benefit to voters; \u2022 the ways in which the legitimacy conferred by local custom and tradition can be harnessed to improve and strengthen local representational arrangements without diluting fundamental democratic principles and rights. A more complete knowledge and better analysis of such issues will help improve our understanding of the \u201cplumbing\u201d electoral and representational arrangements \u2013 and would help us become better \u201cplumbers\u201d. However, and perhaps more importantly, much more work needs to be done to understand how electoral and representational arrangements at the local level pan out in terms of livelihood outcomes \u2013 what comes out of the plumbing system. Here, future work and thinking could focus on a number of issues: \u2022 the kinds of representational systems that enable the poor and other politically weak groups to translate their local political power into appropriate policies and services; \u2022 the limits to local electoral representation as a way of tackling important, poverty- related and social inclusion issues and the other changes that need to be made in order for this to happen; \u2022 the circumstances under which genuinely representative LGs are able to deliver pro- poor services. 60 8. ELECTORAL REPRESENTATION IN DECENTRALISED GOVERNANCE IN ASIA-PACIFIC REGION: COUNTRY CASE STUDIES This section of the background paper summarises the information available on local electoral processes in a range of South West and South East Asian and Pacific region countries. 8.1. South and West Asia 8.1.1. Afghanistan Currently there is no fully-fledged system of LG in Afghanistan. However, the 2004 Constitution does provide for the establishment of provincial, district and village councils, as well as municipal bodies, although the roles of such representative bodies would appear to be largely of a consultative \u2013 rather than deliberative \u2013 nature. The 2004 Law on Provincial Councils clearly assigns an advisory role to the Provincial Councils; as yet, no specific legislation has been enacted defining the precise roles of district and village councils. The following table provides a summary of the Afghanistan system of local representative bodies as envisaged in the Constitution.

The councillors elect a Chairman of the provincial council from among themselves. Each provincial council elects one of its members to become a member of the Afghani Senate (Meshrano Jirga, or House of Elders) for a period of four years. 61 District Councils District councils are also composed entirely of directly elected members, elected in proportion to the population through free, direct, secret ballot, and general elections by the residents of the district for a period of three years in accordance with the law. The district councils in each province elect one of their members to sit in the Afghani Senate (Meshrano Jirga, or House of Elders) for a period of three years. Village Councils Village councils are also composed entirely of directly elected members, elected in proportion to the population through free, direct, secret ballot, and general elections by the residents of the village for a period of three years in accordance with the law. Municipal Councils The mayor and members of the municipal councils are elected by free, general, secret, and direct elections. It is worth noting here that mayors are the only local council leaders in Afghanistan who are to be directly elected. The draft law on municipal elections provides for municipal councils made up of at least 9 members: \u2022 at least 7 of whom are representatives of nahias (wards), where nahias are officially recognised, with nahia representatives to be elected on the basis of FPTP. In municipalities with less than 7 or no officially recognised nahias, non-nahia councillors are to be elected from a single municipal constituency (which will not include any nahias), with the candidates receiving the most votes being elected to the municipal council; \u2022 2 reserved seats for women councillors, to be elected by a municipal constitutency, with the candidates receiving the most votes being selected. According to the same draft law, mayors are to be directly elected by municipal constituencies on the basis of receiving either more than half the votes in the first electoral round, or the majority of votes in a runoff between the two candidates having obtained the most votes in the first round. As stated above, these provisions are at their draft stage at the time of writing (early 2006). Electoral issues The Electoral Law (2004) sets out a Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV) system for elections of all local councils in Afghanistan. No ward system is foreseen (or needed) and elections are direct. The Electoral Law includes a provision for the allocation of seats to the two most voted women candidates in the district and provincial councils (articles 31 and 36). However, the law is not very specific with respect to the procedures/requirements for nominating women, and does not contain any additional elements aimed at ensuring gender balance in the councils. 62 The existing Electoral Law includes a minimum age for candidates for the Wolesi Jirga (House of Representatives) and for the candidates to be appointed for the Meshrano Jirga (25 and 35 years, respectively). The electoral system for the national level is classified by IDEA International as being SNTV (Single Non-Transferable Voting). Political parties are allowed to contest local elections, although the SNTV electoral system \u2013 as compared to PR-List \u2013 would appear to dilute their importance and influence. 8.1.2.

Theoretically, no political party can nominate any candidate for local level elections, but in practice all candidates \u2013 commissioner/mayor/chairman \u2013 are individually supported by political parties. 63 CHAPTER III, Article 59 (1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh states that LG in every administrative unit of the Republic shall be entrusted to local bodies, composed of persons elected in accordance with the law. A variety of local bodies are provided for by law: \u2022 The Union Parishads (Union Councils); \u2022 The Upazila Parishads; \u2022 The City Corporations; \u2022 The Pourashavas (Municipal Committees); and \u2022 The Hill District Councils. In reality, there is considerable deviation from statutory provisions in terms of elected local bodies at different levels. Village level There is no directly elected representative body at the village/ward level in rural areas. The current Government, however, enacted legislation in July 2003 for the establishment of Gram Sarkar to be constituted at Ward level. These bodies will comprise a 15 member council, chaired by the elected UP member, with the Women\u2019s UP member serving as adviser to each of the three wards representing their constituency. The membership of the Gram Sarkar will comprise a range of \u201cselected\u201d leaders and community representatives. The guidelines for the selection of Gram Sarkar suggest the following composition: three women representatives including a trained Ansar/VDP member; one farmer; two landless farmers; one male Ansar/VDP member; one teacher; one physician or professional; one businessman; one member of cooperatives; one ex-freedom fighter; and one distinguished individual. Selection of the membership is the responsibility of the UNO and ideally should be based on the consensus of at least ten per cent of the population of the ward. It should be noted that the establishment of these bodies has been very controversial, with some seeing it as undermining the Union Parishads themselves. Union Parishad level Since the passage of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Ordinance in 1983 and subsequent changes (the most recent being 1997 Act Number 20) each Union Parishad (UP) is now composed of 13 elected representatives including a chair, nine members (one from each ward) and three women elected to reserved seats based on one female representative for every three wards. Standing committees undertake and execute the various functions of each Union Parishad. There are 13 committees in all. Women are to head one third of them and are further mandated to head the committee on women\u2019s and children\u2019s welfare, culture, and sports. Upazila (sub-district) Parishad level Since 1991, after the short-lived experiment pioneered by General Ershad in the 1980s, there has been no directly elected representation at the Upazila level, despite pledges by both parties to reinstate these councils in their election manifestos, and despite widespread calls by civil society for elected councils to hold the very substantial Upazila administrations to better account. The representation of government departments and agencies at this level continues, but their officers remain under the full authority of central government and operate with upward accountability. There is a recognition that planning and co-ordination of development activity is required at the Upazila level, and this is provided by both the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), the central government appointed 64 officer with responsibilities for administrative co-ordination, and by the Upazila Development Coordination Committee (UDCC). The UDCC comprises the chairmen of the respective UPs within the Upazila and is chaired on a rotating basis by a Union Chairman. The Members of Parliament act as Special Advisers to the UDCCs and the UNOs serve as Member Secretaries. Upazila level officers of government line agencies are non-voting members. The UDCC is not a corporate body but is rather an administrative body that aims to coordinate, monitor, and contribute to the planning of development activities in the Upazila. Zila (district) Parishad level According to existing constitutional provisions there should be a council for each Zila (district). A Zila Parishad should consist of a chairman, 15 members and five members of reserved seats for women. The chairman and the members are supposed to be elected by an electoral college. However, elections to this level have never been held, due both to legal complications and to the fact that many in Bangladesh feel that this is not an appropriate level for such bodies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69c0dc8b-9ea4-4515-b5aa-19d2f9d1f0df": {"__data__": {"id_": "69c0dc8b-9ea4-4515-b5aa-19d2f9d1f0df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1fc1b73cf4d629564a19fb4c7098bf5aa90ebcd606f8974fb3eeb6d92eab97a"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb1ee30d-e9e0-4f19-a373-8c8ffe04d68c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7c53cdff836405d1666f0955c766479fff65b1974083b21fe889db07ae0e983"}}, "hash": "2a8a99d09deecec411e25a95c6808a622e05f76038cc0721a3168d161629cacc", "text": "Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) district parishads In addition to the LG levels mentioned above there are also the three CHT District Parishads provided for under separate acts for each Hill District.

The Hill District Parishads have been established to give representation to the tribes living in the Hill District Areas. Each Parishad has a designated number of tribal members as well as a Chairperson and non-tribal members. The tribal seats are further divided according to the number and proportion of tribes in the Hill District. The members are elected by the population of the Hill Districts. The Chairperson is elected from amongst the tribal members. The electoral procedures for the Hill District Parishads are determined by the government. Urban local government This consists of Pourashavas for smaller municipalities and City Corporations for the 6 largest cities. The heads of city corporations are called mayors and for pourashavas they are called chairmen. Members are called commissioners. Mayors and chairmen are directly elected every five years; and all commissioners (representing their respective urban wards) are directly elected every five years. There are particular numbers of reserved seats for women who are elected directly. Organisation of elections Existing laws and rules governing the conduct of elections to different local bodies empower the Bangladesh Election Commission, established under Chapter VII, Article 118 of the Constitution to conduct local level elections. The electoral system at the national level in Bangladesh is classified by International IDEA as FPTP. 8.1.3. Bhutan The highest level of LG in Bhutan is the Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu (DYT) (District Development Committee), which is regulated by the Dzongkhag Yargay Tshogdu Chatrim, 2002. Under the Dzongkhag level is the Geog Yargay Tshogchhung (GYT) (Block 65 Development Committee), which is regulated by the Geog Yargay Tshogchhung Chatrim, 2002.

Whether or not the committee members are to be elected or appointed is to be decided in the corporation charter. A municipality may be divided into several geographical areas depending on its size and when members are appointed through elections, the elections are held for each geographical area. Elections are to be by consensus. If, however, no consensus can be reached a secret ballot is to be held with the candidate with the largest number of votes being the first committee member elected, the candidate with the second highest number of votes elected as the second committee member, and so on, until the required number of committee members are elected. The Thompen is responsible for conducting the elections to the Municipal Committee (Subpart 3).

It is the responsibility of the Legislature of a State, and not the federal government, to make legal provisions with respect to the 67 composition of Panchayats provided that the ratio between the population of the territorial area of a Panchayat at any level and the number of seats in such Panchayat to be filled by election shall, so far as practicable, be the same throughout the State. Each of India\u2019s 28 states thus has its own LG legislation, although laws are very similar in each state. Amendments are infrequent and currently the legislative environment is stable. In principle and practice, the involvement of political parties in LG elections varies from state to state. Panchayats The Panchayats are situated in the rural areas of India. In 22 states there are three tiers in the Panchayati system, in one (Goa) there are two tiers, and in five (Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland) there is one. States with populations of less than two million are not required to adopt the three-tiered system. They are not strictly hierarchically organised, rather there is a division of duties between them. There is a limited coordination role for higher levels of the Panchayati authorities. Rural councillors are elected for five-year terms. The elections for council leader can be direct or indirect, depending on state law. All councillors are directly elected by a FPTP system. All the seats in a Panchayat are to be filled by persons chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the Panchayat area. For this purpose, each Panchayat area is divided into territorial constituencies in such a manner that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it shall, to the extent possible, be the same throughout the Panchayat area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38acd705-7f9e-402c-b0a1-38244e9b0904": {"__data__": {"id_": "38acd705-7f9e-402c-b0a1-38244e9b0904", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fc6ab07b52c3b65101d1a78a2dd0127f312c19bac7a1fe23656f0d6a7fb93f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "63543609-e82d-4630-b5df-a8c31608d432", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34112eb4ccc32d02ee247ea35ddbb843d893f4ef9cf30a4641491c7659b284dd"}}, "hash": "7ee0c48b823d65ec3be7ba7e1892b71956b0d81b4d068c8f0a48665758544bac", "text": "The Legislature of a State may, by law, provide for the representation of certain individuals to the different levels of the Panchayats.

There are also reserved places for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, determined by their proportion of the local population. One third of the places reserved for scheduled castes and tribes must be allocated to women. Provisions are also made for the offices of the Chairperson to be reserved for these groups (Article 243D). In both rural and urban areas, the women members elected under the reserved places represent a ward like any other member. Six months prior to local elections, one-third of the wards are earmarked for women representatives. At the following election these wards lose their women-only status, and a further third of the municipality's or panchayat's wards are designated for women candidates only. The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of all elections to the Panchayats are the responsibility of the State Election Commissions. Subject to the provisions of the Federal Constitution, the Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the Panchayats (Article 243K). Municipalities Article 243Q of the Constitution provides for the establishment of Municipalities in every State. The various types of municipality are: (i) a Nagar Panchayat (by whatever name it is called locally) for a transitional area, that is to say, an area in transition from a rural area to an urban area; (ii) a Municipal Council for a smaller urban area; and (iii) a Municipal Corporation for a larger urban area. 68 All seats in a Municipality are filled by persons directly elected from territorial constituencies, with the exception of such members as the Legislature of State may provide for representation by law, such as persons having special knowledge or experience of Municipal administration. It is the Legislature of the State that decides how the Chairperson of the Municipality is to be elected (Article 243R). Within the territorial area of a Municipality which has a population of 300,000 or more, Ward Committees, consisting of one or more wards, are constituted. It is the Legislature of a State that by law makes provisions for the composition and the territorial area of a Ward Committee and the manner in which the seats in a Ward Committee shall be filled. It is the person who represents the Ward in the Municipality who shall act as its Chairperson (Article 243S). Article 243T lays down the same principle for the reservation of seats in the Municipalities as in the Panchayats. In two states, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, a mayor-in-council system has been introduced in urban areas. These mayors are directly elected for five years with executive powers. In other municipal bodies mayors are elected for one year at a time. In some they are elected for two years \u2013 half the full term of the council. Where there is a mayor-in- council system, a cabinet-style executive committee is appointed by the mayor. As in the case of the Panchayats, the responsibility for municipal elections rests with the State Election Commission and (subject to the provisions of the Federal Constitution) the Legislature of a State, by law, makes provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the Municipalities (Article 243ZA). The electoral system at the national level in India is classified by International IDEA as FPTP. 8.1.5. Nepal At the local level, both independent candidates and political parties can contest elections. Villages Section 4 of the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA), 2055 (1999) provides that the national territory shall be divided into Village Development Areas, each of which is further divided into nine Wards (Section 5). Each Ward Committee is to consist of one Ward Chairperson, one Women Ward Member and three Ward Members elected by the eligible voters within each ward (Section 7). The Village Council which is constituted in each Village Development Area consists of the Village Development Committee Chairperson and Vice- chairperson, the members of the Ward Committees within the Village Development Area and six persons, including one woman, nominated by the Village Council from amongst the poor and tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous peoples (Section 8).10 There is also to be a Village Development Committee, which acts as an executive of the Village Council. The Committee is headed by a Chairperson and Vice-chairperson directly elected by eligible voters within the village development area, the Chairpersons of the Ward Committees, and two members, including one woman nominated by the Village Development Committee, on the same principles as in the case of the Village Council (Section 12).

Pakistan The LG of Pakistan is divided into several levels with District/City District as the highest level together with Tehsil and Town Administration. Below this level come the Unions. There are also Village and Neighbourhood Councils. LG elections are held on a non-party basis. The electorate for the union councils is made up of all registered voters who are Pakistan citizens and who are over the age of 18. For the 2001 local elections, the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18. Union Councils The foundation of the electoral structure for the three tiers of LG is the Union Council. The Union is a multi-member ward for the election of members of the union council (i.e. each constituency is on average 25,000, which is large), and each Union Council is composed of 13 directly elected members11 - prior to the 2005 amendment of the Local Government Ordinance (LGO), there were 21 directly elected members in each Union Council.

In addition, 5% of District and Tehsil seats have been reserved for peasants (in rural constituencies) or workers (in urban areas), and 5% for minorities. Thus, overall, District Councils and Tehsil Councils are made up of about two thirds directly elected members and one third indirectly elected, including the nazim and naib nazim. 12 Where the population of minorities exceeds 10% of the Union\u2019s population, there is provision for the number of minority community seats to be increased by reallocating Muslim general or peasant/worker seats. 13 The term of office was changed from three years through an amendment in 2002. 72 Box 1 illustrates how the electoral system operates. Box 1: The arithmetic of Local Government Elections Assume a District with 60 Union Councils (UCs), grouped in three Tehsils of the same size (20 UCs per tehsil) Direct elections: Union Councils \u2022 There are direct elections for all 13 UC councillors. 11 are elected individually, but the UC nazim and naib nazim are elected on a joint ticket. In this example, there are therefore 780 UC councillors overall. Indirect elections: Tehsil Councils \u2022 Each UC naib nazim is automatically a member of the Tehsil Council; \u2022 In addition to the 20 UC naib nazim, each of the three Tehsil Councils has a tehsil nazim and naib nazim, plus 9 additional members: 7 women councillors, 1 peasant/worker councillor and 1 minority councillor; \u2022 The Tehsil nazim and the additional 9 councillors are elected by the 260 UC councillors (20 UCs in the Tehsil x 13 UC councillors per UC); \u2022 The Tehsil naib nazim is elected from amongst themselves by Tehsil council members at their first meeting. District Councils \u2022 Each UC nazim is automatically a member of the District Council; \u2022 In addition to the 60 UC nazim, the District Council has a District nazim and naib nazim, and 26 additional members: 20 women councillors, 3 peasant/workers and 3 minority councillors; \u2022 The District nazim, the District and the additional 26 councillors are elected by the 780 UC councillors; \u2022 The District naib nazim is elected from amongst themselves by District council members at their first meeting. Municipal arrangements As provided by Section 93 the Tehsil Municipal Administration or Town Municipal Administration respectively may provide for the creation of a Neighbourhood or Village Council consisting of five to eleven members each provided that for each Council one seat is reserved for women and one seat for peasants and workers. A Council is headed by a Chairperson who shall be the person securing the highest number of votes in the election of the Council. Section 9 provides that the Tehsil Municipal Administration and Town Municipal Administration shall conduct the elections of Councils. Organisation of elections In accordance with the Local Government Elections Order (2000) LG elections held under the Local Government Ordinance are conducted by the Chief Election Commissioner (Section 150). It is also the Chief Election Commissioner who prepares the electoral rolls for 73 local elections (Subsection 157[2]). As prescribed by Section 153 LG elections are to be held on non-party basis. The electoral system at the national level in Pakistan is classified by International IDEA as FPTP. 8.1.7. Sri Lanka Section 226 of the Sri Lankan Constitution provides that there is to be a system of LG consisting of regularly elected local authorities. The political subdivisions below the central government are provincial councils, municipal councils, urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas (division/rural councils). The provincial councils act to supervise the local councils. Subsection 226 (4) of the Constitution provides that every Statute enacted by a Regional Council of a Region relating to elections to local authorities in that Region, should as far as practicable, provide for the adequate representation of women, persons under thirty five years of age and the major communities ordinarily resident in the local authority area for which a local authority is established. The present electoral system is regulated by the Local Authorities Election Act of 1989 and successive amendments. The Act changed dramatically the pre-existing arrangements by abolishing the ward system and establishing the Local Authority area as a single electorate, so that each elected councillor represents the entire population of the Local Authority, not that of a specific ward.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2694fb0-389c-4d48-9544-89025bc2d2b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2694fb0-389c-4d48-9544-89025bc2d2b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aecc28f038feae91acbd8733b5d6d2549cc71cf1ac9a5133ca6cb1804627107a"}, "2": {"node_id": "958b0b18-6be8-47b7-8ae7-5108f48957dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "818ee03a347ddbcfcd9abffb9f8385576a407768ebf42db262d61fa31e711225"}}, "hash": "343073dacdd2f66fb8a62c1e47e4035857840b5df88d0de3a0579d00e99d4442", "text": "74 Table 15: summary structure and features of LG system in Sri Lanka Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 9 Provinces (only 7 are functional as LGs) Avge population = 2,000,000 Provincial councils: number of members determined by the President of the Republic.

Such lists must include 40% of candidates below 35 years of age in compliance with the constitutional mandate to promote the youth. Since the local elections of 1997 each voter has been able to give all three preference votes to the same candidate under the provisions of the Local Authorities (Amendment) Act 1990. The number of councillors elected from each Party or IC Group is determined by the proportion of votes received by that Party or Group. The Party or IC Group that gets the highest share of votes also gets a \u201cbonus\u201d of two additional seats. Any Party or IC Group that gets less than one eighth (12.5%) of the total number of votes, will not be represented in the Council. 75 The Parties and IC Groups which receive the highest number of votes nominate council members elected in their lists for the positions of Mayor/Deputy Mayor or Chairman/Vice- Chairman. These are then appointed by the National Commissioner of Elections, who also ratifies the elections\u2019 results and the number of seats accruing to each political party or IC Group. The term of office of the Councils is of 4 years. The Minister in charge has the power to extend this term for an additional year. Municipalities As provided for by Part I of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, areas may be declared as Municipalities by the Minister. For each Municipality a Municipal Council is constituted consisting of a Mayor and Deputy Mayor and such number of Councillors as prescribed by Order of the Minister. As provided for by Sections 8 and 14, Councillors and the Mayor and Deputy Mayor, who are also Councillors, are to be elected in general elections in accordance with the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. As provided for by Part I of the Urban Councils Ordinance in areas of an urban character, the Minister may define the jurisdiction for which an Urban Council is constituted consisting of a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson and such other number of members as prescribed by Order of the Minister. All members of the Urban Councils are to be elected by general election (Section 7). Pradeshiya Sabhas Part I of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, No. 15 of 1987 provides that the Minister may provide for the delimitation and establishment of a Pradeshiya Sabha consisting of a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson and such number of members as prescribed by Order of the Minister, to be elected by general election.

Sangkhat chief is the top candidate of winning party; 1st and 2nd deputy chiefs are leaders of second and third parties According to the Constitution of 1993, Cambodia is a unitary state administratively divided in Provinces and Municipalities, Districts and khans, and Communes and Sangkhats. Currently, therefore, the sub-national governance system of Cambodia is organized at three levels. At the level of Commune/Sangkhats, democratically elected Local Authorities have been established. At the Srok/Khan and Provinces/Municipalities levels, de- concentrated units of the central administration, coordinated by the representative of the RGC in the territory (Provincial and District Governors) are operating. Chapter XIII, Article 146, of the Constitution stipulates that\u201dProvinces, municipalities, districts, khan, khum and sangkhat shall be governed in accordance with an Organic Law\u201d. An Organic Law, that should reflect a recently unveiled national strategy for decentralisation and de-concentration, is currently under preparation. While the national strategy has not yet been officially adopted, its first draft (made public by the Royal Government in April 2005) calls for the creation of two additional levels of elected authorities at District and Provincial levels. However, direct elections would continue to apply only to the Commune/Sanghat level. Districts and Provinces would be established as second and third-tiers local authorities, with Councils indirectly elected from amongst members of lower level Councils. The composition of the District and Provincial Councils would then reproduce the overall balance of seats obtained by different parties in the Commune/Sangkhat elections in the concerned District or Province. Communes The number of members of each Commune Council is determined by Sub-decree nine months prior to the election date (Article 6, Law No. ChS/0301/04) and depends on the population of the jurisdiction. 77 The electoral system for allocating seats in the Commune Councils is the same as at the national level, i.e. List-PR. In accordance with Article 19 of Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04 only those who are registered on the list of voters for the Commune Council elections and have a voter registration card are eligible to vote. In order to register they must be Khmer nationals, be at least eighteen (18) years of age on the date of the election, and should be resident in the Commune where s/he intends to register. Those who are convicts or are \u201cinsane or under guardianship\u201d may not register as voters (Article 20, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04). Article 94 of Law No. Chs/R-Krm/0301/04 provides that in order to be eligible to stand for election a candidate must be a Khmer national by birth, able to read and write Khmer script, be a registered voter in the Commune where s/he intends to stand for election, and be at least twenty-five (25) years of age on the day of the election. Article 95 further provides that the holding of various offices or positions \u2013 such as being a member of an election commission, being a civil servant or being a monk of priest \u2013 prohibit an individual from standing for election. The holder of several of the positions listed in Article 95 may however apply for permission to stand for election and should they be successful they shall submit an application to the body concerned to take up office (Article 96).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e413dfc-34b0-4c70-9ad5-d96ca7328a49": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e413dfc-34b0-4c70-9ad5-d96ca7328a49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Democracy in Asia: Representation in Decentralized Governance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e6e79439159f5a4ab31bbd63c822d4d94cb1b60eb119b9648d2199956d726a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "f15e83fc-9449-4313-8548-1343ab6f724c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-democracy-asia-representation-decentralized-governance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "403736bd57ab5d7afbfcf8894d35ea7a38f6c53b6b983c7892b3e18341963a84"}}, "hash": "1027967a97414967ba0bc050538900caeaf53d6f72edaf550c98f8ebc7d0c105", "text": "A person who intends to stand as a candidate for election should have his/her name included in the list of candidates of a political party (Article 98, Law No. ChS/R- Krm/0301/04).

The NEC is also responsible 14 If only two parties obtain votes in a Commune, then the winning party obtains the Commune Chief and First Deputy Commune Chief positions, and the second party fills the Second Deputy Commune Chief position. 78 for establishing Provincial-Municipal Election Committees (PEC) and CECs (Article 7, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04). In accordance with Article 5 of the 2003 Law on Elections the electoral system at the national level in Cambodia is List PR which is also the classification given to it by International IDEA. 8.2.2. Indonesia Law No. 32/2004 (replacing Law No. 22/1999) provides for the system of LG in Indonesia. Article 19(2) of Law No. 32/2004 provides that it is the regional administration together with the Regional House of Representatives which are responsible for governing the regions. The LG units are provinces, which \u2013 in turn \u2013 are made up of districts (or regencies) and cities. Each of these units has a legislative body \u2013 the Regional House of Representatives (DPRD), and an executive body in the form of a regional government (Article 3[1], Law No. 32/2004). Additionally the Districts and Cities are further divided into Sub-districts, which in turn are made of Village Units (Article 120, Law No. 32/2004). All Indonesians citizens who are seventeen on the day of election or are married have the right to vote. They must, however, register to vote and must be mentally and spiritually healthy and may not have had their voting rights annulled by a court decision with permanent legal effect (Articles 68 and 69, Law No. 32/2004). 79 Table 17: summary structure and features of LG system in Indonesia Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 33 Provinces Avge population = 7,000,000 Largest = 35,000,000 Smallest = < 1,000,000 + 1 capital city district (Jakarta) DPRD (Dewan Pertimbangan Otonomi Daerah) \u2013 council of 35- 100 elected members.

For provinces, regencies and cities, there are electoral districts \u2013 usually made up of sub-districts (kecamatan) or combinations of them. The heads of the regional governments are referred to as the regional Heads. Each regional head is also supported by a deputy regional head. For the provinces these are the Governor and Deputy Governor; for the districts, the District Head (Bupati) and Deputy District Head (Wakil Bupati); and for the cities, the Mayor (Walikota) and Deputy Mayor (Wakil Walikota) (Article 24, Law No. 32/2004). Heads and Deputy Heads are elected through direct and general elections (Article 56[1], Law No. 32/2004). Previous to the enactment of Law No. 32/2004, Regional heads were appointed by the DPRD (Part Four, Law No. 22/1999). Heads and Deputy Heads are nominated and elected as a pair. They are nominated by the political parties or a coalition of political parties which have received at least 15% of the seats in the DPRD or 15% of the total number of votes cast in the election to DPRD. Each political party or coalition of parties may only nominate one pair of candidates (Article 59, Law No. 32/2004). Article 58 of Law No. 32/2004 provides for the prerequisites for standing for election as Head or Deputy Head. These include that the candidate must at least have graduated from senior high school (or equivalent); be at least thirty years of age; submit a declaration of wealth 80 and agree to make this declaration public; and believe in God. The elections of Heads and Deputy Heads are administered by the Regional General Election Commission (KPUD) (Article 57[1], Law No. 32/2004). In accordance with Article 107 of Law No. 32/2004 the pair of candidates which receive more then 50% of the votes are declared winners. However should no candidates receive more then 50%, the pair of candidates that has the most votes \u2013 if the total more then 25% of the total amount of votes cast \u2013 are declared the winners. Should no pair of candidates receive more then 25% of the votes a second round election is called with the first and second pair of candidates standing for election \u2013 the winners being the pair of candidates which receive the highest number of votes. The system used is thus a Majority Run-off Two Round System (TRS). It should however be noted that the current system for LG in Indonesia is regulated by Law No. 22/1999 which is replaced by Law No. 32/2004. The first elections for Regional Heads under the new law were to be carried out in June 2005. Those Regional Heads whose terms are to be completed in 2009 will be replaced by elections under the new law to be held in December 2008 (Chapter XV, Law No. 32/2004). In addition to the Head and Deputy Head the government structure in the regions is to consist of the Regional Secretariat \u2013 headed by the Regional Secretary (appointed and terminated by the President on the recommendation of the Governor from amongst the civil servants) (Article 122, Law No. 32/2004); the DPRD Secretariat \u2013 headed by the DPRD Secretary (appointed and terminated by the Regional Heads with the approval of the DPRD (Article 123, Law No. 32/2004); the Regional Services which are the executing agencies \u2013 each of which is headed by the Head of Services (appointed by the regional heads upon the recommendation of the Regional Secretary) (Article 124, Law No. 32/2004); and the Technical Institutions \u2013 the heads of which are appointed by the Regional Heads upon the recommendation of the Regional Secretary from amongst the civil servants (Article 125, Law No. 32/2004). Sub-districts and villages In the districts and cities it is also provided that there should be sub-districts and village units (Article 120, Law No. 32/2004). The sub-districts are led by the Sub-District Head who is appointed by the District Head or Mayor upon the recommendation of the Regional Secretary of the respective district or city. The Sub-district Head is to be appointed from amongst existing civil servants based technical knowledge of government affairs as well as meeting requirements as prescribed by law (Article 126, Law No. 32/2004).

The different provisions relating to the various LGUs are given above under each separate heading. It is the responsibility of the Commission of Elections to promulgate the rules and regulations to effectively provide for the election of the sectoral representatives. Title Five of the LGC covers appointive (both obligatory and optional) local officials common to all municipalities, cities and provinces. As is the case of the Barangay Councils there are Secretaries and Treasurers with all the higher level Councils. The Secretaries are appointed by the Chief Executive within the respective LGU, whereas the Treasurer is appointed by the Secretary of Finance. The remaining appointive local officials hold various specialized positions such as engineer or Health Officer. Most are appointed by the Chief Executive of the respective LGUs.

Candidates for the provincial, city or municipal legislatures 86 must have been a resident for at least one (1) year in the district in which s/he intends to stand for election. Varying age requirements apply for the different legislatures ranging from 18 at the Barangay level (except in the case of the Youth Council representatives, see above) and up to 23 at the provincial level (LGC, Section 39). Section 40 provides for which individuals are disqualified from standing for election.

Section 65 of the Constitution further prescribes that LG shall be chosen through election. No permanent system for administrative divisions and LG has yet been established in Timor- Leste. Pending a final decision Timor-Leste has adopted legislation \u2013 Law 2/2004 and Decree-Law 5/2004 \u2013 in order to recognise existing organisations at the Suco level and allowing for their legitimisation through the holding of local elections. Suco councils are however seen more as formalised community bodies than LGs per se, and the purpose of electing councils primarily to re-establish the legitimacy of the Suco leadership which had been eroded in many areas during the conflict and also the UNTAET period. Timor-Leste is divided into Districts, Sub-districts, Sucos (villages) and Aldeias (sub- villages/hamlets). There are no elections for the two higher levels. The National Government has appointed District Coordinators and District offices of the main Ministries, and Sub-district Coordinators at the Sub-District level which are the lowest level of government administration. 87 Sucos At the Suco level there is a Suco Council, which is composed of the Suco Chief, who is the head of the Suco Council; the Chiefs of the Aldeias which make up the Suco; 2 women; 2 young persons of each gender; and 1 village elder. A young person is an individual who is aged between seventeen 17 and thirty-five 35 and an elder is a person who over fifty 50 years of age (Article 3, Law 2/2004). In accordance with Article 2 of Law 2/2004, the Suco Chief as well as the other members of the Suco Council are to be elected by direct ballot. Timorese citizens are eligible to vote in local elections if they are aged over seventeen (17), have resided in the Suco during the previous six months and be registered in the Suco\u2019s electoral role. To be eligible to vote for the village heads a voter must also reside in the respective village (Article 7, Law 2/2004). A person is disqualified from voting if s/he is barred by an irrevocable sentence or \u201cclearly and publicly known to be insane\u201d (Article 8, Law 2/2004). All those who are eligible to vote are also eligible to stand for election provided that the candidate has resided in the Suco or village in which the candidate intends to stand for election for at least one year without interruption prior to the polling day (Article 9, Law 2/2004). Article 10 of Law 2/2004 provides for different groups which are prohibited from standing for election, including members of Parliament of Government as well as Public Servants (with the exception health workers and teachers). Candidates may submit their candidature on their own behalf or may be nominated by a political party or a coalition of political parties. Nominations are presented during a village meeting determined by STAE. Should it be deemed that too large a number of candidates has been nominated only the nominations of those candidates who obtain support from more then 10% of the voters present during the gathering will be accepted (Article 12, Law 2/2004). The Suco Chief candidate as well as the Aldeia Chief candidates who receive the highest number of votes in their respective communities are elected. Thus the system used is FPTP. For the young persons the winning candidate is the candidate who receives the highest number of votes in each gender group. (Article 25, Law 2/2004).15 Organisation of elections It is the National Electoral Commission which supervises the elections (Article 14[2], Law 2/2004). The elections are administered by the Technical Support Secretariat for Electoral Administration (STAE), within the Ministry of State Administration.

For nominated candidates comments are sought from voters\u2019 conferences in the various organisations and units on their suitability as candidates (Article 36, Order No. 22/2003/L- CTN). The exception is at the Commune level where conferences of voters are to be held. At these conferences voters shall use secret ballot or a show of hands to express their confidence in the nominated, as well as independent candidates (Article 37, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Based on the result of these consultations a third consultative conference is held with the same composition as the previous to in order select the candidates and subsequently complete the official list of candidates (Article 40, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Each list must contain at least two more candidates than the total number of deputies to be elected in the election unit (Article 41, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN).16 It should be noted that this three- stage process of consultations over the selection of candidates effectively amounts to a pre-election or selection, which precedes any direct elections. It should also be noted that, in consultation with People\u2019s Councils, the Standing Board of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the People\u2019s Committees, at all levels, when considering the proportion, composition and number of candidates, shall make recommendations in order to ensure that an appropriate number of deputies will be women and in for administrative units with many ethnic units to ensure that an appropriate number of ethnic minority people are elected as deputies (Article 14, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Deputies are elected in election units. For each election unit no more than 5 deputies may be elected (Article 10, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). In accordance with Article 7 of Decree No. 19/2004/ND-CP election units are typically the immediate lower level administrative units. At the commune level the election units are made up of villages or population groups. 16 Exceptions are made in cases of inadequacy of candidates due to force majeure reasons under the guidance of the government. 90 As provided by Article 61 of Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN those candidates who win more than half of the valid votes or win more votes than the other candidates are elected as deputies to the People\u2019s Councils. Should candidates have an equal number of votes the candidates that are older shall be elected.17 Organisation of elections The election of deputies to the People\u2019s Councils is supervised by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. The Government directs the People\u2019s Committees at all levels to perform the election work according to the provision of laws (Article 6, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). The direct responsibility for managing the election of deputies to the People\u2019s Councils rests with the Election Commissions which are to be established at all levels by the People\u2019s Committees after having consultation with numerous other bodies as outlined in Article 16 of Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN).

The Fijian Affairs Board approves the appointment of these executive heads and approves all rates and by-laws applied by the Provincial Councils. The basic unit in the system of Fijian Administration is the village (Koro) headed by a Turaga-ni-Koro elected or appointed by the villagers. Several Koros form an administrative sub-unit of a province (Tikina).

The Council consists of fourteen full members and three advisory members. Each of Rotuma's seven districts elects one representative to the Council; the traditional Chief of each district is also a Council member ex officio. The advisory members, who have speaking but not voting rights, are the District Officer, the most senior Medical Officer, and the most senior Agricultural Officer, all of whom serve ex officio. The seven chiefs are chosen according to traditional custom. The election is usually for life, although the Fijian cabinet minister responsible for Rotuma may, at his or her own discretion, dismiss a chief and order the election of a new one. The seven elected representatives are elected for three year terms by resident Rotuman Islanders aged 21 and over. Candidacy is restricted to persons who are eligible to vote. The full members of the Council elect a Chairman from among themselves. Municipalities The Local Government Act 1985 (Cap 125), which was amended in 1997, is the principal statute governing municipalities in Fiji. The Minister for Local Government in the Ministry of Local Government, Housing, Squatter Settlement and the Environment is responsible for its administration. Municipal councils are single-tier authorities in the urban areas. Councils may be designated as city or town councils. All councils have the same responsibilities. There are currently two city and ten town councils.

Unlike national elections, voting is not compulsory. Councilors serve a term of three years and are eligible for re-election. The system is based on wards, with between three and five councilors per ward. The Electoral Commission determines the number of councilors that constitute a council, and the number of councilors per ward. The national Electoral Commission divides each city and town into wards such that each ward has the same number of adult inhabitants, but this criterion may be varied to take into account geographical features, means of communication and density and mobility of the population. The Electoral Commission also conducts municipal elections. Every person of or over the age of twenty-one years who is a citizen of Fiji and who is the occupier or owner of land or house within the municipality is eligible to be enrolled as an elector of that municipality. Electors in a municipality are eligible to stand for election as councilors on condition that they are literate in one or more of Fiji\u2019s official languages (Fijian, English, Hindustani). A number of legal clauses bar certain electors from being able to stand in municipal elections (e.g. those of unsound mind, those who occupy public office, etc.). 92 A part-time mayor, who is the leader of the council, is elected annually by the councilors and may be re-elected for further one-year terms. The council recommends a mayoral allowance which must be approved by the minister. The mayor's primary functions are to chair meetings of the Council and to represent the council at civic functions.

Such advisers are entitled to attend meetings of the council but they do not have a right to vote. The national level electoral system is classified by IDEA International as Alternative Vote. 8.3.2. Papua New Guinea (PNG) The National Parliament is a unicameral House of Assembly with 109 members: 20 from provincial constituencies (19 provinces and the National Capital District of Port Moresby) and 89 from open constituencies (or electoral districts). The main legislation relating to LG in PNG is: \u2022 The Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments 1995; this law was intended to lead to fundamental reforms in PNG\u2019s LG system, with a significant emphasis on LLGs as the basic units of LG. \u2022 The Local-Level Governments Administration Act 1997. Some minor amendments were made to the Organic Law in 1995 to improve implementation but the Local-Level Governments Administration Act has remained unchanged. There are three levels of government in PNG \u2013 national, provincial and local. The sub- provincial level of government is referred to as Local-Level Government (LLG). The table below provides a summary of the structure of LG in PNG. Provincial Assemblies The Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments (OLPGLLG) provides for provincial assemblies comprising the following membership: \u2022 all members of the National Parliament from the province; \u2022 heads of rural local-level governments; \u2022 one representative of the heads of urban authorities and urban councils; \u2022 up to three \u2018paramount chiefs or their appointed nominees representing local areas where the chieftaincy system is in existence and is accepted\u2019; \u2022 one nominated woman representative; \u2022 up to three other members appointed from time to time by the provincial assembly. 93 Provincial assemblies are thus made up of members who are either indirectly elected or appointed/nominated \u2013 in no case are they directly elected to provincial assemblies. All members, including nominated members, have voting powers. The Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments provides for members of the chieftaincy system to be represented in provincial assemblies: \u201cwhere the chieftaincy system is in existence and is accepted in a province, paramount chiefs from the province not exceeding three in number or their duly appointed nominees, who shall be appointed by the Minister responsible for provincial government and local-level government matters on the recommendation of the Provincial Executive Council.\u201d (OLPGLLG S.10 (3) (d)).

If the provincial MP accepts such a position (which thus disqualifies him/her from being provincial governor), or is otherwise removed, s/he is to be replaced by another MP from the 94 province. The governor is constitutionally responsible to the minister for provincial and local-level governments. The deputy governor is elected from amongst and by the representatives of the local-level governments. The provincial executive council comprises the governor and deputy governor, and the chairmen of the permanent committees (not exceeding in total a third of the membership of the assembly). Since the governor appoints the committee chairmen, this provision gives the governor considerable authority. LLG Councils LLG councilors are directly elected by the FPTP electoral system. For LLG councils, PNG has a ward system, each electing a single member to the council. Each LLG has between four and 40 wards, each ward represented by an elected councillor. Each council may also have up to 3 additional members appointed to represent various interest groups as follows: \u2022 1 nominated by the PNG Trade Union Congress \u2022 1 nominated by the Employers\u2019 Federation \u2022 1 to represent women\u2019s organizations. In rural areas, two women are nominated. This has ensured the inclusion of at least one woman appointed councilor in each of the 299 local-level governments. Ten per cent of all councilors are women. All council members, whether elected or appointed, have voting powers. Council elections are held at the same time as national elections. In 2002 these elected 6,003 councilors to 299 LGs. A further 424 members were appointed to represent women, workers\u2019 unions and employers\u2019 federations. Political parties are fully entitled to contest local elections in PNG. Candidates for LLG elections must, by law, be able to demonstrate strong local affiliations (birth, residence, descent, local language fluency). Conditions for ineligibility include insanity, insolvency and a prior criminal record; in addition, LLG employees are not allowed to stand for election. Local councils operate a leader-in-council system. The whole council represents the executive body as well as the legislative body in LG. The leader of the authority may be elected by the councilors or, if there is a proclamation by the head of state, directly elected by the electorate. The term of office is five years. All leaders are full-time and are paid a monthly salary. This remuneration is determined by the Salaries Remuneration Commission. The Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local Governments provides for participative structures including a committee system that involves reporting from community meetings to ward development committees to the local council assemblies. Each ward committee comprises the elected member for the ward (who is the chairperson) and a maximum of five community representatives (of whom two must be women) as associate members. The function of the ward committee is to serve as a consultative and advisory committee to the LG council. 95 8.3.3. Solomon Islands The National Parliament is unicameral comprising 50 members elected by the FPTP system in single-member constituencies. Their term of office is not more than four years. The system of LG is made up of nine provinces, the City of Honiara (the capital) and the Town of Noro. The table below summarises the main features of this system.

The size of each Provincial Assembly varies according to the number of wards \u2013 typically between 9 and 30 members. Under the Provincial Government Act, each Provincial Assembly is headed by an Executive. The total numbers of the Provincial Executive shall not be more than half of the Assembly. The Provincial Executive is led by the Premier, who is elected (for a four-year term) by an absolute majority of Provincial Assembly members. The Provincial Premier is a full-time position. Once elected, the Premier appoints a Deputy Premier and Ministers with portfolio responsibilities, even where the sectoral responsibilities of the Province for services delivery are minimal. The Provincial Secretary is accountable to the Premier and the Executive, in the same way as National Permanent Secretaries are accountable to their Ministers. Urban mayors are also elected by their councilors. The mayors are elected by the councilors from amongst themselves also for a period of four years. Unlike Provincial Premiers, the mayors are part-time. Their remuneration is set by the minister. 96 Very few women hold elected office, and the one leader who is a woman is the chair of the appointed authority currently administering Honiara City Council. The Department of Provincial Government & Constituency Development is responsible for overseeing Provincial and other local elections. The Constitution allows for traditional leadership to be incorporated formally into Provincial structures, although this has never been achieved. Traditional leaders or \u201cchiefs\u201d are widely seen as a credible source of village governance, however, integration into the formal political system has never been successfully completed. The role of traditional leaders is most commonly associated with questions of land use and the legal system allows for Local Courts to adjudicate land disputes to avoid bringing cases to court. There is great cultural variation of customary leadership roles within Solomon Islands and such roles are not always seen as relevant to administrative functions but some Provinces, notably Isabel, are considering more formal systems to facilitate advisory roles for traditional leaders at both Province and village level. The question of how to integrate traditional leadership into formal governance structures has been a focus of discussions of how to reform Provincial Government since the 1970s and remains a priority for Solomon Islanders. The electoral system at the national level is classified by IDEA International as FPTP. Organisation of elections At the national level, IDEA International classifies the current electoral system as Alternative Vote or \u201cLimited Preferential Voting\u201d (LPV). Current arrangements date to May 2003, when LPV supplanted FPTP; the first general election to use LPV will be held in 2007. 97 REFERENCES & BIBLIOGRAPHY This paper has made extensive use of a considerable body of documentation \u2013 some of which is acknowledged in the text, some of which is not fully acknowledged.

Background On 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake registering 9.0 on the Richter scale occurred off the northwest coast of Sumatra, sending several tsunami waves radiating through the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean Tsunami (the Tsunami) struck a vast area across Asia, even reaching as far as the coast of East Africa. The impact of the Tsunami on affected countries was severe in terms of lives lost as well as the widespread destruction caused. While the exact numbers will never be known the number of casualties is believed to be between 200,000 and 300,000.1 Although previous natural disasters have resulted in similar numbers of casualties the Tsunami is unique in the amount of destruction it caused and the wide area that was affected. For example, more than two thirds of the coastline of Sri Lanka and more than 654 villages in Aceh and Nias in Indonesia2 were affected. The coastal areas of India, Maldives and Thailand were also seriously affected.3 Whereas relatively few larger cities suffered any significant damage from the disaster (with Banda Aceh \u2013 the capital of Aceh Province as the major exception), it did take a heavy toll on many urban areas4. The Tsunami caused vast damage to local Infrastructure and Service Delivery (ISD) in almost all sectors which are of crucial importance to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Yet, despite the extensive destruction caused by the Tsunami the macroeconomic impact of the disaster appears limited (ADB, 2005a:20) and it is not expected that the disaster will significantly impact on the overall ability of the affected countries to achieve the MDGs (perhaps with the exception of Maldives). However the Tsunami will impact significantly on the possibility of reaching the MDGs in the affected areas, with the economic and social impact of the disaster being felt most acutely at the local and community level. Although not significantly impacting on national poverty levels in the affected countries (again with the exception of Maldives) it is estimated that two million people were dragged into poverty5 in addition to dragging the already poor into even deeper poverty as a result of the Tsunami. Under a fast recovery scenario, as outlined by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), most countries will have eliminated poverty caused by the disaster by 2007. However, in the slow recovery scenario there will still be an additional 1.1 million poor in 2007 (ADB 2005b:24). Thus, whereas a disaster of such magnitude requires national responses, the local governance institutions in rural areas along the coast and in the cities and urban agglomerations need to be brought to the forefront in meeting the challenges resulting from the Tsunami \u2013 as its impacts have been felt largely at the local level. The importance of local governance was recently emphasized in the 2005 World Summit Outcome which states that local authorities have an important role to play \u201cin contributing to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the [MDGs]\u201d (UN 2005:39).

There are a few noteworthy exceptions (e.g. World Bank 2005; Telford et al 2004; and Wiles et al 2005) but other studies have more or less completely omitted aspects related to local governance (e.g. Beck 2005). The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of lessons learned and emerging principles on the functioning of local governance in disaster recovery (and briefly relief and early recovery)6 \u2013 drawing primarily on experiences from the five countries most seriously affected by the Tsunami: India, Indonesia, Maldives, Thailand and Sri Lanka but also experiences from previous disasters. The main focus of the study is on: (i) the impact of the Tsunami on local governance institutions and local government service delivery; (ii) the role of local governance institutions in recovery - the processes of recovering the institutions themselves but, more fundamentally, their functioning within the national framework for recovery and their role in local recovery; and (iii) how local governance functioned in the recovery period focusing on the local processes - in particular key principles such as representation, participation, accountability, transparency, peace building and integrity. The paper will also briefly address the role and functioning of donor programmes in relation to the above, but focus is on the lessons learned on how national systems of decentralized governance function in recovery situations. This paper presents the findings of an initiative by a group of UNDP practitioners working in the interface between Decentralization and Local Governance and Crisis Prevention and Recovery to analyse the lessons learned on local governance in Tsunami recovery. It has been written by Henrik Fredborg Larsen, Policy Advisor on Decentralization and Local Governance and Nils Taxell, Research Officer in the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok, together with Aminath Shooza (UNDP Maldives), Eugenia Piza-Lopez (UNDP Indonesia), Fredrick Abayratne (UNDP Sri Lanka), Mohammed Zahid (UNDP Maldives), Pradeep Sharma (UNDP India), Ryratana Suwanraks (UNDP Thailand), and Toshihiro Nakamura (UNDP Indonesia). The authors are also grateful for comments and suggestions received from Shanti Faiia (UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo), Jorg Nadoll (UNDP RCB) and Devanand Ramiah (UNDP Sri Lanka). Field research was conducted in Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand in March/April 2005. In each of these countries, interviews and focus group discussions took place with local governments and a range of other stakeholders at the lowest and \u2013 where it exists - second lowest tier of local government in both rural and urban areas as well as with the national/provincial level institutions supporting local governance. Sampling was done in order to cover various socio- economic conditions, in particular the reliance on tourism as opposed to fishery or other income-generating activities and to cover cities and well as towns and other urban areas. The study also builds on the body of analysis conducted in all of the Tsunami affected areas and analyses some of the lessons learned from other disasters in Asia and beyond. More fundamentally, it brings out the experiences of local governance and development practitioners greatly benefiting from their hands-on work helping in the recovery of local institutions and services. It is hoped that this study will contribute towards an increased understanding of the complex and poorly documented area of local governance in disaster recovery. 6 As defined by the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Secretariat: (i) Relief/Response refers to the \u201cprovision of assistance or intervention immediately after a disaster to meet the life preservation and basic subsistence needs of those people affected; and (ii) Recovery (which includes rehabilitation and reconstruction) refers to \u201cdecisions and actions taken after a disaster with a view to restoring or improving the pre-disaster living conditions [of the affected communities], while encouraging and facilitating necessary adjustments to reduce disaster risk\u201d. 4 2.

Local governments in India, Indonesia and Thailand have discretionary authority over, and are accountable to their constituencies for, a significant share of the national budget whereas in Sri Lanka, actual decentralization is more limited, and in the Maldives the development committees have merely been grafted onto a system of local administration functioning as advisory bodies. Second, within as well as between countries, there are large variations in the capacity and resources of local government institutions. There is a major difference between e.g. Phuket Municipality in Thailand with some 380-odd staff and a significant annual budget and a small rural government in e.g. an island in Maldives or a village in Sri Lanka. In making comparisons between different local government bodies differences in jurisdiction, size, capacity, funding, etc. should be acknowledged as should urban-rural distinction. Third, the countries differ simply in the modality of decentralization adopted i.e. in representational arrangement, machinery for delivering local services, administrations and linkages between elected representatives and bureaucrats, strategies for balancing deconcentration and devolution7 etc. Also, it is important to take into account the difference between policy and practice in the affected areas. Whereas India, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka8 and \u2013 to some extent \u2013 Maldives have established the necessary legal, policy and operational frameworks for local governance, implementation has not always fully taken place in the affected areas. This is not least because many of the areas in which the Tsunami struck are also affected by conflict of vertical, and partly also horizontal, nature creating obstacles to the development of local governance capacity as well as leading to a reluctance on the part of central government to move ahead with decentralization. There are however divergences, with some of the affected areas, as an outcome of peace agreements, having arrangements for decentralization of an \u2018asymmetrical\u2019 nature granting local governments in these areas a higher degree of fiscal devolution than is the case in the rest of the country (e.g. Aceh with its special autonomy status has been granted a greater share of revenue from its natural resources, including oil and gas, than other provinces in Indonesia [BAPPENAS, 2005: 15]). That said, there is considerable scope for analysing the lessons learned and attempt to develop an emerging set of principles which can help provide guidance for working with the local governance machinery in recovery. This paper will focus on the role of local representative institutions and the overall system of devolved local government and the role of local elected councils. In all of the countries, local administrations serving as extensions of 7 There are two main forms of decentralization namely: (i) administrative decentralization involves the transfer of decision making authority, resources and responsibilities for the delivery of selected public services from the central government to other lower levels of government, agencies, and field offices of central government line agencies. There are two basic types. Deconcentration is the transfer of authority and responsibility from one level of the central government to another with the local unit accountable to the central government ministry or agency which has been decentralized. Delegation, on the other hand, is the redistribution of authority and responsibility to local units of government or agencies that are not always necessarily, branches or local offices of the delegating authority, with the bulk of accountability still vertical and to the delegating central unit; and (ii) political decentralization transfers political power and authority to sub-national levels such as elected village councils and state level bodies. Where such transfer is made to a local level of public authority that is autonomous and fully independent from the devolving authority, devolution takes place (UNDP, 2004a:4). 8 It should however be noted that in Sri Lanka local governments in the government controlled areas of the country are elected whereas there have been no elected local government in the LTTE controlled areas for the past eight years. The Tsunami impacted both the Northeast of the country (LTTE-controlled) and the South. Thus the varying governance contexts will have implications for the recovery process. This paper deals only with the recovery process in the Southern part of the country. 5 line-ministries at the central level were assigned a lead role in recovery. With the extensive focus on decentralisation across the region and not least in countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka, it is relevant to study the functioning of the local governments and of the local governance processes more broadly to further understand the impact of the disaster on the institutions, the roles and responsibilities assigned to them and the capacity and functioning of the democratic, administrative and financial", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dac23576-8dd9-47e2-8d33-713eb44654ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "dac23576-8dd9-47e2-8d33-713eb44654ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8328c8c4c8072acdf0cadbc5c8326b2c87b587a6366ce8c37884ba0a6f2e0a26"}, "3": {"node_id": "5df6a24c-2afd-4c16-8f28-165a86b4c4f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1789d8daa46ce112ef74267bf17e774b70e2c93c27084eb9feb981b05f5d69f1"}}, "hash": "893daec7fa6a2585d81b3b755268db19426cc28b6a71ce92de564e182a95aecc", "text": "processes. Such an in-depth study of the local governance context for each of the five countries is however beyond the scope of this paper. 3. The impact of the Tsunami on local governance institutions and services 3.1 Major disruption of local service delivery As discussed above, the degree of decentralization and the model for local governance adopted varies significantly among the five countries. However, with the exception of Maldives, the local government in all the countries has significant responsibilities for local service delivery devolved to them and the Tsunami caused heavy damage to the supporting infrastructure. Whereas the mandate and responsibilities of local government in the five countries vary, the Tsunami in most affected countries damaged the following local government social and economic infrastructure: pre-schools/child care centres, health clinics, public markets, drinking water systems (wells, pipes etc.), playgrounds and public parks, libraries, slaughterhouses, streets and minor roads, training centres (e.g. vocational training), crematoriums/cemeteries, community buildings/conference halls, sanitation (sewage systems and public toilets), street lights, bus stands, etc. The extent of the damage caused by the Tsunami across the affected countries is tremendous. The total cost of the damage caused by the Tsunami in Indonesia is estimated at US$ 4.5 billion. Most of the damages and losses (78 percent) were in the private sector (World Bank, 2005:52). Despite this the damages to service delivery and other infrastructure at the local level was extensive affecting all sectors with local government in the most heavily impacted areas completely seizing to function, including law and order functions, and service delivery in other areas being severely disrupted. In India damage to rural and municipal infrastructure was relatively limited, as there was limited infrastructure present in the affected areas. Damage and losses has been estimated to US$29.6 million. The Tsunami also caused damage and losses to the health and education sectors (US$23.6 million) and the transportation sector (US$35.5 million \u2013 although the transportation sector as a whole is not the responsibility of local government) (ADB, UN and World Bank, 2005). In Maldives infrastructure for service delivery (primarily community infrastructure) damaged by the Tsunami included drinking water, pre-schools, markets, sewage systems, storage facilities and telephone systems. Overall damage in Sri Lanka has been estimated to US$1 billion. However the damage is primarily concentrated to the private sector (ADB, JBIC and World Bank, 2005:3). Despite this local government infrastructure did suffer damages, including the destruction of public markets, health clinics, pre-schools, drainage systems, roads, etc. In the Southern Provinces of Sri Lanka alone, reviewed as part of this study, the damage is estimated by the Local Government Department to total Rs. 600 million (approx. US$6 million)9. 9 See Details of the Damages caused by Tsunami Disaster to Local Authorities: Southern Province. 6 3.2 The impact of the Tsunami on local governance institutions In analysing the broader issues surrounding local governance in disaster recovery it is also necessary to look at what happens to the institutions, i.e. the institutions/organizations as well as the wider systems and processes of local governance, as a result of the disaster. Enhanced knowledge in this area will help decision-makers devise the right strategies for: (i) the recovery of the institutions; and (ii) the appropriate role of the local governance institutions in recovery. In particular, appreciating the overall capacity constraints and the need for sequencing, the balance between the two are crucial; increased knowledge will help determine exactly which capacities exist to carry out functions related to existing mandates and new tasks as well as to determine which capacities can feasibly be re-established and at which stage. The physical impact of different natural disasters on local governments differs due to the nature of the disaster. Disasters such as the recent earthquakes in Gujarat (India) and Bam (Iran) cause widespread damage across all sectors including service delivery infrastructure in a limited geographical area and tend to have extensive impact on local governance institutions. The earthquake in Bam killed more than 30,000 people and severely damaged or destroyed some 85 percent of the houses, commercial units, health facilities and administrative buildings in the city of Bam and surrounding villages (UNDP, 2004b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5df6a24c-2afd-4c16-8f28-165a86b4c4f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5df6a24c-2afd-4c16-8f28-165a86b4c4f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8328c8c4c8072acdf0cadbc5c8326b2c87b587a6366ce8c37884ba0a6f2e0a26"}, "2": {"node_id": "dac23576-8dd9-47e2-8d33-713eb44654ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "893daec7fa6a2585d81b3b755268db19426cc28b6a71ce92de564e182a95aecc"}}, "hash": "1789d8daa46ce112ef74267bf17e774b70e2c93c27084eb9feb981b05f5d69f1", "text": "The earthquake in Gujarat killed over 20,000 and led to extensive destruction including two district hospitals destroyed, and over 1,200 health clinics (mostly in rural areas), and over 11,600 schools destroyed or damaged with similar destruction of both rural and urban water supply schemes (World Bank, 2000).

The flooding in Nepal in 2002 and other years, on the other hand, had many casualties but due to the nature of the disaster (affecting more heavily the settlements, or part of settlements, on slopes prone to land slides or in low-lying areas in or close to the river basin) the impact on local governance organisations was fairly limited and they remained capable of supporting relief and recovery efforts. The impact of the Tsunami on local government institutions fell somewhere in-between the extremes cited above with major differences between the countries. The Tsunami primarily affected the lowest tier of local government; in Aceh and Nias, out of 23 agencies in local government visited by a World Bank assessment team, only three had offices that were affected by the Tsunami or earthquakes - all of which were located in Banda Aceh (World Bank, 2005:33). However, offices at sub-district and village level in the affected areas have often been destroyed. In Sri Lanka, in the heavily affected Southern Province visited by the UNDP team, the only two offices which were completely destroyed were sub-offices of the Pradeshiya Sabhas and additional damage (e.g. to walls and files) was to a very large extent to lower tier local government units i.e., Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban/Municipal Councils. In the majority of cases local government offices remained functioning. However, damages also occurred at higher tiers of local government; in e.g. Sri Lanka, four district headquarters were affected, having a major impact on service delivery capacity as the bulk of (deconcentrated) responsibilities are assigned to the District level. In some cases there was significant indirect impact on the functioning of local governments at higher level. In the Maldives, for example, the Island Development Committee Chairs which constitute the majority of members of the councils at the upper level of local government (Atoll Development Committees) generally gave preference to the affairs in their own constituency rather than attending meetings in, and hence support the democratic functioning of, the Atoll Development Committees. 7 In assessing the impact, as indicated above, three categories can be identified: (i) casualties among local government elected representatives and staff; (ii) impact on the physical infrastructure such as buildings, equipment and files - here, a clear distinction should be made between the local government\u2019s infrastructure for their own use (that is administration and council affairs) and the infrastructure for service delivery (as discussed above) and other purposes, and (iii) the impact on the wider \u2018systems, norms and procedures\u2019. Among the five countries, it was only Indonesia that suffered a high number of casualties among local government staff; on average 9 percent of the civil servants were killed in the disaster and the number of casualties in Banda Aceh reached 20 percent. In the other countries, there were also losses from among the ranks of local government staff and elected representatives. However, the overall pattern is that officials killed are primarily from the lower echelons, including contract staff (e.g. in Aceh and Nias, 85 percent of casualties were low level or contract staff [World Bank, 2005]) and there were relatively few casualties amongst chairs and members of the elected councils (e.g. in the Southern Province in Sri Lanka, there were no casualties from among the local politicians).Overall, there was comparatively limited impact to the physical infrastructure used by the local government for administration and council affairs. In Aceh and Nias for example damage to the public administration is estimated at US$81.2 million (BAPPENAS, 2005:63) to be compared with the total cost which is estimated at US$ 4.5 billion. Infrastructure for service delivery and other services on the other hand suffered much more significant damage as noted above. In the majority of countries affected by the Tsunami systems, local government institutional capacity remained intact or was rapidly restored, with the exception of some isolated or remote locations such as the Andaman and Nicobar Island (India). The main exception to this was Aceh and Nias in Indonesia which suffered much greater disruptions in this regard, partly resulting from the institutional capacity not being firmly in place prior to the Tsunami (see below). Yet despite the damages inflicted on local governments by the Tsunami, recovery (of local government) has been relatively rapid in most of the affected countries.

As such, the challenges with respect to local governance six months after the disaster are far less a product of the loss of capacity due to the disaster than a reflection of their strengths and weaknesses prior to the disaster. This is further exacerbated by the limitations posed by how local governments are represented in national task forces and the roles that they are assigned in the relief and recovery process. These are key elements determining the capacity of local governments to cope with the demand to engage in new activities and to rapidly re-establish infrastructure and services (see further below). 4. Local governance in the recovery effort 4.1 What has been the role of local governments in recovery? Given the vast differences in decentralization and capacity of local governance, and the political realities in the five countries, local governments were given very different roles in recovery and the local results and processes have been very different. In looking at the role of local governments in recovery it is also necessary to look at how the challenges to local governance institutions and service delivery outlined above have been addressed. 8 It is often only central (or state) governments which have the capacity to manage the huge commitment of resources required for post-disaster recovery and reconstruction programs. As a result of this, governments in developing countries have tended to establish a special agency at the apex level with reconstruction programmes implemented on a more centralized basis with little role for local governments (IDB, 2003:57). The framework for local governance in recovery is to a large extent determined by their representation in the task forces and the way they are involved in the national level recovery planning \u2013 either directly or through their parent ministry \u2013 and how the challenges are reflected in the national damages/needs assessments and recovery strategies. In India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand, local governments were involved in the assessment and formulation of strategies through the relevant ministry. In the Maldives, however, the Ministry of Atoll Development \u2013 the agency responsible for the Atoll and Island Administrations and the representative Atoll and Island Development Committees \u2013 was not at the centre of decision-making in the National Disaster Management Centre. In the countries covered in the IDB study Disaster Risk Management by Communities and Local Governments there are committees for inter-institutional coordination at all levels of government. However at the local level many of these only operate on a short-term basis and only in the case of an emergency. Experiences from these countries have shown that intermediate levels of government play a crucial subsidiary role in that it is difficult for government at the national level to directly relate to the lowest levels of government (IDB, 2003:19). The local set-up has included the local governments to a varying degree in the five countries and the actual role played by local governments in recovery varies significantly among the five countries. In Sri Lanka, implementation responsibilities at the local level have almost exclusively been assigned to the District and Division Secretariats \u2013 the extensions of the line ministries through the deconcentrated structure \u2013 with very limited additional financial and human resources provided to assist the Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban/Municipal Councils (the lowest tier of local government) to reconstruct the heavily damaged local government infrastructure, which provides the basis for a large range of services that are crucial for local poverty reduction and achievement of the MDGs. The Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban/Municipal Councils and the Departments of Local Government at the Provincial level provided the rough estimates for the first needs/damages assessments and have subsequently carried out the detailed design and cost estimation for the repair work. However, they were not able to start construction since only very limited funding has been made available to them. The own source revenues and limited grants/reimbursement of expenditures have, in the past, enabled them to engage in some development activities, and gradually expand the infrastructure base. However, as the Tsunami has destroyed many years of incremental development, it cannot be rebuilt without a substantive increase in budgets, especially at a time when the tax base has been significantly reduced. The Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban/Municipal Councils (with the support of the Provincial Local Government Departments) in the Southern Province (which was the subject of a field mission \u2013 the situation may differ in other provinces) have the technical/financial capacity which has enabled them to assess the losses and conduct design/cost-estimates for the reconstruction (and to estimate revenue lost).

Furthermore, lack of coordination between the district/divisional secretariats, provincial councils and local government resulted in local government playing a marginal role. It has been acknowledged that this lack of coordination has led to decreased effectiveness in the recovery process. In addition to this, given the 9 political context in Sri Lanka, the fact that most of the local governments were controlled by the opposition may have had implications for the role that they came to play. In Maldives, island level service delivery (apart from health and education delivered by central government ministries) is typically organised by the Island Chiefs with user committees involved in the production of the services \u2013 functional responsibilities are not clearly assigned. It was found that exactly this lack of clarity seems to have hampered the recovery process. This has happened in two major ways. First, the tradition of heavy reliance on user committees made it difficult to take on major reconstruction activities. The respective responsibilities for planning, implementation and management of infrastructure for the individual service is not clear and there has been a tradition for the centre to leave the responsibility for community infrastructure to the island, and for the island administration to put most of the responsibility in the hands of user committee. This can be compared to e.g. Sri Lanka where it is for example regulated that for any building with a budget of more than Rs. 500,000 (approx. US$ 5,000), the engineers of the Provincial Local Government Department will carry out design and cost estimates, and have also taken on this work in Tsunami recovery. Second, the lack of clarity on the responsibilities leaves the Island Chiefs to decide which tasks they will take on and there is no supervision and support to fulfil a minimum set of functions. The Island Chiefs and their administrations have been the focal point for recovery and they established \u2013 as per instruction from the central government \u2013 recovery committees. In the Islands covered by the UNDP study, the committees comprised typically only 1-2 members of the Island Development Committees. The research found that in e.g. Kommandhoo, an active Island Chief was able to organise many elements of recovery but in Guraidhoo, many of the same tasks had not been taken on (e.g. the desalination plant was repaired in Kommandhoo but the desalination plant donated was for unknown reasons not installed by the bilateral donor and the Island Office has not taken action to complete this work). The lack of a formal planning role for local governments and the management from Male of many elements of recovery has led to a feeling among the local governments that the contribution from NGOs is not well coordinated. For the assessment of losses/damages of some sectoral services delivered by central government, the Island Chiefs, and in some cases the Atoll Chief/administration, have been invited to join. In some cases, the Atoll Chiefs felt that they had been insufficiently involved. Reference was made to NGO representatives showing up and saying that \u201cthe government has given us these islands to develop\u201d. Also, this has led to a lack of coordination of the inputs for recovery, e.g. in Kommandhoo Island, a doctor has been provided after the Tsunami but all equipment, e.g. oxygen, the laboratory, still has to be provided by a project. In Indonesia district governments carry a major responsibility for delivery of public services. Also, contrary to the situation in the Maldives, district government in Aceh, due to its special autonomy has quite significant resources. However, there is a gap between existing and required local government capacity to deal with the reconstruction process despite the recovery that they have made from the impact of the Tsunami, and local government has failed to be a decisive actor in the relief and reconstruction programme. Their large budgets have not yet been focused on recovery and reconstruction needs, due to poor planning, low capacities and incidence of corruption (World Bank, 2005:xvii). This is a reflection of the fact that district governments had been struggling to discharge their decentralized functions already prior to the disaster (World Bank, 2005:33). Due to the conflict in Aceh, local government service delivery was already poor in rural areas (BAPPENAS, 2005:17), there were gaps in the legislative framework and the region-centre relationship was unclear.

A World Bank assessment 10 undertaken six moths after the Tsunami concluded that \u201cif local governments are to play their part in the effort, if significant resources are to be entrusted to them for reconstruction, their capacities will need considerable strengthening\u201d and it was concluded that alternative funding mechanisms will need to be used in the meantime (World Bank, 2005:xvii). It is believed that citizens through community-driven projects will themselves be able to deal with micro-level infrastructure. Large-scale infrastructure projects are being undertaken by the larger donors. A gap has however become evident as regards to meso-level infrastructure, e.g. district-level roads, dykes, sewerage and water-supply \u2013 normally the preserve of local government (World Bank, 2005:23). The district governments in both Aceh and Nias do not have the capacity for these tasks \u2013 and due to factors mentioned above (e.g., low capacity and poor control mechanisms) it is unlikely that they would be able to carry out these tasks even if the necessary funds were made available (World Bank, 2005:xviii). Following the Tsunami disaster a team led by the National Planning Development Board (BAPPENAS) formulated a Master Plan for the recovery of Aceh and Nias, involving a wide range of stakeholders in the process \u2013 including line ministries and local government representatives. Reflecting the weakness of local governments in the Tsunami stricken areas, the Master Plan provided for the establishment of the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency (BRR). However, the BRR has a coordinating, rather then implementing, role \u2013 with its core function being to match resources with priority needs. As part of its initial strategy the BRR focused on developing the capacity of local governments to manage their affairs and deliver effective services \u2013 reflecting the weakness of local governments discussed above. In addition to this the BRR also focused on enhancing the effectiveness of the relationship between central government agencies and local governments (World Bank, 2005:20-21). Thailand, having a rather advanced system for devolved service delivery, has coped with the tasks in quite a different manner. Unlike in Maldives and Sri Lanka, the local governments quickly received funding to start recovery of infrastructure and services. In some exceptional cases funding was available from own resources (e.g. the Phuket Municipal Council approved THB 20 million (approx. US$ 500,000) as immediate additional funding from the council\u2019s own coffers the day after the disaster). For smaller local government organizations, i.e. the Tambon Administrative Organizations, funding was provided by the central government; The Tambon Administrative Organisations and Municipalities in Thailand had by April received approximately THB 1.45 billion (approximately US$ 36 million) as unconditional grants compensating for lost tax revenues and ear-marked funds allocated for specific recovery projects proposed. The grants provided to the local government organizations were of two types. The first is the grant for local government organizations which proposed projects for reconstruction of public infrastructure. This grant totals THB 1.2 billion (approximately US$ 30 million), covering 278 projects. The second type of grant is intended to compensate for estimated loss in income of affected local governments for the 2005 budget year. This has amounted to THB 240 million (approximately US$ 6 million). Under this income compensation grant there are three types of funding: (i) grants for estimated loss in tax revenue (not all local government organizations have received these grants); (ii) grants that are proportional to the population size of each local government unit; and (iii) a fixed grant of approximately US$ 5,700 for each of the affected local government organizations. 11 Distribution of grants to local government organizations in Thailand Grant for public works project Grant to compensate for loss of income Grant for compensation of loss in tax revenue (received by 43 out of 74 LGOs) Grant Proportional to Population Size (74 LGOs) Fixed Grant for LGOs in Tsunami-affected Provinces (74 LGOs) US$ 30 million US$ 5,4 million US$ 180,000 US$ 420,000 Total: US$ 6 million However, although recovery in Thailand went relatively fast with respect to the basic local government infrastructure and services, e.g. sewage and drinking water systems were in many places re-established within weeks after the Tsunami, there remain major challenges in two main areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "805bda84-637d-4198-bb3b-bcefe8432f59": {"__data__": {"id_": "805bda84-637d-4198-bb3b-bcefe8432f59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "591d79908359171930089edab246c666b7afa2bf49b3b9d6610866bf8a468ab8"}, "2": {"node_id": "794f2380-41a9-421f-a5bf-a11c9c983afe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fd9096ad9ed2052d8849fa580d7b91d3e0ba393d517f2e2cb73d35b485448eb"}}, "hash": "be5bbcfbc48f4ee52b9299f96b4c8212f4887b4daf3a2436357ff62af04d063a", "text": "First is the extent to which local government organizations ensure a broad public debate on the direction of post-disaster development and participation and protection of the rights of individuals/groups, particularly vulnerable groups, such as the sea gypsies and traditional fisher folk communities (e.g. in Phuket and Phang Nga where powerful interests are backing a different use of the beach front with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d33be34-b1ac-43d2-8c6a-74cbbc33fddc": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d33be34-b1ac-43d2-8c6a-74cbbc33fddc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82af49e9ced12de143d10c441560472f9d5b15508df60da22f084579d35d1e7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd76c8af-18e7-4765-b82f-5cf56d8cd17c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5fa253833c4acc49e62ec1af70ff9f2730e4c401001ae08cc0e2fe86cb83042"}}, "hash": "7e4474bf8772fbd0eb73109f92b95363d186193d18d79afbe8679f9abbf2a406", "text": "less room for e.g. sea gypsies and small entrepreneurs in the hotel and bar business) \u2013 see further below. Secondly, most local government organizations still lack experiences in participatory strategic long-term planning for the overall recovery process, e.g. income generation, beyond the immediate infrastructure reconstruction. In India the Ministry of Home Affairs was initially designated as the nodal point for coordinating relief in the Tsunami affected areas. In the initial stage funds (US$ 627.81 million) were allocated from the National Calamity Contingency Fund. State governments were also able to disburse financial assistance to those affected by the disaster. After the initial relief effort, the government focused on the preparation of a comprehensive framework for rehabilitation and reconstruction coordinated by the National Planning Commission (ADB, United Nations and World Bank, 2005:4). Despite the swift action of the national government in response to the Tsunami, some elected local government representatives have felt that they \u201cwere totally ignored by government agencies in managing the crisis\u201d (ISS, 2005) despite being envisaged by the Constitution as the institutions of self-government. This was a result of the fact that this is not one of the responsibilities of local governments in the third tier. As the main responsibility for relief and rehabilitation has been placed with State Governments and Union Territory Administrations, a call has also been made for the third tier of government, i.e. the Panchayats and Municipalities to be involved as they are likely to have the local information and knowledge that is crucial to ensure sustainable recovery.10 4.2 What happened to the principles for good local governance? During the United Nations Regional Workshop on Lessons Learned and Best Practice in the Response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami held in Medan, Indonesia 13-14 June 2005, the concern was raised that communities had not been consistently consulted on aspects of relief and recovery work and their involvement in needs assessment, planning and implementation of emergency assistance programmes was not prioritized (2005:2). Prior to the regional workshop workshops were also held in four of the Tsunami-affected countries (Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand). Participants in the Maldives and Indonesia workshops found 10 For further information/discussion on the possible role of the Panchayati Raj in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction see: http://www.solutionsexchange-un.net.in/decn/cr/res19010603.pdf. 12 that disaster and damage assessments had been carried out without the involvement of affected communities (GOM/UN, 2005:7 and GOI/UN, 2005:3). In Indonesia it was said that this in some cases had led to aid being delivered without actual needs being taken into account, leading to resources being wasted (GOI/UN, 2005:3-4). Transparency and access to information are crucial elements of the recovery process. Unclear delivery processes and lack of information lead to distrust of local government amongst the intended beneficiaries and a feeling that they are not being included in the decision making process (Fidalgo et al, 2005:45). The lowest tiers of government are in a unique position to ensure that beneficiaries participate in a meaningful way in the recovery programme given their proximity to their constituents. One sector where the participation of the Tsunami affected people is crucial is housing. In order to ensure that the rebuilding of houses in Aceh will follow a community-driven approach, committees for rehabilitation and reconstruction will be established at sub-district and village level based on the lowest government jurisdiction. Moreover communities themselves will be responsible for community mapping, action plans, construction management, etc (World Bank, 2005:62). In fact one of the main principles of the Indonesian Master Plan is that rehabilitation and reconstruction be \u201ccommunity-oriented, participatory as well as sustainable\u201d reflecting the belief that communities themselves have a major role to play in the recovery process (World Bank, 2005:20). In the Maldives and Thailand lessons learned indicated that greater attention needs to be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups during future disasters (GOM/UN, 2005:7 and GOT/UN, 2005:4-5). The importance of paying greater attention to the poor and other vulnerable groups is evident in that they are the ones most vulnerable to the affects of and therefore suffer most of all from natural disasters. The post-disaster recovery phase also holds the possibility of changing the role/situation of vulnerable groups in the affected areas.

In addition to the need for broader direct participation and consultation, the experiences from the first months of recovery also suggests that there is a need to focus on the functioning of the representative institutions (the councils) vis-\u00e0-vis the administration, including issues of accountability, and on the internal functioning of the councils. In for example the Maldives, there was only a limited attempt to integrate the Island Development Committees (the appointed/elected representative bodies) in the recovery effort (e.g. by informing the committees systematically on recovery effort and presenting plans for approval). Also, reacting to a request from Male, the Atoll Chiefs requested the formation of a Task Force for Tsunami recovery at island level. No specific requirements for the composition were provided. The members in the case studies have been selected from among government staff and other citizens considered having the required organisational capacity. In Guraidhoo Island, two out of twenty-five members were members of the Island Development Committees. The second 13 point has been illustrated in Thailand where the directly elected heads of the councils in the words of critics have sidelined other members of the councils.11 Finally, the issue of financial accountability has been an issue of concern. Whereas local governments are often held to be less susceptible to corrupt practices than central governments due primarily to stronger mechanisms for downwards accountability, there exist no a priori unqualified verdict in favour of decentralized governance (see e.g. Fjeldstad 2003 for an overview of the literature on decentralization and corruption). The same would apply to a context of disaster recovery. However, the need to strengthen financial accountability has been highlighted, including in cases where funding is administered by local governments (e.g. in Indonesia \u2013 see World Bank 2005; p. 36). 5. UNDP and donor assistance Past experiences have shown that while technical cooperation has proved effective in \u2018getting the job done\u2019 it has been less effective at developing local institutions or strengthening local capacities. Responding to the immense destruction and human suffering which followed in the wake of the Tsunami there was an unprecedented response on the part of the international community. Support was offered to the affected countries and funds were pledged bilaterally as well as through the multilateral donor agencies including the ADB, UNDP and the wider UN-system and the World Bank. In the initial stages much of the support was directed at providing relief in order to meet the immediate needs. Indonesia, which was the most severely impacted country by the Tsunami consequently also has the largest UNDP programme. The programme covers (i) damage and loss assessment on local governance (co-led with the World Bank); (ii) recovery assessment and planning \u2013 co- leading the governance related task force (including financial management); (iii) provision of support for local governance \u2013 including the development of a project together with the World Bank that aims at filling the capacity gap by placing advisors in various local governance institutions as well as developing the capacity of local institutions in the longer term; and (iv) an overall fund management strategy for reconstruction in Aceh together with the World Bank and developing a strategy for BRR (together with McKinsey).12 A case study looking at the experiences of state institution-building in Timor-Leste was considered a useful model for guiding assistance in meeting capacity development needs in three phases in Indonesia: (i) the stabilization phase \u2013 focusing on the building of individual capacity; (ii) the building phase \u2013 focusing on individual as well as institutional capacity development through combination of broader modalities; and (iii) the consolidation phase \u2013 focusing on a series of cross-institution and institution specific programmes to address both individual and institutional capacity development (Nakamura, 2004:15-32)13. In Thailand UNDP plays a crucial role in supporting the government\u2019s longer-term Tsunami recovery and rehabilitation efforts. It focuses its support through national and local institutions, to vulnerable groups for long-term recovery efforts and inclusive governance, e.g. to sea gypsy and Muslim communities. UNDP also provides support to small local government organizations (Tambon Administrative Organizations) in preparing strategic participatory 11 For further discussion on this see UNDP Human Development Viewpoint on Presidentialism in Decentralized Governance: More Local Leadership But At What Costs (HDV no. 65). 12 Information on UNDP support to Indonesia; study on local governance and tsunami recovery undertaken by Toshihiro Nakamura (UNDP Indonesia).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f52dab0-e5ad-4c4b-a1ee-1d2c3f2412cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f52dab0-e5ad-4c4b-a1ee-1d2c3f2412cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c8ef5bb00a057bf0ac341bd42d1c7762253b2f1d519bd3be07b526975046973"}, "2": {"node_id": "51e297c7-06f1-4c5a-80ab-ee5ce32757fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7867005a4f2213560c3acba8bcbef09f5bf1e9ed4f4dc711cd6f47bd4e6404f"}}, "hash": "50fc62aef4e634cbb09954cbf5e5d1550527d28477b0b7e669732994a9210b5b", "text": "13 For an in-depth description of the model on capacity development and state institution building see http://www.undp.org/oslocentre/docs05/Toshi_final.pdf.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e12eb588-e290-47c3-8c29-1038381e7df9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e12eb588-e290-47c3-8c29-1038381e7df9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3be42007e2ecda8f2bbd0e82c16602cc5872b90eb815d00a4c3b3901d3bacf8d"}, "3": {"node_id": "87813752-c89a-48ce-8785-419035d272c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f270ff29972b67eee4e023a94009ed6d751ca16745cf12eadd055e27c4035a3"}}, "hash": "d939648f5a91c5ebe83ae995515f5ac1d02a808969299a30b85ad6abd99eb6dc", "text": "14 recovery plans and implementing some pilot activities. UNDP\u2019s support is focused in four areas: (i) coordination; (ii) community-based livelihood recovery \u2013 focusing on ensuring the participation and rights of vulnerable groups; (iii) environmental rehabilitation; and (iv) disaster preparedness and mitigation. In India support to post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation has to a certain extent followed a similar pattern to that in Thailand. Again this is a reflection of the governments own capacity and resources to meet the needs at the local level. The Planning Commission, in preparing a comprehensive programme for the rehabilitation has called on the UN-system as well as the international financial institutions to provide assistance specifically in the areas of: (i) sustainable livelihoods; (ii) disaster management and risk reduction; and (iii) infrastructure. In response to this the UN Country Team has identified four areas of support in which it will work: (i) moving from post-disaster relief to recovery; (ii) restoring livelihoods and upgrading infrastructure; (iii) prospective risk reduction; and (iv) policy support and coordination. UNDP has also initiated activities in the area of psychological support as well as supported the coordination of the governments efforts through drawing upon the resources of the already running Disaster Risk Management Programme (UNCT, 2005:17-18). In Sri Lanka UNDP, looking beyond the immediate recovery phase, has developed a programme for Capacity Development for Recovery Programme (CADREP). The focus of the programme is on deconcentrated bodies, local governance and the Pradeshiya Sabhas. However, based on the policy decision of the government to focus on the deconcentrated bodies in the immediate recovery phase, the project will work with the local structures in the second phase. In reflecting the challenges outlined in this paper, the intention is to provide funding (through a proposed Local Recovery Fund) to Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban/Municipal Councils and a major effort is to be made to develop their capacity. UNDP is also supporting the Disaster-Relief Monitoring Unit of the National Human Rights Commission which has been conducting \u2019People\u2019s Consultations\u2019 in collaboration with local universities in an effort to increase participation in the recovery process. In the Maldives UNDP has provided support for community development and participatory processes within the context of the already existing Atoll Development Programme. Policy support has also been given for further development of local democracy through functioning Island and Atoll Development Committees as well as administrative and fiscal decentralization intended to address the challenges in the post disaster context. An innovative approach has been the Adopt-An-Island initiative, developed by UNDP Maldives, which supports the government with its Tsunami recovery work in three key sectors: (i) shelter reconstruction; (ii) infrastructure rehabilitation; and (iii) restoration of livelihoods. The objective of Adopt-An- Island is to generate public and private sector support \u2013 both financial and in-kind \u2013 to sustain the post-Tsunami recovery effort in Maldives. 6. Conclusions and Emerging Principles 6.1 Conclusions The Tsunami has had a major impact on local government service delivery but has, across all affected areas (with the exception of Aceh which saw a significant reduction in an already low capacity of local government), not significantly changed the institutional capacity of local government in place after the immediate recovery phase. The disaster did lead to casualties among local government staff but the vast majority of staff and elected representatives 15 survived the disaster and have resumed their functions. Whereas a limited number of offices were completely destroyed and many office buildings affected, most remained functional. The greatest damage was sustained to infrastructure for service delivery and other public infrastructure under the responsibility of the local governments \u2013 service infrastructure often of crucial importance to attaining the targets set by the MDGs. As discussed above, the macroeconomic impact of the Tsunami has been relatively limited. Yet the destruction of service delivery infrastructure poses a major challenge as the economic and social impacts of the Tsunami on the affected areas have been enormous.14 It is thus crucial that local governments, with the support of national government and donors, quickly re-establish the infrastructure that was destroyed. Therein lies a trade-off between a quick response to urgent needs and a carefully planned reconstruction process that allows for consultation, participation and capacity-building. One of the shortcomings in the recovery process was a lack of consultation with the affected communities, in particular of the poor and disadvantaged, in the planning, design, implementation and monitoring of relief, recovery and rehabilitation efforts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87813752-c89a-48ce-8785-419035d272c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "87813752-c89a-48ce-8785-419035d272c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3be42007e2ecda8f2bbd0e82c16602cc5872b90eb815d00a4c3b3901d3bacf8d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e12eb588-e290-47c3-8c29-1038381e7df9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d939648f5a91c5ebe83ae995515f5ac1d02a808969299a30b85ad6abd99eb6dc"}}, "hash": "9f270ff29972b67eee4e023a94009ed6d751ca16745cf12eadd055e27c4035a3", "text": "Lack of consultation and participation has in some cases led to resources being used in an inefficient manner There is a further conflict between the desire to \u2018return to normal\u2019 and \u2018building better, i.e. making improvements to the previously", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1240d95a-8097-438c-b858-19a0a0e4a4ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "1240d95a-8097-438c-b858-19a0a0e4a4ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca91d230343119332c431f2e0b3df0efed25e00b86703659c81e1c4a75f9894e"}}, "hash": "ca91d230343119332c431f2e0b3df0efed25e00b86703659c81e1c4a75f9894e", "text": "existing institutions and infrastructure. It is clear that local institutions/organizations in the countries studied have had varying success in addressing the challenge of rebuilding infrastructure for service delivery. It is however also clear that lack of capacity on the part of local governments to meet these challenges are not solely a result of the Tsunami, as they were generally able to return to a level of functioning similar to that before the disaster struck. Rather it is a reflection of the fact that local governments in some of the countries lacked capacity and resources already prior to the disaster. The ability of local governments to play an effective role in recovery has also largely been determined by the form of decentralization adopted, administrative as well as financial, as well as the general institutional and legislative framework. Deconcentrated local government in Sri Lanka does not appear to have been equipped with the capacity and resources needed to play an effective role in the recovery process whereas devolved local government in Thailand, due to greater capacity and in particular access to adequate resources was more able to respond. However the performance of local government in Sri Lanka should be seen in light that the local government system in Sri Lanka had a number of weaknesses prior to the Tsunami. It should however be noted that even when local governments are given the mandate as well as the necessary funds they may still not be able to play an effective role if they do not have the necessary capacity \u2013 as was the case in Aceh and Nias. Again, it should be acknowledged that the fact that both Aceh and Sri Lanka were in conflict or in ongoing post conflict recovery process. It can be assumed that will also have impacted on the ability of local governments to respond to the disaster. Another factor impacting on the ability of local government to play an effective role in the recovery is to the extent that it was involved by national government in the planning, design and execution of relief and recovery efforts. As mentioned above e.g. involvement of local government in India was lacking in the early stages. When national bodies are set up to manage the recovery process, local governments need to be represented since they are the institutions responsible for carrying out many post-disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction functions. The importance of local governments is further emphasized by the fact that they 14 E.g. in Aceh the Tsunami had a significant impact totaling 97 percent of the provincial GDP. 16 are likely to be the institutions which are best placed to assess the needs and ensure the participation of the affected communities. It must however be reiterated that this is dependent on the capacity to undertake these tasks existing in local government. Involving them in planning and implementation as well as budgeting the recovery proves is an effective means of building their capacities but in the cases where there is virtually no capacity it may initially be necessary to seek alternative channels until capacity has been built. As such the major needs for assistance of local governments are in recovery of infrastructure and services. More donor and government funding would have to be provided, complemented by support for capacity development if this is to be achieved. Meeting these needs is essentially a continuation, and possibly scaling up of past efforts by UNDP in this area. Further areas in which local governments will have an important role to play in the recovery process and where they are also likely to require support is in reviving the local economy and, through regulating and coordinating, ensuring that the issue of land and property rights is dealt with in an equitable and timely manner. UNDP should consider its role in providing assistance to local governments, in particular the timing and modalities of assistance to local government. UNDP should provide assistance to local governments already at the outset. If assistance is not given to local governments immediately they are likely to be left without any assistance at all during the initial recovery phase, which is likely to have a negative impact on the way reconstruction is carried out. At the initial stage the immediate service delivery could be undertaken by other UN agencies. Currently UNDP works primarily with central government to formulate projects with local governments. But following the above argument and in order to allow for rapid responses and decisions in post disaster situations UNDP should be able to work directly with local government.

A large proportion of support directed at local institutions has focused on capacity development. This has also been the case for UNDP. However, UNDP needs to have a clearer strategy on how to link capacity development with support to local governance. This would include provision of grants when needed in order to allow local governments themselves to set prioritize and invest in the recovery of their infrastructure. Experience indicates that allowing local governments to take part in the planning, budgeting and implementation of the rehabilitation and recovery phase is an effective tool in raising their capacity. A further lesson for UNDP is that for support to local governance to be most effective it must be provided in a timely manner. However, this was not always the case. In e.g. Sri Lanka support to local government is coming at a very late stage. 6.2 Emerging principles This study and the wider experiences and lessons learned on post-disaster recovery and the role of local governance reveals a number of emerging principles: \u2022 The ability of local governments to play an effective part in the recovery effort will in large part depend on their capacity prior to a disaster. \u2022 It is crucial to understand the legal and institutional framework for decentralization as this is likely to be an important factor in determining the effectiveness of local government in the post-disaster recovery phase. \u2022 In order for local governments to be effective players in the recovery process they must have adequate financial resources in addition to capacity. 17 \u2022 Tax bases are typically reduced significantly due to the impact of the disaster on the local economy and reduction of user charges etc. from damaged local government infrastructure and compensatory mechanisms should be established as early as possible. \u2022 Although there is a trade-off between a quick response to urgent needs and a carefully planned reconstruction process that allow for consultation, participation and capacity development it is necessary to opt for the latter in order to ensure the effective use of resources, to ensure that recovery mirrors the actual demands of the affected communities and to develop capacity in the long term. \u2022 Local government should be involved in the planning, design, implementation and monitoring of the recovery process. Involving local governments at all stages of the process is also an effective way to develop capacity. \u2022 Local governments are likely to be the best placed to assess the needs of the affected communities. \u2022 Local governments have a crucial role to play, through coordination and facilitation of participatory processes, in ensuring that the issue of land and property rights is dealt with in an equitable and timely manner. Whereas land management might not be a devolved responsibility of local governments but the elected representations can play an important role as a partner in solving problems related to e.g. ownership and use of land. \u2022 It is crucial to involve communities in the recovery process at all stages. Communities are likely to be the most efficient in restoring some micro-infrastructure. Furthermore attention should be given to building community-based disaster preparedness. \u2022 In planning for post-disaster recovery attention should be paid to the opportunity to promote issues such as gender equality, conflict resolution and human rights. \u2022 There is an urgent need to ensure UN and donor support for early recovery of local governance institutions as well as reconstruction of the infrastructure of local governments which will allow them to re-establish delivery of economic and social services. 6.3 Areas for additional research It is clear from this study that the specific legislative and institutional context of the countries covered in this study has had a major influence on the role that local government has come to play in the recovery phase. Although this study has attempted to do justice to the varying arrangements of decentralization in the different countries it does not have the scope to carry out a full analysis. Given the fact that the Tsunami simultaneously impacted on several countries with differing arrangements for decentralization, it provides an opening for comparative research. Thus it would be merited to undertake additional in-depth case studies in the five countries already included in this study, i.e. India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In addition to revisiting the institutional and legislative frameworks and the impact that they have had on the ability of local governments to play an effective role in the post-disaster recovery phase additional areas of research could include: \u2022 The functioning of the district/local level recovery committees", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b77e2e7-b7d5-40e1-95bc-b6a33d9810f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b77e2e7-b7d5-40e1-95bc-b6a33d9810f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Local Governance in Tsunami Recovery", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cab880863c375faee1586898fc98dd40a1dd36aa05b7407658193648769fd70f"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ee9dd2a-b02f-4f7b-8c16-21d90dabc2f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/local-governance-tsunami-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "982c282b4b21dd0312ed4518c6a32a85137ef4e2de8867dc95ac644f3cd83cd1"}}, "hash": "5a2718ad8e3995eb419fbccfc0ce87eec94b49d4ca57e3eb46d58d4c5b622a61", "text": "and the role of local governments; 18 \u2022 The possibility of developing a standardized methodology to assess the damages / loses of natural disasters on governance institutions (the basis of which could be the methodology developed by UNDP Indonesia)15. \u2022 The role of local government in protecting and promoting human rights in a post- disaster context; \u2022 The relationship between local governments and national and local-level task forces; \u2022 The financing of local governance responses to Tsunami recovery; \u2022 The role of user committees; and \u2022 The role played by communities in the recovery process. 15 For further information on this please contact toshihiro.nakamura@undp.org. 19 References Asian Development Bank (ADB) (2005a): Asian Development Outlook 2005 ADB (2005a): Asian Development Outlook 2005 Update ADB, Japanese Bank for International Cooperation and World Bank (2005): 2005 Sri Lanka Post-Tsunami Recovery Program, Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment ADB, United Nations and World Bank (2005): India Post Tsunami Recovery Program, Preliminary Damage and Needs Assessment Arnold, Margaret et al and ASONOG (2004): Learning Lessons from Disaster Recovery: The Case of Honduras, World Bank, Disaster Risk Management Working Paper Series No. 8 BAPPENAS (2005): Indonesia: Preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment, The December 26, 2004 Natural Disaster Basin (2005): Role of Panchayati Raj Institutions in Past Tsunami Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, Workshop Proceedings, 15 April 2005 Beck, Tony (2005): Learning Lessons from Disaster Recovery: The Case of Bangladesh, World Bank, Disaster Risk Management Working Paper Series No. 11 Bollin, Christina et al.

and the activities of regional centres that successfully contributed to building an effective \u201cService Delivery Platform (SDP)\u201d to provide consistent and coherent support to UNDP country offices (COs) and partner countries. The major steps taken to build the SDP were: I 1. Defining areas of service provision: The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between UNDP and UNODC defines the functional and thematic services being provided by the anti-corruption service area. The MoU provides a framework for cooperation as well as the mutual assistance arrangements between UNDP and UNODC. I 2. Defining and updating UNDP approach: To define the priorities and principles guiding UNDP\u2019s support and to clarify its value-added, UNDP published an anti-corruption practice note entitled \u2018Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Deve - lopment\u2019, which provides guidelines on mainstreaming anti-corruption initiatives in development, particularly the prevention measures in United Nations Convention on Corruption (UNCAC). UNDP\u2019s global programme on anti-corruption also reinforces UNDP\u2019s niche\u2014anti-corruption for development effectiveness. I 3. Developing content: To provide programming guidelines to COs and partner countries, UNDP has also published a primer on corruption and development and a guidance note on UNDP\u2019s work on anti-corruption. I 4. Strengthening the Community of Practice (CoP): Anti-corruption focal points and members of the Community of Practice (CoP) have been identified and trained at global, regional and CO levels. Taking into account new developments in this area, the global anti-corruption CoP also identified the policy priorities and community needs.

Timilsina (anga.timilsina@undp.org), Research Analyst, DGG/BDP, UNDP. 1 I Executive summary I I I I I M a i n s t r e a m i n g A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n D e v e l o p m e n t UNDP memorandum of understanding with UNODC In 2008, UNDP and UNODC finalized the Cooperation Framework to jointly work on anti-corruption issues and effectively deliver as \u2018One UN\u2019. The signing of an MOU between UNDP and UNODC solidifies their partnership at the global, regional and country levels in the provision of technical assistance for anti-corruption initiatives and the implementation of UNCAC. The MoU recognizes that UNDP serves as the coordinating arm of the UN and has wider presence at the country level to promote human development, while UNODC has both normative and technical assistance functions in relation to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Given this complementarity, this MoU seeks to enhance consistency, coherence and quality in the delivery of technical cooperation in anti-corruption to Member States, in response to national priorities. The agreement provides cooperation at regional and national levels depending on the priorities of the country or region concerned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c21fa1c-756b-4dff-b78e-7c3dde0bfa71": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c21fa1c-756b-4dff-b78e-7c3dde0bfa71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Development: Update on UNDP Work on Anti-Corruption in 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "513152131af11de18d9031db88e34ec23bad190731d8203f7a03d39f102e0516"}, "2": {"node_id": "25ae58ac-a8f9-497e-95e8-15baf8aed744", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4c0b8e7ad641c7fc145e2625429765027fbe8424aed2769645f64bdd1cb2f5d"}}, "hash": "e59fa3f9a51783232365f159ec50f49e50e76b312c7e5bf2f6c3ec848c7af9e3", "text": "This is consistent with \u2018One UN\u2019 pilots that encourage joint programming at the country level.

UNDP participated in the 2nd CoSP to UNCAC (held in Bali [Indonesia] from 28 January to 1 February 2008). UNDP also actively participated in and contributed to the Intergovernmental Working Groups on Technical Assistance, Asset Recovery and Implementation Review established under the CoSP. Launch of UNDP\u2019s Asia Pacific human development report on corruption As part of its commitment to global advocacy, UNDP launched an Asia-Pacific human development report entitled \u2018Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives\u2019, which calls for a collective effort by all stakeholders\u2014 governments, development partners, civil society groups, the media and the private sector\u2014to join hands and fight corruption in order to allow governments to provide the needed services to its people. The report is a UNDP policy advocacy resource as well as an instrument for stakeholders, enabling them to influence policies across countries. The report was launched in Jakarta [Indonesia] by Olav Kj\u00f8rven, Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of the Bureau for Develop ment Policy (BDP), at a ceremony attended by H.E. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of the Republic of Indonesia. Along with the launch of the report in Jakarta, several Asia-Pacific UNDP COs together with national anti-corruption insti- tutions also organized events to sensitize the public on anti- corruption. The find- ings of the report were widely covered by the media. The 13th International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) The 13th International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) was held from 30 October to 2 November 2008 in Athens [Greece] under the theme \u2018Global Transparency: Fighting Corruption for a Sustainable Future\u2019. The IACC brought together 1,400 leading practitioners and experts from the private, public and non-profit sectors to collectively formulate innovative and effective solutions, as well as forge partnerships, to better tackle the increasingly sophisticated challenges posed by corruption. The participants discussed how corruption undermines all facets of sustainability: fostering conflict and violence, increasing the exploitation of natural resources, aggravating climate change and deepening global inequalities. In particular, the confe - rence focused on the following topics: I Corruption, Peace and Security I Corruption in Natural Resources and Energy Markets I Climate Change and Corruption I Sustainable Globalization At the 13th IACC, UNDP organized four workshops on \u2018Human Rights and Corruption\u2019, \u2018Tools for Governance and Corruption Analysis\u2019, \u2018Creating Synergies for Technical Assistance\u2019, and \u2018Corruption and Human Development in Asia Pacific\u2019. These workshops increased UNDP\u2019s visibility as one of the key players in the area of anti-corruption. All the workshops were well-attended with high interaction, and there was a lot of interest by participants of IACC on UNDP products, strategy and approach. Moreover, UNDP had its own exhibition booth at the work- shops, with publications and knowledge 3 I Olav Kj\u00f8rven, Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of Bureau for Development Policy, handing over the Report to H.E.

About 140 practitioners, government officials and members from various anti-corruption agencies attended the conference. The conference focused on the role of preventive anti-corruption frameworks and tools under UNCAC and witnessed the launch of the Arab network of anti-corruption practitioners called \u2018Supporting UNCAC Imple men - tation in Arab Countries\u2019. DGG/BDP shared UNDP experiences on supporting preventive anti-corruption bodies including anti-corruption commissions, and introduced UNDP\u2019s approach to anti-corruption programming includ- ing building strategic partnerships at global, regional and country levels. I In October 2008, UNDP contributed to the international conference, \u2018Institutions, Culture and Corruption in Africa\u2019, organized by the United Nations Eco nomic Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa (CODESRIA) from 13 to 15 October 2008.

The conference, which was organized to mark the 50th anniversary of UNECA, was attended by 150 academicians, practitioners, government officials and members from various anti-corruption agencies and civil society. I UNDP also attended and actively participated in the International Group for Anti-corruption Coordination (IGAC) Meeting in October 2008. Among other things, UNDP suggested strengthening its collaboration with member organiations by expanding membership and setting up an effective mechanism for knowledge sharing. I In November 2008, DGG/BDP partic- ipated in the World Urban Forum 4 (WUF4), which was hosted by the Government of China and held in the ancient city of Nanjing from 3 to 6 November 2008. The forum is a biennial gathering organized by UN-HABITAT and attended by a wide range of partners including non-governmental organ- izations, community-based organizations, urban professionals, academics, govern- ments, local authorities and national and international associations of local governments. The WUF4, whose theme was \u2019Harmonious Urbanization: The Challenge of Balanced Territorial Deve - lopment\u2019, witnessed the participation of more than 7,000 people. DGG/ BDP actively participated in both training and networking events. DGG/BDP organized a training session on \u2018Corruption in Local Governments\u2019. 50 participants registered for the course and 35 participants participated in the training. The training modules and reference documents were distributed at the event. I In 2008, DGG/BDP also strengthened its partnership with GTZ and U4 by participating in and contributing to their workshops. In November, DGG/BDP and Regional Centre Bangkok presented its experience on gender and corruption at the GTZ-organized workshop entitled \u2018Gender and Corrup tion in Development Cooperation\u2019. Similarly, in December 2008, DGG/BDP provided a resource person to the training workshop organ- ized by U4 entitled \u2019Current Approaches to Corruption Control: Options for Nepal\u2019.

Through PACDE, the anti-corruption service area of the DGG under BDP is currently con- centrating on developing the internal capacity of UNDP COs to provide quality anti-corruption technical assistance\u2014this includes training, providing knowledge tools that articulate UNDP policy, and guidance on implementing UNDP anti-corruption mandates within the norms and standards provided in UNCAC. The 3rd global anti-corruption Community of Practice (AC COP) meeting UNDP held its 3rd global anti-corruption Community of Practice (AC COP) in Athens [Greece] on 28 and 29 October 2008, back to back with the 13th International Anti-corrup tion Conference (IACC). The overall theme of the AC CoP was \u2018Refocusing UNDP\u2019s Anti-Corruption Work in the Context of UNCAC and UNDP Realignment Process\u2019. The CoP gathered 44 UNDP anti-corruption practitioners from COs, Regional Bureaux/ Centres and the HQ. In addition, repre - sentatives from UNODC, NORAD and an anti-corruption expert from the Northeastern University were invited. The global CoP meeting, organized by the DGG/BDP, was primarily devoted to policy development and identification of community needs and priorities. In addition, it focused on enhancing synergies among CoP members and managing knowledge on anti-corruption. More specifically, the three policy issues discussed in greater detail were: I How to use UNCAC as a framework for UNDP\u2019s work on anti-corruption? I How to build synergies between global, regional and country levels in the context of UNDP realignment process? I How to programme anti-corruption activities as a cross-cutting issue? Most of the participants acknowledged that the COP meeting had positive outcomes: it clarified how UNCAC could be used as a framework for UNDP anti-corruption programming; improved their understanding of the UNDP regional- ization process at the global, regional and 6 I U p d a t e o n U N D P W o r k o n A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n 2 0 0 8 CO level; and made clear how to programme anti-corruption as a cross-cutting issue as stipulated in the strategic plan. In addition, the CoP strengthened the sense of belonging and community among UNDP practitioners. The meeting confirmed the CoP as a viable SDP for anti-corruption and for creating a pool of experts to strengthen South- South cooperation. Knowledge products UNDP has been a leading provider of anti-corruption technical assistance within its governance portfolio and has launched various interventions related to institution, legal and policy frameworks, to enhance accountability, transparency and integrity. However, international norms and standards on anti-corruption have continued to evolve, making it necessary for UNDP to refocus its energies and priorities in anti-corruption within its mandate of reducing poverty, meeting the MDGs and promoting sustain- able economic development in keeping with its mandate. The advent of UNCAC on 14 December 2005 brought new challenges and opportunities. At the policy level, for instance, there were limited knowledge products guiding COs on how to proceed in the context of UNCAC. Thus, the focus for UNDP in 2008 was to redefine its priorities and approaches to combat corruption more effectively. First and foremost, there was need to ensure that UNDP could utilize UNCAC as the rallying international instrument on corruption to further UNDP mandates. Thus, in 2008, DGG concentrated its resources on developing knowledge tools that would make it easy for UNDP COs to provide improved policy and programme advisory services on anti-corruption, and anti-corruption interventions consistent with the norms and standards provided by UNCAC. The DGG/BDP produced the following knowledge products on anti-corruption: Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Development, Anti-Corruption Practice Note 2008 The Practice Note 2008 is the corporate policy document that clarifies UNDP\u2019s position by building on internal knowledge mapping as well as reflecting on and refocusing UNDP\u2019s anti-corruption priorities with respect to the new developments in this field.

The Primer also recommends ways in which UNDP could integrate anti-corruption principles and strategies with its tech nical assistance to effectively implement anti- corruption interventions. Both the Practice Note and Primer went through an extensive validation process and quality control mechanism. These two products were informed by organization-wide consul- tations in regional bureaux and centres, with valuable inputs from UNDP staff on the ground. Additional inputs were provided by other experts and partners. In 2009, these documents will be translated in Spanish, French and Arabic and will be made available to field staff and development practitioners. A User\u2019s Guide to Measuring Corruption, 2008 During the past several years, a flood of new work has emerged, challenging the validity of the traditional measurements of corruption and arguing for new and improved tools for national policy- makers, civil society and donors alike. Is it possible to measure corruption, and if so, how? This publication was one of the first attempts to syste - matically explore the practical challenges and opportunities of measuring what is increasingly viewed as one of the major impediments to development: corruption. The guide provides government, civil society and the private sector with examples of \u2018good practices\u2019 in measuring corruption. UNDP Framework on Corruption and Development, Anti-Corruption Guidance Note and UNDP\u2019s Work in Anti-Corruption, a Brochure This Guidance Note, which is a collective endeavour of the Demo cratic Gover - nance and Anti-Corruption Com munity of Practices within UNDP, succinctly provides corporate guidance on how UNDP positions itself on anti-corruption. This serves as a reference for UNDP practitioners working on the ground. The concept of the Guidance Note was pre- sented at various meetings with representatives of UNDP practices and units, to formu late UNDP\u2019s corporate position on anti-corruption, particularly with reference to finalizing PACDE. The Note sum- marizes the rich contributions that emerged from these discussions. On the other hand, the purpose of the brochure is to provide a brief overview on UNDP work in anti-corruption. Capacity development activities and partnership with regional bureaus and centres and other partners In 2008, the DGG/BDP was involved in several activities related to the capacity development of field staff and national counterparts. The DGG/BDP developed training modules and materials to build and strengthen the internal capacity of UNDP so that COs could effectively engage in anti-corruption programming vis-\u00e0-vis UNCAC implementation. Working through regional centres and their bureaux and other relevant partners, several training programmes were provided in different regions. 8 I U p d a t e o n U N D P W o r k o n A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n 2 0 0 8 Sensitization and validation workshop Lima [Peru], 12-13 June 2008 In June 2008, the DGG/BDP organized a \u2018Sensitization and Validation Workshop on UNDP Practice Note and the Primer on Corruption and Development\u2019 together with the Democratic Governance Cluster of UNDP Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean (RBLAC) and UNDP Peru Office.

Eighteen UNDP anti-corruption practitioners and about 40 national counterparts from anti-corruption com missions, prosecutor offices, the judiciary, civil society, media and public institutions participated in this workshop. The workshop provided an opportunity for UNDP to consolidate the anti-corruption CoP in the Arab Region and for practitioners to exchange best practices and lessons learned from the region and beyond. The workshop focused on developing and strengthening the programming capacity of participants in dif- ferent areas of anti-corruption programming and exploring opportunities and challenges facing the implementation of UNCAC.

Representatives from 20 CSOs participated in the training workshop which aimed at strengthening the capacity of CSOs in monitoring and reporting corruption in African states. The main objective was to promote effective and responsive CSOs by improving their capacity to monitor and report corruption as well as create a pool of stakeholders in the fight against corruption. It aimed to do so through the following: I Orienting the selected CSOs on the objectives, descriptions, conditions, mechanisms, methods and responsibilities of monitoring and reporting corruption.

Upon request, it provided a list of experts to COs and also conducted missions to Bangladesh and Macedonia. Bangladesh In March 2008, in response to growing chal- lenges posed by corruption in Bangladesh, the UNDP Bangladesh CO requested the support of the DGG/BDP Anti-Corruption Policy Advisor to assist the office in identifying key problems and priority measures for integrating anti-corruption issues, in light of reform initiatives already undertaken by the government. The mission held meetings with government officials, CSOs, representatives of international organizations and donors. To understand the extent and nature of corrup- tion in Bangladesh, the mission team looked at corruption within a historical context, reviewed the current framework governing anti-corruption initiatives and the main policy documents related to corruption, and consulted institutions responsible for curbing corruption. This formed the basis for the mission\u2019s recommendations for implementing anti-corruption initiatives. These recommen- dations took into account UNDP\u2019s capacity and the role of other players such as donors and national institutions. The team looked for a project which was manageable and did not require UNDP CO to play the lead role, and which had high chances of a trickle down effect which could be sustained after the elections. Macedonia In February 2008, the DGG/BDP Anti- Corruption Advisor joined the UNDP CO of FYR Macedonia with the following objectives: informing and/or updating the COs in the Western Balkans about the overall objective of the Regional Project entitled \u2018Western Balkans Sub-Regional Mechanism for Facilitation of Anti-Corruption Initiatives\u2019; helping developing a draft activity plan; developing the main project objectives of the sub-regional strategy on anti-corruption in the Western Balkans; and further strengthening the role of COs in national and regional anti-corruption (AC) programming. 11 I M a i n s t r e a m i n g A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n D e v e l o p m e n t Asia-Pacific Region A number of anti-corruption activities were organised for Asia and the Pacific by the Regional Centre Bangkok (RCB) and the Pacific Centre. From 13 to 15 October 2008, RCB and the Pacific Centre organised a major regional training on UNCAC as a follow-up to the first regional \u2018Integrity in Action\u2019 (INTACT) CoP meeting, held in January 2007 in Phnom Penh [Cambodia]. The technical training brought together 61 participants from 18 countries in the region, notably Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. The training consolidated the INTACT CoP in Asia and the Pacific, and provided participants with strategic guidance in imple- menting UNCAC. It deepened understanding of the technical provisions of UNCAC and facilitated the exchange of experiences and lessons learned in the successful implementa- tion of UNCAC provisions in Asia-Pacific countries. Moreover, it developed capacity in Asia-Pacific to sustain anti-corruption initia- tives consistent with UNCAC and fostered synergies with other regional anti-corruption instruments and mechanisms.1 In May 2008, the Pacific Centre co-sponsored a regional workshop of Pacific Ombuds man and officials from countries without an Ombudsman to: (i) discuss the findings of in-country assessments conducted by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in 2007/08; (ii) update stakeholders on related initiatives undertaken by other development partners; and (iii) identify and formulate options for a regional ombudsman support mechanisms. As a follow-up to the meeting, it was agreed to formalise the establishment of a Pacific Ombudsman Alliance. In mid- 2008, the Centre also commissioned a study on Accountability Frameworks and Institutions in the region, which will be finalised in 2009. In June 2008, the Pacific Centre held a Pacific launch of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Corruption in Solomon Islands, in conjunction with a \u2018Workshop on Freedom of Information (FOI) for Pacific Policy-Makers\u2019. The Workshop brought together policymakers from 10 Pacific Island Countries with experts to discuss the value of freedom of information and the practical challenges of implementing freedom of information.

Previously, at the workshop on the role of parliaments in combating corruption, in Vientiane [Laos] in March 2008, RCB provided an overview of corruption in the Asia Pacific region. RCB provided support for the develop- ment of a new project in Sri Lanka, launched in September 2008, to build capacity of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC). It is worth noting that Sri Lanka was the first country in Asia to sign UNCAC and support the development of systems and processes needed to bring the national integrity frame- work incrementally in line with UNCAC provisions. The new project pays specific attention to strengthening key oversight institutions and mechanisms. It strengthens the Commission\u2019s enforcement capacity as well as initiatives to improve understanding on the role of the CIABOC, the anti-corruption strategy and corresponding legislation. Resources are primarily invested in the capacity development of the Commission to ensure its independence. Some small-scale pilot integrity initiatives in selected organi- zations will also be supported by the project, building on the recent \u2018clean hands\u2019 initiative in the public administration. The Sri Lanka Clean Hands Initiative is a voluntary alliance of public sector officials committed to tackling corruption. The new project also includes development of a national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for UNCAC and the National Action Plan of Corruption. In Mongolia, RCB first conducted an assessment in February 2008 looking at anti-corruption efforts and possibilities for future UNDP programme interventions, and then provided support for the drafting of a new project document signed in December 2008 for an amount of $750,000. This project builds on UNDP Mongolia\u2019s previous experience in increasing transparency and accountability of the Ministry of Health and selected health institutions. The new project will seek to replicate the integrity approaches piloted in the health sector in other sectors, under the coordination of the Independent 13 I Participants of UNCAC Technical Training Workshop, 13-15 October, 2008, Bangkok [Thailand].

This will provide interesting opportunities for cooperation with other development partners, some of whom have large projects in support of the sectors. Effective sectoral integrity approaches depend on a diagnosis and good understanding of the policy-making, planning, budgeting and service delivery mechanisms in the sector. Starting with a survey and focus group discussions on how corruption in the sector is perceived both by staff and clients, the project will develop and adopt a set of bench- marks of transparency and accountability requirements. RCB also provided support for anti-corruption programming in Bhutan through a situation analysis and a suggested strategy and outputs to guide the prepara- tion of the UNDP annual work plans in the governance area. The report, entitled \u2018UNDP\u2019s Strategic Contribution to Supporting the Enabling Environment for Achieving the 10th Five Year Plan: Strengthening institu- tional capacity and people\u2019s participation to ensure good governance\u2019, comprises a section, \u2018Strengthening the Legal and Institutional Framework for Controlling Corruption\u2019. Similarly, RCB supported the federal Ombuds man in Pakistan and contributed to the drafting and supported the official launch of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report in Indonesia in June 2008. RCB also conducted a mission to Aceh [Indonesia] in support of the Aceh Govern ment Transformation Programme, addressing among other issues the policy of the anti-corruption team. The report recommended refocusing the team\u2019s efforts from its current activity of \u2018fact-finding\u2019 in allegations of bribery and corruption (without a formal mandate to do so) towards policy development, notably with the development of an \u2018Integrity in action\u2019 action plan for the province. The objective was to tackle corruption from a positive angle (building integrity) rather than a repressive angle (fighting corruption).

In 2008, the ACPN grew in membership from around 120 members to 160, involving several international experts and academics from the region and beyond. Several agencies are official institutional partners of the ACPN. On 14 January 2008, the Commission for Prevention of Corruption of the Slovenian Republic and the UNDP Bratislava Regional Centre signed a \u2018Memorandum on Anti-Corruption Cooperation\u2019, facilitating the participation of the Commission in the activities of the Network. In 2008, the anti-corruption team of the UNDP BRC delivered support to several anti-corruption agencies.

Within the framework of the ACPN, UNDP BRC was requested to participate and deliver presentations on the anti-corruption legal framework of some of the countries of the region, namely Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. In addition to knowledge management, in 2008, UNDP BRC initiated capacity develop- ment assistance for selected anti-corruption agencies in the region. As a first step, the UNDP BRC anti- corruption team, in cooperation with the capacity development team, used information and experiences gathered through the ACPN to create a methodology for capacity assess- ment of anti-corruption agencies. The first three agencies to pilot the methodology, identified in consultation with UNDP COs, were the Agency of State Financial Control and Fight against Corruption of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency and the Directorate for the Anti-Corruption Initiative of Montenegro. A first round of consultations with these agencies was held in Bratislava in July 2008, with a view to conducting capacity assessments during 2008-2009. The first capacity assessment of the Directorate for the Anti-Corruption Initiative of Montenegro was conducted during the year through a self assessment questionnaire and a field mission. The methodology as well as the experiences and case studies gathered during the year will become part of a toolkit for capacity development support to AC agencies that will be finalized during 2009. Establishing cooperation with other organizations and research centres working on anti-corruption in the region was also one of the priorities of the ACPN in 2008. A partnership was established with the Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Estudos de Sociologia, ISCTE, in Lisbon [Portugal]. As a result, a representative of the centre cooperated with the activities of the ACPN during the year. The ACPN experience was also shared and disseminated among UNDP colleagues in other regions through the participation of relevant BRC staff at different events and fora such as the Global AC CoP meeting (Athens, October), the Technical UNCAC training for Asia-Pacific (Bangkok, October), the workshop \u2018Building Partnerships to Support UNCAC Implementation in the Arab Countries\u2019 (Beirut, June), and the Regional Conference \u2018Preventing corruption and strength- ening cooperation between anti-corruption bodies in the Arab region\u2019 (Amman, July). Western Balkans anti-corruption initiative The Western Balkans anti-corruption initiative brought together UNDP offices in Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo to learn from each other\u2019s experiences in anti-corruption programming and develop a joint sub-regional strategy in this area.

For the 2008-2009 period, the focus is on independent anti-corruption bodies, witness and whistleblower protection and national anti-corruption strategies\u2019, with the role of the private sector and civil society addressed as a cross-cutting issue. POGAR\u2019s 2008 work contributed to (1) improving the capacity of governmental actors on UNCAC assessment using the UNCAC Self-Assessment Checklist, (2) strengthening knowledge of policymakers on \u2018prevention measures\u2019 under UNCAC, and (3) enhancing knowledge networking among governmental and non-governmental actors in the area of anti-corruption in the Arab region (including establishing the Arab Anti-Corruption & Integrity Network and consolidating the Anti-Corruption Community of Practice in the Arab Region). The Arab Governmental Expert Group (AGEG) on UNCAC Assessment In cooperation with UNODC, POGAR created a group of 20 government practitioners from 17 Arab States. The members were nominated by their governments in accordance with pre-set criteria and have committed to being part of the Group. The objective of this group was to contribute to improving the capacity of Arab governments on UNCAC assessments through training government officials on UNCAC assessment tools and methodologies, and anti-corruption measure- ment in general, with a view to supporting national efforts to develop assessment reports that would identify compliance gaps, technical assistance needs and related priorities. In addition to undertaking assessment efforts in their countries, AGEG members may also act as trainers at the national level. The AGEG members underwent two training seminars. The first was on UNODC\u2019s \u2018UNCAC Self Assessment Checklist\u2019. The second was on a pilot in-depth assessment tool developed by POGAR. Related efforts will continue and expand in 2009 to address new assess- ment tools in cooperation with the Oslo Governance Center (OGC) and to involve non-governmental actors as well.

Regional Advisors from UNDP as well as representatives from partner organizations such as UNODC, TI and OECD participated in this event as well. This meeting provided a regional platform for knowledge-networking among UNDP practi - tioners and for partnership building among UNDP COs, national coun terparts and other organizations. The meeting helped establish a sense of community among participants; opened avenues for cooperation and synergies at the national, regional and global levels; helped provide a common language among participants; and sensitized them to key issues in anti-corruption programming. Following the CoP meeting, a regional conference was organized in Amman on 29 and 30 July 2008 to strengthen the knowledge of policymakers on UNCAC prevention measures. The conference was attended by 120 participants including high-level representa- tives from around 35 governmental bodies concerned with anti-corruption including specialized agencies and com missions, audit bodies, inspection bodies, ministries of justice, and ministries of administrative development from 17 Arab countries, in addition to the representatives of the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, and representatives from UNODC, OECD, TI, IACCA, ARPAC and other regional and international actors and bilateral and multilateral donors. The objective was to launch and support a region-wide policy dialogue on prevention measures under UNCAC, with a view to preparing Arab States to the Third Session of the Conference of State Parties (CoSP) in Doha [Qatar] in November 2009, which will address this issue as one of its priority themes.

The Bureau provided advisory services and technical support to the anti-corruption project related to political financing, media and strengthening civil society, the implementation of UNCAC and the facilitation of knowledge sharing. The bureau also supported anti-corruption programmes and projects related to financing political parties in Mexico and Panama and on transparency and integrity in Peru, Chile and Mexico and on UNCAC implementation in Colombia. The RBLAC also supported the regional consultative meeting on UNCAC implemen- tation for the countries in the Caribbean and anti-corruption programmes and activities in Barbados, Suriname, Belize, Trinidad and Tobago. The Bureau, together with DGG/BDP, conducted a training workshop for 18 UNDP CO staff from the Latin America and the Caribbean to develop their anti-corruption capacities. Africa Most of the anti-corruption activities in the Africa region have been supported by UNDP COs. 2008, UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa (RBA) initiated a process to develop its regional governance programme.

The major steps taken to build the SDP were: I 1. Defining areas of service provision: The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between UNDP and UNODC defines the functional and thematic services being provided by the anti-corruption service area. The MoU provides a framework for cooperation as well as the mutual assistance arrangements between UNDP and UNODC. I 2. Defining and updating UNDP approach: To define the priorities and principles guiding UNDP\u2019s support and to clarify its value-added, UNDP published an anti-corruption practice note entitled \u2018Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Deve - lopment\u2019, which provides guidelines on mainstreaming anti-corruption initiatives in development, particularly the prevention measures in United Nations Convention on Corruption (UNCAC). UNDP\u2019s global programme on anti-corruption also reinforces UNDP\u2019s niche\u2014anti-corruption for development effectiveness. I 3. Developing content: To provide programming guidelines to COs and partner countries, UNDP has also published a primer on corruption and development and a guidance note on UNDP\u2019s work on anti-corruption. I 4. Strengthening the Community of Practice (CoP): Anti-corruption focal points and members of the Community of Practice (CoP) have been identified and trained at global, regional and CO levels.

The signing of an MOU between UNDP and UNODC solidifies their partnership at the global, regional and country levels in the provision of technical assistance for anti-corruption initiatives and the implementation of UNCAC. The MoU recognizes that UNDP serves as the coordinating arm of the UN and has wider presence at the country level to promote human development, while UNODC has both normative and technical assistance functions in relation to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Given this complementarity, this MoU seeks to enhance consistency, coherence and quality in the delivery of technical cooperation in anti-corruption to Member States, in response to national priorities. The agreement provides cooperation at regional and national levels depending on the priorities of the country or region concerned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3fd6066-eb26-4de9-b1bd-083f3f6685ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3fd6066-eb26-4de9-b1bd-083f3f6685ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Development: Update on UNDP Work on Anti-Corruption in 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfbc98deced28187e3b9b6a757bdc0046e004e5f57a1aee2b515124a0b5ec9e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e429345-e129-49ad-be55-977c09378f16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bdfb637f7aa11ee3d4b0cfc132b41c14b738e8993398345de22092bf6fdfb0e"}}, "hash": "aa10d8a504c3400dd000de5714fab42c5284151323b5e48ed5a0cd354c07c8de", "text": "This is consistent with \u2018One UN\u2019 pilots that encourage joint programming at the country level.

Launch of UNDP\u2019s Asia Pacific human development report on corruption As part of its commitment to global advocacy, UNDP launched an Asia-Pacific human development report entitled \u2018Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives\u2019, which calls for a collective effort by all stakeholders\u2014 governments, development partners, civil society groups, the media and the private sector\u2014to join hands and fight corruption in order to allow governments to provide the needed services to its people. The report is a UNDP policy advocacy resource as well as an instrument for stakeholders, enabling them to influence policies across countries. The report was launched in Jakarta [Indonesia] by Olav Kj\u00f8rven, Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of the Bureau for Develop ment Policy (BDP), at a ceremony attended by H.E. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of the Republic of Indonesia. Along with the launch of the report in Jakarta, several Asia-Pacific UNDP COs together with national anti-corruption insti- tutions also organized events to sensitize the public on anti- corruption. The find- ings of the report were widely covered by the media. The 13th International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) The 13th International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) was held from 30 October to 2 November 2008 in Athens [Greece] under the theme \u2018Global Transparency: Fighting Corruption for a Sustainable Future\u2019. The IACC brought together 1,400 leading practitioners and experts from the private, public and non-profit sectors to collectively formulate innovative and effective solutions, as well as forge partnerships, to better tackle the increasingly sophisticated challenges posed by corruption. The participants discussed how corruption undermines all facets of sustainability: fostering conflict and violence, increasing the exploitation of natural resources, aggravating climate change and deepening global inequalities. In particular, the confe - rence focused on the following topics: I Corruption, Peace and Security I Corruption in Natural Resources and Energy Markets I Climate Change and Corruption I Sustainable Globalization At the 13th IACC, UNDP organized four workshops on \u2018Human Rights and Corruption\u2019, \u2018Tools for Governance and Corruption Analysis\u2019, \u2018Creating Synergies for Technical Assistance\u2019, and \u2018Corruption and Human Development in Asia Pacific\u2019. These workshops increased UNDP\u2019s visibility as one of the key players in the area of anti-corruption. All the workshops were well-attended with high interaction, and there was a lot of interest by participants of IACC on UNDP products, strategy and approach. Moreover, UNDP had its own exhibition booth at the work- shops, with publications and knowledge 3 I Olav Kj\u00f8rven, Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Director of Bureau for Development Policy, handing over the Report to H.E.

The 3rd global anti-corruption Community of Practice (AC COP) meeting UNDP held its 3rd global anti-corruption Community of Practice (AC COP) in Athens [Greece] on 28 and 29 October 2008, back to back with the 13th International Anti-corrup tion Conference (IACC). The overall theme of the AC CoP was \u2018Refocusing UNDP\u2019s Anti-Corruption Work in the Context of UNCAC and UNDP Realignment Process\u2019. The CoP gathered 44 UNDP anti-corruption practitioners from COs, Regional Bureaux/ Centres and the HQ. In addition, repre - sentatives from UNODC, NORAD and an anti-corruption expert from the Northeastern University were invited. The global CoP meeting, organized by the DGG/BDP, was primarily devoted to policy development and identification of community needs and priorities. In addition, it focused on enhancing synergies among CoP members and managing knowledge on anti-corruption. More specifically, the three policy issues discussed in greater detail were: I How to use UNCAC as a framework for UNDP\u2019s work on anti-corruption? I How to build synergies between global, regional and country levels in the context of UNDP realignment process? I How to programme anti-corruption activities as a cross-cutting issue? Most of the participants acknowledged that the COP meeting had positive outcomes: it clarified how UNCAC could be used as a framework for UNDP anti-corruption programming; improved their understanding of the UNDP regional- ization process at the global, regional and 6 I U p d a t e o n U N D P W o r k o n A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n 2 0 0 8 CO level; and made clear how to programme anti-corruption as a cross-cutting issue as stipulated in the strategic plan. In addition, the CoP strengthened the sense of belonging and community among UNDP practitioners. The meeting confirmed the CoP as a viable SDP for anti-corruption and for creating a pool of experts to strengthen South- South cooperation. Knowledge products UNDP has been a leading provider of anti-corruption technical assistance within its governance portfolio and has launched various interventions related to institution, legal and policy frameworks, to enhance accountability, transparency and integrity. However, international norms and standards on anti-corruption have continued to evolve, making it necessary for UNDP to refocus its energies and priorities in anti-corruption within its mandate of reducing poverty, meeting the MDGs and promoting sustain- able economic development in keeping with its mandate. The advent of UNCAC on 14 December 2005 brought new challenges and opportunities. At the policy level, for instance, there were limited knowledge products guiding COs on how to proceed in the context of UNCAC. Thus, the focus for UNDP in 2008 was to redefine its priorities and approaches to combat corruption more effectively. First and foremost, there was need to ensure that UNDP could utilize UNCAC as the rallying international instrument on corruption to further UNDP mandates. Thus, in 2008, DGG concentrated its resources on developing knowledge tools that would make it easy for UNDP COs to provide improved policy and programme advisory services on anti-corruption, and anti-corruption interventions consistent with the norms and standards provided by UNCAC. The DGG/BDP produced the following knowledge products on anti-corruption: Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Development, Anti-Corruption Practice Note 2008 The Practice Note 2008 is the corporate policy document that clarifies UNDP\u2019s position by building on internal knowledge mapping as well as reflecting on and refocusing UNDP\u2019s anti-corruption priorities with respect to the new developments in this field. The Practice Note clarifies that the main rationale for UNDP engagement with anti-corruption is to further its mandates on poverty reduction, realization of the MDGs and promoting sustainable development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fa04481-47e3-4e70-983d-0d65fa6d13dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fa04481-47e3-4e70-983d-0d65fa6d13dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Mainstreaming Anti-Corruption in Development: Update on UNDP Work on Anti-Corruption in 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f945cce987595f3de46b17de552029e8cd09c48b9b6d304038f405148907944"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3eeadbc-ea66-41ab-9f24-ce3900996e7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mainstreaming-anti-corruption-development-update-undp-work-anti-corruption-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52d9ff59bb4b879f1fc7bc6f041e5b105795f5184eb774bc7a8b793fef82c43f"}}, "hash": "58130b7faadfd807e042e8129faa71cfde08b7033bf9607868cfed31c3b5976e", "text": "It also reinforces two important facts: (1) UNDP has been a leading provider of anti-corruption tech- nical assistance within its democratic gover- nance portfolio, and (2) the agency is in a unique position to engage a broad range of national stakeholders in a holistic approach to fighting corruption.

Anti-Corruption Intervention for Poverty Reduction, Realization of the MDGs and Promoting Sustainable Development, Primer on Corruption and Development The main objective of the Primer is to complement the Practice Note by extending concepts and programming guidelines. Thus, the primer explores the theoretical and empirical relationship between corruption 7 I M a i n s t r e a m i n g A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n D e v e l o p m e n t and the various aspects of deve l opment includ- ing economic growth, poverty, human rights, gender, governance, human development, and environment and sustainable develop- ment. The Primer also recommends ways in which UNDP could integrate anti-corruption principles and strategies with its tech nical assistance to effectively implement anti- corruption interventions. Both the Practice Note and Primer went through an extensive validation process and quality control mechanism. These two products were informed by organization-wide consul- tations in regional bureaux and centres, with valuable inputs from UNDP staff on the ground. Additional inputs were provided by other experts and partners. In 2009, these documents will be translated in Spanish, French and Arabic and will be made available to field staff and development practitioners. A User\u2019s Guide to Measuring Corruption, 2008 During the past several years, a flood of new work has emerged, challenging the validity of the traditional measurements of corruption and arguing for new and improved tools for national policy- makers, civil society and donors alike. Is it possible to measure corruption, and if so, how? This publication was one of the first attempts to syste - matically explore the practical challenges and opportunities of measuring what is increasingly viewed as one of the major impediments to development: corruption. The guide provides government, civil society and the private sector with examples of \u2018good practices\u2019 in measuring corruption. UNDP Framework on Corruption and Development, Anti-Corruption Guidance Note and UNDP\u2019s Work in Anti-Corruption, a Brochure This Guidance Note, which is a collective endeavour of the Demo cratic Gover - nance and Anti-Corruption Com munity of Practices within UNDP, succinctly provides corporate guidance on how UNDP positions itself on anti-corruption. This serves as a reference for UNDP practitioners working on the ground. The concept of the Guidance Note was pre- sented at various meetings with representatives of UNDP practices and units, to formu late UNDP\u2019s corporate position on anti-corruption, particularly with reference to finalizing PACDE. The Note sum- marizes the rich contributions that emerged from these discussions. On the other hand, the purpose of the brochure is to provide a brief overview on UNDP work in anti-corruption. Capacity development activities and partnership with regional bureaus and centres and other partners In 2008, the DGG/BDP was involved in several activities related to the capacity development of field staff and national counterparts. The DGG/BDP developed training modules and materials to build and strengthen the internal capacity of UNDP so that COs could effectively engage in anti-corruption programming vis-\u00e0-vis UNCAC implementation. Working through regional centres and their bureaux and other relevant partners, several training programmes were provided in different regions. 8 I U p d a t e o n U N D P W o r k o n A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n 2 0 0 8 Sensitization and validation workshop Lima [Peru], 12-13 June 2008 In June 2008, the DGG/BDP organized a \u2018Sensitization and Validation Workshop on UNDP Practice Note and the Primer on Corruption and Development\u2019 together with the Democratic Governance Cluster of UNDP Regional Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean (RBLAC) and UNDP Peru Office.

Eighteen UNDP anti-corruption practitioners and about 40 national counterparts from anti-corruption com missions, prosecutor offices, the judiciary, civil society, media and public institutions participated in this workshop. The workshop provided an opportunity for UNDP to consolidate the anti-corruption CoP in the Arab Region and for practitioners to exchange best practices and lessons learned from the region and beyond. The workshop focused on developing and strengthening the programming capacity of participants in dif- ferent areas of anti-corruption programming and exploring opportunities and challenges facing the implementation of UNCAC.

Training to CSOs on reporting and monitoring corruption Kampala [Uganda], 10-11 November 2008 In November 2008, the DGG/BDP, UNDP and UNECA jointly organized a \u2018Training Workshop for Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) on Monitoring and Reporting Corruption\u2019. Representatives from 20 CSOs participated in the training workshop which aimed at strengthening the capacity of CSOs in monitoring and reporting corruption in African states. The main objective was to promote effective and responsive CSOs by improving their capacity to monitor and report corruption as well as create a pool of stakeholders in the fight against corruption. It aimed to do so through the following: I Orienting the selected CSOs on the objectives, descriptions, conditions, mechanisms, methods and responsibilities of monitoring and reporting corruption. I Equipping CSOs with the knowledge and information required to execute the arduous challenge of fighting corruption in Africa in a systematic and methodical way.

Upon request, it provided a list of experts to COs and also conducted missions to Bangladesh and Macedonia. Bangladesh In March 2008, in response to growing chal- lenges posed by corruption in Bangladesh, the UNDP Bangladesh CO requested the support of the DGG/BDP Anti-Corruption Policy Advisor to assist the office in identifying key problems and priority measures for integrating anti-corruption issues, in light of reform initiatives already undertaken by the government. The mission held meetings with government officials, CSOs, representatives of international organizations and donors. To understand the extent and nature of corrup- tion in Bangladesh, the mission team looked at corruption within a historical context, reviewed the current framework governing anti-corruption initiatives and the main policy documents related to corruption, and consulted institutions responsible for curbing corruption. This formed the basis for the mission\u2019s recommendations for implementing anti-corruption initiatives. These recommen- dations took into account UNDP\u2019s capacity and the role of other players such as donors and national institutions. The team looked for a project which was manageable and did not require UNDP CO to play the lead role, and which had high chances of a trickle down effect which could be sustained after the elections. Macedonia In February 2008, the DGG/BDP Anti- Corruption Advisor joined the UNDP CO of FYR Macedonia with the following objectives: informing and/or updating the COs in the Western Balkans about the overall objective of the Regional Project entitled \u2018Western Balkans Sub-Regional Mechanism for Facilitation of Anti-Corruption Initiatives\u2019; helping developing a draft activity plan; developing the main project objectives of the sub-regional strategy on anti-corruption in the Western Balkans; and further strengthening the role of COs in national and regional anti-corruption (AC) programming. 11 I M a i n s t r e a m i n g A n t i - C o r r u p t i o n i n D e v e l o p m e n t Asia-Pacific Region A number of anti-corruption activities were organised for Asia and the Pacific by the Regional Centre Bangkok (RCB) and the Pacific Centre. From 13 to 15 October 2008, RCB and the Pacific Centre organised a major regional training on UNCAC as a follow-up to the first regional \u2018Integrity in Action\u2019 (INTACT) CoP meeting, held in January 2007 in Phnom Penh [Cambodia]. The technical training brought together 61 participants from 18 countries in the region, notably Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. The training consolidated the INTACT CoP in Asia and the Pacific, and provided participants with strategic guidance in imple- menting UNCAC. It deepened understanding of the technical provisions of UNCAC and facilitated the exchange of experiences and lessons learned in the successful implementa- tion of UNCAC provisions in Asia-Pacific countries. Moreover, it developed capacity in Asia-Pacific to sustain anti-corruption initia- tives consistent with UNCAC and fostered synergies with other regional anti-corruption instruments and mechanisms.1 In May 2008, the Pacific Centre co-sponsored a regional workshop of Pacific Ombuds man and officials from countries without an Ombudsman to: (i) discuss the findings of in-country assessments conducted by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in 2007/08; (ii) update stakeholders on related initiatives undertaken by other development partners; and (iii) identify and formulate options for a regional ombudsman support mechanisms. As a follow-up to the meeting, it was agreed to formalise the establishment of a Pacific Ombudsman Alliance. In mid- 2008, the Centre also commissioned a study on Accountability Frameworks and Institutions in the region, which will be finalised in 2009. In June 2008, the Pacific Centre held a Pacific launch of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report on Corruption in Solomon Islands, in conjunction with a \u2018Workshop on Freedom of Information (FOI) for Pacific Policy-Makers\u2019. The Workshop brought together policymakers from 10 Pacific Island Countries with experts to discuss the value of freedom of information and the practical challenges of implementing freedom of information.

Previously, at the workshop on the role of parliaments in combating corruption, in Vientiane [Laos] in March 2008, RCB provided an overview of corruption in the Asia Pacific region. RCB provided support for the develop- ment of a new project in Sri Lanka, launched in September 2008, to build capacity of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC). It is worth noting that Sri Lanka was the first country in Asia to sign UNCAC and support the development of systems and processes needed to bring the national integrity frame- work incrementally in line with UNCAC provisions. The new project pays specific attention to strengthening key oversight institutions and mechanisms. It strengthens the Commission\u2019s enforcement capacity as well as initiatives to improve understanding on the role of the CIABOC, the anti-corruption strategy and corresponding legislation. Resources are primarily invested in the capacity development of the Commission to ensure its independence. Some small-scale pilot integrity initiatives in selected organi- zations will also be supported by the project, building on the recent \u2018clean hands\u2019 initiative in the public administration. The Sri Lanka Clean Hands Initiative is a voluntary alliance of public sector officials committed to tackling corruption. The new project also includes development of a national monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for UNCAC and the National Action Plan of Corruption. In Mongolia, RCB first conducted an assessment in February 2008 looking at anti-corruption efforts and possibilities for future UNDP programme interventions, and then provided support for the drafting of a new project document signed in December 2008 for an amount of $750,000. This project builds on UNDP Mongolia\u2019s previous experience in increasing transparency and accountability of the Ministry of Health and selected health institutions. The new project will seek to replicate the integrity approaches piloted in the health sector in other sectors, under the coordination of the Independent 13 I Participants of UNCAC Technical Training Workshop, 13-15 October, 2008, Bangkok [Thailand].

This will provide interesting opportunities for cooperation with other development partners, some of whom have large projects in support of the sectors. Effective sectoral integrity approaches depend on a diagnosis and good understanding of the policy-making, planning, budgeting and service delivery mechanisms in the sector. Starting with a survey and focus group discussions on how corruption in the sector is perceived both by staff and clients, the project will develop and adopt a set of bench- marks of transparency and accountability requirements. RCB also provided support for anti-corruption programming in Bhutan through a situation analysis and a suggested strategy and outputs to guide the prepara- tion of the UNDP annual work plans in the governance area. The report, entitled \u2018UNDP\u2019s Strategic Contribution to Supporting the Enabling Environment for Achieving the 10th Five Year Plan: Strengthening institu- tional capacity and people\u2019s participation to ensure good governance\u2019, comprises a section, \u2018Strengthening the Legal and Institutional Framework for Controlling Corruption\u2019. Similarly, RCB supported the federal Ombuds man in Pakistan and contributed to the drafting and supported the official launch of the Asia Pacific Human Development Report in Indonesia in June 2008. RCB also conducted a mission to Aceh [Indonesia] in support of the Aceh Govern ment Transformation Programme, addressing among other issues the policy of the anti-corruption team. The report recommended refocusing the team\u2019s efforts from its current activity of \u2018fact-finding\u2019 in allegations of bribery and corruption (without a formal mandate to do so) towards policy development, notably with the development of an \u2018Integrity in action\u2019 action plan for the province. The objective was to tackle corruption from a positive angle (building integrity) rather than a repressive angle (fighting corruption). The report suggested an Aceh integrity initia- tive could be developed with support from interested donors.

On 14 January 2008, the Commission for Prevention of Corruption of the Slovenian Republic and the UNDP Bratislava Regional Centre signed a \u2018Memorandum on Anti-Corruption Cooperation\u2019, facilitating the participation of the Commission in the activities of the Network. In 2008, the anti-corruption team of the UNDP BRC delivered support to several anti-corruption agencies.

Within the framework of the ACPN, UNDP BRC was requested to participate and deliver presentations on the anti-corruption legal framework of some of the countries of the region, namely Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. In addition to knowledge management, in 2008, UNDP BRC initiated capacity develop- ment assistance for selected anti-corruption agencies in the region. As a first step, the UNDP BRC anti- corruption team, in cooperation with the capacity development team, used information and experiences gathered through the ACPN to create a methodology for capacity assess- ment of anti-corruption agencies. The first three agencies to pilot the methodology, identified in consultation with UNDP COs, were the Agency of State Financial Control and Fight against Corruption of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Kosovo Anti-Corruption Agency and the Directorate for the Anti-Corruption Initiative of Montenegro. A first round of consultations with these agencies was held in Bratislava in July 2008, with a view to conducting capacity assessments during 2008-2009. The first capacity assessment of the Directorate for the Anti-Corruption Initiative of Montenegro was conducted during the year through a self assessment questionnaire and a field mission. The methodology as well as the experiences and case studies gathered during the year will become part of a toolkit for capacity development support to AC agencies that will be finalized during 2009. Establishing cooperation with other organizations and research centres working on anti-corruption in the region was also one of the priorities of the ACPN in 2008. A partnership was established with the Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Estudos de Sociologia, ISCTE, in Lisbon [Portugal]. As a result, a representative of the centre cooperated with the activities of the ACPN during the year. The ACPN experience was also shared and disseminated among UNDP colleagues in other regions through the participation of relevant BRC staff at different events and fora such as the Global AC CoP meeting (Athens, October), the Technical UNCAC training for Asia-Pacific (Bangkok, October), the workshop \u2018Building Partnerships to Support UNCAC Implementation in the Arab Countries\u2019 (Beirut, June), and the Regional Conference \u2018Preventing corruption and strength- ening cooperation between anti-corruption bodies in the Arab region\u2019 (Amman, July). Western Balkans anti-corruption initiative The Western Balkans anti-corruption initiative brought together UNDP offices in Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo to learn from each other\u2019s experiences in anti-corruption programming and develop a joint sub-regional strategy in this area.

For the 2008-2009 period, the focus is on independent anti-corruption bodies, witness and whistleblower protection and national anti-corruption strategies\u2019, with the role of the private sector and civil society addressed as a cross-cutting issue. POGAR\u2019s 2008 work contributed to (1) improving the capacity of governmental actors on UNCAC assessment using the UNCAC Self-Assessment Checklist, (2) strengthening knowledge of policymakers on \u2018prevention measures\u2019 under UNCAC, and (3) enhancing knowledge networking among governmental and non-governmental actors in the area of anti-corruption in the Arab region (including establishing the Arab Anti-Corruption & Integrity Network and consolidating the Anti-Corruption Community of Practice in the Arab Region). The Arab Governmental Expert Group (AGEG) on UNCAC Assessment In cooperation with UNODC, POGAR created a group of 20 government practitioners from 17 Arab States. The members were nominated by their governments in accordance with pre-set criteria and have committed to being part of the Group. The objective of this group was to contribute to improving the capacity of Arab governments on UNCAC assessments through training government officials on UNCAC assessment tools and methodologies, and anti-corruption measure- ment in general, with a view to supporting national efforts to develop assessment reports that would identify compliance gaps, technical assistance needs and related priorities. In addition to undertaking assessment efforts in their countries, AGEG members may also act as trainers at the national level. The AGEG members underwent two training seminars. The first was on UNODC\u2019s \u2018UNCAC Self Assessment Checklist\u2019. The second was on a pilot in-depth assessment tool developed by POGAR. Related efforts will continue and expand in 2009 to address new assess- ment tools in cooperation with the Oslo Governance Center (OGC) and to involve non-governmental actors as well.

Regional Advisors from UNDP as well as representatives from partner organizations such as UNODC, TI and OECD participated in this event as well. This meeting provided a regional platform for knowledge-networking among UNDP practi - tioners and for partnership building among UNDP COs, national coun terparts and other organizations. The meeting helped establish a sense of community among participants; opened avenues for cooperation and synergies at the national, regional and global levels; helped provide a common language among participants; and sensitized them to key issues in anti-corruption programming. Following the CoP meeting, a regional conference was organized in Amman on 29 and 30 July 2008 to strengthen the knowledge of policymakers on UNCAC prevention measures. The conference was attended by 120 participants including high-level representa- tives from around 35 governmental bodies concerned with anti-corruption including specialized agencies and com missions, audit bodies, inspection bodies, ministries of justice, and ministries of administrative development from 17 Arab countries, in addition to the representatives of the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, and representatives from UNODC, OECD, TI, IACCA, ARPAC and other regional and international actors and bilateral and multilateral donors.

The Bureau provided advisory services and technical support to the anti-corruption project related to political financing, media and strengthening civil society, the implementation of UNCAC and the facilitation of knowledge sharing. The bureau also supported anti-corruption programmes and projects related to financing political parties in Mexico and Panama and on transparency and integrity in Peru, Chile and Mexico and on UNCAC implementation in Colombia. The RBLAC also supported the regional consultative meeting on UNCAC implemen- tation for the countries in the Caribbean and anti-corruption programmes and activities in Barbados, Suriname, Belize, Trinidad and Tobago. The Bureau, together with DGG/BDP, conducted a training workshop for 18 UNDP CO staff from the Latin America and the Caribbean to develop their anti-corruption capacities. Africa Most of the anti-corruption activities in the Africa region have been supported by UNDP COs. 2008, UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa (RBA) initiated a process to develop its regional governance programme. At the regional level, DGG/BDP, in collaboration with UNECA, organized a training workshop for civil society members from various African countries on monitoring and reporting corruption.

However, given the range of public interventions that will need to be financed, guidance in managing public finance, which relates to a climate change response, is also warranted. Achieving climate change objectives will involve pub- lic interventions that are both economic (e.g. taxes, subsidies, loans), regulatory (formulating and enforc- ing legislation that specifies the behaviour required of organisations or individuals), and informational (e.g. awareness campaigns, corporate reporting require- ments). In addition, changes in a government\u2019s provi- sion of goods and services (e.g. building roads, running primary schools) will be required. Executing public in- terventions in these areas will undoubtedly require ad- ditional public finance to be managed across a range of public institutions. Critically, the full suite of climate change related public interventions that is required will need to be consid- ered as a whole, both in terms of the potential syner- gies between interventions and as well as potential contradictions. To address climate change will require not just an increase in expenditures dedicated to ac- tivities for climate change mitigation and adaptation; but also a qualitative shift across government in the overall composition of expenditures, so that \u2018harmful\u2019 expenditures are reduced and potential synergies with developmental expenditures are maximised. The comprehensiveness of a climate change response will not only be built on climate change specific poli- cies, but on interventions to achieve other govern- ment goals like higher employment, increased ex- ports, improved food and energy security. A response to climate change therefore needs to be at the heart of development policy and its financing considered as part of the entirety of the national budget. Thailand and Philippines governments have set up inter-minis- terial, multi-stakeholder, climate finance groupings to act as advisers on the implications of new policy initia- tives for climate change across government. As the key instrument for policy makers to make de- cisions on prioritising public interventions across the whole of government, the national budget is of funda- mental importance for developing a coherent govern- ment response to climate change. When using public finance for a national response to climate change, the question that should be asked is not what does a Executive Summary 5 Making Sense of Climate Finance system of \u2018climate financing\u2019 look like; but rather, how can climate change considerations be integrated with- in existing planning and budgeting processes? In practise much of the government\u2019s budget for the coming financial years is already committed and so space to make these changes in the immediate future may be limited. However, over time, the discretionary resources in the budget will increase and as such a medium-term outlook in budgeting can help to shape this reallocation. Analysis of how climate policy relates to existing pat- terns of public expenditure has begun with UNDP sup- port in Asia and the Pacific. Nepal, Bangladesh, Thai- land, Cambodia and Samoa have undertaken Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs). These reviews provide an analytical base for informing how budgetary allocations may need to be redirected over time to address climate change. CPEIRs also show how the impacts of climate change are likely to dispro- portionately affect services delivered at the local level. For example, the Indonesian Government is looking at building upon their existing inter-governmental fiscal transfer system, by introducing a Regional Incentive Mechanism to support localities to achieve their re- spective REDD targets. Nepal is also building their cli- mate change adaptation work on the existing systems developed for delivery of local level energy services. It is widely agreed that to adapt to and mitigate cli- mate change there is a need to mobilize increased finance. Recognising the historical legacy of green- house gases emitted by the industrialised nations, it has been agreed it is incumbent upon those countries to make additional finance available from public and private sources. There are three broad ways of disburs- ing these sources of finance: (i) to the national treasury to be allocated through the budget; (ii) to extra-bud- getary funds with their own governance arrangements outside of the budgetary process; or (iii) directly to agencies responsible for the implementation of spe- cific projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59636442-31e1-4be4-bdb3-b3ca2d23d8e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "59636442-31e1-4be4-bdb3-b3ca2d23d8e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2188a36cb66bc0686ac849dd31f82fa45062bdc2fd20d4916bf51fa3e28d931e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e75811a-f6b8-4c2a-b3bc-dbf295926eec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08a9e08bc486c53dcf57f7ee4ffbb2f03847563da4c163f950359295ecc615a9"}}, "hash": "593fefe9deba92520a9b2f6eb9e78b3b3b13ea83c20555fa4d8f1c3cb913ef31", "text": "CPEIRs show that, in practice, the majority of additional climate finance is currently being disbursed outside of national budgetary procedures, through extra- budgetary funds or project finance.

On the other hand if the financing of a climate change response take place outside of the national budgetary system, it will undermine the mainstreaming of climate change considerations into national planning and budgeting systems. Some lessons from the management of Official Devel- opment Assistance (ODA) can strengthen the manage- ment of public sources of climate finance. Project and extra-budgetary funds can support comprehensive- ness, transparency and accountability of the national budget if they utilize country systems of planning and public financial management to the maximum extent possible. For example, projects and activities to be funded can be drawn from a country\u2019s national plan- ning process; and planned revenues and expenditures related to extra-budgetary funds and projects can still be recorded in budget documentation and use the national budget classification system. Using planning and budgeting processes at sector and national levels to prioritise climate change related interventions can help identify gaps and reduce overlaps in expendi- tures. Likewise more focus on ensuring complementar- ity between budgetary allocations and extra-budget- ary mechanisms can reduce fragmentation and ensure a comprehensive national response to climate change. 6 Making Sense of Climate Finance 1. Introduction A large body of analytical work has built up in recent years on the issue of \u2018climate finance\u2019. Much of this work was initially dedicated to establishing the scale of fi- nance needed to sufficiently limit the negative impacts of man-made climate change through mitigation and adaptation. There have been a series of estimates both at international and national levels, which have sought to put a financial value to how much it might cost to reach defined objectives of climate change mitiga- tion and adaptation (see for example \u2018Generating the Funding Needed for Mitigation and Adaptation\u2019 from the World Bank 2010 Development Report )2. Given that responsibility for the increased concentration of greenhouse gas emissions that has already occurred lies primarily with developed countries, a formalized commitment was made at the CoP in Cancun to jointly mobilize and deliver new and additional funds of USD 100 billion per year by 2020 (Buchener et al. 2011a, Copenhagen Accord Ref.). The collective financial com- mitment made also articulates the requirement of a system to measure, report and verify (MRV) the rele- vant financial flows across a variety of sources. Emerging from the need to mobilize explicitly new and additional finance and also to measure, report and verify the impact of those financial flows, Bird (2012) notes a \u2018first wave\u2019 of analytical work that aims to bet- ter understand (i) the architecture with which \u2018climate finance\u2019 is expected to be delivered (see for example Atteridge et al 2009 and Buchener et al 2011b); (ii) how climate finance might be tracked (see for example Bu- chner et al. 2011a); as well as (iii) considerations of what new and additional climate finance might reasonably be defined as (as in World Bank 2010). This body of work is primarily from the perspective of the provider of finance: it asks \u2018how can the money be raised and delivered to a developing country?\u2019 2 According to this study, mitigation in developing countries could cost $140 to $175 billion a year over the next 20 years (with associated financing needs of $265 to $565 billion); over the period 2010 to 2050 adaptation invest- ments could average $30 to $100 billion a year. Efforts to date to raise funding for mitigation and adaptation stand at less than 5 percent of projected needs. A \u2018second wave\u2019 of analytical work began in 2010, look- ing at how climate finance might be delivered more effectively drawing from the principles by which the delivery of development finance has been judged (Bird 2012). In this vein, the recent 4th High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan recognized the relevance of the principles agreed in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action and particularly the impor- tance of country-ownership, the use of country sys- tems, and avoiding fragmentation (OECD 2012). More recently, there has been a growing body of work that has focused in on the recipients of climate finance and considered the \u2018readiness\u2019 of these countries to receive a significant increase in international financial flows to address the challenges of climate change (see for example UNDP, 2012 and GIZ, 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "667a19e8-bf4a-4bea-82b8-bf8ec698442b": {"__data__": {"id_": "667a19e8-bf4a-4bea-82b8-bf8ec698442b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ea7a289ef554f5247c61af31a4d153847476adb27ca5f345d43b90f51c7876e"}, "2": {"node_id": "867c4e9e-8b21-4fb1-bd4a-8de366d853b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3566c2e528bdcaa0c64ba054034246ef34df5b73ab63b40709212d7b7522f51c"}}, "hash": "92c034e82d545a72e78c9d00b7cf1afa6f7305c239fce5b8d635cb365cfb979e", "text": "UNDP (2012) have developed a framework, which can be used to as- sess \u2018readiness\u2019, which they define as the capacities to (i) plan for finance for climate changes, (ii) access different forms of finance, (iii) deliver finance for implementation of activities, and (iv) monitor, report and verify climate- related expenditures and their impact.

From the perspective of the national deci- sion maker who is determining a national response to climate change, the concept of \u2018climate finance\u2019 is operationally not easily understood and needs fur- ther disaggregation. For example \u2018climate finance\u2019 comprises public finance that governments spend, but also private finance for private actions on climate change. This paper seeks to build on this recipient-centric ap- proach, but suggests that in practise governments manage public policy, not \u2018climate finance\u2019 and public policy is operationalized through the national budget process based on the resources available, not on the size of the financing need. Governments have a number of objectives they wish to achieve (including objectives on climate change amongst others), a range of policy instruments at their disposal to achieve them and lim- ited resources to finance those policies. 7 Making Sense of Climate Finance This paper is principally targeted at central policy deci- sion makers and aims to provide accessible guidance for thinking through how policy interventions might be prioritized and financed through the national bud- get and complemented by international public financ- ing. However, it may also be of interest to researchers and those working with donors who are involved in financing public interventions on climate change in developing countries. This paper is not intended to re- place more comprehensive guidance on public expen- diture management; rather it draws out some of the key principles of this literature and applies them in the context of climate change, using illustrative examples from the Asia-Pacific region. It is intended to help build common understanding between officials in finance and planning ministries and their counterparts in cli- mate change and environment institutions on how public policy on climate change might be financed. The paper is structured as follows: section 2 presents a simple framework of public policy instruments at the disposal of government and applies them to a climate change context. Section 3 proposes some mechanisms for linking climate change policy and public expendi- ture. Section 4 looks in more detail at how internation- al public finance can complement government policy on climate change. The final section summarizes the key recommendations made in this paper. 8 Making Sense of Climate Finance 2. Public policy instruments and climate change 2.1 Framework of public policy instruments Governments have a number of objectives they wish to achieve and a range of policy instruments at their disposal through which they would look to achieve them. Bemelmans-Videc et al. (1998) put these policy instruments into three main groupings: \u201ccarrots, sticks and sermons\u201d: where \u201ccarrots\u201d are economic instru- ments (e.g. taxes, subsidies, loans), \u201csticks\u201d are regu- lations (formulating and enforcing legislation that specifies the behaviour required of organisations or individuals), and \u201csermons\u201d are information instru- ments (e.g. awareness campaigns, corporate reporting requirements). It has been noted by Howlett (2011) that these three groupings of instruments underplay the importance of a fourth grouping: the government provision of goods and services (e.g. building roads, running primary schools). To achieve the goals of climate change mitigation and adaptation, countries are using a mixture of all four types of instrument. Table 1 has some examples: Arguably, international development agencies have focused more on the latter grouping: government pro- vision of goods and services. Improved government service delivery has been a central platform in setting out to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Better schools, better district health centres and better roads have tended to be the visible hallmarks of the development agenda and the increased public financ- ing thereof. The way government manages the provision of public goods and services is undoubtedly having an impact on climate change. The choices made over infrastruc- ture investments for example will influence both the concentration of greenhouse gases as well as the re- silience to climate risk. However, governments and providers of finance will benefit from not losing sight of the whole range of potential policy interventions at their disposal. A significant component of public policy on climate change will be about shaping behaviours of households, communities and businesses, which may require a change of mind-set from the prevailing ser- vice-delivery oriented development agenda. Invest- ments to put in place appropriate economic incentives and suitable regulatory structures, as well as to gather and disseminate appropriate information will have a vital role to play in effectively limiting the negative impacts of climate change.

Further, it is not just how resources are spent that in- fluences climate change, but also how those resources are raised. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region are using their tax policies to shape private incentives for investment. Vietnam and China have for example introduced taxes levied on extraction of coal; while a number of countries are offering tax credits for \u2018green investments\u2019. (Ernst & Young 2011) 2.2 Indirect impacts on climate of public policy instruments Climate change will be influenced not only by policy interventions with the primary objective of mitiga- tion or adaptation to climate change. In many cases, policies put in place to achieve other objectives may have complementary secondary benefits or costs on climate change outcomes. For example, interventions that promote sustainable development such as micro- credit schemes for rural livelihood development are also likely to have co-benefits for increasing resilience to climate risks. Equally, one can think of interventions to achieve objectives that may conflict with the goals of climate change mitigation and adaptation: for in- stance, to promote agricultural productivity countries may convert forests to land for commercial agriculture. Finally, in some cases, policy interventions beneficial from a mitigation perspective could potentially leave affected communities less resilient to climate change (e.g. large scale hydroelectric projects) and vice versa (e.g. subsidizing fossil fuel usage for rural irrigation schemes). Although additional finance will be necessary to ad- dress the impact of climate change, it will not be ad- dressed solely by increasing expenditure on activities aimed at mitigating or adapting to climate change. An effective public policy on climate change will require the promotion of behaviours that lead to adaptation and mitigation, but also inhibit behaviours that lead to exacerbation of climate change or maladaptation. The policy interventions highlighted will be undertaken both at the centre of government (e.g. tax policy, en- vironmental regulations), but also importantly across different sectors of government (e.g. energy, transport, agriculture) and at the local level. Within certain sec- tors, there will be no/low regret options of policy in- terventions where existing core sector objectives can also lead to benefits from a climate perspective. For ex- ample, energy efficiency measures can improve ener- gy security and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are many sectors where there are di- rect trade-offs that sector policies will need to address.

Linking policies to public expenditure 3.1 Prioritisation of policy interventions Policy interventions will have varying financial implica- tions, both on revenues and expenditures. This is true of investments in government-delivered services but also \u2018enabling\u2019 investments: tax collection costs money to verify and enforce, regulations require funding to draft and enforce, while information will also have a cost to prepare and disseminate. Estimating the costs of introducing a policy and the total resources that are likely to be available can be one useful framework to help assist prioritisation and sequencing of policies. Institutions can identify which policies might be affordable given the projected re- sources available; but can also provide a clear signal to possible providers of finance as to what could be achieved if additional resources were to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea4cc860-f2f5-4cbf-b28c-21c0df82ef60": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea4cc860-f2f5-4cbf-b28c-21c0df82ef60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c76a8560560144b2f28d29698a53c6a3514c118239f944cf828820ab195ca5e"}}, "hash": "4c76a8560560144b2f28d29698a53c6a3514c118239f944cf828820ab195ca5e", "text": "be forthcoming. Most countries in the region have in place comprehen- sive climate change policy documents; but at present, these policy documents can sometimes read like wish- lists, rather than prioritized policy plans. For example, the CPEIR in Bangladesh suggests that the Bangladesh climate change strategy is not yet a costed and se- quenced delivery framework (CDDE/UNDP 2011). The stated needs of policy interventions will always be greater than the total resources available to govern- ment: whether in the field of climate change or health, in a developing country or developed. While this does not in any way lessen the importance of mobilizing ad- ditional resources for climate change it does point to the need to make choices over how government can best achieve its objectives given the resources available. The national budget process provides a framework through which government makes trade-offs between competing policy interventions across the whole of government and is therefore a key instrument for as- sessing how climate change may complement or com- pete with other policy objectives at a national, sector and local level. 3.2 Linking climate change policy and the national budget When preparing the national budget, the Ministry of Finance will determine the likely total resource enve- lope for the budget and then allocate that budget to different sectors (e.g. health, education, energy, trans- port etc.) at different levels of government (e.g. centre, local). The allocations made to sectors should be based on the priorities of the government. This then provides the sectors with a resource envelope with which they can implement their own prioritized plans. For exam- ple, based on the budget allocation provided by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transport will pri- oritise certain programs and policy instruments over others in order to best achieve the objectives given the resources available. As choices of how to allocate the budget are meant to be reflective of government priorities, it is often said that the budget should be the financial mirror of gov- ernment policy (ADB 1999). The following discussion provides some concrete guidance on how policy mak- ers might facilitate the reflection of climate change in the budget. 3.2.1 The budget framework As a general point, it is useful to remember that bud- gets evolve over time. Budgets do not start from a ze- ro-base each and every year, with all potential policy interventions analysed and then the whole budget allocated accordingly. Where efforts have been made to do such an exercise, known as \u2018zero-based budget- ing\u2019, they have been described as an \u2018expensive illusion\u2019 (ADB 1999). In practise, much of government\u2019s bud- get for the coming financial years is already commit- ted: there is an existing wage-bill to pay, interest on outstanding debt, social security payments, on-going capital projects, and the costs of providing certain priority goods and services like basic education and health services. This means that in the near term, the discretionary resources, (often called fiscal space) that a government has at its disposal to implement new pol- icy initiatives in any single annual budget are minimal. (ADB 1999) 11 Making Sense of Climate Finance A medium-term outlook for the budget can give great- er space for governments to shape the overall direc- tion of spending patterns over time, as the margin for change will be typically greater in the medium-term with revenues growing and existing commitments coming to an end (ADB 1999). This is one of the major reasons why many countries in the region have intro- duced, or are in the process of introducing Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (see Box 1). 3.2.2 Processes for allocation of discretionary resources Normally, at a national level, the easiest way to priori- tize budgets is to adjust the allocations of sector min- istries. For example, to increase the budget for agricul- tural productivity, the Ministry of Finance can increase the budget allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture (see example 1 in Figure 1). One of the challenges with climate change is that it is affected by the policies of a number of sectors, and so to prioritize resources for actions on climate change, allocations within Ministries dedicated to climate related actions need to increase. This is more difficult to directly influence through cen- tralised allocations (see example 2 in Figure 1). One way to attempt to shift behaviour away from \u2018busi- ness as usual\u2019 would to be identify the discretionary re- sources available in the budget framework that could be dedicated to specific new climate change policy ini- tiatives, as shown in Table 3. In Vietnam, for example, there are established processes in place during budget preparation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2676dad-3fc4-4ff4-aa0a-67bcaa7b8a57": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2676dad-3fc4-4ff4-aa0a-67bcaa7b8a57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63e1beb6c440c9845f19ea97df4ef0cbd4504e17051356843127f4b90de799fc"}}, "hash": "63e1beb6c440c9845f19ea97df4ef0cbd4504e17051356843127f4b90de799fc", "text": "for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) to al- locate a proportion of the resources provided through its budget support operation (see page 20, Box 4) to dedicated climate change schemes and projects. First, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) develops prioritized duties and criteria to guide other ministries in the formulation of their proj- ects, which are potentially eligible for financing. Ap- propriate ministries and localities then formulate those project outlines and send them to the appropriate nat- ural resources and environment agencies for comments (i.e. at a national or local level). Based on the comments, ministries and localities prepare a finalized prioritized list of potential projects for financing. Finally, MoF and MPI then decide upon which projects to finance based on the available resource envelope identified for new initiatives on climate change, in consultation with MONRE. (Ministry of Finance Viet Nam, 2012) Box 1: Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in Indonesia The Government of Indonesia has been in the process of introducing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) since 2003 since the issuance of Act 17 of 2003 on State Finance. The Government of Indonesia has a \u2018rolling 3 year\u2019 medium-term expenditure framework in place. This means that each year when the annual budget is prepared, budgets are presented at an aggregate level for the coming 3 years (although only the coming financial year is legally agreed upon by Parliament). Indonesia also provides budgets for each sector for the coming 3 years. By providing sector Ministries with more predict- able resource envelopes, it helps Ministries to allocate funds in line with priorities in a fiscally sustainable way. Further, as part of the MTEF in Indonesia, each sector is required to provide a breakdown of their budget by programs. It is therefore possible to monitor both how the budget is evolving over time at a national level between sectors, but also how the budget is changing within sectors, which is important for monitoring cross-cutting issues like climate change. The Indonesian MTEF separates on-going and new policies. All new policy initiatives are submitted for scrutiny by the Cabinet, who ultimately decide upon how discretionary resources should be allocated. Trade-offs are therefore made at the highest level of government on how budgetary resources should be allocated over the medium-term to best achieve government policy objectives. Source: The Indonesian Budget Overview 2011, Ministry of Finance, Directorate General of Budget 12 Making Sense of Climate Finance Focusing solely on how resources can be allocated to new initiatives that promote adaptation or mitigation does not address the issue of reducing interventions with secondary impacts on climate change outcomes. Responding to climate change requires not just more dedicated expenditures for climate change actions, but also a qualitative shift across government in the overall composition of expenditures over time, so that expenditures which exacerbate climate change are re- duced and potential synergies are maximised. In practical terms, it may be difficult to analyse each and every policy intervention through a \u2018climate lens\u2019; however, government may wish to identify policies and sectors which potentially have the most signifi- cant linkages with climate change. In those sectors, it is not just dedicated \u2018climate change\u2019 initiatives that need to be considered, but also the impacts on climate change of all key new policy interventions and major investments. For example, decisions made today on infrastructure to provide additional energy generation capacity will have significant implications into the fu- ture. A number of countries have set up multi-stake- holder climate finance groups who may be best placed to advise on the implications of major policies on cli- mate change. For example, the Philippines Govern- ment, has created a multi-stakeholder Climate Finance Group while the Government of Thailand has formed a Climate Fiscal Framework Working Committee to com- ment on such issues. Where additional resources are made available for new policy interventions, which have significant implica- tions on the budget, there can be benefits in record- ing those measures in the budget documentation so agencies can be held to account for the use of those resources. This type of approach is currently under- taken in the Solomon Islands for all government agen- cies (see Box 2).

Such a section could also highlight key new policy initiatives that have secondary benefits or costs from a climate change perspective. 3.2.3 Reviewing public expenditures As climate change is an emerging policy issue, at pres- ent there is a lack of understanding at a national level on how existing policies and public expenditures are affecting climate change. Carrying out a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) can help to partially fill this analytical gap. A number of coun- tries in the region have completed (Nepal and Bangla- desh) or are in the process of completing (Thailand, Cambodia, Samoa) Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIRs). While the specifics of the studies vary from country to country, each CPEIR to date entails: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdAn assessment of current policy priorities and strat- egies as these relate to climate change \u2022\ufffd \ufffdA review of the institutional arrangements for pro- moting the integration of climate change policy priorities into budgeting and expenditure manage- ment \u2022\ufffd \ufffdA review of the integration of climate change ob- jectives within the budgetary process, including as part of budget planning, implementation, expendi- ture management and financing. (ODI, CDDE 2011) Emanating from the CPEIR, policy makers should gain greater insight into how climate change is being re- flected in the budget and how public expenditures may need to be restructured if climate change objectives are to be met. One of the key benefits of this type of Table 3: Example budget with a proportion of discretionary resources dedicated to new climate change policy initiatives 2013 2014 2015 Total resources 1,000 1,150 1,280 Total expenditures already committed 900 920 860 Fiscal space/discretionary re- sources 100 230 420 Total for new climate change policy initiatives 20 55 90 Source: Author\u2019s Own Box 2: Recording new initiative in the Solomon Island\u2019s Budget Documentation In the Solomon Islands, where additional discretionary resources are allocated to Ministries in annual budget prepara- tions, the description of what that allocation is intended for is highlighted in the budget.

Further, in practical terms, it may be unrealistic to review the entire budget each and every year through a \u2018climate lens\u2019: but this type of analysis can help to highlight those key priority sectors and programs where central ministries may wish to fo- cus upon when considering climate change in budget preparation (see Box 3 for examples from Bangladesh).

As such, they rely upon transfers from central government that are agreed during the bud- getary process. As with the national budget more gen- erally, governments have systems in place for manag- ing these inter-governmental fiscal transfers. The ques- tion that should be asked therefore is not what does a system of \u2018climate finance\u2019 transfers look like; but rather, how should existing inter-governmental fiscal transfers be adjusted or complemented by additional dedicated funds given the impacts of climate change. The World Bank\u2019s 2007 guidance on inter-governmen- tal fiscal transfers notes that the assignment of respon- sibilities between the centre and local levels are broad- ly similar across countries: with central government typically assuming responsibility for national public goods (defense, foreign affairs, money and banking, national infrastructure, legislation); while local govern- ment structures provide local public goods and servic- es, including water and sanitation, local health and ed- ucation facilities, local roads and recreational facilities. It is unlikely that addressing climate change will necessi- tate a significant shift in how responsibilities for expen- ditures are assigned to different levels of government, but a shift in the aggregate size and geographical com- position of transfers from the centre may be required. This is because it is at a local level, where the effects of climate change are manifested.

The impacts of climate change are likely therefore to place a disproportionate strain on those services deliv- ered at the local level that respond to local needs. To maintain local services even at their existing standards may require additional resources over time as a result of the impacts of climate change. In recognition of the impacts climate change will have on local communi- ties, and the challenges in directing resources to them, the Nepal government has committed to channelling 80% of additional resources for expenditure on climate change to the local level (CDDE, 2011). The effects of climate change will also vary depending upon the geographical context: for some regions cli- mate change may bring with it benefits, while for oth- ers increased strain. In the interests of equity and fac- toring in the global discussions on climate justice, the size of funding for some regions may therefore need to be adjusted in order that those most vulnerable to climate change can access government support. Decisions on how to structure any adjustments to trans- fers will clearly be country and situation dependent: Energy Resources Development, 1.9% Energy Utilization and Conservation, 1.4% Oil Industry Management and Control, 3.6% Electric Power Industry Management and Control, 2.7% Renewable Energy, 5.0% National Biofuels Board, 1.4% ADB \ufb01nanced Energy E\ufb03ciency Project, 54.4% Other, 29.7% Figure 2: Composition of the 2012 Department of Energy Budget in the Philippines Source: Department of Budget and Management, The Phil- lipines, 2012 Budget Documentation for Department of Energy 16 Making Sense of Climate Finance It is worth noting though, that the need which transfers are addressing ought to shape the structure of grant used. Inter-governmental transfers can broadly be divided into two groups: the first are general purpose grants over which local governments have complete autonomy over how the grants are used. (WB 2007b) For climate change adaptation, the importance of re- sponding to the localized impacts of climate change might point to the importance of maintaining a high degree of autonomy on how those resources are used and as such increasing \u2018general purpose grants\u2019 may be more appropriate. Alternatively, with specific purpose grants, central gov- ernment provide conditions on what those grants can be used for. In the forestry sector, it is expected that large sums of international finance may potentially be mobilized to pay for mitigation, but this will be con- tingent upon the verified achievement of agreed local- ized Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) targets. To incentivize localities to achieve their respective targets, the Government of In- donesia is considering building upon their existing in- ter-governmental fiscal transfer system and introduc- ing a Regional Incentive Mechanism (Government of Indonesia, 2009). These specific purpose grants would be conditional on outputs, with payments linked to successful program implementation and measurable carbon reductions. How the projects are designed to achieve these targets would still be fully under the control of the local government. 17 Making Sense of Climate Finance 4. Managing international public finance for responding to climate change It is widely agreed that to adapt to and mitigate cli- mate change there is a need to mobilize increased fi- nance. Given the primary historical responsibility for increased greenhouse gas emissions to date lies with developed countries, it is incumbent upon those coun- tries to make additional finance available from public and private sources. There is however potentially a ten- sion between the need to mobilize additional resourc- es for climate change and the importance of a holistic, country-owned, whole of government approach to ad- dressing climate change that has been stressed in the previous section. At the recent 4th High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Busan, it was agreed that the principles of de- velopment effectiveness outlined in the Paris Declara- tion and the Accra Agenda for Action are also of con- siderable relevance to international public resources dedicated to supporting actions on climate change. Particular mention was made of the importance of country ownership, the use of country systems and the need to avoid fragmentation.

According to the OECD-DAC, Direct budget support is defined as a method of fi- nancing a partner country\u2019s budget through a trans- fer of resources from a donor to the partner govern- ment\u2019s national treasury. From a national perspective, once received, revenues from budget support are indistinguishable from do- mestically collected revenues. They would be allocated according to the national budget and then disbursed to line ministries through government\u2019s standard funding procedures. In this respect country ownership is high. Choosing to deliver finance through a budget sup- port operation provides donors with a clear avenue for engaging on climate change at a high level and par- ticularly on issues of policy coordination. There is Gen- eral Budget Support, but also Sector Budget Support in relevant sectors (e.g. EU Budget Support in Samoa for the Water Sector) or as is the case in Viet Nam Cli- mate Change Budget Support (see Box 4). The focus of engagement on policy dialogue and monitoring and evaluation varies accordingly. Where funds are channelled through the budget it can be more difficult to attribute measurable and verifiable impacts to specific funding streams. For example, the UK National Audit Office (2008) wrote in their assess- ment of budget support, specifically about aid, but also applicable to climate finance: Monitoring the impact of aid, and particularly bud- get support, is challenging given the weaknesses in developing country data and difficulties in attribut- ing changes to a particular type of aid such as bud- get support. 18 Making Sense of Climate Finance This is why conditions of disbursement are often linked to high-level policy actions and considerable emphasis is placed on the importance of policy dialogue, which brings with it its own significant transaction costs 4.1.2 Extra-Budgetary Funds In most countries in the region, there are a number of ex- tra-budgetary funds through which public resources are spent that impact upon climate change outcomes. Cer- tain funds have climate change mitigation or adaptation as core objectives (e.g. national climate funds, REDD+ funds); while other funds have been created where miti- gation or adaptation may be a secondary benefit (e.g. rural electrification funds, contingency funds). Extra-budgetary funds are created for a variety of rea- sons. In many cases, funds are formed at the request of donors, who wish their finances for climate change to be insulated from other financial flows in the bud- get. (ADB 1999) There are also numerous examples of extra-budgetary funds solely financed by domestic re- sources. In certain cases, this will be down to political reasons: by receiving earmarked revenues for a specif- ic program, the implementing agency has dedicated funds secured and can therefore bypass the annual process of budgetary negotiation and scrutiny (WB 2007a). Alternatively, there are also sometimes operational reasons why extra-budgetary funds are created. One of the key motivations is to avoid the \u2018annual rule\u2019. Nor- Box 4: Direct Budget support for Climate Change in Vietnam Source of Funds Vietnam has received commitments for approximately 220 million USD of concessional ODA loans provided through di- rect budget support to cope with climate change. Initially, in 2010, Japan and France committed a total of approximately 145 million USD and since that time, the World Bank has committed 70 million USD and CIDA an initial $4.5 million USD. It is expected that Korea\u2019s EXIM Bank and AusAID will also provide financing in the future. Administration Providers of finance to the budget support operation and other donors supporting government on climate change en- gage with the Vietnamese government through the Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). Allocation and delivery of finance Providing resources through the budget gives government full ownership of how resources are allocated and prioritized as part of the broader national budget procedures.

For example, the World Bank\u2019s monitored policy actions are aimed at: strengthening the scientific, analytical and technical basis for climate action and promoting an integrated approach for the financing of climate actions, including monitoring and reporting: E.g. \u201cEstablish implementation guidelines for allocation and reporting of financial resources directed at climate change action\u201d This is consistent with an approach that seeks to strengthen the governance of the response to climate change, the ef- fectiveness of which is more difficult to measure than mitigation-specific financial flows whose impact can be judged according to more clear criteria, i.e. the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

In some cases, these arrangements may not provide suf- ficient managerial flexibility (WB 2007a). For example, there are a number of extra-budgetary funds in the re- gion that have been created to promote and provide financing to private sector \u2018green investments\u2019 and are managed through extra-budgetary arrangements (e.g. the Thai Energy Conservation Fund and China CDM Fund). There are a number of examples of countries in the region putting in place National Climate Funds as a means of accessing international finance from mul- tiple sources to fund public expenditures related to climate change (see Box 5). The idea is that disburse- ments will be made to these funds, which are \u2018country- owned\u2019 and so governments will have full say over how financing is allocated (although in practise, many international financed NCFs currently have multilat- eral donors as intermediate trustees). These National Climate Funds typically have stand-alone governance arrangements that allocate resources to specific proj- ects implemented by ministries, local governments or in some cases non-state actors. These funds have been created for a number of rea- sons: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdNational Climate Funds can serve as a clear signal of government commitment to the issue of climate change. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdNational Climate Funds can serve as useful conduit for funding from international sources and aligning the contributions with government climate change policy, where donors are not willing to channel re- sources through the budget. This type of approach can help to foster harmonisation of donor proce- dures for reporting, budgeting, financial manage- ment and procurement, relative to each donor man- aging their funds separately (Flynn 2011). Box 5: Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Source of Funds In 2007, the European Union agreed to build a global Climate Change Alliance between the EU and the developing coun- tries that are likely to be hardest hit by climate change. Cambodia was selected to be a pilot country. UNDP supported an expansion of this vision by facilitating the participation of other donors, initially Sweden and Denmark. The Cambodia Climate Change Alliance (CCCA) was formally launched in February 2010 and receives financing of US$8.9 million with contributions from DANIDA (US$0.6 million), the European Union (US$3.2 million), SIDA (US2.1 million) and UNDP ($3.0 million). Administration of Funds As part of the CCCA programme, a CCCA Trust Fund was set up. The trust fund will be administered initially by UNDP, but it is envisioned that this arrangement will eventually be replaced by country systems, possibly a government-managed trust fund or direct budget support. Activities financed by funds The activities of the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance will also support the development of a National Climate Change strategy and Action Plan and support the mainstreaming of climate change into key priority sectors. It is expected that grants will be made to projects that are aligned with the 39 \u201cno regrets\u201d projects identified as priorities in the National Adaptation Programme of Action to Climate Change (NAPA). Four priority areas for adaptation are identi- fied in the NAPA: water resources management and agriculture, forestry, health, and the coastal zone.

(Flynn 2011). 4.1.3 Project-based Finance Project-based finance refers to funds directed to in- dividual projects or groups of projects that are part of a sector programme (GEF Evaluation Office, 2006). Where project based finance is to be disbursed to gov- ernment; donors and governments will typically agree upon the allocation of resources on a project by proj- ect basis prior to the financing agreement. Project-based finance shares many of the same char- acteristics as extra-budgetary funds in that allocations are determined outside of standard budgetary proce- dures (even if they might be recorded in the national budget and impact allocations within the budget). However, within each of these three modalities out- lined, there is considerable variation in the institutional arrangements by which they are managed: processes for donor coordination (e.g. programme based ap- proaches, sector wide approaches etc.); the conditions of payment (i.e. performance based payments as pro- posed for REDD+, conditionalities linked to policy ac- tions etc.); the use of country systems (i.e. the process- es for planning, procurement, reporting, accounting), systems for measurement, reporting and verification; all of these can vary considerably from fund to fund and project to project. Some of these variations will be considered in more detail in the next section. 4.2 Managing a range of funding modalities at the national level Despite commitments on the importance of country ownership, the majority of finance that is being pro- vided by international financiers is being channelled outside of the national budget. By keeping financing flows separate from other sources of ODA and domes- tic revenues, money dedicated to climate change can be more easily tracked from source through to use. This is particularly appealing to providers of climate fi- nance given the international pressure to demonstrate additional finance is being provided and also the re- quirements to measure and verify the impacts of the increased funds (Brown and Peskett 2011). There is however a real risk that as funding for climate change proliferates outside of the standard budgetary system, it could be perceived to be a problem to solely be addressed with those dedicated extra-budgetary fi- nancial flows. Further, as funding sources become frag- mented, there is a danger that the benefit of a unified view of how government resources are being allocated is lost, which can lead to gaps and overlaps in expendi- ture. The findings of the Bangladesh CPEIR are indica- tive in this regard: there is a proliferation of potential funding mechanisms, each with their own institutional arrangements, through which sector Ministries could potentially request additional financing (CDDE 2012) as shown in Figure 3. There are a number of approaches that donors and governments can take at a national level to manage and coordinate fragmented sources of funding. 4.2.1 Maximising the Use of Country Systems In Carter\u2019s 2008 literature review of putting aid on bud- get, she draws out three key principles of sound public expenditure management that could potentially be undermined by a proliferation of funds that bypass standard budgetary procedures. First budgets should be comprehensive, that is to say ideally all revenues and expenditures should be cap- tured in the budget in order that they are subject to the discipline of the resource allocation process, whereby trade-offs are made between the different ways finan- cial resources can be used. (World Bank, 1998) 21 Making Sense of Climate Finance Second budgets should be transparent so that de- cision makers have all relevant issues and information before them when they make decisions. It is difficult, for example, for Ministries of Planning and Finance to allocate resources strategically to climate change pro- grams if they do not have information on the alloca- tions of national climate funds. Third is the importance of accountability. It is vital that policy decision makers and implementing agents can be held to account by parliament and the wider public for the allocation and use of public resources: this is true both of funds managed through the bud- get and extra-budgetary funds. If for example, the gov- ernment manages an extra-budgetary REDD fund and planned transfers to local communities have not been made as projected, local communities will have an in- terest in knowing why. To mitigate the risks outlined to comprehensiveness, transparency and accountability, country systems should be used where possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ef80ecd-302f-4643-8702-ab06e5385ef7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ef80ecd-302f-4643-8702-ab06e5385ef7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e47ea00fff86772a94725ce8109a64af7fbafce288a604c2ac2505629a4ee76"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd176371-0aef-41e1-84d0-8924bc19379b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3fbad7f9a9a1eee612d41421175fe7f2df1f371fff942d71204cef6dbc57505"}}, "hash": "d804f6c0c20dedea2c068cdeffc6f7bf2a2b1eb0d9742b1951b3f1041746155c", "text": "Drawing from Mo- koro\u2019s 2007 analysis, Carter (2008) break down seven different ways that aid can be integrated into the na- tional budget cycle, which is also highly relevant for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2753729-4d3b-40f4-b49c-559b6f05fe3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2753729-4d3b-40f4-b49c-559b6f05fe3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e410a9f26f51e90dcf8c460fc802601c941ab6e9c4cc9a80138db814516b63f9"}}, "hash": "e410a9f26f51e90dcf8c460fc802601c941ab6e9c4cc9a80138db814516b63f9", "text": "cli- mate finance. As can be seen in Table 4, although bud- get support by definition uses more country systems, there is still considerable scope for extra-budgetary funds and projects to be more integrated. Certain financing modalities outlined will not be fully integrated into the budget: by definition, for exam- ple, extra-budgetary funds will not go \u2018through the budget\u2019. However, to minimize negative impacts on comprehensiveness, transparency and accountability, three general principles should be agreed upon for all financing: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdFirst of all funds should be \u2018on plan\u2019. For the host country to be able to comprehensively manage a range of funding modalities they need to be brought together in a country\u2019s strategic planning processes. In this vein, the Pilot Program for Climate Change Resilience only provides funds to programs of public and private sector investments already identified in existing national plans and strategies. To be eligible projects must either (i) provide technical assistance to build upon existing work to integrate climate risk and resilience into national planning and budgeting systems or (ii) provide additional financial resources to fund the building of climate resilience in programs (see Box 6). \u2022\ufffd \ufffdSecond, all funds should be \u2018on budget\u2019. There would be benefit in capturing the planned revenues and expenditures of all extra-budgetary funds in the budget documentation even if they do not follow standard budgetary procedures for appropriation. (ADB, 1999). Often budget documents are one of the most established mechanisms whereby parlia- ment, the press, civil society and communities can hold the executive to account. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdThird, all funds should be \u2018on accounting\u2019 and adopt the same expenditure classification system as the national budget. (ADB, 1999) This is particularly im- portant in a cross cutting issue like climate change if there is to be a \u2018whole of government approach\u2019 to Figure 3: Potential funding sources for activities related to climate change resilience in Bangladesh National Budget Domestic Revenues International Public Finance Sector Ministry Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) The Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) Direct Project Finance Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF ) Pilot Program for Climate Change Resilience 22 Making Sense of Climate Finance addressing the issues. If different classifications are being used from one fund to the next, it is very dif- ficult to get a transparent picture of how allocations and priorities are changing over time across govern- ment. Finally, extra-budgetary funds should continue to be reviewed over time. Routing funds through the na- tional budget should be the default option unless there continues to be strong reasons otherwise. As an emerging policy area, political visibility for climate change expenditure may be more important now than in five to ten years time. If an extra-budgetary fund is a good idea today, it does not necessarily mean it will be in the future. In practise, extra-budgetary funds tend to proliferate over time and are more easily created than withdrawn. 4.2.2 Coordination of financing The fragmentation of the international financing ar- chitecture is such that the public response to climate change in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region is likely to be financed by a diverse range of funding modalities. The core element of the public response to climate change will continue to be from funds allocated through the national budget, possibly including budget support. In addition, the close links between climate change adaptation in particular and sustainable development also mean that many actions on climate change will be financed through existing ODA funding streams. Further, as increasing flows of international finance become available, dedicated sources of \u2018climate finance\u2019 are also likely to play an ever greater role.

Where national governments do have considerable influence though is in thinking about how specific policy inter- ventions within national strategies may be best suited to financing from different available funding modali- ties (domestic or international) given the characteris- tics of those modalities. For example, on the adaptation side McGray et al. (2007) have noted with examples that dedicated cli- mate financing modalities typically finance activities that \u2018confront climate change\u2019 directly (e.g. reducing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods), where the im- pact of investments with respect to climate change is potentially most visible and easily measurable. On the other hand, ODA is more development focused and used to \u2018address drivers of vulnerability\u2019 (e.g. di- versification of livelihood strategies in areas vulner- able to flooding). Less money is forthcoming to \u2018build response capacity\u2019 (e.g. reforestation to reduce flood induced landslides) and to \u2018manage climate risk\u2019 (e.g. monitoring salinisation of drinking water). Box 6: Pilot Program for Climate Change Resilience in Cambodia Source of Funds US$105 million has been committed by the Asian Development Bank to undertake the PPCR, with US$50 million of grants being used to support \u2018soft\u2019 enabling investments and US$55 million of concessional loans for \u2018hard\u2019 infrastructure invest- ments. It is expected that further co-financing of US$299.4 million will be raised from ADB\u2019s and other donor\u2019s operations. Administration of Funds The funding for the PCCR is largely additional to ongoing and planned investments from the Asian Development Bank, as part of their conventional ODA lending program. It will continue to be administered through the existing project arrange- ments agreed between the Cambodian government and the ADB. Activities to be financed by funds Funds are primarily dedicated to sector and locality specific projects in three priority sectors: water, agriculture and in- frastructure. A fourth component is to build upon the pilot programs and support more generally the integration of con- cerns on climate resilience into the national development agenda.

This may be a useful tool for making the linkage be- tween public expenditures and climate change more visible across different funding modalities. Nepal, for example, has developed a budget code whereby de- velopment expenditures on climate change can be marked (see Box 7). This type of exercise may also pro- vide reassurance to providers of finance that any addi- tional money that is being disbursed is being allocated towards climate change activities. The Bhutan govern- ment has for example developed codes for climate change to track whether local grants being provided by UNCDF are being used for climate change related activities (UNCDF 2011). As an analytical input for policy review and informing budgetary allocations, such measures should be con- sidered with caution, because of the complex linkages between public expenditure and climate change that a budget classification cannot cover (e.g. a code for \u2018climate change expenditure\u2019 will not track the size of expenditures that have negative impacts on climate change). This type of exercise should also be managed carefully to avoid adding significant complexity to budget prep- arations. These are some possible guiding principles that policy makers might consider if trying to define \u2018climate-change\u2019 related expenditures: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdPolicy makers should be consistent in the defini- tions of climate change related expenditures and where possible avoid \u2018relabeling\u2019. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdHowever expenditure on climate change is defined, mechanisms for calculating expenditure on climate change should be commensurate with national capacity and budgeting systems. Overly complex means of calculating climate change related expen- diture should be avoided and they should, where possible, use existing budget classification systems to minimize transaction costs. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdIn order that expenditure related to climate change can be tracked across time, the definition of climate change related expenditures should be transparent. Box 7: Climate Change Budget Codes in Nepal The National Planning Commission (NPC) in Nepal con- ducted a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review in 2011 to better understand how actions on climate change were being financed. One of the recom- mendations of the review is that there would be benefit in introducing climate budget codes to assist in track- ing climate change related expenditures. As climate change related expenditures do not come under a single sector Ministry, it is not easy to see how the budget is reflective of climate change policy. The codes being introduced are expected to help delin- eate climate change related expenditures, to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the actions being financed and also to track whether funds are reaching the grass-roots level where most needed. The initial proposal drafted is that activities in the de- velopment budget will be defined according to their relevance to climate change with activities marked as \u2018highly relevant\u2019, \u2018relevant\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019.

Recommendations The key message of this paper is that while mobiliz- ing increased international resources is vital for ad- dressing climate change, an effective response to cli- mate change requires looking outside of dedicated \u2018climate finance\u2019 streams and the activities they fund and understanding how development priorities and public expenditure more generally impact upon cli- mate change. The national budget is the key linkage between the policy agenda and the public financing available and is therefore of fundamental importance for developing a coherent government response to cli- mate change. International finances need to be man- aged in such a way that it provides complementary support, rather than fragments the policy agenda on climate change. More specific recommendations are outlined below: \u2022\ufffd \ufffdWhen designing policies for climate change, gov- ernments and providers of finance may wish to consider the whole range of potential policy inter- ventions at their disposal. Enabling instruments in- cluding tax policy, regulations, and information pro- vision will have a key role in changing the behaviour of individuals, communities and businesses, as well as more visible infrastructure investments. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdIn attempting to shift behaviour away from \u2018busi- ness as usual\u2019, some of the discretionary resources identified in the budget framework can be dedi- cated to specific new climate change policy initia- tives. However, the impacts on climate change of all major new policy interventions and investments in key policy areas and sectors also ought to be con- sidered before those policies are incorporated in the budget. Institutions responsible for climate change should be involved in decisions over how dedicated resources for climate change might be allocated. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdA medium-term outlook for the budget can give", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a7cbed9-ae92-40f0-b03c-0a6b52c2d8d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a7cbed9-ae92-40f0-b03c-0a6b52c2d8d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Sense of Climate Finance", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3a6672eb7177f3b939d1524fe92f3dd72d1f848e7755526350cc74e1122acad"}, "3": {"node_id": "b82ddfd7-f640-4a80-b932-3212be8e3232", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-sense-climate-finance", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c27121a62d95cb4d554aa4bbc55862991b2a2d4bc2eb6d906e98a54c816c785"}}, "hash": "acff0b12c5a6a3e05aa3f5269b730e5886b9b25fb75705d8d91c36f75ab7b765", "text": "greater space for governments to shape the overall direction of spending patterns over time.

CPEIRs can be usefully comple- mented by further analysis on how fiscal and tax policies affect climate change. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdGovernments should use, and strengthen where necessary, budget classifications so that it is visible how budgets are being allocated to climate change policies within sectors. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdThe aggregate size of intergovernmental fiscal transfers may need to be increased upwards given that services delivered at a local level are likely to be disproportionately impacted. The geographical composition of transfers may also require revisiting over time, as the likely impacts of climate change will be dependent upon geographical context. The structure of transfers should take into account the need that is being met. Regional incentive mecha- nisms may be a useful tool for implementing REDD programs. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdA useful addition to budget documentation would be to dedicate a section to climate change that shows key new climate change policy initiatives in the budget across government that have been agreed with different implementing agencies and the budgetary allocations for those initiatives. Such a section could also highlight key new initiatives that have secondary benefits or costs from a climate change perspective. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdThe current proliferation of international funding mechanisms for climate change risks leading to a weakening of the budget process. To minimize the costs to comprehensiveness, transparency and ac- countability of the budget; it is important that coun- try systems are used wherever possible. Projects financed should be part of government strategic plans, the planned revenues and expenditures of extra-budgetary funding should be recorded in the budget documentation and the same expenditure classification system should be used as in the bud- get. \u2022\ufffd \ufffdTo prevent gaps and overlaps in expenditure emerg- ing as a result of the fragmented sources of finance, 26 Making Sense of Climate Finance coordination is needed.

The year 2010 is a critical milestone in the countdown to 2015, and at the UN MDG Review Summit which took place in September, heads of nations reafrmed their commitment to accelerate the progress towards achieving the MDGs by consolidating the lessons learned through the past 10 years of development experience. The Regional Initiative on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development of the Asia Pacifc Regional Centre, United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Millennium Campaign jointly produced this publication Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples to contribute to MDGs achievement taking into account indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development priorities. Our special thanks go to Rajat Khosla for drafting this publication. Approximately 370 million indigenous peoples around the world are characterised by a stark disparity from majority populations in levels of fnancial income, access to and enrolment in culturally pluralistic education, clean water, basic medical services, and political representation. Further, it is indigenous peoples who are at the frontlines of environmental degradation and climate change. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples cautions that this segment of the population will not be among the ffty per cent lifted out of extreme poverty unless and until immediate measures are taken to rectify the impacts of past development approaches that have increased marginalisation and dispossession. In order to prevent uneven and inequitable MDG attainment, development must be formulated and implemented with full and efective participation of indigenous peoples. This publication provides substantive basis for taking this bold step by placing human rights, equity and justice frmly at the centre of development.

Background and Context The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) constitute the unprecedented commitment of world leaders to address key development priorities through a set of specific goals and targets to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, ensure all boys and girls complete primary school, promote gender equality, improve the health of mothers and children, reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, protect the environment, and create a global partnership for development. In many developing countries, the MDG framework has brought different social groups to work towards the common development agenda. In this regard, UNDP and the UN Millennium Campaign continue to work with a wide range of constituencies to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs with particular attention to the vulnerable and marginalised population, including the indigenous peoples. There are over 370 million indigenous peoples in some 90 countries, living in all regions of the world. While they constitute 5 per cent of the world\u2019s population, indigenous peoples account for 15 per cent of the world\u2019s poor. Most indicators of well-being show that indigenous peoples suffer disproportionately compared to non-indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples face systemic discrimination and exclusion from political and economic power; they continue to be over-represented among the poorest, the illiterate, the destitute; they are displaced by wars and environmental disaster; dispossessed of their ancestral lands and deprived of their resources for survival, both physical and cultural; they are even robbed of their very right to life.1 Their levels of access to adequate health and education services are well below national averages, and they are also especially vulnerable to the consequences of environmental degradation.2 Indigenous peoples aspire to maintain and strengthen their institutions, cultures and traditions, and to promote their development in accordance with their aspirations and needs. Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination, and by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The dominant development discourse does not adequately respond to these aspirations and needs of indigenous peoples. Major development projects often do not take into account fundamental interests of indigenous peoples and result in violations of their human rights. Full, meaningful and effective participation of indigenous peoples in development is generally not being considered.3 It is this interpretation of development that many argue is responsible for worsening the state of indigenous peoples\u2019 poverty and pushing them into further marginalisation.4 Indigenous peoples have distinct and unique cultures and world views, and their development needs and aspirations may differ from the mainstream population. The indigenous peoples approach to development is based on the principles of respect for and preservation of land, natural resources and all elements of the natural environment; consensus in decision-making; mutual respect for peoples\u2019 values and ideology, including sovereignty over land, resources and 1 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), Division for Social Policy and Development, Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues: State of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples (2010). 2 UNPFII: \u201cIndigenous Peoples and the MDGs\u201d, UN Chronicle, No.4, 2007. 3 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples, UN Doc.

United Nations bodies apply four criteria to identify indigenous peoples: y they live within or maintain close attachments to geographically distinct ancestral territories; y they tend to maintain distinct social, economic, and political institutions within their territories; y they aspire to remain distinct culturally, geographically and institutionally rather than assimilate fully into national society; and y they self-identify as indigenous or tribal.5 Despite such common characteristics, there is no single definition of indigenous peoples that can fully capture their diversity. Indigenous peoples themselves do not believe a definition is necessary, and fear that this may result in exclusion of some groups. Self-identification as indigenous or tribal is recognised as fundamental\u2014specified in ILO Convention No. 169\u2014often in combination with other variables such as \u201clanguage spoken,\u201d and \u201cgeographic location or concentration.\u201d6 This concept is increasingly accepted as fundamental. 56 the environment under natural law.7 The emphasis is on recognition as distinct peoples, and development has to encompass the social, cultural, political and institutional dimensions of their identity and rights. This is not based on economic or monetary value, but on a holistic approach that incorporates the collective, spiritual and cultural values, and is shaped and informed by indigenous priorities for development. Equal worth and dignity of indigenous peoples can only be assured by recognition and protection of their individual and collective rights. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) emphasizes the need to adopt an integrated approach, which incorporates the close connections among issues of livelihood security, the environment, hunger and sustainable resource management. It also recognises the need to raise awareness of the MDGs and the impact on indigenous peoples to promote their participation in the process of monitoring achievement of the MDGs, such as the official MDG progress reports.

The Campaign goes beyond the aggregated data and focuses on policy and practice change at the national and sub-national levels. UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre\u2019s Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme (RIPP) and the UN Millennium Campaign have jointly developed this publication on the MDGs and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIPs) as a practical advocacy tool. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples is aimed at a global audience, and provides illustrative examples of direct experiences of indigenous peoples related to the MDGs across the world with particular focus on the Asia-Pacific region. The aim of this publication is to clarify the linkages between the rights of indigenous peoples and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its primary purpose is to outline a framework of analysis, identifying entry points to strengthen indigenous rights at the policy, programming and advocacy levels. The publication draws out key connections between each MDG goal and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and provides key recommendations for policy and practice change to promote the rights of indigenous peoples and accelerate the achievement of the MDGs. 2. The Millennium Declaration and the MDGs In September 2000, 189 world leaders adopted the Millennium Declaration. The Declaration sets out within a single framework the key challenges facing humanity at the threshold of the new millennium, outlines a response to the challenges, and establishes concrete measures for judging performance through a set of inter-related commitments, goals and targets on development, governance, peace, security and human rights. \u201cWe will spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for all internationally recognised human", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "521696f7-cab2-4fa7-914d-1cd9c6020885": {"__data__": {"id_": "521696f7-cab2-4fa7-914d-1cd9c6020885", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "MDG and Indigenous Peoples", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/mdg-and-indigenous-peoples", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d126d9333cc62ac34e9267fcb411b9326eadf12ac1a02d275824f63dce1300e7"}}, "hash": "d126d9333cc62ac34e9267fcb411b9326eadf12ac1a02d275824f63dce1300e7", "text": "rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development.

We are committed to making the right to development a reality for everyone and to freeing the entire human race from want.\u201d8 In recognition of the need to translate this commitment into action, the international community agreed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which consist of eight goals to be achieved between 1990 and 2015. The MDGs are the world\u2019s time-bound and quantified targets for addressing extreme poverty in its many dimensions\u2014income poverty, hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, and exclusion\u2014while promoting gender equality, education, and environmental sustainability.9 Goals 1 to 7 relate to poverty and hunger, child education, empowering women, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, and ensuring environmental sustainability. Goal 8 is focused on promoting global partnership especially in the areas of technological transfer, enhanced aid quantity and quality, debt relief, etc. and acknowledges that the other seven Goals can only be achieved through international cooperation. Goals 1-7 are therefore responsibilities of developing and developed countries, whereas Goal 8 puts forward the developed countries\u2019 responsibilities. 8 UN General Assembly, Resolution 55/2 UN Millennium Declaration, part V. 9 See http://www.undg.org for more details on the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 4 The MDGs are derived from the Millennium Summit commitments, and focus on human development.10 Since their adoption in 2001, the MDGs have dominated the development agenda and have provided much needed impetus to meet the needs of the world\u2019s poorest. Countries have to report on progress\u2014to the United Nations and the public\u2014on their efforts to implement the MDGs. There are 21 targets and over 60 indicators to measure progress. To spur on these efforts, at the 2005 United Nations World Summit, poor countries agreed to produce medium term national development plans focused on MDGs. These action plans will provide clear guidelines towards MDG attainment, including identifying gaps and challenges, as well as successes. Box 2: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Goal 1 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2 Achieve universal primary education Goal 3 Promote gender equality and empower women Goal 4 Reduce child mortality Goal 5 Improve maternal health Goal 6 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Goal 7 Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 8 Develop a global partnership for development 2.1 MDGs and Indigenous Peoples The Millennium Declaration describes key values and principles such as freedom, equality, and solidarity, which defines how the MDGs are to be achieved. Implementation of the MDGs in connection with indigenous peoples must therefore be understood within the broader context of the Millennium Declaration. Paying attention to needs and rights of indigenous peoples can improve strategies for achieving the MDGs, and reduce any potential for tensions.11 Globally, indigenous peoples\u2014in particular indigenous women and children\u2014are severely affected by poverty and hunger, illiteracy, malnutrition and ill health, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental degradation and development assistance, yet, they are not accorded sufficient attention of involvement in MDG-related processes. Along with all other segments of the population, indigenous peoples also have the right to benefit from the MDGs and fulfil the aspirations contained in the UN Millennium Declaration. In a majority of countries where indigenous peoples live, they lag behind other parts of the population in the achievement of these goals.12 The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) recently observed that \u201cindigenous issues are often absent from the Millennium Development Goals and poverty reduction processes and from the Millennium Development Goals reports and poverty reduction strategy papers.\u201d 10 UNDP, Human Rights and Human Development, 2005 11 World Summit Outcome, A/RES/60/1, 2005, para 127. 12 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

Owing to the cross-cutting nature of gender equality, it is also critical that gender perspectives be fully integrated into the implementation and monitoring of all the other objectives associated with the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs. There is a need to support the efforts of indigenous peoples to build, articulate and implement their visions of and strategies for development. The challenge is therefore to redefine approaches to the implementation of the MDGs so as to include the perspectives, concerns, experiences and world views of indigenous peoples.14 3. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007) On 13 September 2007, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the UN General Assembly.15 The Declaration is the most recent and comprehensive instrument addressing the rights of indigenous peoples, and was shaped through an intensive and inclusive process that covered over twenty years from the initial draft prepared by the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP) before being adopted by the General Assembly in 2007. It is the only international human rights instrument that was adopted with the substantive participation, and consent, of indigenous peoples from all continents of the globe. As described by Professor Erica Irene Daes, former chairperson-rapporteur of the WGIP: \u201cThe UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration) constitutes the most important development concerning the recognition and protection of the basic rights and fundamental freedoms of the world\u2019s indigenous peoples. It is the product of many years of work by many people, including in particular, many hundreds of indigenous people from all parts of the world. It reflects an 13 Ibid., para 5. 14 Report on the fifth session UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

It was adopted to address the historic injustices and centuries of colonisation and dispossession of their lands, territories and resources, thus preventing them from exercising, in particular, their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests.18 The right of indigenous peoples to exist as distinct peoples has been reiterated in the Declaration.

A/Res/61/295, 2007. 18 Ibid., preamble. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 7 Article 1 of the Declaration specifies that indigenous peoples have the right to full enjoyment, as a collective and as individuals, of all human rights under international human rights law. It prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples and promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them. Article 3 recognises the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples, and their right to freely pursue their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. Les Malezer, Chair of the Global Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Caucus \u201cWe emphasise once again that the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples contains no new provisions of human rights. It affirms many rights already contained in international human rights treaties, but rights which have been denied to the Indigenous Peoples. As Indigenous Peoples we now see a guarantee that our rights to self determination, to our lands and territories, to our cultural identities, to our own representation and to our values and beliefs will be respected at the international level. The Declaration does not represent solely the viewpoint of the United Nations, nor does it represent solely the viewpoint of the Indigenous Peoples. It is a Declaration which combines our views and interests and which sets the framework for the future. It is a tool for peace and justice, based upon mutual recognition and mutual respect.\u201d (At the adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the UN General Assembly, September 2007) Box 3: Rights in the UNDRIP The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples reaffirms indigenous peoples\u2019 right to fully enjoy as a collective and as individuals, all human rights and fundamental freedoms as recognised in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and other international instruments.19 The Declaration addresses, among others: y Individual and collective rights y Right to self-determination y Right to culture and identity y Right to land, territories and resources y Safeguards against relocation y Rights to education, health, employment and language y Right to determine development priorities y Right to free, prior and informed consent 19 UNPFII, Frequently Asked Questions: Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 2007. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 8 Box 4: Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples The Special Rapporteur, Prof. James Anaya, emphasizes that the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides the normative framework and is grounded on human rights principles. It synthesizes and builds upon preexisting norms and affirms these rights in the context of indigenous peoples\u2019 realities. The Declaration affirms core principles, such as the right to exist, rights to land, to equality, non-discrimination based on the essential idea that indigenous peoples have the right to exist as peoples and as communities with their own distinct cultures. Traditionally, the focus was on individual rights, the Declaration is a shift away from this thinking and recognises collective rights, including the right to self-determination. Indigenous peoples, through their international mobilisation efforts, have helped shape a new understanding of human rights. The UNDRIP posits a new model whereby indigenous peoples can coexist with other peoples, and are protagonists moving to change the system and bring in new innovations, new institutions and the increasing acceptance of multi-culturalism.20 20 A unique feature of the Declaration is that its implementation is clearly mentioned in the Declaration itself. Articles 41 and 42 place responsibility on States, UN organs and specialized agencies, including at the country level, and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to promote respect for and full realisation of the provisions of the Declaration. UNDRIPs Article 41 The organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system and other intergovernmental organisations shall contribute to the full realisation of the provisions of this Declaration through the mobilisation, inter alia, of financial cooperation and technical assistance.

To achieve full realisation of the rights contained in the Declaration, participatory approaches to indigenous issues, based on effective consultations and partnerships with indigenous peoples are essential. \u2018The Declaration, although far from being perfect, represents the world community\u2019s commitment towards redressing the historic injustices faced by indigenous peoples. 20 2nd Interactive Regional Dialogue on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the UN Mechanisms on the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Bangkok, December 2009, organized by UNDP-RIPP and OHCHR. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 9 The next battle for the world\u2019s indigenous peoples will be to secure full and effective implementation of these universal minimum standards for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights.\u201921 The international community increasingly recognises that special attention needs to be paid to the rights of indigenous peoples. This is due largely to the mobilisation and demands of indigenous peoples themselves. A number of international instruments address indigenous peoples\u2019 rights or include provisions relevant for them. The list of other relevant human rights norms and instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO Conventions concerning indigenous peoples, UN Conventions and Declarations, and Safeguard Policies of major international financial institutions (IFIs) concerning indigenous peoples, can be found in the Annex 2. 4. The Human Rights Based Approach to Development and Indigenous Peoples The human rights-based approach to development is firmly based on human rights standards and principles. It recognises that structural inequalities exists within society and uses a human rights framework to empower people to claim their rights and hold duty-bearers accountable. It promotes the active and meaningful participation of rights-holders throughout the development process and advocates for non-discrimination with particular emphasis inclusion of marginalised and disadvantaged groups. Drawing on this framework, indigenous peoples have demanded respect for their right to participate equally in development processes and lobbied to ensure that development programmes being pursued that affect their lives and livelihoods follow a human rights-based approach. Indigenous peoples around the world are characterized by inequality in income, education, access to basic public services (e.g., clean water, food, shelter and health) and political representation. The achievement of the MDGs, particularly through their clear incorporation into the mid- term national development plan, as well as of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), is therefore particularly important for indigenous peoples.22 Indigenous peoples economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights are recognised by the international human rights framework and in particular have been specifically articulated in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to ensure that the historical inequalities faced by indigenous peoples are addressed and their priorities reflected including in national development plans. The need to operationalise a human rights-based approach to development has been emphasized by indigenous groups at international conferences and forums, and is also reflected in the reports of the Special Rapporteur.23 This approach is premised on the understanding that development should enable people to live in dignity and attain highest standards of humanity guaranteed by international human rights law. A human rights-based approach is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promotion and protection of human rights.24 21 John B. Henriksen: The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: Some Key Issues and Events in the Process in Making the Declaration Work (IWGIA 2009) at p. 83. 22 The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII) has consistently raised the issue of inclusion of indigenous peoples in development processes; the need for a human rights-based approach to development; and for indigenous peoples to be included in the monitoring mechanisms for the MDGs and PRSPs. 23 For example see, Reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, UN Doc.

It also provides an opportunity for UNDP to restate its commitment to support those efforts within the context of the human development agenda, with its focus on allowing people to develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in dignity and in accordance with their needs and interests. Despite their rich cultures and identities, indigenous peoples are often among the most marginalised populations in society, deprived of access to health care, education and participation in processes that affect their future. They also face dispossession of their traditional lands and livelihoods and destruction of their belief systems and language. Indigenous peoples are also disproportionately represented among those at risk of not achieving the Millennium Development Goals. As an organisation that supports a human rights-based approach to development, UNDP is committed to involving indigenous peoples in achieving the MDGs and in promoting their basic rights to lands and resources, culture and identity, and self-determination.\u201d (Message on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, August 9, 2008) United Nations Agencies agreed on the UN Common Understanding on the human rights- based approach in 2003. A number of essential attributes of a human rights-based approach to development that includes the following elements: y As development policies and programmes are formulated, the main objective should be to fulfill human rights. y A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. y Principles and Standards derived from international human rights treaties should guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process.25 The human rights-based approach highlights that the process of development is as important as the outcomes, and seeks to ensure that people who are affected by development interventions have a say in decisions which affect them and their communities. The human rights-based approach to development requires that development processes seeking to expand the choices and freedoms of people also adopt principles of equality and non-discrimination with particular attention to disadvantaged groups, participation and inclusion, and accountability and rule of law. Indigenous peoples have supported the human rights-based approach to development because it recognises the power imbalances and hierarchies that exist in societies and seeks to ensure that marginalised groups are able to actively participate in development processes. For example, the principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is very much grounded in the human rights- 25 Ibid., p. 15-16. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 11 based approach principles of participation, accountability and transparency. Free, active and meaningful participation is necessary for all development interventions so that communities can take a lead in defining their own priorities. In light of the human rights-based approach principles of participation and accountability as well as the principle of FPIC, development programmes proposed within indigenous territories must fully inform the community about the positive and negative impacts of the interventions so that indigenous communities can make an informed decision as to whether to consent to the projects or not.26 5. Identifying Synergies between the MDGs and UNDRIPs There are wide-ranging and deep linkages between MDGs and rights of indigenous peoples as seen in the table below.

Poverty, Hunger and Indigenous Peoples (Goal 1) There are more than 370 million people in the world who are indigenous\u2014belonging to more than 5,000 indigenous groups in some 90 countries.31 It is estimated that whereas indigenous peoples represent 5 per cent of the world\u2019s population, they represent 15 per cent of the world\u2019s poorest people.32 Despite being among the poorest, indigenous peoples in many countries may not be included in the one-half of the people lifted from extreme poverty by 2015.33 \u201cIndigenous women throughout the world are among the most marginalised groups, suffering discrimination not only on the basis of gender, but also on the basis of race, culture and class as well [\u2026]. Top down and paternalistic approaches to development have provided a social and economic environment whereby indigenous women have suffered from the effects of poverty, the breakdown of traditional social mechanisms and institutions, violence and militarization, dislocation and migration, and the depletion of their natural environment and resources\u201d. (UNFPII 3rd Session 2006) Indigenous poverty is multi-dimensional, highlighting the process of impoverishment caused by dispossession of indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands, loss of control over their natural resources and indigenous knowledge, and their forced assimilation into the mainstream society and integration in the market economy.34 Conventional economic indicators used to measure poverty do not always reflect true extent of indigenous poverty.35 There is a need to incorporate indigenous peoples\u2019 own definitions and indicators of poverty in the PRSPs. Further, lack of up-to- date, disaggregated data on indigenous peoples is increasingly recognised as a major obstacle in addressing their poverty.

The traditional practices, customs and traditions of indigenous peoples are tied to their lands, territories and resources, an integral part of their distinctive culture. The Inuit whose food and livelihood depends on hunting and fishing, the Saami and their reindeer herding, the pastoralists of East Africa\u2014for whom cattle ranging is an integral custom and a source of food and income, the Karen and the Jummas with their rotational agriculture, are a few examples of this.39 The importance of the control of peoples over natural resources is included in many instruments including the ICESCR and the ICCPR, while specific reference to the rights of indigenous peoples in relation to natural resources pertaining to their lands is found in the UNDRIPs and in ILO Convention 169. Further, the Declaration of Atitl\u2019an, adopted at the first Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Global Consultation in 2001, on the right to food and food security, has also articulated the cultural aspect of food, water and means of subsistence. Many studies confirm that poverty and extreme poverty among indigenous communities can be traced back to colonisation and the continued and systematic discrimination and denial of recognition of individual and collective rights of indigenous peoples.40 Internal colonisation perpetuated by states aimed at assimilating indigenous groups undermined their autonomy and local sovereignty and further perpetuated poverty among these groups.41 Legislations such as those relating to land and natural resource management have ignored indigenous peoples\u2019 systems and practices and have contributed to the chronic poverty among indigenous peoples.42 36 Note on SPFII\u2019s work on Indicators Regarding Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Well-Being, Poverty and Sustainability, 22/9/2009, (on file with author). 37 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 16 Further, the debt burden is also a major factor exacerbating indigenous peoples\u2019 poverty. Many governments exploit indigenous areas by bringing in extractive industries (such as mineral, oil, gas) in an attempt to raise revenue to pay off debt. Such enterprises further push indigenous peoples into a vicious cycle of poverty. Box 6: Land and Resource Rights in the Orissa Tribal Development Project In India one of the first projects which dealt with securing land and resources rights was the Orissa Tribal Development Project. It had a component for land surveying which regularized tilling of lands with slopes above 10 degrees. Land settlement schemes led to the distribution of 17,175 dongar (hill) lands to the 6837 tribals. Titles were provided to the spouses and these were registered in the names of wife and husband. Their collective rights over community and forest land were also recognised. This was done even before passage of Panchayat Raj Act in 1996. This Act gives the rights of ownership of minor forest products to the respective Gram Sabhas and is inclusive of all the reserved forest areas since it is applicable to all scheduled areas.

When the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) was created in 1961 one of its objectives was to protect the food supplies of the existing San population in the area. The government of Botswana relocated the San to permanent settlements within the reserve, where services like water, education and health care were promised.

Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning. 2. Indigenous individuals, particularly children, have the right to all levels and forms of education of the State without discrimination. 3. States shall, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, take effective measures, in order for indigenous individuals, particularly children, including those living outside their communities, to have access, when possible, to an education in their own culture and provided in their own language. The rate of illiteracy among indigenous peoples is usually higher than other groups.43 Accessing good quality education is particularly difficult for indigenous children. There are several interrelated obstacles such as distance to schools, differences in lifestyles, nomadic and semi- nomadic communities, discrimination, violence, extreme poverty and exclusion.44 Further, isolation is a major obstacle that prevents indigenous peoples from enjoying their right to education.45 According to UNPFII any efforts to achieve the MDG 2 are likely to fail if impartial and effective implementation of culturally sensitive educational programmes and curricula addressing the needs of indigenous peoples are not undertaken.46 \u201cEducation is an effective means leading to equality, freedom and quality of life. Education principles must ensure non-discrimination (on the basis of race, ethnicity, culture, sex, age, disability or religion). Education can also be an effective means to protect the cultural traditions of Indigenous Peoples. Education, when it is culturally appropriate, promotes mother tongue learning and includes knowledge in the curriculum, can help defend against the negative impacts of cultural globalization. Education is a crucial right for indigenous women and girls\u201d. (UNPFII 3rd session, 2004) UDHR, ICERD, ICESCR, CRC, UNESCO Convention on Elimination of Discrimination in Education, and ILO Conventions reiterate the MDG 2 goal, \u201cAchieve universal primary education: ensure all boys and girls complete primary school\u201d, especially indigenous children. Education is one of the most important tools for combating prejudice and discrimination. National curricula however frequently ignore the cultures, treaties, spiritual values of indigenous peoples and reinforce stereotypes. Seventeen Latin American countries recognise the indigenous peoples\u2019 right to intercultural, bilingual education. Educational outcomes of pupils in indigenous schools however, tends to be inferior to pupils in other institutions. This is a result of lack of required institutional, technical, academic and financial support to the bilingual intercultural education.47 43 Ibid., p. 62. 44 Report on the fourth session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

Particular attention shall be paid to the rights and special needs of indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities in the implementation of this Declaration. 2. States shall take measures, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, to ensure that indigenous women and children enjoy the full protection and guarantees against all forms of violence and discrimination. Indigenous women face multiple forms of discrimination, based on gender and race/ethnicity and poverty.55 Violent conflicts and militarization further affect the lives of indigenous women and their families and communities, causing violations of their human rights and displacement from their ancestral lands.56 Indigenous women are one of the most marginalised groups in many countries, being victims of serious acts of discrimination and flagrant violations of their fundamental rights.57 In certain communities, indigenous women have often been kept in a situation of dependency. They have been marginalised, refused access to land or subjected to other forms of discrimination. For instance, in patriarchal society, a woman has to leave her natal home after marriage and work for her husband and his family. Consequently, parents are reluctant to send their daughters to school or to pursue higher education because this is not considered beneficial or productive. Each time that these situations are reproduced gender disparity in educational attainment of indigenous men and women increases.58 In indigenous communities, women have taken on the great responsibility of transmitting traditional knowledge, skills, and intangible heritage from one generation to the next, however when foreign values are introduced, this conception is severely affected or even destroyed. As a result, there is a negative impact on the relationship between men and women, as well as on women\u2019s role within their communities. Whereas there has been some improvement in the ratio of girls to boys in primary schools among indigenous peoples, the rate of dropouts and repetitions remain higher among girls. At the secondary school level, there are widespread disparities, whereby families prioritize the education of boys over girls.59 While indigenous women and girls are important as traditional knowledge holders, they have at the same time been particularly disadvantaged in formal education systems.60 The UNDRIPs and the Beijing Declaration stress the need to address the vulnerable situation of indigenous women. Indigenous women, while sharing many of the concerns in the areas of poverty, human rights, and economic and social development with other women throughout the world, also offer a distinct and important perspective on these issues, which should be a central premise for the design of policies and programmes for implementation of the MDG 3. 55 IANGWE, Indigenous Women and United Nations: Good practices and lessons learned, 2006. 56 Report on the third session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 22 There are significant disparities between the health of indigenous peoples and that of the non- indigenous population in many countries around the world.63 Indigenous peoples tend to die younger and generally live in poorer health than other population groups. In some jurisdictions, they are more likely to have chronic disorders such as diabetes, high blood pressure or arthritis, and are more prone to substance abuse, depression and other mental disorders. HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are spreading rapidly in indigenous communities, a trend fuelled by factors including social and economic exploitation of indigenous women, as well as a lack of access to health-related information. Infant, child and maternal mortality rates in many indigenous communities are significantly higher than among non-indigenous groups.64 Indigenous peoples\u2019 wellbeing cannot be measured using health indicators, such as disease and treatment, for indigenous peoples wellbeing is distinct and also include physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. The social determinants therefore play a crucial role in determining indigenous health. These determinants include cultural factors, such as loss of language, loss of connectivity to the land, and other factors primarily linked to indigenous identity.65 Box 11: Global Snapshots on Health of Indigenous Peoples Diabetes: Worldwide, more than 50 per cent of indigenous adults suffer from Type 2 diabetes \u2014a number predicted to rise. In some regions of Australia, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have a diabetes prevalence rate as high as 26 per cent, which is six-times higher than in the general population. Tuberculosis: In the United States, a Native American is 600 times more likely to contract tuberculosis. Living conditions: In Rwandan Twa households, the prevalence of poor sanitation and lack of safe, potable water were respectively seven-times and two-times higher than for the national population. Reproductive health: For indigenous peoples in Viet Nam, more than 60 per cent of childbirths take place without prenatal care compared to 30 per cent for the Kinh population, Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic majority. Suicide: Among Inuit youths in Canada, suicide rates are among the highest in the world, at eleven-times the national average.

Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 23 Some governments have adopted policies with the aim of \u201cclosing the gap\u201d with respect to disparities in human development indicators between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. The impact of these initiatives so far has been low. 40 per cent of indigenous population in Latin America lacks access to basic health services, and the huge differences in health status between the indigenous and non-indigenous population persist. Indigenous children continue to display extraordinarily high malnutrition rates.66 Health of indigenous peoples is affected by multiple factors such as low income levels, and by low availability of safe water, food, sanitation and access to health services. One of the main threats to their health is the destruction of their habitat, which also provides them with spiritual and material sustenance. According to WHO acculturation and the loss of cultural cohesion also have deleterious impact on their health.67 Discrimination, as well as costs, may also prevent them from seeking basic health care, which is especially problematic in the context of the HIV/AIDS crisis. In some cases, indigenous peoples have purposely isolated themselves to try to maintain their traditional cultures and practices.68 There is a lack of reliable data with respect to the true level of HIV infection among indigenous peoples. Relationship to land, poverty, geographical isolation, marginalisation, different demographics, different understanding of health and medicine and low levels of participation in political and policymaking processes, are considered by UNAIDS as key factors affecting the impact of HIV epidemic on indigenous populations. The absence of reliable data about HIV infection in indigenous populations has sometimes made it more difficult for concerns about the impact of the HIV epidemic on indigenous peoples to be given priority in national and international policy agendas. ILO Convention No. 169 stresses that health services should be community-based, and planned and administered in cooperation with the peoples concerned, taking into account their traditional preventive care healing practices and medicines. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health has specifically called for the governments and other actors to ensure participation in the formulation, implementation and monitoring of health policies and programmes. UNDRIPs Article 23 explicitly connects health to self-determination. Participation of indigenous peoples in decisions affecting their own health entails greater respect for the use of traditional medicines and healing practices on the part of formal health systems, training of indigenous health workers, the use of indigenous languages in transmitting health information, and creating accountability towards indigenous communities for policy and programmes that affect their health, including displacement of communities from their land.69 Indigenous women around the world suffer from serious deterioration of health conditions within their communities. The rate of maternal mortality is alarmingly high among indigenous women. Health needs of indigenous women are particular to their ethnicity and gender, and therefore they may be different from the ones of other women and male members of indigenous communities.70 Inadequate and limited access to health services, lack of culturally appropriate approaches to 66 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, UN Doc.

In a recent judgment the Inter-American Court held that the authorities were responsible for the deaths of 18 Sawhoyamaxa children because of their failure to provide preventive medical care. The Court called on the authorities to provide regular medical care and appropriate medicines. Despite this, preventable deaths among the Yakye Axa and Sawhoyamaxa continue; more than 27 deaths have been reported since the judgements were issued in 2005 and 2006. An agreement has now been reached with the authorities for health care to be provided locally, so that members of the indigenous communities do not have to travel over 200 km to the capital for health services. Access to emergency services and free medicines remains inadequate and local volunteer health promoters lack adequate training and materials. (Source: \u2018We are only asking for what is ours\u2019: Amnesty International 2009) Many indigenous peoples have a rich and sophisticated health care system that is based on traditional cultures and environment, perfected over many centuries of practice, trial and error. Some of these practices are gaining recognition as carrying tremendous benefits, of not carrying adverse side effects, and being environmentally sound. In addition, many indigenous communities are reluctant to trust more modern health practices, and prefer to rely on traditional health carers. According to UNDRIPs and international human rights law, indigenous peoples have the right to specific measures to improve their access to health services and care as well as the underlying determinants of health. These services should be culturally appropriate, taking into account traditional preventive care, healing practices and medicines.73 71 Report on the third session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN Doc.

Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 25 Box 13: Indigenous Health in Australia The 2005 Social Justice Report considers progress in achieving improvements in the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. According to the report both chronic and communicable diseases are recorded at much higher rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities than in non-indigenous communities. Chronic conditions include heart disease, diabetes and cancers. The causes of chronic conditions are believed to include: poor fetal and child health; poor diet throughout the lifecycle; smoking and alcohol misuse; a lack of access to primary health care\u2014which is important in the detection and early prevention of chronic conditions\u2014and social stress. Communicable diseases, such as trachoma and tuberculosis, are linked to overcrowding and poor sanitation in living conditions. The report points out that a major and underlying cause of health inequality is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples do not have an equal opportunity to be as healthy as non- indigenous Australians in two key areas: namely primary health care and health infrastructure. They do not enjoy equal access to primary health care and health infrastructure, which includes: safe drinking water, supplies of healthy food, effective sewerage systems, rubbish collection services and healthy housing. Without effectively addressing these underlying causes of health inequality, disease or condition-focused programmes are not likely to result in sustainable changes. The report makes key recommendations for achieving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health equality within a generation. Importantly they require the governments of Australia to commit themselves towards achieving equality of health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous people within 25 years.

The Peruvian rainforest is the biggest stretch of the Amazon outside Brazil. As the Earth\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, the Amazon plays a critical role in safeguarding global climate. This crucial global ecosystem has been threatened in recent decades by the industrial activity in the region. It is feared that this will have devastating effects on Peruvian rainforest and its people, and will also have repercussions for the global climate. The legislation has been declared unconstitutional and is being debated again in the Peruvian Congress. (Source: www.ens-newsservice.com/en) Land has material, cultural and spiritual dimensions for indigenous peoples and, through their profound understanding they have managed their territories sustainability for generations. In order to survive as distinct peoples, indigenous peoples and their communities need to be able to own, conserve and manage their territories, lands and resources on the basis of their collective rights, therefore protection of their collective right to lands, territories and natural resources must be given a priority.75 Indigenous women and men both offer unique perspectives which takes into account traditional knowledge and awareness of the environment. Indigenous peoples\u2019 societies generally view gender as complimentary and egalitarian, where each role is defined but complimentary to each other. For instance, indigenous men may focus on cultivation and indigenous women may plant and gather the food, so both roles are necessary and complimentary in the holistic relationship of the family/community. Traditionally, both indigenous women and men had equal access to lands, animals and resource use, which was more beneficial to the collective. However, since the integration and assimilation into dominant cultures and introduction of the idea of individual ownership, indigenous peoples, in particular women, experience fewer opportunities to access their natural resource and lands. Gender relations within indigenous communities have been changing alongside the transformation that their own environment has undergone, especially in the face of colonisation.76 Indigenous peoples have been at the frontline of the climate change crisis. The Inuit people for instance have been affected by large-scale melting in their traditional Arctic territories which was also the subject of a recent petition lodged by the Inuit Circumpolar Conference with the 75 UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Resource Kit on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Issues, 2008, p .14-16. 76 UNFPII Briefing note Gender and Indigenous Peoples Environment, available at http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/ women.html Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 27 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights against the United States of America.77 Indigenous peoples have also been affected by the reduction of water reserves throughout the world, threatening their survival.78 \u201cClimate change-related impacts have a range of implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights inter alia, the right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the right to adequate housing, the right to self-determination and human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Recalling that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, the Council recognises that the effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by those segments of the population who are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status and disability.\u201d (Preamble of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution No. 10/4, 25 March 2009) Box 15: Climate Change Impact in the Arctic Evidence of climate change is being seen right now in indigenous communities in the Arctic.

Several other articles within the Declaration also recognise a number of related rights, including the right to free and informed consent prior to approval of interventions affecting their lands. 77 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, UN Doc. A/ HRC/4/32, 2007, para 50. 78 Ibid, para 51. Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples 28 However, this recognition has not been translated into an improvement of conditions for indigenous peoples. In the name of development or free trade, mining, oil and gas developments, plantations and the like, encroach on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories and make their life and survival increasingly difficult.79 The UNDG Guidelines on Indigenous Peoples (February 2008) states: \u201cIndigenous peoples\u2019 lands have been disproportionately affected by national development activities because they often contain valuable natural resources including timber, minerals, biodiversity resources, water and oil, among others\u201d. It is feared by many that unless efforts are made to integrate indigenous peoples\u2019 perspectives, the programmes and policies aimed at meeting the targets laid down for the MDGs could in fact have harmful effects on indigenous peoples.80 Box 16: Sinking Islands in the Pacific Many island states in the Pacific region are affected by rising sea levels due to climate change. The threats of climate change have severely affected the ability of island ecosystems to maintain a healthy environment for the enjoyment of indigenous peoples. The effects of climate change include high tides which flood causeways linking villages, forcing cars, buses and trucks to drive through seawater. This has been particularly noticeable in Kiribati and a number of other small Pacific island nations that according to experts could drown during this century. High tides and stormy seas have also caused problems recently in the Marshall Islands, Cook Island, Tuvalu and low-lying islands of Papua New Guinea (PNG). Migration according to reports will become a major issue as flooding (due to rise in sea level) forces families to move from their homes. For example, the people living in PNG\u2019s Bougainville\u2019s atoll island of Cartaret have asked to be moved to higher ground on the mainland. Also the people of Sikaiana Atoll in the Solomon Islands have been migrating away from their atoll, primarily to Honiara, the capital. Further, warmer temperatures have led to the bleaching of the Pacific Island\u2019s main source of survival\u2014the coral reefs. Bleaching occurs when reef-building corals, reacting to stress such as warmer waters, loosen the algae that help feed them. Because the algae give them colour, the starved corals look pale, thus the term \u201cbleaching\u201d. Continued bleaching ultimately kills corals. Reef-building corals provide most of the primary productivity of coral reefs and an important shelter for the coral reef organisms. Reduction of abundance and diversity of reef-building corals is thus very likely to have a major influence on the surrounding biodiversity. Agriculture in the Pacific region, especially in small island states, is becoming increasingly vulnerable due to heat stress on plants and salt water incursions. Hence, food security is of great concern to the region.
