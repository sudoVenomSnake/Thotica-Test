Based on previous IUCN red-listing exercises for South African birds, the formal and informal criteria applicable for down-listing (in no particular order) are: \u2022 Quantified evidence that the population is increasing in numbers nationally and regionally throughout its range. \u2022 Quantified evidence that the population is expanding nationally and regionally throughout its range. \u2022 Evidence that appropriate measures have been put in place to support increased protection nationally. \u2022 Country-based empirical evidence to support national down-listing throughout the species' range states (may not apply to regional down-listing, will apply to outside RSA). \u2022 National signatories (DEA) to support the down-listing throughout the region \u2013 potentially as an outcome of a biodiversity management plan (BMP). \u2022 Evidence of healthy levels of genetic diversity within and among populations within and among range states. This will be conducted by ongoing sub-sampling site evaluation of heterozygosity and allelic diversity based on sites chosen from a genetic diversity heat map produced for the species. Goals 1. Increase population nationally and regionally throughout its range-states. 2. Expand population nationally and regionally throughout its range-states. 3. Measures put in place to reduce threats and support increased protection nationally. 4. Country-based evidence to support national down-listing throughout the species' range-states (may not apply to regional down-listing, will apply to out of RSA). 5. National signatories (DEA) to support the down-listing throughout the region. 6. Assess and maintain genetic fitness within and between populations. 27 Actions (numbers in brackets relate to goals above) a) Whenever a group is found without juveniles, attempt to find a nest site and, if no nest found, supplement artificial nest (1 & 2). (All field workers, MGHP to provide nests) b) Monitoring of nest activity and breeding success (1 & 2). (All fieldworkers) c) Implement actions from the risk assessment and threat reduction group (Group 3) (1 & 2). (Project Thunderbird) d) Encourage and implement custodianship of groups and monitoring of populations (3). e) Implement monitoring for detection of population change, positive and negative, to inform adjustments to management plans (3). f) Education, awareness and educational reinforcement (3). g) Community and cultural support (3). h) Incorporate information and outputs from range-states group (Group 2) (4) (MGHP). i) Collate existing evidence into a BMP (Biodiversity Management Plan) to be implemented by government (5). (All PT) j) Molecular evidence that shows that there is population fitness e.g. genetic diversity is assessed and monitored to indicate genetic viability and fitness within and between populations (6). k) Conservation genetics map of fine-scale population structure for South Africa (NZG, MGHP, FIAO). l) Additional occurrence data is required (preferably as point data but pentad scale data will suffice as this is consistent with SABAP 2). It is imperative that groups are reported as groups and individuals as individuals (1 & 2). (MGHP to collaborate with EKZNW for finalisation of their monitoring plan and the implementation of this approach in then taking other provinces) m) SOPs and a national plan for harvest, rearing and reintroduction is required (2), with targets and defined activities. This will be derived from the MCDA to be held after the BMP has been established or to be done concurrently. Most of the protocols are already completed and MGHP will prepare a reintroduction plan according to the IUCN Reintroduction Guidelines. 2. What data are needed to feed into the evidence underpinning the above? What are the gaps? Who will provide the data and who will fill the gaps? New data have been processed/analysed, primarily in the form of six PhD theses. Actions a) Key data on community protection and the role of cultural relevance for the SGH should be extracted from the literature collated and expanded, and incorporated within the MGHP education awareness and cultural programmes. (MGHP, WLTP, CNCZ to undertake). b) Protocol and guideline documents have been developed for many of the activities above.

These features, together with cooperative breeding and other complex social structures, combine to produce naturally slow rates of breeding and recruitment (Purvis et al., 2000). Added to this, the species face a number of anthropogenic threats (BirdLife International, 2017), each growing in scale as human development expands across sub-equatorial Africa. As a consequence, population declines of SGH have already been reported for Kenya (BirdLife International, 2014), Malawi (Kalimira, 2007), Mozambique (Parker, 1999, 2005), Zambia (BirdLife International, 2014), Zimbabwe (Chiweshe, 2007; Maasdorp, 2007; Witteveen et al., 2013), Botswana, and Swaziland (Parker, 1994), with declines best enumerated and most dire for South Africa (Kemp & Webster, 2008; Underhill, 2014; Taylor & Kemp, 2015) and Namibia (Simmons et al., 2015). The IUCN Red List status of SGH is Vulnerable (BirdLife International, 2014) but in the south of the range, the species is regionally listed as Endangered (Simmons, Brown & Kemper, 2015; Taylor & Kemp, 2015). Considering the decline in many areas, it must be assumed that conservation efforts, such as those currently underway in South Africa (Theron, Turner & de Waal, 2007) and Zimbabwe (Witteveen et al., 2013), will be required on an increasing scale across the sub-equatorial range. The SGH has been reported in sixteen range-states: South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, Angola, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, with one record for Zanzibar (Kemp, 1995) and one for Lesotho (D. Maphisa, pers. comm.). Coarse range-distribution maps are needed, based on historical, mostly museum-specimen localities, including that for the other Bucorvus species that occurs north of the equator. The SGH and the Northern (Abyssinian) Ground-Hornbill B. abyssinicus have been shown to be parapatric (Sanft, Wermuth, Mertens, Hennig, 1849; Snow, 1978; Kemp, 1995) (Figure 2.1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8e2200a-b772-48c6-b546-811a55d010b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8e2200a-b772-48c6-b546-811a55d010b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d9c0e3f7e38251ce7900f2036c5f2ca0d9e9d019183290499fc496e424d47eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfc1750f-88a1-4555-8ade-0be4f2ce2225", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71d799c2486f44a1e94f70fee775c76ec134fbd359485be15a31de00c046a4f2"}}, "hash": "a9cf2b031dbc74c9f6c5d4a1aea9447c4703d1dc74a14ef90fd8d94462b5c1bd", "text": "The area of range overlap in southern Kenya and Uganda is small (Musila, 2007; Odull & Byaruhanga, 2009), with each species essentially found on either side of the equator and overlap attributed to dispersal rather than breeding individuals (Kemp, 1995), with B. abyssinicus restricted to dry grasslands in northwest Kenya and B. leadbeateri found in moister rangelands in the southwest (Musila, 2007).

The main source of distribution data has been from a one-off atlas initiative, with only the Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP) able to provide replicate atlas data to allow for analysis of range change, and thus the ability to assess population trends. Threat analysis has, to date, consisted of expert opinion, with no known data collection to support this. For some range-states expert opinion however has led to conflicting views on population trends. Goals, cost benefits & actions 1. Find the right people in each range state to implement monitoring and conservation initiatives. Short-term objectives \u2022 Reach out to government and non-governmental agencies (e.g. Birdlife Partners) to gather recommended contacts per country. \u2022 Initiating a network of support (e.g. IUCN Hornbill Specialist Group). Long-term objectives \u2022 A functioning network of people across range-states who will champion the species, and has the relevant backing of authorities. \u2022 Provide ongoing support in terms of grants and research methodologies. 31 Cost-benefit analysis Creating a network of partners will be a good way of sharing information. In many of the range states resources are limited, and effectiveness of partners may be restricted due to work load and resource availability. This can be ameliorated by supporting the access of international funds for additional staff and resources. The only initial cost will be the outreach to each range state. Actions: Identify and establish contacts in each range state that can oversee and implement nationwide monitoring. 2. Providing the people with the tools to implement these monitoring plans. Short-term objective \u2022 The initiation and standardization of data collection with support and guidance from the South African national action group. Long-term objective \u2022 Comparable data sets across the range of the species, to allow for a proper understanding of density demographics and threats across the entire range. Cost-benefit analysis This approach will be positive in that it will encourage research, allow for standardized research that can allow for regional meta-analyses, enhance interest in the species and this approach will be a low-cost product that can be distributed to all other parties involved. There may however be high initial interest with a subsequent drop, and there may be potential data-sharing conflicts. The costs will be country specific and dependent on needs. PT may be able to provide advice on how to acquire funds. Actions Creation and distribution of toolkits. 32 WORKING GROUP 3: RISK ASSESSMENTS ACROSS LAND USE TYPES Introduction The aim of this group was to highlight, discuss, critically analyse and propose solutions to potential risks and threats for SGHs across the major land use types in South Africa. The four major land use types highlighted by the Land Use Working Group (Technical Workshop) were: commercial agriculture, community owned rangelands, private conservation properties and government owned reserves including formally protected sites, such as World Heritage Sites. The broad threats and their perceived risk levels for each of the land use types has been summarised below (Table 1).

Data available: Arnaud le Roux to follow up on Groblersdal data indicating negative effects of using agrochemicals on humans. Olifants River Crocodile study data (Stephan Woodborne). 3. The presence of lead in the SGH range-states is causing damage to the birds through both short- and long-term exposure. The current problem is multi-faceted: 1) lead bullets are cheaper than alternative lead-free ammunition, 2) hunters have negative perceptions about non-lead ammunition, 3) wing-shooters do not see alternatives, and 4) hunters commonly do not believe the science behind the negative health impacts of lead, to humans or wildlife. Goals d) Initiate buy-in from hunting industry (private conservation industries) to buy lead-free ammunition. This will be an on-going action. 34 Action: Arnaud le Roux to raise issues of lead in the environment at rangeland management forum and other community group meetings. MGHP to engage with Peter Oberem re non- lead ammunition. Get a Vet (Katja Koeppel) or Doctor to present about the effects of lead accumulation in humans to organisations such as WRSA, PHSA, SAWingShooter, CHASA, SAHunters (12-month time frame). Will need both a bottom-up approach: consumers going to ammunition manufacturers to demand that lead-free ammunition is manufactured at cheaper rates (M. Murison suggested creating bullets from recycled plastic as a possible option). Carte Blanche expos\u00e9 with a ballistics expert to add to expertise behind the argument. Link lead poisoning to the Poison Working Group (point 2). Lead accumulation in HUMANS must be the KEY driving approach to change the culture of gun-users in South Africa. Data available: Internationally there are a wealth of papers with regards to lead toxicosis in both humans and wildlife. Locally few papers exist for avian cases of lead toxicosis \u2013 e.g. Koeppel and Kemp (2015) for SGH. Katja Koeppel to provide details on the study of lead accumulation in hunters (and the venison they harvest). Support Linda van den Heever\u2019s lead and vulture research with data for any species. 4. Unfriendly veld management practices that detract from SGH population growth and survival. Goals a) Project Thunderbird awareness campaign to educate various stakeholders and land owners. Action: MGHP to create guideline document (deadline for toolkit will need to be in the next 12 months) that can be circulated to the broader Project Thunderbird communities. This action will be ongoing. b) Create feedback loop/monitoring system for management of landscapes where SGHs occur. Action: Contact organisations such as the ARC, Dept. of Agriculture, Working on Fire, Grassland Society of South Africa (GSSA) to promote better veld management nationally to the benefit of biodiversity and subsequently the SGHs. Data available: APNR research on habitat use and spatial movement of SGHs, Loftie-Eaton and Combrink thesis. 5.

Data available: Katja Koeppel can provide data on this and use of the monthly DAFF disease outbreak reports to drive alerts. 7. Lack of appropriate enforcement of current biodiversity legislation and implementation of prosecution and suitable penalties for crimes involving SGHs. Goals a) Improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies through improved awareness about SGHs. i.e. a SGH is as important as a rhinoceros. Actions: a) Better identification of species involved in wildlife crimes, b) Improved understanding of the importance of ALL wildlife species, 36 c) Improve understanding of the current conservation and biodiversity legislation. d) Join forces with other species stakeholder and perhaps make the toolkit for all EN and CR avian species. Engagement with NPA (magistrate, prosecutors, traditional leadership) to ensure appropriate prosecution of wildlife crimes involving SGH. Action: For Project Thunderbird: develop a toolkit to cover national and provincial legislation, with input from Croplife South Africa/AFCHASA on agricultural legislation and legal use of pesticides and agrochemicals. Call meetings with traditional leadership to run workshops and engage with local and regional leaders about incorporating protection. Chain of command from local villages to higher leadership: Headman \u2192 Councillor \u2192 Chief. Suggested need to provide magistrates with financial evidence of the value of the SGHs to direct penalty charges. Data available: Sale prices from private sales. b) Identify champions for SGH conservation in areas that currently have no conservation support. Action: Identify stakeholders in areas where no work is currently being conducted i.e. the Eastern Cape. Find and support the development of champions for the SGHs in those areas. Target conservancies/farmer\u2019s associations to get potential leads on contact people (i.e. Jenny and Walter Curry). Additional notes: Climate change and how it will affect future distribution is important as is understanding how more than one habitat/geography-specific threats are co-related to land use. Given the SGH N/E/SE range, would these threats affect all SGH land use types equally? Cost-benefit analyses 1. A) Identify BUFS: low cost with large benefit to incorporate the reporting of BUFS by the WLTP using the MapMarker App. B) Low cost with high benefit to generate feedback on mitigating BUFS. 2. A) \u201cProject Poison\u201d and \u201cProject Lead\u201d to keep meetings virtual and at a low cost. B) Higher cost associated with going on road show to educate necessary stakeholders but given greater stakeholder engagement may share costs. 3. End-user costs are potentially high (changing to more expensive lead-free ammunition). Costs to attend AGMs of the highlighted organisations and to present human safety and lead poisoning to a broader membership. Treatment of lead-poisoned birds is expensive. COST of lead poisoning in humans is greater than the cost of educating them about it. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e0af4fc-c9dc-4584-8766-44578349e21f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e0af4fc-c9dc-4584-8766-44578349e21f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f82e2d59dcca30a0a3622dd94f70f0598cdc1e3568fdc0afac32758e4d09738b"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b8228de-2d99-47f2-9e53-9917be90e633", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f42e9709ffcaa0ba65a962f610789580978714d8dee8480b81f18a366d9f59d"}}, "hash": "ac9b8e2374554cb48c6f9783e594c6ce38bc12e3d042a2e4029ba760a567ec35", "text": "4.

Law enforcement: Road show to law enforcement agencies and cost to develop a standard toolkit, costs to travel and hold meetings with necessary authorities, a buy in from stakeholders. Final recommendations (see Appendix 1: Technical Working Group 1 for synergistic recommendations) 1. Development of a risk map with layers created for each of the abovementioned threats/risks. Working Group (MCDA a good tool for this). Spatial data for each threat layer will need to be provided by nominated representatives (perhaps as part of the proceedings of the BMP). 2. Formation and launch of \u2018Project Thunderbird\u2019 to drive broader SGH threat mitigation and to serve as an oversight body for SGH. 3. Prepare a Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) for SGH. (This national plan, signed by the Minister, institutionalizes SGH conservation and thus create a succession plan in the event that current members of PT move on to other career paths). Identify and support SGH champions within the different areas of the range where work is currently not being conducted (I.e. BirdLife South Africa community guides, bird clubs, local community members/ leaders etc.). This can be driven in conjunction with the MGHP Custodianship Programme and the BirdLife Species Guardian Programme. 38 WORKING GROUP 4: STOCHASTIC POPULATION MODELLING Mike Bruford, Isa-Rita Russo, Rhys Bruford Introduction Following on from the development of a working baseline model during the Technical workshop (Appendix 1, Working Group 5), more realistic and management orientated models were developed. These models focused mainly on understanding the consequences of current land-use practices on hornbill demography, resource availability and likely growth within those constraints. Five land-use classes were defined: 1) protected areas (predominantly based on data from Kruger National Park), 2) Populations found associated with local communities where the birds receive active protection (based largely on data from Matopo, Zimbabwe but clearly applies to certain communities and ethnic groups in South Africa and elsewhere), 3) Populations located along local communities where the birds receive no protection (i.e. have no special cultural status), 4) Populations living in commercial game land, including that which has recently been converted from cattle and other livestock farming, 5) Populations living in commercial agricultural land including that under cattle and other livestock rearing but also arable, forestry and related land-use. The different impacts of these land-use classes on the SGH were implemented in the model via changes in mortality, reproductive output and alterations in carrying capacity. As with previous models, catastrophes were not modelled at this stage, but could be done in the future. First, a baseline model was constructed for the current South Africa population based on the current available habitat of 288,000 hectares, an average territory size of 100 hectares and an overall average of 2.75 birds per 100km2 (Kate Carstens, pers comm). This sums to a carrying capacity of 7,920. The first model, run without reference to land-use class, is based solely on habitat suitability as per vegetation types and with assumed homogeneity across the country in terms of mortality, reproductive output and carrying capacity (Figure 5.2). Figure 5.2 Growth curve for an idealised South African SGH population with no land-use specific constraints on demographic rates. 39 The assumptions of the model in Figure 2 are unrealistic but were used for comparative purposes. The model produced a mean stochastic growth rate of 0.0144, with a mean final population size of 788, achieving carrying capacity around year 100 of the 270-year (ten generation) model. A more realistic model was then implemented that took account of land-use induced demographic variance. In the absence of full land-use data, an assumption was made that all land-use classes comprise an equal proportion of the SGH\u2019s current and future distribution range. Table 5.2 shows the underlying assumptions and how mortality schedules and carrying capacity were altered. Mortality sources were agreed with land-use participants (including Arnaud Leroux), a veterinarian (Katja Koeppel) and Lucy Kemp and were based on data collected on known mortality events and an assessment of current practices.

Here mortality has been very rarely observed for the last five years, female productivity is approximately 80% breeding per year and the population shows strong evidence of growth to mean group sizes of 7-9 individuals. Under these unusual but highly beneficial circumstances, the population is predicted to grow at 8.3% per annum. This perhaps provides an ideal target by which other non- protected area population might be compared. In summary, only protected populations are predicted to grow under the current model, and under extreme levels of culturally mediated protection, they can grow rapidly. However, the use of harmful chemical substances is predicted to have a strongly negative impact on the population and lead to extinction on commercial land where they are being applied, even if in adjacent areas. It is worth noting that our mortality multiplier (10% across age classes) for poisoning was regarded by most participants as being highly conservative. In addition, no poisoning related catastrophes were modelled, despite the fact that pesticide and other chemical uses are known to have had catastrophic effects on vulture populations worldwide and the northern bald ibis in Morocco.

The meeting divided into four working groups, focusing on 1) human-hornbill interactions, both positive and negative; 2) land- use types; 3) captive breeding and reintroduction and 4) ecology. The reports tendered by these groups were reviewed in Plenary, modified and approved by all participants (see list of attendees in Appendix", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af64c467-e19b-431c-90dc-3fcb878cf8fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "af64c467-e19b-431c-90dc-3fcb878cf8fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "759271bbb854ea3caa550bb396aec211b876f08440fec036615586c7485b586e"}, "3": {"node_id": "1eb420a6-5b3e-468c-bb87-c9ccdc20a64c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32b32f51a86a5eef4c1674e1e1df84dff558541a20f38c1b9e1766f39a7236d0"}}, "hash": "e4a144714d7c7f747115471df5bc27cf1e6370cea3ded5acdd86d0a3f13c51bd", "text": "2). The formatting of each report was quite different and this report is a synthesised formatted version of the originals. A working group on population viability analysis used the parameters and outputs to initiate the stochastic modelling, a full version of which will be appended to this report when modelling is completed after the Stakeholder Workshop. 51 WORKING GROUP 1: ANTHROPOGENIC INTERACTIONS Background Ground-hornbills have a dual relationship with humans; a negative association due to losses to habitat and populations to various anthropogenic land uses, persecution, use for trade or medicine; and a positive association with cultural belief systems and appreciation as an icon of the savanna and grassland biomes. Threats Ground-hornbills in RSA hold down larger territories than would be expected for their body size (Kemp, 1995). Energetically, these are beyond their ability to patrol and so less time- and energy- intensive use of vocalisations is used to proclaim and maintain boundaries. Only when an incursion is detected, and visually confirmed, will they actively engage in defence. This territorial drive is high year- round, with a peak before and at the start of breeding. The birds will also attack their own reflections in windows (Forsberg, 1994; Oatley, 1967; C. J. Vernon, 1982) or shiny surfaces (such as metallic coloured vehicles), which results in broken window panes, often in large quantities as they move from pane to pane. This puts the whole group at risk of injury from broken glass but also leads to intense conflict with humans. Persecution by irate landowners leads to direct mortality or reduced productivity, with confirmed reports of a community burning down the resident ground-hornbill group\u2019s nest (Blouberg, Limpopo Province) or stoning a nest and causing abandonment (Melmoth, KwaZulu-Natal Province). Ground-hornbills are actively persecuted for breaking windows (Vernon, 1986; Forsberg, 1994; Kemp, 1995; Maasdorp, 2007). This behaviour is universal and reported from throughout their range. Mitigation to prevent them from seeing their own reflections is the only way to reduce this human-wildlife conflict, with a temporary and cheap solution being use of a solution of wood ash or paint on the panes (Chiweshe, 2007) and a more permanent one using perforated one- way-vision vinyl film (pers. obs.). Experiments in the use of commercial acoustic bird scarers failed (L. Kemp; pers.obs.). The species favours short-grass areas and is commonly found on mown grass airstrips and road verges, with reports of group members being shot to ensure runways are kept clear (Mundy, 2000; Chiweshe 2007) or as road-kill (Kemp & Kemp, 1980). In rural areas, ground-hornbills are reported to prey on poultry and small pets (Maasdorp, 2007; Witteveen et al., 2013), or on commercial concerns such as bee hives (El-niweiri & Satti, 2008), making them targets for retaliatory disturbance or killings. Non-targeted anthropogenic effects are also having a negative impact on the species. Even within the largest protected areas, effects of rising carbon dioxide levels and temperatures, coupled with erratic rainfall are leading to bush encroachment as conditions favour woody plant growth (ref?). The increasing use of chemicals in the environment leads to toxic compounds that cause both immediate mortalities (e.g. poisons, pesticides) and chronic physiological effects that reduce population growth (e.g. mercury and other persistent pollutants; Daso et al., 2015a,b, Koeppel & Kemp, 2015). Ground-hornbills forage together as a group (Farlow, 1976), primarily hunting independently of each other for small food items but they also act as a team when hunting larger prey items (Bennun, 1992; Driver & Humphries, 2014). This group-foraging behaviour, however, means that if a carcass or bait is laced with poison then it is likely that all group members will scavenge on the bait and this will increase mortalities. Use of chemical pesticides to target wildlife is increasing across Africa (Ogada, 2014), although reported poisoning cases for ground-hornbills have been assumed incidental or secondary 52 through poison-laced bait intended for other species ( Engelbrecht et al., 2007, Jordan, 2011).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1eb420a6-5b3e-468c-bb87-c9ccdc20a64c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1eb420a6-5b3e-468c-bb87-c9ccdc20a64c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "759271bbb854ea3caa550bb396aec211b876f08440fec036615586c7485b586e"}, "2": {"node_id": "af64c467-e19b-431c-90dc-3fcb878cf8fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4a144714d7c7f747115471df5bc27cf1e6370cea3ded5acdd86d0a3f13c51bd"}}, "hash": "32b32f51a86a5eef4c1674e1e1df84dff558541a20f38c1b9e1766f39a7236d0", "text": "Government-led rabies-vector and Red-billed Quelea (Quelea quelea) control campaigns contributed to widespread declines with associated die-offs of non-target scavenging species (Bothma, 2012; Chiweshe, 2007; Talbot, 1976). What is of particular concern for end-users of traditional medicines is that methods of harvest increasingly include persistent poisons, such as aldicarb, which remain in the parts consumed by patients (Bruyns et al., 2013; Ogada, 2014) and risk human or wildlife morbidity or fatalities, as for vultures (Mander et al. 2007).

Ground-hornbills are also caught unintentionally in snares (Chiweshe, 2007), both within (Stalmans, Peel, & Massad, 2014) and outside protected areas (E. Mabiza pers. comm., 2015; L. Kemp, pers. obs.). Trade exists in the species, both at a local level for traditional medicine and ritual practise (Anon, 1998; Msimanga, 2000; Kalimira, 2007; Maasdorp, 2007; Bruyns, Williams & Cunningham, 2013; Witteveen et al., 2013; Coetzee, Nell & van Rensburg, 2014), and across international borders for the zoo and aviculture trade (Trail, 2007). It has been reported across the range that where cultural practices are respected there is an inherent protection for the species (Trail, 2007). However, in areas where cultural taboos are less rigid, the species becomes prey to traders and their suppliers, either opportunistically, or as directed trade (Thiollay, 2006). It is difficult to quantify the scale of trade as the species is not listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Use of body parts is reported on a local scale but trade is reported only for formal traditional medicine markets, not for domestic use (Ngwenya, 2001; Maasdorp, 2007; Whiting, Williams & Hibbitts, 2011; Bruyns, Williams & Cunningham, 2013; Williams, Cunningham, et al., 2013). The scale of development in rural areas appears to have a marked influence on the persistence of the species. Ground-hornbills are susceptible to electrocution on transformer boxes (Jordan, 2011). With development, degradation, fragmentation and transformation of natural habitats also expand. Some less affluent and less developed areas now appear to sustain ground-hornbill populations at higher densities than areas where development increased the number of potential threats within a territory. It would be essential to tease out how much of this protection is because of strong cultural protection for the species in communal lands and how much of it is simply an increase in losses to newly arrived threats within a region. Cultural dynamics Hornbills, as an order, are revered and recognised as strong cultural icons in both Africa and Asia. The snake-killing ground-hornbill with its striking aposematic (red, black, white) colouration and deep rhythmic drum-like calling duet is embedded in human cultures across the range, featured in art and customary dress (Bastin, 1984; Chanda & Daniel, 2014; Kalimira, 2007), musical instruments, and riddles and songs (Godfrey, 1941; Estermann, 1964; Khumalo, 1974; Vernon, 1986; Anon, 1998; Maasdorp, 2007). It is sighted at homesteads or moving through villages, and accepted and tolerated as part of the rural landscape (Norton, 1982; Penzhorn, 1983). Ground-hornbills are reported to be powerful as both ritual and palliative medicine across their range for both Bucorvus species. This has accorded them wide-spread protection (Penzhorn, 1983), which has created de facto protected areas where these traditions remain strong (e.g. Matopos Tribal Trust Land, Zimbabwe; Witteveen et al., 53 2013, Mabiza, E, pers. comm.). This powerful status also creates a conservation challenge, since although mostly accorded cultural protection, ground-hornbills are also occasionally utilised for specific purposes. The most widespread and prevalent value ascribed to the species is the belief in their ability to predict, signal or bring the summer rains, vital to subsistence farmers\u2019 survival (Koopman, 2011; Chiweshe, 1998; Godfrey, 1941; Coetzee et al., 2014b; Vernon, 1986; Orlove et al. 2010; Brunton & Badenhorst 2013; Chisadza et al., 2013; Rusinga et al., 2014; Msimanga, 2000; Muiruri & Maunda, 2010; Simelane, 2011; Nevill, 1984; Maasdorp 2007b; Kuckertz 1983; Okonya & Kroschel 2013; Hockley & Archer, 1966; Vernon 1974; Jiri et al., 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d82eaffd-0c1d-4272-ad2e-4ddff7011835": {"__data__": {"id_": "d82eaffd-0c1d-4272-ad2e-4ddff7011835", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bb13b6756a0a1183cb28b5061478872ac918b9000539424195a00b780f0870d"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbd147ea-dbc7-4efb-a215-86b868288614", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23bde94a0e24a7974b76fb8e1e601f321e9c9852022c025965937532aa08d600"}}, "hash": "622d8dd28788f5eade93549bf7cf202c6a79a782852388daa6c650e3770d1c89", "text": "Accordingly, whole birds, alive or dead, or just some part, such as a feather, are reported to be placed in a river bed to avert drought, and crops are planted \u2018when the birds call\u2019. This power is believed to be so strong that the bird, carcass or feather(s) must be removed later from the site, lest floods prevail. Their rain-related powers extend to being able to avert lighting strikes (H. Coetzee, Nell, & Rensburg, 2014; Derwent & Mander, 1997; Koopman, 2011). Already concern has been expressed by the people who rely on them for climate prediction (Rusinga et al., 2014), as the species enabled them to know when it is worth preparing fields. This link to the rain is likely due to the species requirement for sufficient summer rain to initiate breeding. The continental reference to the species as a rain bird or thunder bird is likely due to the species occurring overwhelmingly in Bantu-speaking regions, where cultural associations were transferred by mutually intelligible sub-languages as the Bantu spread South and East about 3000 years ago[ref?].

This would make broad national policies very difficult to implement. For example, within Zimbabwe, the bird is reported to be widely protected by isiNdebele speakers (Chiweshe, 1998; Maasdorp, 2007; Bruyns, Williams & Cunningham, 2013; Witteveen et al., 2013), but less so by chiShona speakers (Bruyns et al., 2013). This difference may have contributed to the patterns of its current distribution and range contractions. Uses are also often contradictory within the same culture: bringing both good luck (Howell & Nkomo, 2000) or bad luck (Chiweshe, 1998; Gonzalez, 2011; Wilfred, 2007), or death (Bruyns et al., 2013; H. Coetzee, Nell, & van Rensburg, 2014; Godfrey, 1941; Msimanga, 2000; Muiruri & Maunda, 2010; Whittall, 1969), or strength (H. Coetzee, Nell, & Rensburg, 2014), or fertility (Chanda & Daniel, 2014), depending on the context. To hurt, disturb or kill a bird is often treated as tantamount to killing a member of one\u2019s own family, and the species is accorded full burial customs if killed, or even found dead (Mabiza pers. com.), to prevent a retaliatory killing incurred through witchcraft (Kideghesho 2009a; Bruyns et al. 2013; Vernon 1986; Msimanga 2000; Adanson 1757; Godfrey 1941; Maasdorp 2007b). Use of alternate surrogate species (plant or more common avian species) has been proposed as a conservation technique, but Coetzee et al. (2014) found that for certain medicinal and ritual uses there were no surrogates as powerful as the ground- hornbill, such as for strength, courage and leadership (H. Coetzee, Nell, & Rensburg, 2014). An alternative approach suggested by Williams and Whiting (2016), to counter the anxiety of healers and diviners in disclosing actual uses, is rather to understand the symptoms being treated, often symptomatic of issues in the society at large. Conservation interventions BirdLife International (2014) suggested priority actions that have already been initiated in South Africa, and to some extent in Zimbabwe; (i) to conduct population surveys and establish monitoring, (ii) begin awareness campaigns to prevent persecution, (iii) identify key stronghold habitat and 54 prevent degradation, and (iv) continue to research the effectiveness of artificial nest-sites. In South Africa, these actions are in line with priorities drawn from initial stakeholder engagement to ensure that sufficient research and action were invested for the species, with a total of 71 research and conservation interventions proposed (Morrison et al., 2005). Several have been reiterated as priorities in the Single Species Action Group (Jordan, 2011), with additional actions bringing the total list to 74 interventions. Only 13 have been completed, with 52 still in progress and a further nine still to be initiated (see Appendix 2.3? for a summary table of details of what is being conducted, where and to what stage). Knowledge retention, however, is weak and emphasis must be placed on documentation of decision-making processes, actions and outcomes. In South Africa, of the group that formed the initial stakeholder engagement a decade ago, only 6 of the original 35 participants are still involved, and insights have been with lost due to having insufficient data collection, analysis and storage mechanisms in place. The conservation of this species will require long-term commitment and sustainable programmes supported by both finances and human resources. It will require the development of a \u2018community of practice\u2019 (Cundill, Roux, & Parker, 2015) to ensure that the programme is truly able to benefit from the trans-disciplinary community of stakeholders and to be transparently cooperative. It is vital that data, even anecdotal, be accumulated and stored efficiently, and shared widely and transparently.

A range of land use types are found within each of these broader ecoregions and have been subdivided into general categories below (Figure 1). Key land use types have been highlighted where conservation strategies may benefit the SGHs and further research can be rolled out. The three key land use types are privately owned conservation land (and wildlife rangelands), agricultural land (crop and livestock) that is suitable for the SGHs, and communal rangelands for domestic livestock (Figure 2.1 grey shading). Figure 7.2. Identification of key land use types found in the known broad eco-regions within the natural distribution of the Southern Ground Hornbill.

Gland, Switzerland: IUCN Species Survival Commission. 67 WORKING GROUP 4: ECOLOGY Kate Carstens, Antoinette Kotze, Kyle Middleton, Alan Kemp Background A wealth of recent theses and publications have greatly enhanced our understanding of the ecology of the species since the last PHVA. Within the last decade, these have described the threat of bush- encroachment (Loftie-Eaton 2017), assessed the status and genetic connectivity of the species across its entire distribution (Kemp 2017), investigated habitat preferences and habitat use by social groups (Wyness 2011, Zoghby 2015), investigated factors associated with reproductivity (Wilson et al. 2011), and assessed the role of nest boxes as a conservation tool (Carstens 2017). Importantly, much-needed data on the ecology of the species was generated from studies outside of South Africa (Msimanga 2004, Witteveen et al. 2013). These are just a few of the research outputs generated on this species recently, and each one has contributed to the information required to make evidence-based conservation plans. There are important gaps in our knowledge which require addressing in the near future to build on the current and existing foundation of knowledge. Some have more of a conservation focus, others to simply deepen our understanding of the species. These goals, each described in the section below, focus on a wide range of outstanding issues, such as: increasing our understanding of the population size outside of protected areas, using molecular markers to address questions regarding relatedness and health, and understanding basic biological aspects such as moult. It is acknowledged that there will always be gaps in the knowledge, and that in the future more biological questions will arise. However, by tackling these goals listed below, we will be making significant progress toward resolving some long-standing, unanswered questions about this fascinating species. Goals, objectives & actions Goal 1: Increase long-term data in non-protected areas Objectives \u2022 Estimate reliable estimate of population size in KZN \u2022 Estimate reliable estimate of population size nationally Actions \u2022 Citizen science and provincial monitoring plan, at p entad level, reliability indicated by colour (green to red) over 4-year cycle, from presence/absence to productivity, nest sites and possibly including group composition in reports by .2018). \u2022 Mimic KZN monitoring plan and implement nationally, coordinated at a national level.

This analysis builds upon work that was carried out in 2005 during the first SGH PHVA workshop, where stochastic modelling was also included, using Vortex 9.4, by Kerryn Morrison and colleagues. Briefly, the 2005 PHVA model was first re-analysed using Vortex 10 under Malthusian conditions (in the absence of inbreeding depression, catastrophes and carrying capacity limitation, for input data see Table 7.4). This model predicted the population to decline rapidly, indicating that the 2005 life history data did not permit the population to grow under ideal conditions. Therefore, a new model was constructed and sensitivity tested to better reflect the species\u2019 capacity for intrinsic growth (up to 2% per annum) that the SGH is now known to possess (Kemp, A. pers. comm.). Using a combination of 2005 values with new data from SGH studies at the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR), Mpumalanga Province (Kate Carstens et al. unpublished), and collected by L Kemp from workshop participants, and others prior to the meeting, parameters were identified and modified accordingly (see description of the APNR study site below). Altered parameters included inbreeding, Environmental Variation (EV) correlation between reproduction and survival, maximum age of reproduction (females/males), maximum life span (females/males), age and sex specific mortality, and fecundity (maximum number of progeny, sex ratio at birth, distribution of broods per year, number of offspring per brood). Five hundred iterations were initially used with the population size being arbitrarily set at 200 individuals to analyse the performance of the model. Sensitivity testing was carried out to optimise the Malthusian growth rate in accordance with expectation for constrained and unconstrained populations (r~0.01 and ~0.02 respectively). Once the Malthusian model was optimised, density dependent reproduction (DDR) was included, using demographic data from Carstens et al. (unpublished) for APNR (Table 7.5). A growth curve was developed by comparing change in mean group size and total offspring productivity between 2000 and 2015 (Figure 7.3). The results indicate a substantial Allee effect for offspring productivity (35% of maximum), a maximum productivity at 63.5% of carrying capacity K (K defined at the point at which group size did not increase over time) and a substantial decline in productivity as group size asymptotes (to 45% of maximum).

Further sensitivity testing using data and discussion with the group resulted in a final baseline model with a reduction in density dependent effects for P(0) and P(K) of 18%, which produced a deterministic growth rate of 0.021 and a stochastic growth rate of 0.011 (Table 7.3, Figure 7.3). Using the final parameter values (Table 7.4), a simulation of 10 000 iterations was conducted to verify this baseline model (Table 7.4 & 7.5). This final baseline model was used in subsequent management scenario testing. 74 Figure 7.3. Growth curve (including standard deviation) for final baseline model (mean of 10,000 iterations presented). Management Models Captive breeding/reintroduction In collaboration with the Captive Breeding working group a series of models were developed to test the sustainability of the captive population in its current situation, how it may be improved using regular supplementation from wild-caught birds and how it might provide a source for augmentation of social groups in the wild. The current captive population only comprises four breeding pairs of South African origin and we tested how this population would be expected to develop with (one pair every two years for 10 years) and without supplementation over the coming 20 years. We further assessed whether a supplemented population could provide a male chick for reintroduction into the wild once the captive population had achieved carrying capacity (90 birds). Specifics of the captive model included: 20 and 40 year time-scale, implementation of inbreeding depression (due to small population size - we used 6.29 Lethal Equivalents, and 50% of inbreeding depression due to recessive lethals, the default values in Vortex in the absence of other data), EV correlation of reproduction and survival = 0, age of first offspring 6 for females and 8 for males, 75% of females breeding per year, 50% producing one offspring and 50% produce 2, low mortality rates (10% for 0-1, 5% for subadults and 2% for adults), 100% of males in breeding pool, initial population size of 8 (four pairs), carrying capacity of 90 (currently there are 60 South African birds being held and ~30 of Tanzanian origin). Figure 7.4 shows the results for all three scenarios in terms of population size and Figure 7.5 for inbreeding coefficient. 75 Figure 7.4: Population growth over 20 and 40 years in captive population models. Figure 7.5. Inbreeding coefficient over 20 and 40 years in captive population models It can be seen that the pair supplementation model provides a benefit not only in assisting the captive population in achieving carrying capacity, which it does after just 14 years, but also constrains the inbreeding coefficient below 1%. However, it should be noted that in the absence of further 76 supplementation into the captive population, the inbreeding coefficient achieves 3.5% at the end of 40 years, implying that further, periodic supplementation is needed to maintain genetic health. Most importantly however, this analysis shows that the captive population, provided it receives periodic supplementation of wild pairs, can produce one male chick every 2 years, for wild the augmentation purposes, without any negative effect on the demographic stability of the captive population. Reintroduction using only wild birds Next, we simulated the effects of an ongoing plan to harvest redundant chicks from approximately 100 wild nests to supply birds for the establishment of new SGH groups in areas between current populations to provide population connectivity between currently disconnected sites. Two group demographies were employed, first establishing a group with four subadult individuals aged 3 years, and second with an adult pair and a three-year old helper male. Here the modelling largely followed the baseline scenario described above with the exception that: simulations ran for 40 years, density dependence was not used, an initial population size equal to that currently estimated for South Africa was used as the \u2018source\u2019 population (n~2,880, although it is clear that not all birds and nests can provide chicks for this program, we decided to examine the effects of harvesting on the population as a whole), a carrying capacity of 7,920 (currently estimated for the whole of South Africa, Carstens pers comm), harvesting of whole groups (2 and 3 groups, tested for both group configurations) every year for 20 years of the 40 year simulation. However, this will require further modelling as the current reintroduction programme is based on harvest of redundant second-hatched chicks that would naturally die and so has no impact on the remaining wild population. The occasional harvest of sub- adult males to take the role of mentors in \u2018bush-schools\u2019 will thus have negligible effect on the remaining population,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fb76ffa-ee02-4100-af4d-4fb444fbd7f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fb76ffa-ee02-4100-af4d-4fb444fbd7f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abfdf2fe280e8d23b07e11377c4a24505fbb56fd62abba8afcc16fffe4b3c66c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cebbd49-cc23-42a5-a91f-6b899cd53e95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dd1594f1153d04a3fd99bef2c142e954fb701dea04371886194c7d1c4d8ad5c"}}, "hash": "6f507366175eb09df780fc2c9e4bb30d9790e2db15f39d91f75241d009a21e95", "text": "but perhaps if the group size of origin is low, there might be with Allee effects on the group. This has only been undertaken once and no impact was measured in breeding success (Carstens K., pers. comm.). A very clear outcome was achieved using all scenarios (Figure 7.6). All scenarios showed that the harvesting program would not impact on population growth, genetic diversity or probability of extinction. A stochastic growth rate of 0.0121 - 0.0125 was generated in all cases, very similar to the baseline growth model. Indeed, the deterministic growth rate (0.0331) is significantly higher than the baseline, possibly reflecting the increased growth expected for a large population (although it should be borne in mind that density dependence was not implemented here, due to the fact that harvesting acts in the same way as density dependence would in natural populations). 77 Figure 7.6. Population growth over 40 years in wild reintroduction models Group-level reintroduction Finally, group level reintroduction plans were tested in collaboration with the land-use group to assess whether current plans for reintroduction of groups into conservancies could be carried out in a sustainable fashion. Here, models were developed for the establishment of five social groups at a hypothetical site with 10 available territories to establish whether such group-based reintroductions could result in a viable population becoming established. Once again, model parameters largely followed those for the baseline wild scenario with the exception of: simulations ran for 40 years, 10 subpopulations were used (to represent groups and empty territories), inbreeding depression was used in some scenarios using the same values as for the captive population, female dispersal was modelled for individuals aged 1-2 with 10% between each subpopulation (summing to a 100% probability for each bird), a dispersal modifier function (=D*[ (S=\u2019F\u2019) OR (RAND>0.9) ] was used to simulate male dispersal occurring at 10% of the probability of female dispersal, 75% survivorship during dispersal, an initial population size of four or five birds (one female aged 16, one male aged 2, one male aged 3, one male aged 16 for four birds with an additional male aged 2 for five-bird models), carrying capacity per territory of 6 birds and finally population supplementation was modelled for some scenarios with birds (males aged 4 and 10) at year 5 and 10. This complex model proved very difficult to stabilise and it was found that the populations would not survive unless mortality was substantially altered to reflect the interventional management needed to assist the establishment of these groups (see Kemp 2017). Altering the model to reflect this, and using mortality values of 9% for individuals aged 1-3 years with 5% thereafter resulted in a population that stabilised (but which did not show signs of growth) over 40 years in terms of numbers but where individual subpopulations had a probability of extinction of ~0.3 (Figures 7.7 and 7.8). These models will require further evaluation during the workshop. 78 Figure 7.7 Population growth in group level conservancy model for five introduced groups over 40 years, with managed mortality.

The APNR was formed in 1976 when fences between these reserves were removed, and with the removal of fences between the Kruger National Park and the study area during the 1990s. Before their establishment as private nature reserves, land-use was mainly gamehunting, cattle grazing and the growing of fruit (Bornman 1995) - hornbills were present but not under study. The vegetation within the study area falls within the Savanna Biome of South Africa, varying from open savanna to closed woodland (van der Waal 2010).

The study site contains 31 groups in 180,000 ha, of which 18 are known to breed. Average group size during 2000-2015 was 4.0 \u00b1 1.4 individuals per group, but varied between 3 (2000) and 4.9 (2015).

As we walked through the fields and communal grazing areas, we often saw iNsingizi, the Southern Ground Hornbill. Wherever there were cattle, there were iNsingizi. The booming call of these large birds was familiar to us. It reminded us of the seasonal blessing of rain. In our culture, these birds were never hunted, for fear of unleashing torrential downpours. But seeing iNsingizi in a grazing area meant that the area was being cleared of snakes and scorpions. So we welcomed their presence. Today, however, when I walk among my cattle in Mahlabathini, it is very rare to see a Southern Ground Hornbill. Tragically, in the whole of northern Zululand, there may be fewer than 25 breeding groups left. They may soon become Critically Endangered. I long to see this symbolic bird reinstated in the collective memory. I want my grandchildren and great grandchildren to see iNsingizi and to hold them in high regard, as our ancestors did. It would be an unspeakable loss to our cultural and natural heritage to allow these birds to slip into extinction. I am therefore enormously grateful for the work being done to preserve the species, through research, habitat augmentation, awareness campaigns, the rescuing, hand-rearing and rewilding of chicks, and their reintroduction into our wildlife areas. I must thank the Kemp family and the team at the Mabula Ground Hornbill Project for their invaluable service to conservation. As a lifelong conservationist, I know that conservation initiatives must be supported and driven by traditional leaders and traditional communities. As Prime Minister to the Zulu Monarch and Nation, and Inkosi of the Buthelezi Clan, I have championed an intensive conservation dialogue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f63ebe8-3cff-49e1-856c-3daa49b4f765": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f63ebe8-3cff-49e1-856c-3daa49b4f765", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14bd79e85e6f2c89dacf3119f7387a727fa45d64477ec12142843c1ada5b8086"}, "2": {"node_id": "027438ab-12b8-4a03-b97e-c081556f84ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7d8937a71052f53cff79afb138d8228baf3a30ffb73b252634802cf23314264"}}, "hash": "a3eb4bd969eef1e31a55670f0759601ca99460f31a22fef00640d5385ffeefaa", "text": "I intend to see that dialogue encompass the protection of the Southern Ground Hornbill, as part of our future conservation plan, and I make myself available to open the way.

Five years later in the summer of 1972-73, we spent four months finding and following as many SGH groups as could be located within an area centred on Satara Rest Camp. The end result was an estimated density of 100 km2 per group (n = 14), with a mean group size of 3.6, led by an alpha pair and including variable numbers of helper adults (predominantly males) and immatures (of varying ages). A number of nest sites were found and, over as many subsequent years as possible, additional groups and nest sites were located, the contents checked and all group sizes and age/sex compositions recorded. These data formed the basis for most early SGH perceptions and conservation considerations. Wherever possible, effort and information was expanded. The low density, projected small total population size and limited breeding potential for the species (and for other large avian species) convinced KNP authorities to include SGHs in their annual aerial counts during 1978-86, which expanded the distribution and group-size data to cover 90% of the KNP. Throughout 1990-92, the Big- Six bird project, in collaboration with the Percy Fitzpatrick Institute, maintained a KNP-wide record of SGH sightings and the sample of nest sites known rose to 50, representing an estimated quarter of the KNP groups. In the original Satara study, when the second-hatched chick was found to succumb early in the nestling period, its conservation potential was realised and these redundant chicks were removed opportunistically for hand rearing, with low success initially until the National Zoological Gardens added their support and skills. Two attempted hard releases followed, of three and two captive-reared birds into Malolotja, Swaziland in 1995: both failed, but the best lasting three months. In 1998, two MSc students then harvested and reared chicks, testing a community-based protocol for rearing in collaboration with the Makuleke living adjacent to the northern KNP. By 1999, this developed into the soft release of three juveniles, with community assistance, and was the start of the Mabula-based reintroduction efforts into vacant but historically occupied habitats. From 1999-2005, establishment of a free-ranging Mabula group, and improvement of harvest from the wild and rearing of redundant chicks met with some scepticism and some success. Enthused and conducted by Ann Turner, the funds she raised, and the students and volunteers she attracted, various experiments were tried with different release techniques and alternative interventions for group 98 augmentation in the wild. As ideas, projects and participant\u2019s increased, conflicting opinions and organisations precipitated the need for national discussion and culminated in the 2005 PHVA1. Other organisations took control of sections of the interests pioneered at and by the MGHP, the Fitztitute adopting the artificial nest programme, and the EWT formed its own Ground Hornbill Working Group. Sensing the fragmentation of effort, the National Zoological Gardens then facilitated formation of an informal national Action Group, which elected its own chairperson, to coordinate these disparate groups and individuals. This Action Group later built on the results and recommendations from PHVA1 to initiate a more detailed Species Recovery Plan published in 2011. In the 12 years from the 2005 PHVA1 to the present 2017 PHVA2, much more research and publication has been completed - six PhDs, seven MScs, 2 Honours projects and 25 formal research papers, besides numerous and various technical protocols for many practical aspects of, for example, nest location/examination, ageing/sexing, harvesting, rearing, handling, morphometric and veterinary sampling, and marking techniques! All this new information, together with all the new unpublished national, extra-limital, range-wide and captive insights that have become available, plus the expert facilitation and modelling provided by Dr Mike Bruford and his team, have produced results that are a quantum increase in accuracy and credibility than those from PHVA1. As two of only three participants from PHVA1, and the oldest, it was exciting to be part of the collation of all this new information and, as a swansong, to be able still to make some contributions to the discussions. Most of the participants who contributed to the tsunami of new information now available are mostly in their middle years and will be able to provide the expert guidance necessary for the years ahead until PHVA3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "332fe39f-fa05-49c6-8070-38c9c8a0a4f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "332fe39f-fa05-49c6-8070-38c9c8a0a4f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b91479389739aa9a14a599dc1fdd80cd53524dddf9669a6374af8b125dedcd1"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d21d15a-0ea3-462c-948c-9d734018fbe9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "399fcdc80387ea1ac9d81938fde91914ae5eed5560f2f62fa713ed6129b0da65"}}, "hash": "12210c014e6fd5ae5cfc3859cf173db9670edfa47f962cdadeb8af8ae81fbece", "text": "Best of all, was also meeting the healthy population of new and enthusiastic young participants, who are well placed to rejuvenate some of the organisations involved, and to drive the plans now", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b927c53-63ee-4cfc-bd62-5e0a5c192fb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b927c53-63ee-4cfc-bd62-5e0a5c192fb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Southern ground hornbill", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/southern-ground-hornbill", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b345eccb0f923b66b7864e6487f8415bd48891455eb2c110c9c6edc2707f090"}}, "hash": "1b345eccb0f923b66b7864e6487f8415bd48891455eb2c110c9c6edc2707f090", "text": "being developed for the immediate future.

This report focuses on the following five biodiversity-related conventions: (1) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); (2) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); (3) Convention on Migratory Species (CMS); (4) Ramsar Convention on Wetlands; and (5) World Heritage Convention (WHC). The Secretariats of all five biodiversity-related conventions have adopted decisions or resolutions calling for enhanced synergies with other conventions; in addition, the strategic planning documents of CBD, CITES, CMS and Ramsar Convention carry provisions for implementing synergies. Also, a wide range of mechanisms for coordination and collaboration between the biodiversity-related conventions already exists. These include, but are not exclusive to, the Biodiversity Liaison Group (BLG), the Chairs of the Scientific Advisory Bodies of Biodiversity-related Conventions (CSAB) and the Environment Management Group", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38d9f250-4452-4277-ab70-fd2cf474ff63": {"__data__": {"id_": "38d9f250-4452-4277-ab70-fd2cf474ff63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bb34c351ea59e649e659c5a94faf160ce71a4797bd3d7d2bf2dbc769556ceed"}, "3": {"node_id": "99403be9-8bb0-4710-80d8-447890184f4a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c1fbc00fb2944fd0843e4676837024838e855a6698fe23c57be9ce208e30d43"}}, "hash": "170be6b9779d446053ddf259be930b51d2826771d82a042fb3b18b9a71045ed7", "text": "(EMG). Additionally, the biodiversity-related conventions have established a range of bilateral or multilateral memoranda of understanding for joint cooperation as well as joint work plans or programmes with other conventions. The recent international reports developed by these five conventions confirm that the loss of biodiversity continues all over the world, in spite of all existing efforts at the national, regional and international levels. This means that additional efforts must be exerted to enable the biodiversity- related conventions to fully deliver their planned targets. In this regard, enhancing synergies and coherence among the biodiversity-related conventions is essential, as a huge potential for synergies lies unrealized. The tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COPD) (Nagoya, Japan) called on the UN Environment Management Group (EMG) to contribute to the international decade on biodiversity 2011-2020. The COPD also specifically invited the EMG to build on its \u201cAdvancing the Biodiversity Agenda, a UN System-Wide Contribution\u201d report to identify measures for effective and efficient implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity across the United Nations system. With the adoption of the National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan 2011-2020 (NBSAP) and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, the Conference of the Parties to the CBD has clearly reached out to the other conventions, inviting them to contribute to the collaborative implementation of this global plan, stressing synergies with the national implementation of the other biodiversity-related conventions. By understanding how each UN agency and convention can help advance the NBSAP and target development on a variety of topics, each agency can better understand how its efforts contribute to a more efficient, targeted, strategic and comprehensive approach to country support. Therefore, conventions have begun to acknowledge the opportunities that the Aichi Targets offer for enhancing collaboration and synergies. For example, both CITES and CMS have encouraged their national focal points to engage in the process of updating and revising NBSAPs at the national level. vi Based on this, UNEP/ROWA and IUCN/ROWA offices have agreed to develop a joint study to promote synergies among the biodiversity conventions and establish links to the Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 (SDGs) targets in Bahrain. A national workshop was organized in Manama, Bahrain in close cooperation with the Supreme Council of Environment (SCE). With a wide range of national stakeholders in attendance, the workshop covered synergy among biodiversity-related conventions and the December 2016 SDGs. After the workshop and feedback from stakeholders, several recommendations were put forward suggesting options for further action to promote synergies, cooperation and harmonization. It is important to recognize, however, that the identification and implementation of synergies is a process that needs to be implemented in accordance with the identified needs, the ongoing processes and the available resources of each convention. In addition, many of the following recommendations, if implemented, would require political support and institutional and financial resources, which may not be currently available if SCE continues to rely on government funding. vii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The Supreme Council for Environment is very grateful for the generous support of the United Nations Environment Programme/Regional Office for West Asia (UNEP/ROWA) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature/Regional Office for West Asia (IUCN/ROWA), who provided financial and technical support for the development of this synergy report on biodiversity-related conventions.

resources remain one of the defining challenges of our world and form an essential element of sustainable development. Over the last century, countries have developed a range of legal international agreements that tackled different aspects of this challenge. In the past decades, a number of biodiversity-related conventions were adopted, which led to establishing a comprehensive legal and governance regime for addressing most biodiversity issues. The Kingdom of Bahrain consists of an archipelago of approximately 40 natural islands in addition to several islets, shoals and patches of reefs, lying centrally on the southern shores of the Arabian Gulf. The current total land and marine areas of Bahrain are around 770 and 7,499 km2, respectively.1 Bahrain\u2019s islands and their surrounding waters support several valued ecosystem components ranging from desert and agricultural ecosystems to coastal and marine ecosystems. Terrestrial ecosystems in Bahrain include palm groves, fresh water springs and local varieties of crops. These ecosystems provide important ecological services such as food provisioning, medicinal plants and recreational services. Additionally, genetic diversity is demonstrated in the native Arabian horse breeds and palm tree species, which represent historical and cultural values for Bahraini people.

OVERVIEW OF THE SYNERGY AMONG THE BIODIVERSITY-RELATED CONVENTIONS IN BAHRAIN 2 A wide range of mechanisms for coordination and cooperation among the biodiversity-related conventions already exists. They can be grouped into multilateral (generic and thematic ones) and bilateral mechanisms, including cooperation and coordination bodies and other arrangements. The most important existing mechanisms are briefly described below. 1.1 Summary of biodiversity-related conventions 1. Convention on Biological Diversity2 (CBD) Logo Date of Entry Into The Force 29 December 1993 Objectives It has 3 main objectives: 1. The conservation of biological diversity. 2. The sustainable use of the components of biological diversity. 3. The fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. Background In 1981, through Resolution 15/10, IUCN Members called on the IUCN Secretariat to analyse the technical, legal, economic and financial matters related to the conservation, accessibility and use of genetic resources. This is to provide the basis for international arrangements and for rules to implement these arrangements. The Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity, under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), convened in November 1988 to explore the need for an international convention on biological diversity. In May 1989, UNEP established the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts to prepare an international legal instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. By February 1991, the Ad Hoc Working Group had become known as the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee. Its work culminated on 22 May 1992 with the Nairobi Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Convention was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio Earth Summit). It remained open for signature until 4 June 1993, by which time it had received 168 signatures. The Convention entered into force on 29 December 1993, which was 90 days after the 30th ratification. The first session of the Conference of the Parties was scheduled for 28 November \u2013 9 December 1994 in the Bahamas. Programmes There are seven thematic programmes of work which correspond to some of the major biomes on the planet: (1) Agricultural Biodiversity; (2) Dry and Sub-humid Lands Biodiversity; (3) Forest Biodiversity; (4) Inland Waters Biodiversity; (5) Island Biodiversity; (6) Marine and Coastal Biodiversity; and (7) Mountain Biodiversity.

Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora3 (CITES) Logo Date of Entry Into The Force 1 July 1975 Objectives To ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Through its three appendices, the Convention offers varying degrees of protection to more than 30,000 plant and animal species. Background In the 1960s, the international discussion of the regulation of the wildlife trade for conservation purposes was relatively new. Now, the need for CITES is clear. Annually, international wildlife trade is estimated to be worth billions of dollars and to include hundreds of millions of plant and animal specimens.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f32a795-b321-4e6d-9b55-900bcf7be564": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f32a795-b321-4e6d-9b55-900bcf7be564", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71aea9ff04641a57e54b8939cfdb60db3f57a113a0ea4973bc5d7b2482e7004a"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec0fb77d-2e0a-4eb6-85b6-5d2e501910fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85cbbf57e80cb1ebdc85d4b0a8c906da68989588beafd047395e800837971e87"}}, "hash": "7a80bf57cd999a2d9e629a4a501671f2a39b4e246196896a42f69c28695e41ba", "text": "CITES was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of IUCN members (The World Conservation Union).

Background CMS provides a global platform for the conservation and sustainable use of migratory animals and their habitats. CMS brings together the States through which migratory animals pass, known as the Range States, and lays the legal foundation for internationally coordinated conservation measures throughout a migratory range. As the only global convention specializing in the conservation of migratory species, their habitats and migration routes, CMS complements and cooperates with several international organizations, NGOs and media partners as well as with the corporate sector. The migratory species that are threatened with extinction are listed in Appendix I of the Convention. CMS Parties strive to protect these animals, conserve/restore the places where they live, mitigate obstacles to migration and control other factors that might endanger them. Besides establishing obligations for each State joining the Convention, CMS promotes concerted action among the Range States of many of these species. Migratory species that need or would significantly benefit from international co-operation are listed in Appendix II of the Convention. For this reason, the Convention encourages the Range States to conclude global or regional agreements. In this respect, CMS acts as a framework Convention. The agreements may range from legally binding treaties (called Agreements) to less formal instruments, such as Memoranda of Understanding, and can be adapted to the requirements of particular regions. The development of models tailored according to the conservation needs throughout the migratory range is a unique capacity to CMS. Programmes Several agreements have been concluded to date under the auspices of CMS. They aim to conserve: (1) Populations of European Bats (EUROBATS); (2) Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic area (ACCOBAMS); (3) Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS); (4) Seals in the Wadden Sea (Wadden Sea Agreement); (5) African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA); (6) Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP); and (7) Gorillas and Their Habitats (Gorilla Agreement).

World Heritage Convention6 Logo Date of Entry Into The Force 16 November 1972 Objectives To encourage identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. Background In 1959, UNESCO launched an international campaign to save Abu Simbel temples in the Nile Valley, and a draft of the Convention on the protection of cultural heritage was prepared. In 1965, the organization called for a \u2018World Heritage Trust\u2019 to protect natural and scenic areas and historical sites. In 1966, UNESCO spearheaded an international campaign to save Venice after disastrous floods threatened the city. In 1968, IUCN developed a proposal similar to the \u2018World Heritage Trust\u2019 for its members. In 1972, the work of experts from IUCN, ICOMOS and UNESCO and their proposals came together in the Convention concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in Paris on 16 November 1972. In 1978, the first twelve sites were inscribed on the World Heritage List. In 1992, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre was created and the cultural landscapes category was adopted by the World Heritage Committee. Number of parties 185 Status of Bahrain Party since 28 May 1991 Major implementation tools The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention Other agreements under the Convention N/A National Focal Point Higher National Council for Environment 6- http://whc.unesco.org 7 1.2 JOINT ACTIVITIES AMONG BIODIVERSITY-RELATED CONVENTIONS AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL Each of the biodiversity-related conventions works to implement actions at the national, regional and international levels to reach shared goals for conservation and sustainable use. In meeting their objectives, the conventions have developed several complementary approaches (site, species, genetic resources and/or ecosystem-based) and operational tools (e.g. programmes of work, trade permits and certificates, multilateral system for access and benefit-sharing, regional agreements, site listings and funds). In 2010, the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 was adopted at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the CBD (CBD COP10) in Nagoya, Japan. Parties agreed to translate this overarching international framework into revised and updated NBSAPs by 2015. Subsequent to its adoption, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) agreed to take the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 as a universal framework for action on biodiversity and a foundation for sustainable development for all stakeholders, including agencies across the UN system. The adoption of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, therefore, created a significant momentum to foster a new generation of NBSAPs that address the coherent implementation of the biodiversity-related conventions. Accordingly, the CBD decision that adopted the strategy invites parties to involve National Focal Points (NFPs) in all the biodiversity-related agreements, as appropriate, in the process of updating and implementing NBSAPs and their related enabling activities. The biodiversity-related conventions also explicitly encouraged their NFPs to engage in their country\u2019s NBSAP revision process. In addition, the CMS and the CITES Secretariats have developed guidance materials which support parties that consider the inclusion of migratory species or their CITES national and regional actions in a revised and updated NBSAP while other conventions like the WHC are currently in the process of compiling guidance material.

Therefore, in this section, the joint activities and the links among the biodiversity-related conventions will be discussed. Strategic Goal A: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society. Aichi Biodiversity Target 1: By 2020, at the latest, people will be aware of the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably. General Observations: 1. Articles: \u2022 Only CBD and WHC Conventions have actions related to raising awareness described in Aichi Target 1 while the remaining conventions (CMS, Ramsar, CITES) do not have corresponding articles in their convention texts. 2. Guidance: \u2022 All biodiversity-related conventions have developed guidance materials that are of relevance for Aichi Target 1. (Ramsar Strategic Plan for 2016-20247, Strategic Plan for Migratory Species 2015-20238, CITES strategic vision: 2008-2020).9 CBD: \u2022 CBD decisions call specifically on different stakeholders to build capacity and raise awareness at the community level. \u2022 CBD decisions also call on parties to review and revise strategies for communicating biodiversity agenda and policies to businesses. The CEPA Toolkit10 was designed for CBD focal points. CITES: \u2022 CITES decisions that are relevant to Aichi Biodiversity Target 1 provide guidance to parties involved in the illegal trade of rhinoceros horns to develop and implement strategies or programmes to enhance community awareness with regard to the economic, social and environmental impacts of illicit wildlife trafficking. \u2022 Parties are also encouraged to report illegal activities related to wildlife trade and collaborate on public education programmes of selected species. \u2022 Relevant tools include Hope for a Sustainable Future (2014)11, which aims to raise awareness of the role of CITES in biodiversity conservation.

WHC: \u2022 WHC encourages parties to support the new World Heritage Capacity Building Strategy by focusing on train- the-trainers programmes in particular. \u2022 Additionally, the Convention invites parties to support and contribute to the improvement of the State of Conservation Information System (SOC), which is a comprehensive and integrated information system on the state of conservation of World Heritage properties.101 100- http://strp.ramsar.org/strp-publications/ramsar-briefing-notes 101- http://whc.unesco.org/en/soc 33 Strategic Goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building. Aichi Biodiversity Target 20: By 2020, at the latest, the mobilization of financial resources for effectively implementing the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 from all sources \u2012 and in accordance with the consolidated and agreed process in the Strategy for Resource Mobilization \u2012 will be increased substantially from previous levels. This target will be subject to changes contingent on resource needs assessments to be developed and reported by parties. General Observations: 1. Articles: \u2022 CBD and WHC are the only biodiversity-related conventions that have actions related to Aichi Target 20 while the remaining conventions (Ramsar, CMS, CITES) do not have articles in their convention texts. 2. Guidance: \u2022 The Strategic Plan for Migratory Species 2015-2023 includes a target to substantially increase resources from all sources to effectively implement the Plan. \u2022 The Ramsar Strategic Plan 2016-2024 includes a strategy on international assistance and Convention financial capacity. \u2022 Goal 2 and its associated objectives in the CITES Strategic Vision 2008-2020 are closely related to Aichi Target 20 in that they call for securing the necessary financial resources and means for the operation and implementation of the conventions. CBD: CBD has agreed on a set of preliminary targets for resource mobilization,102 related to: (1) doubling total biodiversity- related international financial resource flows to developing countries; (2) the inclusions of biodiversity in national priorities or development plans; (3) reporting on domestic biodiversity expenditures, as well as funding needs, gaps and priorities; and (4) mobilization of domestic financial resources. Further, CBD urges parties to develop their national resource mobilization strategies or finance plans within the framework of revising NBSAPs.103 Parties should report on their contributions to the collective efforts to reach the global targets for resource mobilization in their sixth national report. Furthermore, parties are urged to develop and use various sources of funding, together with market and non-market based instruments, REDD+ and other policy approaches for results-based finance. Parties are further urged to consider undertaking a review and assessment of existing relevant legislation and policies governing biodiversity financing mechanisms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fef1190-536f-45ef-878c-9996109b0fcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fef1190-536f-45ef-878c-9996109b0fcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd2a1d1868f2cc133dfb4a16a1ed0176dfa14961aeac7044bb2f806099bb15ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "1cf7728a-a280-47b1-9f28-3bc347d78f0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2c0c8a5d5ab9a1c52c97a2bdb5c223bc8cdd0ed7a545a1643197bd5737968dd"}}, "hash": "e776154ff52e17290899390c700964e99b86687956efdbbfa7ea818adf85399d", "text": "Regarding resource effectiveness and sustainability of financial flow, CBD invites parties to support developing countries, to enhance institutional, national, administrative and managerial capacities and to strengthen cooperation and synergy among Convention focal points and focal points for other relevant sectoral processes. \u2022 CBD invites developed countries to increase their financial assistances to the sixth GEF replenishment period (GEF- 6) and encourages parties to submit multi-focal area projects for GEF funding. \u2022 CBD promotes the work of the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN)104 and the CBD LifeWeb Initiative.105 CITES: \u2022 CITES invites parties to initiate or strengthen collaborative partnerships among all stakeholders and conservation agencies to enhance financial support for wildlife conservation and rural communities. \u2022 The Convention encourages parties to provide financial and in-kind resources for capacity building activities, particularly those in support of Goals 1 and 3 of the CITES Strategic Vision. \u2022 Parties are further urged", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "534b71d2-8f7b-4a55-ad9c-ccda63b96790": {"__data__": {"id_": "534b71d2-8f7b-4a55-ad9c-ccda63b96790", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f907e62f0951187a75a0fe7ec2bac716096adcf5cff47b61616bc213f7147cf"}}, "hash": "4f907e62f0951187a75a0fe7ec2bac716096adcf5cff47b61616bc213f7147cf", "text": "to consider the identified needs of developing countries when implementing capacity building, fundraising and budget allocation programmes.

This agenda is a road map for people and the planet that will build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals and ensure sustainable social and economic progress worldwide. It seeks not only to eradicate extreme poverty, but also to integrate and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental) in a comprehensive global vision. It is vital that we begin implementation based on an accurate evaluation of where the world stands now. Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere Goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations, including extreme poverty, over the next 15 years. All people everywhere, including the poorest and most vulnerable, should enjoy a basic standard of living and social protection benefits. Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Goal 2 seeks to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition and to achieve sustainable food production by 2030. It is premised on the idea that everyone should have access to sufficient nutritious food, which will require widespread promotion of sustainable agriculture, doubling of agricultural productivity, increased investments and properly functioning food markets. Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Goal 3 aims to ensure health and well-being for all at all ages by improving reproductive, maternal and child health; ending the epidemics of major communicable diseases; reducing non-communicable and environmental diseases; achieving universal health coverage; and ensuring access to safe, affordable and effective medicines and vaccines for all. Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Goal 4 focuses on the acquisition of foundational and higher-order skills; greater and more equitable access to technical and vocational education and training and higher education; training throughout life; and the knowledge, skills and values needed to function well and contribute to society. Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Goal 5 aims to empower women and girls to reach their full potential, which requires eliminating all forms of discrimination and violence against them, including harmful practices. It seeks to ensure that they have every opportunity for sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights; receive due recognition for their unpaid work; have full access to productive resources; and enjoy equal participation with men in political, economic and public life. Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 6 goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to addressing the quality and sustainability of water resources. Achieving this Goal, which is critical to the survival of people and the planet, means expanding international cooperation and garnering the support of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. 37 Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Goal 7 seeks to promote broader energy access and increased use of renewable energy, including through enhanced international cooperation and expanded infrastructure and technology for clean energy. Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Continued, inclusive and sustainable economic growth is a prerequisite for global prosperity.

Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 9 focuses on the promotion of infrastructure development, industrialization and innovation. This can be accomplished through enhanced international and domestic financial, technological and technical support, research and innovation and increased access to information and communication technology. Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income, as well as those based on sex, age, disability, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity\u2014both within and among countries. It also aims to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration and addresses issues related to representation of developing countries in global decision-making and development assistance. Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Goal 11 aims to renew and plan cities and other human settlements in a way that fosters community cohesion and personal security while stimulating innovation and employment. Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 12 aims to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns through measures such as specific policies and international agreements on the management of materials that are toxic to the environment. Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its widespread, unprecedented effects disproportionately burden the poorest and the most vulnerable. Urgent action is needed not only to combat climate change and its impacts, but also to build resilience in responding to climate- related hazards and natural disasters. Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development This Goal seeks to promote the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems, prevent marine pollution and increase the economic benefits to Small Island Developing States and LDCs through the sustainable use of marine resources. 38 Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Goal 15 focuses on managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss. All of these efforts in combination will help ensure that livelihoods are preserved for those that depend directly on forests and other ecosystems, that biodiversity will thrive and that the benefits of these natural resources will be enjoyed for generations to come. Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Goal 16 envisages peaceful and inclusive societies based on respect for human rights, the rule of law, good governance at all levels and transparent, effective and accountable institutions. Many countries still face protracted violence and armed conflict, and far too many people are poorly supported by weak institutions and lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms. Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development The 2030 Agenda requires a revitalized and enhanced global partnership that mobilizes all available resources from Governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors. Increasing support to developing countries, in particular LDCs, landlocked developing countries and Small Island Developing States, is fundamental to equitable progress for all. 39 As described above, biodiversity obviously spans many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They contribute directly to human well-being and development priorities. Biodiversity is at the center of many economic activities, particularly those related to agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries. Globally, nearly half of the human population is directly dependent on natural resources for its livelihood, and many of the most vulnerable people depend directly on biodiversity to fulfill their daily subsistence needs. As mentioned before, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets have been adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity and have been recognized as setting the global framework for priority actions on biodiversity. The SDGs Agenda is consistent with other existing international commitments, including Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Table 1 offers a summary of linkages between SDGs, Aichi Biodiversity Targets and other biodiversity- related conventions as a short guide for the Bahraini government to share with decision-makers and development professionals and better understand how the contributions of biodiversity-related conventions help the involved parties reach the SDGs.

Other major anthropogenic stresses on local biodiversity include sewage outfall, industrial and oil pollution, over-fishing and invasive alien species. To reduce these threats, efforts have been undertaken to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in Bahrain. A legislative framework for biodiversity management exists and includes a wide range of national laws, multi-lateral agreements and international agreements pertaining to environmental protection in Bahrain with particular reference to the conservation of biodiversity. The purpose of this section is to provide a framework to analyse and understand the relationship between Bahraini National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) under the CBD and the Sustainable Development Goals as Bahraini Government will use them to meet its international commitments for the welfare of its people. This framework is based on a recent report published by UNEP. The UNEP report reviewed more than 6,000 actions included in NBSAPs of 60 countries. The analysis includes two parts taxonomy for actions found within the NBSAP. Each action is classified based on a thematic category (restoration, protection, sustainable use, etc.) and generic action statement (develop a plan, conduct research, strengthen governance, etc.). These actions can subsequently be linked to the associated Sustainable Development Goals. Such analysis will shed light on the collective impact of the contribution of NBSAPs toward fulfilling the SDGs. Generally, the full implementation of the NBSAP\u203as actions can contribute to several goals, including national food security, water security, economic growth, reduction of pollution and climate resilience. Further, the role of NBSAP as a policy instrument can pave the way for fast implementation of national sustainable development goals. The analysis of Bahraini NBSAP included its vision, mission and guiding principles. This was followed by analysing the national priorities actions, strategic goals and objectives and national targets. The detailed analysis of the Bahraini NBSAP is as follows: 78 NBSAP actions Analysis SDGs Vision: \u201cStrive towards improving resilience of all four ecosystems in the Kingdom and sustainably manage ecosystem services to ensure good quality of life for the Bahraini citizens by 2030.\u201d Improving resilience of all ecosystems in Bahrain, adopting sustainable management systems, securing ecosystems services and aiming for good quality of life for all Bahraini citizens contribute to several SDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a455dd38-8c88-405b-97e3-9783ecd08ad4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a455dd38-8c88-405b-97e3-9783ecd08ad4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "013e28474f44c7c3626ba806c2a67b9ed2187e69e9b989f031941f12a87bd075"}, "2": {"node_id": "1632cc6a-6bd7-45bd-986f-80319234a2c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77a5ba0b81ae77dfc7b3918a29b7b787a1d44514386193eefb1fef81956cf12c"}}, "hash": "51b33c2223f90342ea25d05fd7463c7aaa2f6c44349a4f3d2e8002431d5d6ff0", "text": "1.4, 2.4, 2.5, 2.a, 4.7, 6.5, 6.6, 8.4, 9.4, 11.4, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, 13.1, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c, 15.1, 15.3, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.a, 15.c Mission: \u201cBiodiversity in the Kingdom is assessed, mapped and valued and its conservation is integrated into all national policies and accounted for in national budgeting by 2021.\u201d Assessing, mapping and valuing biodiversity;

Secondary information is partly used in supporting questionnaire design and interpreting research findings. ii. Participatory rapid review Participatory rapid review is a key method in this assessment. This method has enabled key actors and stakeholders (SCE, ARCWH, DCG, DOF) and other stakeholders (UNEP/ROWA, IUCN/ROWA, etc.), to share and present information, facts and experience that relate to daily implementation of the biodiversity-related conventions through individual observations and informal interviews. A set of techniques and tools was adopted and used during a national workshop. iii. Synergies workshop A workshop addressing synergies, sustainable development goals and financing regarding biodiversity-related conventions in the national context of Bahrain was held in Manama, Bahrain from 30 November to 1 December 2016. The workshop took place with the participation of representatives from several national stakeholders, IUCN/ROWA and UNEP/ROWA. iv. Synergies questionnaires Questionnaires were developed in consultation with SCE, IUCN/ROWA and UNEP-ROWA in order to reflect the current situation and future options for synergies. The questionnaires were disseminated to all related stakeholders in Bahrain. Stakeholders filled the required sheets and the data obtained was analysed. 84 4. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIODIVERSITY- RELATED CONVENTIONS 85 4.1 CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL SYNERGY FRAMEWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIODIVERSITY RELATED CONVENTIONS This section provides an overview of the development of the institutional framework of biodiversity conservation in Bahrain. The Environmental Protection Committee (EPC), established by Legislative Decree No. 7 of 1980 under the Ministry of Health, was the first governmental authority concerned with environmental protection in Bahrain. The EPC was upgraded by Legislative Decree No. 21 of 1996, establishing \u2018Environmental Affairs\u2019 under the Ministry of Housing, Municipalities and Environment. In 2000, Environmental Affairs was reorganized under the Ministry of Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning. A second governmental body concerned with wildlife protection is the National Committee for Wildlife Protection, which was established by Legislative Decree No. 2 of 1995. This committee was upgraded to become the National Commission for Wildlife Protection by Legislative Decree No. 12 of 2000. Wildlife protection in Bahrain started as early as 1976 with the establishment of the Al-Areen Wildlife Park.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04f73988-b70f-4fd4-bc7d-31272471239e": {"__data__": {"id_": "04f73988-b70f-4fd4-bc7d-31272471239e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9e604ad1f4c010d6539ae883332ae8031f4e96b955533256e431c646e91cea0"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0c17ab6-0871-4d8c-8fbf-d1d5a68933d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d89761353e1b9474a8583e17a842ab00c8addbed32a487db12fe0a822c4d5fd"}}, "hash": "e337a5c6cc09df2b1b51dbf5539af20cd0db202063cc191dd56ed02b35674a6a", "text": "This park is among the earliest sanctuary areas in the Arabian Gulf region dedicated to the protection of endangered animals.

The Directorate of Fisheries is currently part of Agriculture and Marine Resources Affairs at the Ministry of Work, Municipalities and Urban Planning. Figure 1 shows the chronological development of environmental bodies in Bahrain. Figure 1: Institutions concerned with biodiversity in Bahrain 87 Steering Committee for Biodiversity Bahrain established a steering committee for biodiversity. This committee is composed of relevant institutions concerned with the protection of biodiversity in Bahrain. The ministerial rank is not less than undersecretary assistant. This committee was formed based on the Council of Ministers Order No. 44 of 2011 with respect to establishing the National Steering Committee for Biodiversity. According to this order, the committee aims to supervise the preparation and implementation of policies and programs aimed at preserving biodiversity and encourage the sustainable use of biodiversity resources. Additionally, it aims to ensure the fulfillment of the regional and international agreements related to biodiversity, particularly the obligations stipulated in the bilateral and multilateral agreements. The main tasks of this Committee include: \u2022 Prepare the national biodiversity strategy and action plan and ensure the effectiveness of its programs and activities. \u2022 Reexamine and update the national biodiversity strategy and follow up with the action plan and ensure that the plan is in harmony with the national priorities related to biodiversity. \u2022 Implement plans for mainstreaming biodiversity in all governmental and non-governmental sectors. \u2022 Identify potential terrestrial and marine protected areas with national, regional and international importance, especially those related to Ramsar and World Heritage Conventions. \u2022 Prepare guidelines for the selection of protected areas and prepare operational plans for these areas that are in line with the obligations of the country towards regional and international agreements. \u2022 Advise relevant parties when Bahrain joins bilateral and multilateral agreements related to biodiversity. \u2022 Review periodic national reports from the Secretariats of bilateral and multilateral agreements related to biodiversity. \u2022 Coordinate between all sectors in Bahrain to enhance Bahrain\u2019s efforts to preserve biodiversity in the regional and international forums and COP meetings. \u2022 Propose mechanisms to strengthen cooperation in biodiversity conservation with regional and international institutions, in particular GCC countries and the League of Arab States. \u2022 Supervise the implementation of biodiversity-related studies to assess the current condition and specify the anthropogenic threats to biodiversity resources. \u2022 Propose mechanisms and programs to enhance the human, financial and technical resources related to biodiversity in Bahrain. \u2022 Propose mechanisms and programs for environmental awareness in all Bahraini society. 88 The members of the committee were selected based on the Council of Ministers Order No. 81 of 2011 with respect to forming the National Steering Committee for Biodiversity.

Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities is considered the official institution responsible for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention. Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities was established by Directive No. 10 of 2015 with respect to establishing Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities. This Authority replaced the former Ministry of Culture and is administratively affiliated with the Council of Ministers. 89 4.2 CURRENT LEGAL SYNERGY FRAMEWORK RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIODIVERSITY-RELATED CONVENTIONS The implementation of a biodiversity-related convention is facilitated by a range of policies, strategies, national laws as well as regional and international agreements. The protection of biodiversity is widely reflected in several legal and environmental instruments ranging from the Constitution and the governmental action plan to national laws and international agreements. Constitution of Bahrain The protection of biodiversity and natural resources is reflected in the Constitution of Bahrain. Article 11 refers to the conservation of all natural resources. Similarly, Article 117 (A) emphasizes the legal regulation of investments in natural resources. Economic Vision 2030 The Bahraini Economic Vision (2030) stresses the conservation of natural resources for future generations. This Vision also encourages young generations of Bahrainis to gain the knowledge related to their cultural heritage. National Environmental Strategy Bahrain launched the National Environmental Strategy (NES), which was approved by the Council of Ministers in 2006 (Edict No. 02-1902 on 8/10/2006). The NES identifies mechanisms by which principles of sustainable development can be implemented, including enforcing the role of EIA during planning, implementation and after commissioning phases of major projects, adopting principles of integrated environmental management for coastal and marine environments, applying valuation systems to estimate the costs of environmental degradation and rehabilitation, strengthening institutional and legal frameworks and increasing public awareness and participation. Government Action Plan 2015-2018 Protection of the environment and conservation of natural resources are key elements in the Government Action Plan (2015-2016), which emphasizes the following: \u2022 Give priority, in particular, to projects related to the protection of coastal and marine protected areas and support greening projects. \u2022 Develop measures for the conservation of the environment and the protection of species, ecosystems and resources with environmental, economic and cultural importance. \u2022 Develop new control measures and increase the frequency of inspections. \u2022 Review and update the legislative framework of environmental issues to keep up with rapid developments and to ensure the protection of natural habitats, wild flora and fauna and marine life. \u2022 Develop awareness and environmental education projects and strengthen partnerships with the local community in various environmental fields. 90 Regional agreements The Convention on the Conservation of Wildlife and their Natural Habitats in the Gulf Cooperation Council Countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) provides the basis for integrating biodiversity issues within national and regional environmental strategies and policies. This convention also helps with the implementation of biodiversity-related conventions and aims to effectively conserve ecosystems and wildlife habitats. It is also concerned with the protection of threatened species at the regional level, especially when the distribution of these species goes across the international borders of two or more neighbouring countries or when these species migrate across the boundaries of member states. The Kuwait Regional Convention for Cooperation on the Protection of the Marine Environment from Pollution (Kuwait Convention), which was adopted in 1978, provides the basis for an integrated regional response to protecting biodiversity and combating pollution. Currently, there are four protocols under the Kuwait Convention: a protocol concerning regional cooperation in combating pollution by oil and other harmful substances in cases of emergency, a protocol concerning marine pollution resulting from exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf, a protocol for the protection of the marine environment against pollution from land-based sources and a protocol on the control of marine transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous wastes. These protocols collectively address the pollution of marine environment and propose criteria for protection and management of ecosystems and marine resources. National legislations Environmental legislations related to biodiversity in Bahrain are based on a range of directives, laws and orders with respect to the environment, regulation of fishing, exploitation of marine resources, protection of wildlife,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69edacb1-3466-45f0-9a24-a45214ae0dc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "69edacb1-3466-45f0-9a24-a45214ae0dc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd842dab17fe92c60f3ffa464848182d3d55b5a90f2dff8d82d4c5df9aacedd4"}, "3": {"node_id": "0888113c-829f-4139-8fc8-9da714e667f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "055a6b96b37b1a14b81da31193d49f8d7ec7474aed54618fc2a115d42b927979"}}, "hash": "d63286e87b464b398b33a019e6c6892955e8c3aefec3fc71e0c5ad8e32920555", "text": "environmental quality standards for wastewater effluents, declarations of protected areas and banning of catching endangered species.

Bahrain has taken several initiatives toward implementing the CBD such as strengthening environmental governance, establishing protected areas, incorporating biodiversity in education and adopting a participatory approach in biodiversity conservation. The main aspects of CBD implementation include: Environmental governance: The establishment of the Directorate of Biodiversity at the Supreme Council for Environment in 2012 is considered a major step towards strengthening the biodiversity governance. Establishment of protected areas: Recognizing the role of protected areas in conserving and maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services, Bahrain has established several terrestrial, coastal and marine protected areas.

Table 7: Natural coastal and marine protected areas in Bahrain 4.3 SUMMARY OF CURRENT NATIONAL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE SYNERGY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTIONS\u2019 DECISIONS 94 Education: Biodiversity and conservation issues have been incorporated in curricula at schools and universities. For instance, a course in conservation biology was held in the Department of Biology at the University of Bahrain in 2009. This course explored the principles of conservation biology, including biological diversity and its value, threats to biological diversity, conservation of the population and species levels and management of habitats and ecosystems. The course discussed aspects of biodiversity conservation in Bahrain. Several graduate students skilled in knowledge related to conservation biology joined relevant institutions. Environmental awareness: The Supreme Council for Environment, in cooperation with the Ministry of Information and Ministry of Education, has increased the aspects of environmental awareness through a range of media and activities. These include organizing lectures and workshops, producing short biodiversity films and TV advertisements and spreading the knowledge of biodiversity in Bahrain through local newspapers and magazines. Restoration programs: The transplantation project for cultivating and planting mangrove seedlings along the coastline of Tubli Bay began in 2013. This project aimed at rehabilitating the coastal area in Tubli Bay, which hosts the last remaining mangroves in Bahrain. Ecosystem-based management: A project aimed at improving the environmental, cultural and socio-economic management of protected areas in Bahrain through the application of an ecosystem-based management approach was carried out during from 2012 to 2014. The project was implemented through collaboration between the Supreme Council for Environment, the Bahrain Authority for Culture and Antiquities and the United Nations Environment Program. Studies related to ecosystem services valuation: Linking ecosystem services and human well-being can lead to a better understating of the importance of biodiversity by decision makers, stakeholders and the public. For that purpose, Bahrain has conducted initial studies to assess provisioning, supporting and regulating cultural goods and services provided by coastal and marine ecosystems in Bahrain. Participatory approach in biodiversity conservation: The SCE adopts the participatory approach to planning and implementing projects related to biodiversity in Bahrain. The involvement of stakeholders and NGOs in the programs related to the protection of biodiversity has substantially increased. Scientific research related to biodiversity: Scientific studies related to biodiversity have increased in the last five years. This is reflected in increased published articles, chapters and books related to biodiversity in Bahrain and the Arabian Gulf. The University of Bahrain and the Arabian Gulf University contribute significantly to the studies related to the environment and biodiversity. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): There is a growing number of NGOs concerned with the environment and biodiversity such as Bahrain Environment Society, Arab Youth Climate Movement, Youth and Environment Association and Friends of Environment Society. These societies are involved in several environmental initiatives and contribute to environmental awareness in Bahrain. 95 Overview of the implementation of CITES Several measures were taken to implement the requirements of CITES.

Additionally, several national legislations to protect turtles were issued in Bahrain. A range of national supporting laws to protect the marine environment in general will contribute to the protection of migratory species in the Arabian Gulf. These include laws and decisions establishing marine protected areas and regulating the marine resources. Overview of the implementation of Ramsar Hawar Islands and Tubli Bay were identified as wetlands of international importance in 1997. An initial management plan for Hawar Island was issued in 2003. Fishing around Hawar Islands was regulated by the Order No. 13 of 2005 by the Regulation of Fishing in Hawar Islands and their Territorial Waters. This order was amended by the Order No. 4 of 2010, which restricts the use of hadhrah (an intertidal fixed stake) in Hawar Islands. Measures were taken to protect Tubli Bay including controlling reclamation and conducting rehabilitation activities. The Ministerial Order No. 70 of 2011 for the Determination of the Reclamation Line in Tubli Bay directs all competent governmental authorities to take all necessary measures to protect the environment and wildlife in the bay. Additionally, a program was initiated to rehabilitate the degraded areas of Tubli by transplanting mangrove plants. Overview of the implementation of WHC Bahrain ratified the World Heritage Convention based on Directive No. 3 of 1991 with respect to Bahrain joining the World Heritage Convention. Since then, Bahrain managed to register two sites: Bahrain Fort and Pearling Road. Bahrain Fort, which is considered one of the major archaeological sites in the Arabian Peninsula, was registered as a UNESCO site in 2005. Pearling Road (Testimony of an Island Economy) was registered as a UNESCO site in 2012. Specialized studies, including ecological and socio-economic characterizations for the oyster beds areas were conducted. These studies helped in developing the strategic, ecological and operational objectives for the protection and specifying target indicators and monitoring programs for the Pearling Road. Bahrain established the Arab Regional Centre for World Heritage (ARC-WH) based on the directive No. 53 of 2010 for the ratification of the agreement between Bahrain and the UNESCO to establish this centre. This centre was established under the auspices of the UNESCO as an autonomous and independent legal entity at the service of Arab States Parties to the World Heritage Convention. The ARC-WH can play important role in soliciting efforts of implementing the WHC in Arab States Parties, including Bahrain. For instance, the ARC-WH supported the preparation of the National Red List for Bahrain. A preliminary list for potential UNSCEO sites in Bahrain includes Barbar temples, Aali Burial Mounds, Hawar Islands, and Sar Archaeological Site. Nationally, several archaeological sites were added recently to the national heritage list based on Order No. 2 of 2015 for the inclusion of archaeological sites in the Bahraini national heritage. According to this order, thirty five sites were declared and included in the national heritage list. 96 5. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIODIVERSITY- RELATED CONVENTIONS 97 5.1 CHALLENGES TO SYNERGY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BIODIVERSITY- RELATED CONVENTIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL Table 8 below presents a summary of challenges and recommendations identified by stakeholders during the National Workshop on NBSAP - Dealing with Synergies, SDGs and Financing which was organized in Down Town Rotana, Manama, Bahrain (30 November \u2013 1 December 2016). This table showing challenges and recommendations is not comprehensive and some of the stakeholders may find other issues that are relevant to them.

In Bahrain, these activities have been conducted for many years to increase people\u2019s awareness of their roles and responsibilities in biodiversity conservation. The national biodiversity strategy and action plan (2016-2021) for Bahrain calls, in its fifth national target, \u201cto raise awareness among 90% of key stakeholders and 50% of the general public.\u201d Bahrain also has a biodiversity awareness programme on natural resources and protection through a network of universities and research institutes. Education and training have also been carried out through training courses, workshops, information exchanges, etc.; however, biodiversity conservation knowledge and awareness of officials and communities need to be enhanced. So far in Bahrain, the development of national strategies, plans, programmes and legal framework (policies and laws) for implementing biodiversity-related conventions have initial achievements (see page 70). However, capacity-related issues that cross-cut these conventions and effectiveness of the implementation of the provided national plans, programmes and legal framework need to be supported. At the moment, coordination between the ministries, agencies, sectors, departments, agencies and localities is still weak and needs more efforts to be enhanced. Meanwhile, biodiversity problems are complicated and have great impacts; therefore, there should be an efficient cross-sectoral coordination mechanism to solve these problems. This is also a challenge for biodiversity conservation in general and for the implementation of the conventions, particularly in Bahrain, in the years to come. Currently, some of the thematic reports, research works, scientific research themes, investigation projects, etc. conducted by individuals and organizations that are funded by the government and/ or international organizations are scattered. The information-sharing mechanism between relevant ministries, sectors and agencies is still constrained. A significant problem faced in Bahrain is the capacity of the national focal points to respond to the demands of coordinating and implementing biodiversity-related conventions. Most focal points have only few officials assigned to handle the conventions, and in addition to a number of biodiversity conventions each has to handle, they are also invariably involved in other pressing national environmental activities. The lack of sufficient human resources tends to limit the ability of related agencies to effectively manage biodiversity-related conventions at the national and local levels. 99 5.2 OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER SYNERGY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BIODIVERSITY-RELATED CONVENTIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL 5.2.1 Common thematic approaches to the conventions All of the biodiversity-related conventions promote cooperation amongst each other in the context of NBSAP revision and implementation and point to convention specific issues that should be integrated in NBSAPs, e.g. biodiversity mainstreaming into sectoral and cross-sectoral plans (Ramsar Convention and CBD) and poverty eradication and development concerns and priorities (CBD). Furthermore, all the biodiversity-related conventions (except WHC) clearly address enhanced cooperation among NFPs. Similarly, CMS and CITES have already developed guidance documents to assist their parties in this process. CBD and CMS decisions promote the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the context of ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change. Similarly, CBD, CMS, CITES and Ramsar Convention have a number of decisions about enhancing monitoring programmes; these conventions point to a number of tools in that regard. CBD, CMS, WHC and Ramsar Conventions have decisions that promote cooperation in enhancing existing databases and strengthening information systems at the national, regional and global levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc1241ec-ef49-403d-8d5b-a313342a1994": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc1241ec-ef49-403d-8d5b-a313342a1994", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29d8d318ce35dbc7a69a12fca2c2bc238cf932c7a1a0754cb2277b2daa2acbf5"}, "2": {"node_id": "9676e1a6-bed4-4bfa-90ef-e7f736c38534", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b6d35f01a5a02f6891a78c8b87268d55999d1c6de116a577252769a32e55efc"}}, "hash": "ccd3d84e264fb4aef1e657bf8c82999b1e0bcb721814b4c558afbabef345e33e", "text": "Regarding awareness-raising, areas for considering coherent outreach include: engagement with agriculture and energy sectors (CBD, CMS, Ramsar Convention and WHC), sustainable use of wildlife and combating wildlife crime (CBD, CITES and CMS), sustainable tourism (CBD and Ramsar Convention), community-based approaches to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use (CBD, CITES, Ramsar Convention and CMS), control and risk analysis of IAS (CBD, CMS, Ramsar Convention), special biodiversity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf6fce02-50a9-4370-8fb9-6a4ace9ac505": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf6fce02-50a9-4370-8fb9-6a4ace9ac505", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c568e1ac592e64dc744ace6ed93aada03a49c41978ac4a55769436094b0a30bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "9cae8614-3504-4436-b892-05fca0a4cdad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10c713d5294ac9da0e39b31e4dab6685ae5e4785673b459d435cfe1c686f0a8e"}}, "hash": "1733660a5c93650681a948ad3d784b23e2c7cb726f568bd0920282a92481420b", "text": "events (i.e. World Days) (CBD, CMS and Ramsar Convention).

These opportunities were developed in harmony with the decisions by the biodiversity-related conventions, as well as recommendations from UNEP, for the governments as effective synergy mechanisms. The opportunities presented in this report are those that were suggested at either of the stakeholders meetings and then refined by national and international experts. 100 5.3 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Bahrain (NBSAP: 2016-2021) 1. Adopt a new law for the conservation of biodiversity and protected areas in Bahrain, where all PAs will be managed by one national organization (i.e. SCE). 2. Establish a national technical unit under the SCE titled \u201csynergy unit\u201d which will contain in its structure all the NFPs of the biodiversity-related conventions and at least one full-time staff responsible for each convention to help the NFPs build their capacities. Members of the \u201csynergy unit\u201d will work to liaise with NFPs, ensuring that the synergies between the different conventions are captured and implementation of the NBSAP is also harmonized. 3. Set up clear Terms of Reference (ToRs) for all NFPs responsible for the biodiversity-related conventions. In these ToRs, synergy efforts should be described in detail to ensure that all NFPs will work effectively to implement their conventions to conserve biodiversity. 4. Establish a dialogue platform that brings together NFPs of all conventions as a means to promote synergy and collaboration in the activities of the NFPs. 5. Organize a biennial national dialogue under the supervision of the SCE to ensure regular evaluation of the NBSAP implementation process. 6. All climate change, biodiversity and desertification projects funded by Bahrain\u2019s government should be assessed to ensure that they are mutually supportive of the objectives of the biodiversity- related conventions. 7. Conduct assessments every 5 years to evaluate the level of coordination among implementing agencies. 8. Develop a national road map as well as five-year plans for effective implementation of the biodiversity-related conventions. 9. Implement NBSAP. The Bahraini government needs to establish a new \u201cenvironmental police\u201d department under the Ministry of Interior to better enforce the existing environmental laws in general and in biodiversity-related conventions in particular. 5.3.1 National reporting to conventions a. Develop and monitor appropriate national sets of indicators to track progress. b. Develop harmonized reporting protocols for biodiversity in Bahrain. c. Evaluate the different reporting structures for the targeted conventions and identify the key areas of overlap between the required information of the biodiversity-related conventions. d. Identify opportunities to streamline the national reports and develop guidelines to support synchronized reporting. 101 The following table provides the main reporting requirements for the biodiversity-related conventions that could help NFP to conduct the harmonization reporting exercise: Table 9: Overview of the main reporting requirements of the biodiversity-related conventions Biodiversity-related conventions Type Types of Information Requested CBD A report every 4 years Status and trends of biodiversity; actions to implement the Convention; contribution to SDGs and the convention\u2019s Strategic Plan 2011-2020.

In light of Bahrain\u2019s commitment to achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, several national committees were established (e.g. Biodiversity Steering Committee) to achieve harmonization between policies, strategies and national action plans for development by executing specific indicators to determine implementation efficiency in different fields, such as environmental sustainability, enabling women and improving the quality of health and education. Decision makers for the SCE in Bahrain need to exert more effort to enhance the environmental trust fund mechanism and support more investment projects inside protected areas, particularly for ecotourism and medicinal plants, both of which generate revenue and provide job opportunities for local communities. Efforts must continue to receive funding from multilateral international agencies (e.g. UNDP/GEF, EU). A resource mobilization strategy is urgently needed for several reasons: \u2022 The long-term nature of NBSAP as a development strategy for biodiversity conservation in Bahrain needs to have its own financing mechanisms in order to mobilize funding for the national/international economic and political integration agenda. \u2022 Meeting Bahrain\u2019s requirements and commitments to achieve the CBD Aichi Targets for biodiversity conservation at the national level will need considerable financial resources. The overall objective of the proposed Resource Mobilization Strategy (RMS) is to ensure that there is a systematic and well-coordinated approach to acquiring, utilizing, managing, reporting, monitoring and evaluating assistance from international partners and for expanding the resource base to ensure sustainable resource availability for implementation of the NBSAP programmes in support of the national action integrating the Sustainable Development Goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ddee436-ead6-4bb7-ad8a-970aef1a7643": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ddee436-ead6-4bb7-ad8a-970aef1a7643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15ad20eb0f4eb59f385bcb8449ad5c555f273836a080ac8fd350519925d7c9f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "a499711f-d217-4fc6-902e-d07815929d1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b451e43b50e889ce59451f9f730e93dbd25699fc674dc0d54dca269f5a8f2d51"}}, "hash": "80435aeb6dcbf9214dd3002141a287098e0881fc949240ef10098c96d4e5576d", "text": "For developing an effective RMS for biodiversity-related conventions, the Bahraini government would need to consider the following: 105 6.2 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROPOSED RMS 6.2.1 Institutional capacity for resource mobilization The SCE should establish a multidisciplinary Resource Mobilization Committee (RMC) under its full policy and supervision with a mandate to: \u2022 Engage resource partners. \u2022 Negotiate resource partners. \u2022 Maintain a thematic cooperation principle. \u2022 Prepare and disseminate the RMS manual that facilitates the implementation of the process. \u2022 Review and update the financial mechanisms that may enhance the implementation of the RMS. \u2022 Ensure that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78813643-3852-4b94-937f-a69f756d93b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "78813643-3852-4b94-937f-a69f756d93b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99d2322ae15e6f216ecdcc7bdd80427dacf8a041f6d139b3f531f362c9478231"}}, "hash": "99d2322ae15e6f216ecdcc7bdd80427dacf8a041f6d139b3f531f362c9478231", "text": "the implementation of the RMS is aligned annually with the national plan and the NBSAP. \u2022 Maintain an annual work plan \u2012 entirely based on the RMS \u2012 with an expected timeframe and a synchronization to the RMS and its and planning cycle. \u2022 Communicate projects\u2019 implementation results. 6.2.2 Resource planning The RMC, through close consultation with relevant stakeholders, shall define the areas where resources will be required annually to enhance the active project portfolios according to the requirements of the NBSAP 2021. All financial resources acquired by the SCE shall be monitored and reported through the RMC. The RMC shall encourage cooperating partners to program their financial support over multi-year timeframes as well as make multi-year funding commitments in a manner that makes it easier for the SCE to plan and make good projections in accordance with predictable funding. The SCE shall request timely information on cooperating partners\u2019 commitments and disbursement schedules so as to secure the required predictability of external support and its effective integration into the planning system. 6.2.3 Resource budgeting and accounting \u2022 The RMC shall facilitate an effective and credible budget preparation process consistent with the SCE. The development of realistic budgets will remain a priority. \u2022 The capacity for planning, monitoring, evaluating and managing the budget will be strengthened further in order to facilitate reliable and timely reports that clearly separate commitments, allocated budgets and actual expenditure for all budgets. \u2022 The RMC must have the capacity to strengthen the implementation capacities to ensure that expenditures are in line with approved budgets and enhance the monitoring of budget execution to minimize the levels of discretion that could threaten the expenditure execution systems. \u2022 The RMC will \u2012 upon SCE approval \u2012 implement reforms, where necessary, to strengthen its budgeting and accounting systems. \u2022 The RMC shall be supported by a necessary IT infrastructure that enables it to create an enhanced electronic database that would capture key funding and budgeting information as well as to publish and share information on financial opportunities. 106 6.2.4 Resource Monitoring and Reporting The internal monitoring system will be one of the responsibilities of the RMC and shall be strengthened and aimed at generating and disseminating quality reports, which feeds back into the policy process for informed actions. Cooperating partners will be encouraged to adopt a single monitoring framework that stipulates common formats, content and frequency for reporting. The development and use of websites and related products will help improve information sharing among all stakeholders, including cooperating partners. In the same manner, the monitoring and reporting communication infrastructure (both hardware and software) shall be strengthened. Effective development assistance reporting and monitoring systems shall be fully integrated into the other existing systems that monitor all resources for the SCE cooperation programs. 107 6.3 DIVERSE AND SECURED FUNDING PORTFOLIO FOR BROADER RESOURCE CHANNELS The SCE shall diversify its funding mechanisms and exert more efforts to mobilize resources for biodiversity programs. The financial plan for the SCE that had been implemented in 2016 showed several mechanisms for generating domestic funds with their conditions and indicators, which can be summarized as follows: 6.3.1 Multilateral and bilateral assistance As the institutional structure operating the CBD\u2019s financial mechanism, GEF is the most important multilateral body that provides financial resources to developing countries that are CBD members. One of the more common criticisms directed at GEF is that project proposals often have to wait for up to six years to obtain funding. For this reason, in December 2012, the CBD COP called on \u2018GEF to avoid additional and lengthy processes.\u2019 Furthermore, the COP invited developed country parties and others to increase their financial contributions through the financial mechanism during the sixth GEF replenishment period (GEF-6) while recognizing the increase of funds under GEF-5, taking into account the substantial financial needs in order to implement the obligations of the Convention and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. 6.3.2 Carbon finance Carbon finance includes all sources of funding linked to reducing greenhouse gas emissions or adapting to climate change. In many respects, carbon finance represents one of the new and very promising opportunities available to support the long-term funding of biodiversity, PAs, indigenous lands and conservation projects. Carbon finance could take the form of carbon markets (\u2018cap-and- trade\u2019) or taxes on carbon emissions. Although various taxes on carbon (and other greenhouse gases) have been introduced at the national level, the international community has relied mainly on setting up carbon markets to tackle climate change. 6.3.3 Investment project concessions The best approach for this is that SCE has its own annual investment package agenda.

The concession revenues would be used at least for operation and fixed assets priorities related to conservation of biodiversity. 6.3.4 Joint venture partnership PA financing mechanisms that have emerged in recent years, including partnerships of PAs with private sector, NGOs and local communities as well as joint venture contracts with investors, offer a great chance to substantially increase revenues for PAs in the future, and can also help to stimulate broader improvements of PA management and sustainability. The partnership with the private sector can be addressed under Public Private Partnerships (PPP) sharing and may be under Building Operating Transfer (BOT) or Development Operating Transfer (DOT) agreements. 108 6.4 FINANCIAL NEEDS AND GAPS IN SYNERGY IN BAHRAIN Once the costs for all strategies and actions are identified, according to the NBSAP, the next step is to summarize all these costs. These costs can then be compared with the past financial baseline, as well as the projected future. As a starting point, during the synergy workshop, all participating stakeholders were asked to identify joint programmes that they think will support the synergy efforts in Bahrain. After collecting inputs from stakeholders, all joint programmes were described in the following table, where the identified programmes were linked to the targeted biodiversity-related conventions, allocated budget identified, planned budget recommended and the financial gaps calculated. As described in Table 10 and Figure 2, the following remarks were made: \u2022 There are several programmes with very limited budgets or even without a clear budget at all (e.g. green building, law enforcement and surveillance for environmental law, control of wildlife trade, declaration of new PA and rehabilitation of coral reefs). These programmes have big gaps in budget and SCE, through the proposed RMC, could seek more funds to cover these gaps as a priority. \u2022 Other programmes have a considerable budget (e.g. pest infestations in palm grove) but they still have gaps in budget and more efforts are needed to fill these gaps. \u2022 The remaining programmes have minor gaps in budget and they work well to some extent but they need also to collapse their gaps in the planned budget. \u2022 The total allocated budget, by the Bahraini government, for all programmes represents 15.2% of the planned required budget while the remaining 84.8% represents the total gap in the budget for all programmes to be implemented efficiently.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72a830e1-9ce6-4285-8011-62deba1154cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "72a830e1-9ce6-4285-8011-62deba1154cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergy among Sustainable Development Goals and biodiversity-related conventions in Bahrain", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06b88c531003b77d539caa09fcf8e40981209cc8447ad40f14b27c2c46c9016a"}, "2": {"node_id": "202b8e71-29b1-41f7-96e4-90cc701484ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergy-among-sustainable-development-goals-and-biodiversity-related", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1bbae3447d2ab8e6386541c12a0155f80e083f34bbf5caf99d42317d8d27859"}}, "hash": "7f57b8c6bb8b9eee7eea54112adc0e3b2960abf755cea4fc716372f8d1b8246b", "text": "109 Table 10: Current programmes identified by the different stakeholders No Stakeholders Program(s) / Project(s) Biaodiversity related conventions* Allocated budget ($) Planned budget ($) Gaps in budget ($) 1 Ministry of Works, Municipalities and Urban Planning Fish diseases lab CBD, CMS, Ramsar 66000 150000 84000 2 Pest infestations in palm grove CBD, CMS 350000 1000000 650000 3 Green building CBD, WHC 0 9000000 9000000 4 Waste recycling projects CBD, CMS, Ramsar 6000000 11000000 5000000 5 Afforestation CBD, CMS 500000 2000000 1500000 6 Gardens CBD 350000 2500000 2150000 7 Medicinal plants CBD, CITES 50000 3000000 2950000 8 Informatics and E-Government Authority General atlas of Bahrain CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 0 350000 350000 9 Agricultural atlas of Bahrain CBD 0 150000 150000 10 Directorate of Coast Guards Law enforcement and surveillance CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 0 750000 750000 11 Control of wildlife trade CBD, CMS, CITES 0 1200000 1200000 12 Ministry of Education Add curriculum to biodiversity in the education materials CBD 0 3000000 3000000 13 Scientific researches CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 1500000 4000000 2500000 14 National media Advertising CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 0 3000000 3000000 15 Documentary films CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 0 1000000 1000000 16 Supreme Council for Environment Combating crows CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES 0 2500000 2500000 17 Rehabilitation of mangrove CBD, Ramsar 70000 980000 910000 18 Declare new PAs CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 0 22000000 22000000 19 Water quality CBD, CMS, Ramsar 0 230000 230000 20 Aquaculture CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES 2000000 3000000 1000000 110 21 Management of marine PAs CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 800000 8500000 7700000 22 Rehabilitation of coral reefs CBD, Ramsar 0 3000000 3000000 23 Implementation of NBSAP CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 1060000 11800000 10740000 24 University of Bahrain Scientific researches in conservation of biodiversity CBD, CMS, Ramsar, CITES, WHC 0 1500000 1500000 26 Directorate of Fisheries Take and non- take zones CBD, Ramsar 0 1500000 1500000 Total 15230000 100110000 84880000 111 Figure 2: Financial gaps in programmes related to conservation of biodiversity 113 7.1 General recommendations The primary results of this report point out trends for better synergy in implementing the biodiversity- related conventions in Bahrain although they are limited to specific sectors.

Although physical capacity is the most widely quoted source of inadequate efforts in dealing with the conventions, both at the negotiation and implementation levels, it is lack of mainstreaming of the biodiversity conservation policies with national sustainable development policies that seems to be the biggest issue the country now faces. This report outlines an approach of synergy and harmonization that may provide a vision for implementing synergy among biodiversity-related conventions. The approach also provides an insight into the real challenges that national policy makers face when dealing with these issues. These insights can provide tips on how best to approach regional and global responses. The following recommendations aim to suggest options for further action to promote synergies, cooperation and harmonization and are addressed to decision makers within the Bahraini Government. However, it is important to recognize that the identification and implementation of synergies is a process that needs to be implemented in accordance with the identified needs, the ongoing processes and available resources of each convention. In addition, many of the following recommendations, if implemented, would require the institutional and financial commitment of substantial resources, which may not be readily available. Maintain communication with all stakeholders Joint liaison groups of the biodiversity-related conventions should be established and meet on a regular basis. This could be the responsibility of the SCE as the major engine for these groups. Enhance the existing information systems \u2022 Links among information management systems involving biodiversity-related conventions could be particularly supportive to the national implementation of these conventions. These links could be established around themes such as species or sites, with links to a range of specific information systems held by agencies and organizations. Traditional knowledge could play a major role in this. \u2022 Links to relevant websites of other conventions and mechanisms could be extremely useful, for example to the CBD Clearing-House Mechanism or NBSAP Forum, which encompasses a wide range of information and offers a number of search options. Harmonize reporting to biodiversity-related conventions \u2022 Joint standard data forms for the designation and/or description of sites, using, as appropriate, the same definitions and criteria, could be developed for a number of site-based conventions and instruments, allowing for an easier sharing of information and better access to relevant information. \u2022 Opportunities for multiple designations, under more than one agreement, could lead to more collaborative action, in particular for threatened sites and regarding the attraction of funding. \u2022 Joint site-based activities as already envisaged by few conventions could be developed for other conventions and provide case studies for on-the-ground cooperation. Such demonstration projects could develop lessons on how synergies between agreements manifest themselves at the national and local levels. 114 Focus on synergies at the national level \u2022 All relevant actors, especially staff in the relevant ministries, need adequate capacity, particularly in terms of relevant information and resources. This includes full participation of national delegations at the regional and global levels. SCE could work to develop an annual schedule of meetings, based on the regional and international agendas of meetings of the biodiversity-related conventions, for staff of related stakeholders and partners to ensure regular management capacity of these stakeholders as well as effective dissemination of updated information on conservation of biodiversity at the global level. \u2022 National and regional synergies workshops might provide a platform for developing synergies and linkages and discuss the benefits of a streamlined and harmonized approach to the implementation of the biodiversity conventions. \u2022 The National Focal Points in Bahrain could exchange information and conduct discussions of areas of common interest on regular basis. At highest levels, these meetings could discuss policies, e.g. in the context of national sustainable development. \u2022 SCE could be responsible for organizing national coordinating meetings ahead of meetings of the Conferences of the Parties to ensure an integrated approach and to avoid non-coordinated positions at COPs. These coordination meetings could also ensure a more integrated approach to reporting. \u2022 Development of a common approach to implementation of biodiversity-related conventions, including working on the basis of a single integrated programme or strategy, might be seen as a goal for national harmonization efforts. This approach could be combined with any of the above-mentioned mechanisms, and would clearly lead to greater integration at the national and the regional levels. 7.2 Technical recommendations National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan for Bahrain (NBSAP 2016-2021) \u2022 Set up clear terms of reference, by the national biodiversity steering committee, for all NFPs responsible for the biodiversity-related conventions.

Members of the \u201csynergy unit\u201d will liaise with NFPs ensuring that the synergies between the different conventions are captured and implementation of the NBSAP is also harmonized. \u2022 Organize periodic national dialogues, with two years\u2019 span under the supervision of the SCE, to ensure regular evaluation of the implementation process of the NBSAP and the other conventions. \u2022 SCE could establish a dialogue platform that will bring together NFPs of all conventions as a means to promote synergy and collaboration in the activities of the NFPs. \u2022 All climate change, biodiversity and desertification projects funded by Bahrain\u2019s government should be assessed by the national biodiversity steering committee to ensure that they are mutually supportive of the objectives of the biodiversity-related conventions. \u2022 For seeking effective implementation of the NBSAP, a new police department could be established known as \u201cenvironmental police\u201d (including enforcement of laws related to Bahraini NBSAP) under the Ministry of Interior, as currently the Coast Guard is overwhelmed by the enforcement of the environmental law. In addition, the existing penalties in the Bahraini environmental law are weak and need to be strengthened with regard to violations against the environment in general and biodiversity-related conventions in particular. 115 \u2022 Develop a national road map and five-year plans for effective implementation of the biodiversity-related conventions aiming to establish a national schedule for tasks related to all NFPs for effective implementation of NBSAP. \u2022 Conduct five-year periodic assessments to evaluate the level of coordination among implementing agencies. National reporting to conventions \u2022 Evaluate the different reporting structures for the targeted conventions and identify the key areas of overlap in the required information of the biodiversity-related conventions. \u2022 Identify opportunities for streamlining the national reports and develop guidelines to support synchronized reporting. \u2022 Develop and monitor appropriate national sets of indicators to track progress. \u2022 Develop harmonized reporting protocols for biodiversity in Bahrain that help the NFPs to develop reliable national reports to the conventions without any contradictions in facts and figures within these reports. Share information and raise public awareness \u2022 SCE, in coordination with the National Biodiversity Steering Committee (NBSC), can create a centralized national depository that will allow easy access to and/or storage of data for biodiversity reporting and build on existing facilities (e.g. CHM). \u2022 Make use of regional and global datasets (e.g. GBIF; IUCN) as a complementary source of data and encourage the usage of traditional knowledge (e.g. grey sources). \u2022 Conduct a five-year periodic assessment to identify gaps in information related to conservation of biodiversity to be sure that there is periodic update of biodiversity data and information. \u2022 Organize national dialogue on specific targeted national scientific research programmes to address gaps in information and develop unified monitoring protocols. \u2022 Organize regular events (workshops, campaigns, celebrations, international biodiversity days, etc.) to raise awareness of the benefits of coordination among the biodiversity-related conventions for all stakeholders. \u2022 Set up formal mechanisms (e.g. platform) to provide the high political levels and the parliament in Bahrain with information about the ongoing conservation processes (e.g. NBSAP implementation) and the key findings from national reports and conventions. \u2022 Develop guidance for mainstreaming content from biodiversity conventions into education curricula at universities and other educational institutions. Capacity building related to implementation of conventions for NFPs and related ministries \u2022 SCE should first conduct an assessment of human resources at the national level in Bahrain in order to identify gaps and needs related to the conservation of biodiversity. \u2022 Implement a staff rotation policy that can enhance the experience and connections of staff (even among NFPs). \u2022 Organize periodic common capacity building programs to NFPs and other related staff. \u2022 Hold preparatory meetings before COPs of biodiversity-related conventions to exchange information and develop a common vision for Bahraini negotiators. \u2022 Organize capacity building workshops for NFPs and other key stakeholders on the implementation of biodiversity-related conventions. 116

Of the total of 356 species, 148 (60.4% of those species included in the IUCN 2017 Red List, and 41.6% of all turtle and tortoise species) are officially listed as Threatened by IUCN crite- ria (categorized as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered). Additionally, if one takes into account pre- liminary assessments by the IUCN Tortoise and Fresh- water Turtle Specialist Group (TFTSG) of previously unevaluated species and updates in progress (Turtle Tax- onomy Working Group, 2017), 114 (32.0%) of all species are severely Threatened (CR or EN), 179 (50.3%) are Vul- nerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered, and 186 (52.2%) are either Threatened or Extinct. Overall, 10 taxa \u2013 7 species and 3 subspecies (2.1% of all taxa) \u2013 have gone extinct in recent human history. These percentages are more dire for turtles and tortoises than they are for the major vertebrate taxonomic groups. Only the nonhuman primates, with approximately 61% of species threatened with extinction, are in a more precarious state. The imperiled state in which turtles and tortoises exist is a tragic irony considering the remarkable set of evolutionary adaptations they possess. The shell, evolved over two hundred million years ago, has served them well, along with their extreme longevity. Unfortunately, these traits do not protect them from human develop- ment or depredations. In fact, the slow maturation time of all turtle and tortoise species leaves them extremely vulnerable to human pressures. Tortoises and freshwater turtles often play import- ant roles in the ecosystems they inhabit. The larger spe- cies serve as ecological engineers, consuming plants, creating trackways, and mediating competition among plant species. The seeds and spores of many plants, trees, and fungi are dispersed and often germinate more reli- ably after ingestion by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "613c6ce3-914b-4aa0-88ab-57eaa9bbab16": {"__data__": {"id_": "613c6ce3-914b-4aa0-88ab-57eaa9bbab16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Turtles in trouble", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12f47ba002cdbf84120dad269c2381a7982b17ff8b320d7304f6493194544100"}, "3": {"node_id": "e777162a-9105-4061-aca8-ea8760717a24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e08397fa5c89d94b4728f1cb4d9f7b3b0a00ecbda88bf9ab3295ebf0102b6326"}}, "hash": "f5fe4d92d14034a383f84c74558218dd0bb5765a975bd05ce88dc36acce66de7", "text": "turtles, while their droppings pro- vide instant fertilizer. In some tropical forests, tortoises are dispersers of the seeds of fallen fruit. The burrow- ing tortoises of North America provide habitat for myr- iad other species in their deep burrows. Diamondback terrapins keep populations of Littorina snails in check, which would otherwise overgraze and denude tidal salt marshes. Snapping and softshell turtles are important scavengers and contribute to maintaining clean aquatic ecosystems. Turtles and tortoises also play an important cultural role in human history, depicted in art and as icons of longevity and virility in many societies. Losing them would not only degrade ecosystems and contribute to the widespread loss of biodiversity; it would destroy an important piece of our culture. Tortoise and freshwater turtle populations are today under intense pressure from humans. Their populations are being extirpated by development, agriculture, and land and water pollution. They are eaten along with their eggs, collected both by people whose societies have done so for centuries, and to feed current, larger scale tastes for turtle meat and eggs. In some parts of the world tur- tles are used in traditional medicines. And the pet trade, both legal and illegal, severely threatens many species. While there are a few success stories \u2013 outlined later \u2013 most chelonians are in terrible trouble, with a few at the very edge of extinction. For example, a prominent and widely publicized example of the extinction crisis is the Ploughshare Tor- toise (Astrochelys yniphora), which had been in gradual decline for decades. Then a spike in poaching occurred since our previous Top 25+ publication in 2011, with many of the remaining and reintroduced tortoises having been poached, smuggled and sold into the international market. Many Ploughshare Tortoises were intentionally defaced by conservationists under Malagasy government authority by carving deep identifying markings on their dorsal scutes, in hopes this would lower their black mar- ket value and therefore deter poachers. Due to the ag- gressive demand for this highly sought-after species in the international pet trade, however, these efforts have not deterred poaching. 2 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 This updated publication is an effort to publicize the plight of tortoises and freshwater turtles by high- lighting those species that are at the highest risk of ex- tinction. We hope that, by calling greater attention to these magnificent animals, we can help generate more international attention, more resources, and more con- servation action to save them. Through the actions of conservationists around the globe, efforts have long been underway to protect threatened species of tortois- es and freshwater turtles. Time will tell if our actions are enough to prevent these species from sliding into extinction. Humans are the cause of the extinction cri- sis, and only humans can provide the solutions. Those of us in the turtle conservation community believe that saving these jewels of evolution is a battle that can and must be won. AN OBITUARY FOR CHELONOIDIS ABINGDONII, THE PINTA ISLAND GIANT TORTOISE We are sad to report that since our 2011 publica- tion of \u201cTurtles in Trouble\u201d Lonesome George, the last Pinta Giant Tortoise (Chelonoidis abingdonii) has passed away, and with this loss, the species is extinct. The tortoise population of the entire Galapagos archi- pelago before the whaling era is estimated to have been at least 250,000 tortoises. Perhaps 15,000 remain on the islands today, and at least three islands have lost their tortoises altogether (though reintroduction efforts are underway). Lonesome George died on June 14, 2012, at the Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island. He had lived there since 1972 when he was removed from Pinta Island in the hope of breeding him to females of the closely related Chelonoidis becki. Unfortunately, no fertile eggs were ever produced.

In the case of the Pinta Giant Tortoise, one last surviv- ing member lived on and on, reminding us of our past depredations against his species and beckoning us to try one more time to save it. In the case of Lonesome George, it may have been too little, too late, but new hope has recently arisen from finding hybrid animals alive on Volc\u00e1n Wolf on Isabela Island. These are being brought back into a focused captive breeding program on Santa Cruz Island that may restore the species to the wild in coming generations. THE TOP 25+ THREATENED TURTLES: HISTORY AND METHODS OF THE LISTING PROCESS Every four years since 2003, a working group of tortoise and freshwater turtle conservationists has pub- lished a list of the Top 25 most threatened species. The first Top 25 list was produced by the Turtle Conserva- tion Fund, entitled Top 25 Turtles on Death Row. The second edition was issued in 2007 by the Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. It expanded the list to move beyond 25 species and arranged the spe- cies in rough order of extinction risk; it also presented regional lists. The third edition in 2011 was published by a working group of individuals representing a range of chelonian conservation organizations, who adopted the name Turtle Conservation Coalition to reflect the collaboration. This update continued to add species be- yond the Top 25 (and was then branded the Top 25+), recognizing the growing list of species at imminent risk of extinction. While not rank ordered by extinction risk, the 2011 list was categorized into the Top 25, \u201cthe other Top 40\u201d and \u201cOthers.\u201d In this 2018 update we re- view a total of 50 species. Like previous editions of the Top 25+ endan- gered turtles, this document has selected the species for inclusion entirely based on the survival prospects and extinction risks of individual species, without regard to any possible prioritization based on phylogenetic uniqueness, lineage history, geographic or taxonom- ic priority, or ecosystem significance of the species in question. As much as possible, it reflects the estimat- ed risk of extinction for each species, rather than any broader considerations. PATTERNS OF THREAT TO TORTOISES AND FRESHWATER TURTLES As a group, turtles and tortoises face a greater ex- tinction risk than almost any other vertebrate group. It is remarkable that over the past 100 years only three or four taxa of turtles and tortoises have become ex- tinct (Chelonoidis abingdonii and Kinosternon hirtipes megacephalum, Pelusios castaneus seychellensis, and possibly Chelonoidis phantasticus, Table 1). More than half the extant species are, however, under threat. The geographic distribution of the Top 25+ species com- prises five continents but is heavily skewed to Asia, the continent with the greatest species richness: 17 of the most threatened 27 species (63.0%) are native there. The skew is also evident if we consider the entire list of 50 species, of which 29 (58.0%) are Asian (Table 2). This skewed representation applies to countries as well, with 11 species (22.0%) of the Top 50 coming from China and 9 (18.0%) from Vietnam. India and Indonesia are third and fourth on the list of countries with the largest number of threatened species, followed by Madagascar (Table 3). The turtle and tortoise extinction crisis has its epicenter squarely in Asia. This is in part because Asia\u2019s turtle richness is high, with more species to be impact- ed. The primary causes, however, are the intense levels of harvest of adults and eggs, the extensive habitat deg- radation and loss, and the international trade in turtles and turtle products. Taxonomically, the Top 25+ comprise seven tor- toise and freshwater turtle families. As one would ex- pect from the geographic balance, the families and genera hit hardest are those with species inhabiting Asia. The largely Asian family Geoemydidae \u2013 the Old World Pond Turtles \u2013 includes 20 species of the Top 50 (40.0%); the tortoise family Testudinidae includes 13 species in the Top 50 (26.0%). The genus that has been hit hardest by extinction threats is Cuora \u2013 the Asian \u201cbox turtles\u201d \u2013 accounting for five of the Top 25 species and 11 of the Top 50 species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b02912ee-651c-467b-8106-0ec0f48a58d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b02912ee-651c-467b-8106-0ec0f48a58d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Turtles in trouble", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "17fb6b8f4aa47503f0027156f55d7fa39c1e965610200d4d6dcad42c2070da01"}, "2": {"node_id": "86dbc033-ddc0-4443-8e99-c8a288044ee9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cda48b77ad2d58bd0ab427788c1c3a4078a90380f53d8783543b7904766c04d"}}, "hash": "85043783dbf6e92d1a409b66cfdf21ea86138368bee0e603a4cf2c94c870a956", "text": "The large river turtles of the genus Batagur also account for five of the Top 25 4 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 species.

Some generalities emerge, however, from a preliminary analysis, including the very high EDGE values for monotypic genera and fam- ilies known to have deep phylogenetic ages (Joyce et al. 2013; Crawford et al. 2015; Shaffer et al. 2017) includ- ing Dermatemys mawii, Carettochelys insculpta, Platys- ternon megacephalum, and Pseudemydura umbrina. Meanwhile, EDGE values for relatively young genera with multiple highly threatened species such as Cuo- ra or Batagur are significantly lower. Asia is the epicenter of the chelonian extinction risk crisis. The historical desire in Asia for turtles as food, traditional medicines, and more recently as pets has been an important part of the increased global use of turtles and tortoises. Economic development in China and other Asian countries has elevated the use of chelonians to unsustainable, commercial levels. The impacts of the trade in Asia were detailed by van Dijk et al. (2000) and Horne et al. (2012); the threat has only grown more intense in the years since. Turtles and tortoises are often highly valued as symbols of good luck, virility, and longevity, and the pet trade in Asia has skyrocketed. Combined with the rapid decline of many Asian species, this has created a marketplace in which the value of an individual turtle may command an astronomical price, creating an economic incen- tive for intense collecting, poaching, and smuggling. This trend sadly extends globally; the Asian countries have joined Europe and North America as importers of turtles from other regions, and both protected and unprotected rare species from North America, Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere are being transported and smuggled to Asia. RECENT PROGRESS AND SUCCESS IN CHELONIAN CONSERVATION In the midst of a crisis of imminent extinction risk to so many species, there is also progress to report. In-situ conservation success is always the top priority; saving wild populations before they are extirpated is preferable to attempting large scale captive breeding projects followed by reintroductions. Reintroductions involve risks, including husbandry and breeding ex- pertise, sometimes with species that are delicate in cap- tivity and simply fail to breed. Other issues include the financial cost of human labor and physical space need- ed for captive rearing projects to head start juveniles prior to release, site fidelity of animals following their release, the risk of resumed poaching after release, and the possibility of pathogens acquired in captivity being transmitted to wild populations. Head starting and re- lease of captive bred juveniles is a risky venture to be undertaken only when other strategies have failed. Habitat protection via land acquisition is one key aspect of the conservation effort to protect turtles and tortoises.

Land purchase alone is of course not enough to safeguard the animals on it. Land management \u2013 in- cluding building infrastructure, fencing, creating pro- tection from fire, water level changes, predators and invasive species, establishing anti-poaching patrols and monitoring biodiversity \u2013 is an essential follow-up to land acquisition. Working with local communities to build a cooperative, collaborative relationship is es- sential. For land acquisition to succeed, the investment of resources, time and funding in the site and species must be intensive and long term. Land stewardship, monitoring and evaluation, adaptive management, and enforcement are all necessary components of effective conservation programs. Land acquisition must often be comprehensive to be effective. The Trombetas Biological Reserve in Bra- zil was established in 1979 primarily to acquire and protect the nesting beaches of Podocnemis expansa, which numbered 10,000 nesting females at that time. The number of nesting females had declined to 860 by 1989, and in 2017 fewer than 200 nested, showing that even though the species is fully protected within a biological reserve, access by poachers cannot neces- sarily be controlled. Effective reserves for freshwater river turtles may need to include the entire river basin. Most reserves throughout the world use rivers as the boundaries, which allows poachers to operate freely on the unprotected side of the river. Legal protection of specific species is a corner- stone of conservation, and tortoises and freshwater turtles have been among the species prioritized for protection under legislation. A wide range of laws, regulations and conventions are in effect at local, na- tional, and international scales concerning most turtle species, with effects ranging from the designation and protection of critical habitat, through restrictions on collection, possession, and local, national and interna- tional trade, to supporting research and trade moni- toring. The effectiveness of laws and regulations is of- ten difficult to judge, particularly as illegal activities may continue with little risk of effective prosecution. The freshwater turtles (and their eggs) of Neotropical Mexico were, for example, protected by law since 1975. Dematemys mawii has nevertheless been nearly exter- minated in Mexico, including in protected areas. Many turtle species have, however, avoided excessive impacts from exploitation and trade, and for others those im- pacts have been restrained \u2013 threats and impacts could have been much worse without laws or regulations, particularly for Mediterranean tortoises (Testudo spp.), North American box turtles (Terrapene spp.), Alliga- tor Snapping Turtles (Macrochelys spp.), Asian geoe- mydids and softshells, and many more. When in-situ conservation efforts fail or are unsustainable, conservationists may turn to captive breeding with plans to reintroduce head-started juve- niles into the wild. Whether this is feasible in the short term depends entirely on the local situation. Whether appropriate habitat still exists is a primary concern, as is whether the original cause of population extirpation is still in effect. Poaching must be mitigated and lo- cal communities must be educated about the value of having the animals living near them. Head starting 8 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 projects that succeed may require years of effort before positive results can be demonstrated. Reintroductions of the Burmese Star Tortoise (Geochelone platynota) have begun in Myanmar. Re- cently considered ecologically extinct in the wild, more than 10,000 G. platynota hatchlings have been produced in assurance colonies in Myanmar. The cur- rent captive population is growing at a rate of 37% per year in three captive breeding centers. We expect the captive population to exceed 14,000 individuals by ear- ly 2018. Additionally, two experimental releases of 750 head-started tortoises into two protected areas have so far been successful. Intensive monitoring of released tortoises via radiotelemetry has documented high sur- vivorship, and reintroduced tortoises have begun to re- produce in the wild.

The Madagascar Big-headed Turtle (Erym- nochelys madagascariensis) has been successfully bred at a captive breeding center at Ampijoroa, Madagascar, and some limited reintroductions have occurred. The Galapagos Islands, scene of our only tor- toise or turtle extinction in the past forty years, is also the setting for dramatic successes. Captive breeding of the last 13 remaining Chelonoidis hoodensis \u2013 the saddle-backed Espa\u00f1ola Giant Tortoise \u2013 has led to reintroduction of their offspring and restoration of a breeding population on Espa\u00f1ola Island. More than two hundred have also been introduced to Santa F\u00e9 Island. A similar potential success is occurring on Pinz\u00f3n Island, where after more than 100 years of no reproduction, clearing that island of rats has allowed reintroduction of juveniles of that species (C. duncan- ensis) to their native habitat, and successful growth and reproduction are occurring. In the Indian Ocean, Aldabra Giant Tortoises, whose numbers were deci- mated in the late 19th century, have rebounded on Al- dabra atoll, and the species is abundant in captive and semi-captive settings across the islands of the Indian Ocean and around the world. The Western Swamp Turtle (Pseudemydura umbrina) Nature Preserve was a critical step in preventing the extinction of this species. Gerald Kuchling 9 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles DEFINING SUCCESS An important metric of success in the turtle con- servation world is the successful reproduction of a pop- ulation of turtles, either persisting in or reintroduced into the wild, leading to a long term viable population. This alone, however, may not be enough to declare a program successful in the long term. We must also place our programs in a long-term ecological and evolution- ary conservation context by combining information on demography, ecology, genetics, and management measures. This will require an understanding of the changing environment, including climate change and perturbations in land use, so that these can be factored into demographic projections. Resistance and resilience of a population to change are important considerations in assessing success of either in-situ protection or re-in- troduction programs. When all three metrics \u2013 demog- raphy, ecology, and genetics \u2013 are incorporated into monitoring, evaluating, and adapting a program, we can make specific determinations of success and also direct future efforts based on those data. Success is not just producing more juvenile turtles; instead we must recruit more turtles into habitats where they can fulfill all their life history stages and resume their ecological role within the ecosystem over many generations. This is a difficult task because reducing anthropogenic mor- tality must occur simultaneously with increases in re- cruitment and survivorship if we are to see population growth or recovery. As a conservation community, we must work together to define how these metrics of suc- cess should be prioritized. For example, the Vietnamese Pond turtle (Maure- mys annamensis) is functionally extinct in the wild, but is being bred in sizeable numbers in Europe, the Unit- ed States, and Vietnam. Although the species has been removed from an extinction trajectory, suitable habitat has not been protected for this species and turtles have not been returned to the wild. Moreover, the species has yet to garner the turtle conservation community\u2019s at- tention in a manner that would allow for sufficient res- toration efforts. Multiple generations have been raised in captivity. Unfortunately, large scale captive breeding often leads to artificially selecting for traits and/or indi- viduals that survive better in captivity, which may not thrive when returned to the wild. Ex-situ turtle collec- tions must be accompanied by proactive and innovative adaptive management in-situ. THE FUTURE OF TORTOISE AND FRESHWATER TURTLE CONSERVATION The mission of the individuals and groups work- ing to protect turtles and tortoises is that none of the species on this list slides into extinction. We work to- ward the full ecological conservation or recovery of all these species in the wild. Such recovery must include genetically diverse and numerically robust populations combined with a functional restoration of each species\u2019 demography, life history, and ecology.

For a few species, extinction risk has been avert- ed through captive breeding, even though a safe hab- itat to reintroduce them into the wild may no longer exist. Other turtle species at present appear relatively secure from extinction because at least some of their populations are securely protected in optimal native habitat. For many others, their future hangs in the bal- ance. Without further conservation action, many of the 50 species detailed in the accounts that follow will be extinct in the near future. A few may even disappear before the publication of the next edition of this list. Conservation monitoring and conservation action are constant; extinction is permanent.

Capture for consumption, river damming, wetland destruction, and water pollution reduced the global population to only three individuals, one in a reservoir west of Hanoi and a captive pair in China residing since 2008 in Suzhou Zoo. The female, with a minimum age of 80 years and owned by Changsha Zoo, has laid eggs each year since, but so far all have been infertile. Examination of the old male in 2015 revealed a severely damaged pe- nis, reduced to a stump without seminal grooves, prob- ably the result of a battle with another male decades ago. Since he is unable to inseminate the female, artificial in- semination, so far largely untested and never successful in any turtle, remains the only hope to produce a new generation of this magnificent species. Electro-ejaculation confirmed motile sperm, but semen quality and quantity appear to be suboptimal. Three attempts at artificial insemination have so far not resulted in fertile eggs or hatchlings, but experi- ence has been gained and techniques have improved with every attempt.

The species is restricted to a single protected area, Baly Bay Na- tional Park, in northwestern Madagascar, created in 1998 with the tortoise as the primary conservation target. A cap- tive breeding program was established in 1985 to increase numbers of Ploughshare Tortoises for release back into the wild. The initial release target of 100 captive-bred animals back in the wild was reached in 2015. The main pressure on wild animals, poaching for the illegal pet trade, has grown to such an extent that, despite concerted protection efforts in the field, the species is now near extinction. There are likely fewer than 100 animals remaining in the wild. This illegal trade was enabled by the political unrest in 2009, after which there was an exponential increase in poaching activities. Collaborative efforts between NGOs and government part- ners in Madagascar and Southeast Asia have directly addressed the illegal trade chain, by targeting smugglers, working with law enforce- ment and supporting greater international collabo- ration. These efforts are beginning to gain some traction. Current efforts to save the ploughshare tortoise have three core components: 1) secure the remaining wild ani- mals and remove the threat from poaching, 2) ensure the continuation of a physically and genetically safe breeding program, and 3) support Madagascar to build the necessary capacity to arrest and prosecute smugglers caught illegally removing the country\u2019s natural heritage. The hundreds of animals now held illegally need to be moved into multiple secure captive breeding programs in order to prepare for eventual repatriation to the species\u2019 native habitat. Ploughshare Tortoise 16 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 Cuora yunnanensis (Boulenger 1906) China IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Cuora yunnanensis was described in 1906 from Yunnan Province in southern China. After its initial description, it all but van- ished from scientific view for the next near- ly 100 years. This predominantly brown colored turtle reaches carapace lengths of 12\u201319.5 cm, males being smaller, flatter and with a larger and thicker tail. It was the first freshwa- ter turtle that was officially listed by IUCN as extinct in 2000. In 2004, however, photos of a female specimen ap- peared in China. Only a few months later, an adult male appeared in the local pet trade. This pair was the first to reproduce in captivity. In 2006 another female specimen was found in a local Yunnan market and after extensive searching, in 2008 the habitat of the species was finally found by a research team. This population has over the years largely been transferred into a local as- surance colony, where about 50 specimens are maintained and some breeding success has been achieved. A few other populations have been found by hunters in recent years due to the increasing demand for this high- priced and sought-after species, with about 20 specimens having been sold to private Chinese turtle collectors. No living specimens of this species exist out- side of China. While the species was able to survive for nearly a century undisturbed, its recent discovery threatens the rather small and endemic population of this species; furthermore, human development in Yunnan combined with severe droughts and ongoing habitat destruction has led to a potential habitat decrease of more than 98%. Yunnan Box Turtle 17 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles The Northern River Terrapin, Batagur baska, has declined largely due to over-col- lection of both adults and eggs for human consumption and is now rare in the rivers and deltas of India, Bangladesh, and Myan- mar. Habitat loss and degradation due to sand mining, dam construction, and pollution have also contributed to this species\u2019 decline. To date no active nesting locations have been found in the wild, but the presence of the occasional juvenile in Bangla- desh suggests that there some breeding still occurs in the wild. The Northern River Terrapin was until recent- ly considered to range from India to Indonesia, but a genetic analysis determined that what was previously considered one species was in fact two separate species; the Northern River Terrapin, Batagur baska, and the Southern River Terrapin, Batagur affinis.

Batagur baska (Gray 1830) Bangladesh, India & Myanmar IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Northern River Terrapin 18 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 Once on the brink of extinction with fewer than a dozen individuals remaining, the Myan- mar Roofed Turtle, Batagur trivittata, now numbers close to a thousand captive individu- als. The majority of these are in four assurance colonies: three in Myanmar and one in Singapore. Efforts to supplement wild populations are ongoing with experimental releases of head-started turtles. Early re- sults from the releases show that the turtles can disperse long distances and survive. Unfortunately, some were also killed either by drowning in fishing nets or by the concussive blast of dynamite fishing. Once numbering in the hundreds of thousands, this large river turtle has undergone drastic declines due to many years of hunting and harvesting of eggs. Habitat destruction and degradation have contributed to its low population levels. In 2005, the Myanmar Forest Department began protecting the nesting beaches on the upper Chindwin River, and to date (2006- 2010) 376 hatchlings have been transferred to the head-starting facilities. With a ro- bust captive population serving as a hedge against extinction, recovering the wild popula- tion to its former ecological role is the next goal. Co- inciding with the release of 25 head started turtles, there was an increase in the rate of viable eggs hatching. Prior to this there were multiple years where there was very low hatching success, sometimes zero, which suggests that very few males remain in the wild. It is hoped that confirmation of the released turtles mating with wild females can be determined via paternity analysis. Batagur trivittata (Dum\u00e9ril & Bibron 1835) Myanmar IUCN Red List: Endangered TFTSG: Critically Endangered Myanmar Roofed Turtle 19 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles This Cuora species only became known to science when it was described in 1990 based on a handful of specimens from two mar- kets in southern China\u2019s Guangxi Province bordering with Vietnam. A year later, the species received a synonym, Cuora pallid- icephala, by American scientists, having re- ceived specimens of this species in 1989 from a Hong Kong turtle trader. These specimens were said to have originated in southern China\u2019s Yunnan Province. Cuora zhoui has a brownish to black carapace, a black plastron with a distinct yellow central figure and an olive colored head. Adults reach a carapace length of 15\u201322 cm and sexes can be differentiated by the larger tail and concave plastron present in males. Despite intensive searches for nearly three decades both in China and Vietnam, this species has not yet been found in the wild. Based upon the low number of specimens (< 200) that have ap- peared in the trade between 1990 and 2010, this species probably has a highly restricted range. No new specimens are known since 2009, increasing the fear that it might be ex- tinct in the wild already. In captivity, about 200 wild caught founders ex- isted, but this number has decreased to fewer than 30 in the last decade. A handful of breeders have been able to reproduce this species, the most successful being Elmar Meier in Germany, producing more than 80 hatchlings from three breeding pairs. The world captive population totals about 140 specimens. Without a known habitat, there is high potential of it being extirpated in the wild already. With a very small gene pool in captivity, its future is bleak.

It is Critically Endangered, with a declining wild population estimated at fewer than 1,000 individuals. More than 90% of the species\u2019 low elevation (70\u2013600 m) habitat has been lost to agricultural expansion and urbanization over the past two centuries. Most of the remaining tor- toise habitat exists as very small, isolated fynbos patches on private farms that cannot support viable populations. Tortoises have disappeared in recent decades from sev- eral small, previously created preserves. The bulk of the surviving population is restricted to two protected ar- eas totaling about 1,300 ha that continue to be compromised and threatened by wildfires and invasive alien plant species. Local pred- ators of juvenile Geometric Tortoises, par- ticularly crows and ravens, exhibit rapidly increasing populations in this human-trans- formed landscape and likely suppress natural recruitment in the remaining tortoise populations. Rapid global warming affecting South Africa is expect- ed to magnify seasonal drought and wildfire risk. The species is a top conservation priority for the provincial government (CapeNature). As one mitigation measure a small semi-captive assurance colony (in native habitat) and head-starting program is now being implemented. Psammobates geometricus (Linnaeus 1758) South Africa IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Geometric Tortoise 22 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 Cuora aurocapitata is a highly aquatic Asian box turtle, reaching a carapace length of 10\u201319.5 cm. It is sexually dimorphic; males are smaller than females and have a flatter carapace and longer, thicker tail. In 2017, the species was split into two subspe- cies: the nominate subspecies from southern Anhui and the new subspecies Cuora aurocapitata dabieshani from central Anhui. Like many of the recently described Cuora, its sci- entific description in 1988 triggered its demise. It took until 2004 for scientists to find the species in the wild for the first time since its description. While already collected and consumed by the local villagers for cen- turies, the pet and medicinal trades became interested in this bright yellow-headed species, leading quickly to unsustainably high levels of col- lection from the wild. By the late 1990s, the population of this endemic and rare spe- cies collapsed due to over-collecting, and also pollution and destruction of its habitat. This trend has been ongoing due to sand min- ing for China\u2019s ever growing building industry, river regulations, hydroelectric dams, poison and dynamite fishing techniques. No new specimens have been re- corded in China since 2013 and it is feared to be extinct in the wild. Worldwide captive stock is estimated to have reached 600\u2013800 specimens and breeding success is increasing. Potential future release projects are hin- dered by the lack of existing habitat.

It is the largest member of the subfam- ily Cyclanorbinae. Cyclanorbis elegans can be distinguished from its congener C. sene- galensis by the presence of two, or less com- monly, four plastral callosities in adults. The smaller C. senegalensis has up to nine callosities. This species is highly aquatic and carnivorous, and inhab- its only the large water basins and wide river tracts in the Sahelian and Sudanian belt. Despite its potentially wide distribution (including Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Ghana, Nigeria, South Sudan, Sudan, and Togo), this species has rarely been captured in the wild and very rarely recorded during the last 50 years; there is presently no single individual in captivity throughout the world. There is no evidence of any wild specimens record- ed during the last 15 years, despite several long-term field surveys in the region. There is currently very little hope for the survival of any wild population of this species in Gha- na, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, or Cameroon. It is possible that the species still survives in a few remote White Nile wetlands of South Sudan (nearby historic records from Mongalla, adjacent to Bandingilo National Park), where some interviews with local fishermen suggest that this species may still be found there. Indeed, field research has been started in 2017 by an international team in South Sudan.

The carapace is chestnut brown with three longitudinal stripes, giving the species its scientific name. The plastron is black and the head is yellow with black lines and a brown blotch behind the eye. In 2017, the species was split into two subspecies: the nominate subspecies endemic to the Chinese mainland provinc- es of Fujian, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Guangxi, and a new subspecies, Cuora trifasciata luteocephala, on Hainan Island. This species has a long history in Chinese folklore and traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years, C. trifasciata has become a financial in- vestment and status symbol in China, and is the most sought-after turtle in China. Its Chinese name translates as \u201cGolden Coin Turtle\u201d because of its value. It is be- ing farmed by the thousands in China, but the demand for wild specimens is still high. The last three decades of intense collecting and massive habitat destruction and degradation have brought it to the brink of extinction in the wild. Estimates are as low as 500 specimens remaining in the wild. Fewer than twenty specimens per year are still reported by hunters, with a last potential strong- hold in Hong Kong, though in recent years illegal trap- ping has led to an almost complete population collapse. On Hainan, the last strongholds are within well-pro- tected military areas. Farmed C. trifasciata are of little conservation value due to hybridization with related species.

Geochelone platynota has historically been collected by villagers; some were sold in Chinese food markets or used in traditional Asian medicine. More recently it has become highly prized in the international pet trade, resulting in the removal of nearly all animals from the wild. Destruction of its habitat continues as the dry zone is the most densely populated region of Myan- mar. A National Action Plan developed in 2012 resolved to return G. platynota to ev- ery protected area within its former range. This habitat could in theory support hundreds of thousands of tortoises. Captive breeding in Myan- mar has been highly successful, and the captive popula- tion is growing rapidly. Experimental releases of three- year-old head started animals, at a size large enough to avoid predation by rats, has demonstrated high survival rates, site fidelity, and eventual reproductive success.

Geochelone platynota (Blyth 1863) Myanmar IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Burmese Star Tortoise 27 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles Chelodina mccordi is a medium-sized side- necked turtle (maximum carapace length 24 cm) found on the small Indonesian island of Roti (Rote) as well as in Timor-Leste. Three subspecies are currently recognized: C. m. mccordi (Western Roti Snake-necked Turtle), C. m. roteensis (Eastern Roti Snake- necked Turtle), and C. m. timorensis (Timor Snake- necked Turtle). The Timor-Leste taxon may be a sepa- rate species. Chelodina mccordi has an extremely limited distribution. Its Roti population has been subjected to habitat loss, predation by invasive fish species, and extensive collection for the international pet trade; it became commercially extinct within 10 years of its de- scription. It may be extinct in the wild, the last known record being in 2009, despite recent field surveys. Agri- culture is the primary factor leading to land use change on Roti, with much of the historical habitat for C. mccordi now being used for farming, ren- dering previous habitats unsuitable for tur- tles. The population in Timor-Leste may be relatively stable, as most of its distribution falls within the protected boundaries of Co- nis Santana National Park. No formal government-designated protected areas exist on Roti that encompass C. mccordi habitat; however, traditional island leaders have now declared its habitat (local freshwater lakes) protected by traditional law. In addition, land owners of the best remaining lake habitats have announced that they will collaborate with conservation efforts. Captive breeding via ex-situ assur- ance colonies in North America, Europe, and Asia pro- vide hope for eventual reintroduction of captive-bred individuals.

Geographic barriers further limit the species\u2019 range. The species occurs sympatri- cally with M. sinensis, with hybridization seen in both the wild and captivity. The closely related M. mutica is found in close proximity in Hue province, although no intergrade area is identified. Historically abundant, M. annamensis is now ex- tirpated throughout much of its former range. Habitat loss and degradation have been severe, in particular the agricultural conversion of wetlands for rice cultivation. As recently as 2013, animals reported as locally caught were appearing in the wildlife trade within its range. Collection for the Chinese market, for traditional food and medicine, in the 1980s and 1990s put in- tense pressure on the species. Wholesale wild collection has now largely ended due to the rarity of wild specimens. Increases in the economic value of the species have seen a focus on farming, with M. annamen- sis now bred in large numbers in commercial turtle farms in China and Vietnam. This breeding has mainly served to increase the demand for more breed- ing stock with a proliferation of farms in the region. This species lives and breeds well in captivity, and cap- tive breeding has succeeded to the point that its value in the pet trade has dropped markedly. The survival of M. annamensis in captivity is therefore assured; the challenge will be successful reintroduction, considering there is no currently protected habitat where the species was previously found in the wild.

The species is heavily collected for its much-desired meat, both for local subsis- tence and commercially. Increasing pressure from a rapidly growing human population and the trend in fishing habits towards the use of nets, which results in substantial bycatch of this species, as well as harvest of eggs and nesting females, is having dramatical- ly deleterious effects on its populations. Survey data over the past three decades document an ongoing decline of the species. International conser- vation organizations, along with Madagascar authori- ties, manage a conservation program for the species, engaging local communities and reintroducing head started turtles at several sites.

Genetic analysis determined that the species should be split into two; the Northern River Terrapin, B. baska, and the Southern River Terrapin, B. affinis, which in- cludes the Western Malay River Terrapin, B. a. affinis, and the Eastern Malay River Terrapin, B. a. edwardmolli. This species has been heavily exploited for its flesh and eggs and only small isolated populations remain. These are likely below minimal viable population levels, thus they require intensive stewardship. Sand mining, dam construction, and pollution have also impacted this spe- cies by contributing to widespread habitat loss. Programs protecting wild populations are active in eastern peninsular Malaysia and Cambodia. Recent field surveys in Sumatra have failed to detect any evidence of remaining wild B. affinis. Captive breeding colonies are maintained in Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia. Population supplementation by releasing head started turtles is occurring in penin- sular Malaysia and southern Cambodia. Mon- itoring these released turtles has demonstrated the ability of the turtles to survive after being released, but whether they will survive long enough to reach sexual maturity and produce offspring is unknown. Additional conservation actions aimed at reducing human-induced turtle mortality are necessary for these supplementation programs to succeed over the long-term. Habitat man- agement needs include the creation of protected areas, vital to the species\u2019 survival.

Once found throughout the entire Gangetic River system, the last po- tentially long-term viable population is now found only within the National Chambal River Sanctuary. Based on over a decade of nest surveys, it is estimated that less than 500 adult females remain within the 400 km long sanctuary. However, the sanc- tuary is not immune to the impacts of large scale clan- destine sand mining and illegal fishing. The loss of optimal nesting habitat increases the probability that nests are destroyed by predators and/ or flooding events.

Frank Yu- wono, after whom the species is named, obtained the first specimen known to sci- ence from a market in Gorontalo; the spe- cies was formally described to science only in 1995. Males are much larger than females and dis- tinguished by their whitish heads. No detailed field studies have been carried out, but the species\u2019 pre- ferred habitat appears to be cool shallow streams that flow from the mountains. These streams are bordered by either forest or crop plantations. Leucocephalon yuwonoi appears to spend the daytime hidden under leaf litter or foraging near the stream bank, moving into the stream to forage at night. Females lay a single egg, or occasionally two eggs, while multiple clutches in a year are possible. Habitat destruction from commercial logging, small-scale agriculture, and forest clearing for palm plantations has greatly reduced the species\u2019 habitat. This has been exacerbated by collection for the meat and pet markets; an unknown number of animals are consumed locally and exported illegally. The species\u2019 low reproductive output is also cause for con- cern. Leucocephalon yuwonoi has a very limited range on the Minahasa Peninsula of northern Sulawesi. Priorities for this species include detailed population surveys and field research into its biology so that effective conserva- tion measures can be developed. Both ex-situ and in-situ captive breeding programs will be needed to supplement populations and act as assurance colonies. In-situ efforts should focus on protected areas, which could be release sites for captive raised young. Captive propagation has thus far proved difficult, with limited success.

Together with 17 captive individuals, which did not breed, the world population was below 50. A rescue opera- tion begun in 1988 established a successful captive breed- ing project through an ecophysiological approach, taking into account the species\u2019 extreme seasonality. A recovery program over the last three decades allowed the last tiny self-sustaining wild population in one of the reserves to increase slowly through predator exclusion and acquisi- tion and restoration of adjacent habitat. Through reintro- duction of captive-bred juveniles and supplementation of some swamps with water during dry winters, the second natural population was also recovered. Togeth- er with conservation introductions of cap- tive-bred juveniles at two additional protect- ed sites north of its known range, the overall wild population increased by about ten-fold since the 1980s, but since juveniles take 8\u201315 years to reach maturity, the wild adult popula- tion still hovers around 50. Natural recruitment is now occurring in all populations. The species remains under severe threat from introduced predators (foxes, rats, pigs), poaching, incompatible surrounding land uses, as well as stochastic events related to climate change: drought, in- creasing aridity, drying swamps, and bushfires. Based on integrated biophysiological and hydrological modelling, colonization in two sites on Western Australia\u2019s wetter and cooler south coast commenced in 2016, making P. umbrina the first vertebrate species to be deliberately re- located to novel areas because of climate change.

For almost 70 years, biologists were unable to locate additional specimens. Finally, in 1987 a specimen was purchased in a food market in northern Palawan. It is now known to be endemic to the Palawan island group, and does not occur on Leyte. Siebenrockiella leytensis is an aquatic species that prefers slow moving streams in well vegetated lowland forest and swamp forests, as well as wetlands, creeks, and rivers. It is nocturnal, hiding during the day in deep burrows in river banks or, during the dry season, under rocks. It is omniv- orous and depends on an intact lowland forest ecosystem. Its habitat is threatened by slash-and-burn farming, logging, and agricultural encroachment. The greatest threat to the Palawan Forest Turtle is the international pet trade, which surged when it was rediscovered. Demand for the Asian food and traditional medicine markets has added to this over-exploitation. Although the species is protected under Philippine law, and its trade is regulated by CITES, there contin- ues to be an active illegal trade both for local consumption and export. In 2015 alone, 4,124 S. leytensis \u2013 3,831 from a single seizure \u2013 were confis- cated. Fortunately, 89% of them have been released back to the wild, and continuous monitoring shows high site fidel- ity and survival. In-situ conservation through habitat pro- tection of vital populations under the involvement of local communities is considered the most effective conservation tool. The Palawan Forest Turtle is the focal species of the Philippine Freshwater Turtle Conservation Program imple- mented by Katala Foundation Inc., with the overall goal to conserve and restore most viable populations of S. leytensis and its habitats.

Much of the land bor- dering the riverine habitat that this species occupies has been converted to pastures or plantations. The draining of wetlands for agri- culture and irrigation also impacts this species. Defor- estation in the head-waters of the rivers (and one hy- dro-electrical plant in the Sin\u00fa River) produces changes in the local hydrology, increased siltation of wetlands and altered natural river cycles, often leading to flood- ing of nesting areas, causing egg mortality. More criti- cal is the intense subsistence hunting and commercial exploitation that occurs throughout this species\u2019 range, which has reduced or extirpated populations. Further- more, the primary nesting season coincides with Lent, a period when there is a high demand for turtle meat. Other indirect human effects on populations include lower recruitment due to cattle trampling nests and domestic animals such as dogs and pigs excavating and consum- ing incubating eggs and destroying nests. The geographic range of Podocnemis lewyana does not include any private or official protected areas. The species is thus exposed to direct and indirect threats.

Development of large-scale agro-based activities that discharge effluents into the rivers negatively impacts the riparian vegetation that B. borneoensis relies on for the majority of its diet. Additionally, this species is often collected from the wild for the pet trade due to its highly attractive coloration. Conserva- tion measures accorded to the species have been limited.

In Ma- laysia, eggs from wild nests are incubated in several locations in Terengganu (east coast of West Malaysia) and in Sarawak. With decades of high egg collection, recruitment of juveniles into the population has been extremely limited. Many remaining wild adults are of advanced age, which could cause remaining adult popu- lations to quickly decline as these individuals reach the end of their life span.

It grows to only 10\u201312 cm carapace length. Its entire geographic range is confined to the larger streams of the Black Warrior River drainage in northern Alabama. The occurrence of mollusks seems to predict the occurrence of the turtles, and they forage along the stream bottom both day and night. They occur in clear streams and rivers with abundant rocks and crevices, under which they lodge themselves, facilitated by their flattened shells. It is believed that Sternotherus depres- sus once occurred throughout the streams and rivers of the Black Warrior Basin. It is today limited only to ar- eas in which human development has not destroyed its former habitats. It is estimated that less than 7% of the species\u2019 original habitat remains unaffected by habitat destruction, and the species\u2019 population has declined by more than 90% in the past 25 years. Runoff from local coal mining has led to silt and coal dust clogging stream bottoms and eliminating the species\u2019 food supply. Sewage runoff has also damaged their habitat and food supply. Poaching for the pet trade exists, at unknown levels. While it is protected by federal and state law, there are currently few conservation measures being taken to protect S. depressus, and few assurance colonies exist. Their survival depends on steps being taken to protect the remaining habitat from further degradation.

The species measures 10.5\u201319.5 cm; males are usually smaller and less domed than females. The species inhabits fast-flowing streams in the north- ernmost range of this genus, with air tempera- tures as low as -20\u00b0C during winters, occurring along the Jangtse River in the Qinling Mountain range in the central Chinese provinces of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Si- chuan, Chongqing, and Gansu. While the overall range covers about 200,000 sq. km, it is restricted to streams in suitable mountain valleys within this area, making the actual range much smaller.

It inhabits a 30\u201350 km-wide coastal strip of desert habitat between the Mediterranean Sea and the northern Sahara Desert in Libya, Egypt, and Israel. Once found in relatively high densities (up to 41 tortoises per sq. km) in Egypt, T. kleinmanni is likely extirpated from that portion of its range due to collecting pressure for the pet trade. Poaching for the pet trade peaked in the mid- 1990s, when Egypt requested the animal be upgraded from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I. Density was estimated to be as low as 4 tortoises per sq. km in the early 1980s and the species is now suspected to be iso- lated to a few pockets of habitat in the Negev Desert of Israel. Former habitats have been converted to large-scale agriculture and urbanization and much is used for grazing by local pas- toralists. Testudo kleinmanni maintains large home ranges (15\u201335 ha) and lays only 2\u20136 eggs per year. The low reproductive rate, combined with heavy poaching for the pet trade and severe habitat destruction, have pushed the species to the brink in the wild. Conservationists have conducted grassroots efforts to work with local people to locate sustainable and alternative income sources to harvesting tortoises.

Within this region, H. depressa is found in a variety of low and mid-elevation (to 700 m) habitat types, including primary evergreen forest, second-growth forest in abandoned swidden fields, deciduous forest, and bamboo brake. Very little is known concerning the natural history of this enig- matic turtle, although on-going radiotelemetry studies suggest H. depressa is largely terrestrial, active primar- ily during the wet season, spends much of the cool dry season in a state of semi-dormancy, and consumes a diet of vegetation and various fruits. Heosemys depressa is widely harvested for food by indigenous peoples in the region, but commercial hunting appears lim- ited. Some populations are threatened by habitat destruction, although for the most part forests in much of western Myanmar remain intact; however, this situation could change as Myanmar opens to foreign invest- ment. The Rakhine Yoma Elephant Sanctuary (RYES) harbors globally significant populations of H. depressa and expansion of this protected area would go far towards insuring the continued survival of this species. Heosemys depressa also occurs in the smaller Kyauk Pan Taung Wildlife Sanctuary of northern Ra- khine State. A small assurance colony is established at RYES that regularly produces offspring, and H. depres- sa is also maintained at several institutions outside of Myanmar where reproduction has likewise been report- ed.

This species has a low reproductive rate and is severely threatened by habitat loss and pre- vious over-collection for the international pet trade. Since being placed on CITES Appen- dix I in 2002, legal export for the pet trade has ceased and its severe population decline has been halted, but collection for the illegal pet trade still occurs. Local people do not consume or harm the tortoises which are only active during the hot wet season from November/ December to March/April and remain hidden under leaf litter and dormant for the rest of the year. Noted for having a distinctly flat tail, this species has long been desired by pet keepers, although due to its life style it adapts poorly to captive conditions, is highly suscepti- ble to bacterial and viral infections, and has generally poor survivorship. Only a few institutions and private breeders outside Madagascar manage to breed this species; it reproduces regularly at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust\u2019s tortoise breeding facil- ity in Ampijoroa in northwestern Madagascar. Conservation measures focus on protecting its native habitat, the dry deciduous forest which is threatened by slash and burn agriculture, and maintaining viable wild populations, as is currently the case in Kirindy Forest where the species remains locally abundant in a small population. The population of Andranomena Reserve, effectively extirpated two decades ago through collec- tion for the pet trade, may eventually be repopulated with captive progeny from Ampijoroa. Pyxis planicauda (Grandidier 1867) Madagascar IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Flat-tailed Tortoise 47 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles While the occurrence of Chitra softshells in Myanmar was long assumed, it was not until the 1990s that conclusive proof of their existence was found, and in 2003 the populations inhabiting the Ayeyarwady river system and lower Thanlwin (Salween) were described as a separate species. All indi- cations from field surveys and market observations continue to indicate that the species is widespread, but populations are depleted. Remaining animals are at high risk of exploitation for local consumption or ex- port trade, while its riverine habitat has been impacted by runoff from erosion, and the impacts of hydroelec- tric dam construction, with more dams being planned. Further status surveys and local conservation initiatives like nest protection and possibly head starting are high- ly recommended. Developing effective and equitable community-based fishing practic- es and regulations would greatly help this and other riverine species. The most prom- ising long-term conservation measures would be to enact designation of the upper Chindwin and its surrounding forest areas as a strictly protected riverine sanctuary, and upgrade the Irrawaddy Dolphin Protected Area in central Myanmar to an effectively protected, enforced, and managed riv- erine wildlife sanctuary. This would secure this turtle as well as migratory waterfowl, fish, dolphins, and other biodiversity from the threats of exploitation and eco- system degradation, and provide the downstream eco- system benefits of clean freshwater and fish fingerlings, benefiting human communities as well.

As a visual ambush predator focused on fish, the animals are dependent on shallow areas of clear flowing water to forage, as well as extensive sand banks for nesting. The population inhabiting the National Chambal River Gharial Sanctuary, a 400 km ribbon of protected river and riverbanks in the heart of India, should in theory be fully protected, thus allowing recruitment and dispersal of offspring to populate other parts of the Ganges river system. However, clandestine sand-mining, riverside agriculture impacts, plus entangle- ment and drowning in illegally set mono- filament fishing nets, impact even this population and its ecosystem. The political will to enforce Sanctuary regulations is ur- gently needed, especially regulating the hydro- logical regimes. There are long-running conservation programs in India, involving former turtle poachers, to protect known nesting banks along the Ganga, Ya- muna, and Chambal rivers, educate riverside villagers, as well as hatch-and-release initiatives. An assurance colony of C. indica was recently established at Kukrail Gharial Centre. These efforts should be continued and possibly replicated in other parts of the species\u2019 range. Chitra indica (Gray 1830) Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan IUCN Red List: Endangered South Asian Narrow-Headed Softshell Turtle 50 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 The Coahuila Box Turtle is unique among North American box turtles in its largely aquatic habits. The species has an unclear phylogenetic relationship to the other box turtles and may be a sister taxon to Terra- pene carolina. It is one of the rarest turtles in North America, and has one of the most re- stricted distributions of any turtle in the western hemi- sphere. Terrapene coahuila is endemic to small spring- fed wetlands and pools in an intermontane valley near the town of Cuatro Cienegas in northern Mexico. The species averages 13-14 cm in carapace length; adults are a dull greenish brown color. They are found in the pools, foraging aquatically for animal and plant foods. They are also encountered on land, crossing between pools and hiding beneath grass tussocks. Coahuila Box Tur- tles have been found to migrate up to 10 km between wetlands. Terrapene coahuila is thought to be great- ly reduced in most of the wetlands in which it formerly occurred. The population densi- ty in 1974 was estimated at 148 turtles per hectare in the proper habitat, and a total population of approximately 10,000 turtles. A more recent estimate in 2008 indicated a dra- matic reduction to between 1 and 67 turtles per hect- are. Current population numbers are unknown but are certainly lower; a new census is urgently needed. The primary threat appears to be habitat loss due to a low- ering of the water table from encroaching agriculture, such that formerly prime wetland habitat is now too dry to support a turtle population. A lesser threat is collec- tion for the pet trade. Although the species breeds well in captivity, there were as of 2012 only 54 adults assur- ance colonies, with few genetic lineages represented.

Astrochelys radiata (Shaw 1802) Madagascar IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Radiated Tortoise 52 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 The mountainous evergreen forests of Central Vietnam and adjacent eastern Laos are home to this highly terrestrial member of the genus Cuora. Its domed carapace is highly variable in color, well adapted to its surrounding habitat, and can be entirely black to chestnut brown with or without black stripes and radiations and a lighter colored lateral band. The plastron is cream colored with or without a varying degree of black blotches on each scute. The head coloration shows variably mixed black, red, orange, yellow, blueish, pink, or whitish patterns, patches, and spots, making it one of the most colorful Asian turtle species. The species reaches a carapace length of 15\u201320 cm. Males can have a slightly concave plastron, larger claws and a thicker and longer tail. Despite ongoing rampant collection for more than three decades, mainly for the Chinese food and medicine markets, the species is still found in large parts of its range, but heavily poached and traded to China. An estimated 1500\u20132000 specimens ended up in the international pet trade in the 1980s and 1990s; this trend has ceased since the listing of this species on CITES Appendix II. Population esti- mates are in the 10,000\u201320,000 range at most due to its large geographic distribution. Habitat destruction from logging and the creation of new farmland threaten the remaining populations. This species is rather delicate in captivity and is easily stressed. Successful breeding is rare but increasing. Fewer than 1,000 specimens are believed to live in captivity.

Its domed cara- pace is highly variable in color and can be en- tirely black to chestnut brown with or without black stripes and radiations and a yellow, orange, or mainly black lateral band. The plastron is usually black; some specimens, especially from Hainan, show a yellowish central pattern similar to its close relative C. bourreti. The Hainan population was once described as a subspe- cies, C. g. hainanensis, but is not currently regarded as valid. The head coloration shows variably mixed black, red, orange, yellow, blueish, pink, or whitish patterns, patches, and spots. The species reaches a carapace length of 15\u201320 cm. Males can have a slightly concave plastron, larger claws and a thicker and longer tail. Despite ongoing rampant collection for more than three decades, mainly for the Chinese food and medicine markets, the species is still found in large parts of its range, where it is heavily poached and traded to and within China.

Pyxis arachnoides (Bell 1827) Madagascar IUCN Red List: Critically Endangered Spider Tortoise 55 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles The Bolson Tortoise remained unknown to science until 1959, when John Legler de- scribed it. At the end of the Pleistocene it ranged throughout the Chihuahuan Des- ert from central Mexico to southern Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. It now survives only in the Bols\u00f3n de Mapim\u00ed, an interior basin in northern Mexico. Gopherus flavomarginatus usual- ly grows to about 34 cm in shell length, but can reach 40 cm. The scutes of its carapace are often dark with a contrasting yellow border, giving the species its scien- tific name. It has massive claws on its feet for digging large burrows that it uses to retreat from predators and to wait out drought or cold weather. It shares these bur- rows with a host of other animals, making it a keystone species for the Chihuahuan Desert. Animals take over 10 years to reach sexual maturity and females have a clutch size of only around five eggs, so its populations recover slowly from dep- redations. The Red List status for this tortoise is currently being revised from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered. It is threatened most by agricultural development, but also by local use for food and pets. The Mapim\u00ed Biosphere Reserve was established to protect the tortoise and its ecosystem. Within the Re- serve, the recently created 17,540-ha (43,400 acres) Bol- son Tortoise Ecosystem Preserve has strengthened its protection. The Turner Endangered Species Fund has captive-bred more than 500 animals for a reintroduc- tion program planned to include New Mexico, Texas and, eventually, Mexico. Gopherus flavomarginatus Legler 1958 Mexico IUCN Red List: Vulnerable TFTSG: Critically Endangered Bolson Tortoise 56 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 The Bog Turtle is one of North America\u2019s smallest turtles, with a maximum size of 11.5 cm. The species has one of the most re- stricted habitat requirements of any turtle, living only in spring fed boggy areas, which are often widely dispersed. It has a low re- productive rate, each adult female laying fewer than four eggs per year, which are deposited just above the water line and are vulnerable to predation from rac- coons and skunks and also subject the local changes in water levels. Although it is found in 12 U.S. states, its habitat is so widely dispersed and subject to human development that its future is precarious. Changes in land use near bogs harboring the species can lower or raise the water table, resulting in the destruction of the habitat and the extirpation of the population. There has also been much pres- sure from collecting for the pet trade in the past, as well as roadkill mortality as turtles migrate among dispersed bogs. State wildlife officials and local nature groups have worked to mon- itor Bog Turtle populations and protect habitat. There is also ongoing habitat restoration work on both public and private lands.

Past overgrazing on large pastoral farms and the potential impact of climate change on drought frequency and intensi- ty are thought to be impacting the habitat of this species.

The species appears to exhibit an extremely small home range of less than 1 ha, and only rarely ventures out from rocky retreats when infrequent rainfall or fog events promote ephemeral plant growth in the largely barren landscape.

In addition to the impacts from targeted hunting for consumption and the food trade, the species is likely also impacted by habitat degradation resulting from dam and reser- voir construction and formerly extensive riverside gold- mining. Priority conservation actions include minimizing further exploitation of the spe- cies, as well as further surveys to locate via- ble remaining populations and critical hab- itat areas. This should then be followed by protecting one or more riverine areas where such populations persist, such as the Irrawaddy Dolphin Protected Area in the middle Ayeyarwady, and portions of the Chindwin River. Population aug- mentation efforts, such as nest protection and/or head starting hatchlings from the small assurance colony at Yadanabon Zoo in Mandalay, may also be beneficial.

It was not until 1999 that softshell turtles living in a few temple ponds and in some riverine wetlands in Ban- gladesh and northeastern India were determined to be this species, instead of the similar, more widespread In- dian Peacock Softshell Turtle (Nilssonia hurum). While the adult animals at the shrine and temple ponds are secure from capture, their nesting and recruitment op- portunities are limited. Nilssonia nigricans in the Brah- maputra wetlands is, by contrast, subject to intensive exploitation for local consumption or regional trade, as well as the impacts of habitat degradation. Greater protection is needed for the remaining wild populations, including effectively enforced legal protec- tion, nest protection and anti-poaching out- reach programs and incentives, while living, nesting, and recruitment conditions at temple ponds can gener- ally be improved so that these populations can poten- tially represent a source for reinforcement of the wild populations.

The species\u2019 extremely flattened and pliable shell is an adaptation to a lifestyle focused on hiding deep in cracks and crevices in granite boulder areas. This unique appearance has also made the Pancake Tor- toise valuable in the global pet trade, with over 66,000 live animals traded between 1975 and 2015. Concern over trade volumes in the 1990s led to a voluntary trade ban by Kenya and restrictions on exports from Tanza- nia, those being limited to a varying annual quota of several hundred to almost a thousand captive-produced animals under 8 cm CL. Since the discovery of the Zambian population, first reported in 2002, Zambia has declared exporting between 2,000 and 6,000 live pancake tor- toises annually. Reports persist of ongoing collection of animals from the wild through- out its range, often involving the destruction of scarce rock crevice retreats, and concern exists about tortoises collected illegally from the wild being \u2018laun- dered\u2019 through alleged in-range captive breeding facil- ities.

Malacochersus tornieri (Siebenrock 1903) Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia IUCN Red List: Vulnerable TFTSG: Critically Endangered Pancake Tortoise 62 TURTLES IN TROUBLE \u2219 2018 The Mojave Desert Tortoise is one of the most intensively studied and monitored reptiles in the world. Officially recognized as being in decline in the 1980s, the species came under U.S. federal protection in 1990. The rationale for listing the Mojave popula- tion of the Desert Tortoise was the loss of indi- viduals to disease, severe climatic conditions, loss and degradation of habitat, increased levels of mortality as- sociated with urban growth throughout the desert, and the inability of regulatory and management agencies to protect the Desert Tortoise and its habitat. Since then, however, it has continued to decline, with no abatement to the list of threats. Though listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN since 1996, the TFTSG has recently re-assessed the species\u2019 status and is elevating it to Critically Endan- gered. Part of that elevated status is due to the original definition of G. agassizii recently being split into three separate species (G. agassizii, G. morafkai, and G. evgoodei). The range of G. agassizii now encompasses only the Mojave Desert region of southern California and adjacent areas of southern Nevada, extreme southwestern Utah, and northwestern Arizo- na. This iconic inhabitant of the Mojave ecosystem is a medium-sized (25 cm) tortoise that is highly adapted to extreme temperatures by spending much of its time underground in burrows, with activity above ground peaking in the Spring and Fall. As an ecosystem engi- neer that creates essential shelter for numerous desert species, the decline of the Mojave Desert Tortoise will have far reaching implications for the greater desert fau- na.

The focus of the TFTSG is to provide the scientific foundation necessary to assess the survival status of all species of tortoises and freshwater turtles, to identify and document the threats to their survival, and to help catalyze conservation action to ensure that none become extinct and that viable populations persist in the wild. The TFTSG provides expertise and science-based recommendations with conservation relevance to IUCN and other institutions. The TFTSG is the official IUCN Red List Authority and works closely with the IUCN Red List Programme to assess, evaluate, and determine appropriate categorizations of the risk of extinction for these species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Spe- cies. The TFTSG has been at the forefront of efforts to ensure that native turtle populations are adequately regulated and pro- tected under domestic and international legislation. It has also worked extensively with partners to include more species in the CITES Appendices, while working to ensure that legal trade is sustainable and illegal trade is prosecuted. In 2001 the TFTSG helped found the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) as a Task Force of the TFTSG, before the TSA became an independent NGO, and in 2002 the TFTSG, in conjunction with Conservation International and the TSA, created the Turtle Conservation Fund. The Turtle Conservancy protects turtles and tortoises and their ecosystems through land acquisition, captive assurance colonies, illegal trade supression, increased awareness, and promotion of science. It has purchased and protected around 53,000 acres of critical habitat including 43,540 acres in Mexico for the Bolson Tortoise (Gopherus flavomarginatus), 1,000 acres also in Mexico for Goode\u2019s Thornscrub Tortoise (Gopherus evgoodei), and 1,000 acres in South Africa for the Geometric Tortoise (Psammobates geometricus). Further, it has helped to outright purchase 26 acres and protect 7,363 acres for the Palawan Forest Turtle (Sieben- rockiella leytensis) in the Philippines.

Today the TSA has an overarching Commitment to Zero Turtle Extinctions, is widely recognized as a catalyst for turtle conservation globally, and focuses on species ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List. An action oriented partnership organization, the TSA is dedicated to converting passion for turtles into effective conservation action. Employing multiple strategies to secure species both in captivity and the wild, the TSA has built an extensive network of conservation partners around the world and today manages rescue centers, assurance colonies, or head starting programs in 12 countries, primarily Asia, but also including Madagascar and Central/South America. These captive programs, coupled with field research, capacity building and community engagement, have led to successful reintroduction efforts for several species. Finally, as part of our Commitment to Zero Turtle Extinctions, the TSA began developing the Turtle Survival Center (TSC) in South Carolina in 2013, dedicated to saving species that were either functionally extinct in the wild, or believed to be in need of assurance colonies for survival. Today the TSC manages over 700 specimens of 30 critically endangered or endangered species, and employs five full-time staff. The TSA is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation registered in the State of Texas and based at the Fort Worth Zoo. The Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) is a strategizing and funding partnership coalition of leading turtle conservation organi- zations and individuals focused on ensuring the long-term survival of tortoises and freshwater turtles. The TCF was established in 2002 as a non-aligned collaborative partnership of Conservation International, the IUCN SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group, and the Turtle Survival Alliance. It has since been joined and supported by several other turtle-focused con- servation organizations, including the Shellshock Campaign of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, Humane So- ciety International of Australia, Turtle Conservancy, Global Wildlife Conservation, Chelonian Research Foundation, Panaphil Foundation, Wildlife Conservation Society, Chelonian Research Institute, and the Andrew Sabin Family Foundation. TCF has also received major individual support from George Meyer and Maria Semple, as well as Matt Frankel. TCF produced a Global Action Plan in 2002, and in 2003 compiled the first list of the Top 25 Turtles on Death Row, and has since then provided strate- gic funding for many conservation projects from all over the world focused primarily on Critically Endangered or Endangered tortoises and freshwater turtles. To date the TCF has distributed over $1 million in small seed grants (average grant ca. $4,400) to nearly 240 projects from nearly 60 nations focused on threatened turtles and tortoises. Since TCF is not a formal legal entity, Conservation International and Chelonian Research Foundation have served as its financial NGO umbrella organizations.

Rhodin, and based in Lunenburg, Massachusetts, CRF is an IRS-designated 501(c)(3) private operating foundation. The mission of CRF is the production, publication, and support of worldwide turtle and tortoise research, with an emphasis on the scientific basis of chelonian diversity and conservation biology. CRF has published the peer-reviewed professional turtle journal Chelonian Conservation and Biology since 1993 (distributed by Allen Press since 2006) as well as the book-length Chelonian Research Monographs series since 1996. The monograph series includes the ongoing comprehensive publication project on Conservation Biology of Freshwater Turtles and Tortoises compiled in association with the IUCN SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group (TFTSG) since 2008, as well as its associated checklist authored by the Turtle Taxonomy Working Group: Turtles of the World: An Annotated Check- list and Atlas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca99a01c-acc3-481e-8013-9e60fe86e8ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca99a01c-acc3-481e-8013-9e60fe86e8ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Turtles in trouble", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11da5576495f35b56b8bafe607056a4a9e05a50db24bd20edca833dc1719a5d5"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfeb3a46-4deb-4597-acd9-7ea9f26d6fc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab9b6adf4afabed71fc498b4295ebd37c81bbdcf232e48012926729c7a4871c8"}}, "hash": "1c8433046e1491c80dfe2db4e10b1bcc3cd607c23b14d9089a6e95f768024096", "text": "Recently, CRF has joined forces with the Turtle Conservancy to co-publish both Chelonian Conservation and Biology and Chelonian Research Monographs.

The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) saves wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, edu- cation, and inspiring people to value nature. We recognize chelonians as powerful flagship species pivotal in addressing critical conservation issues globally. WCS conducts both ex-situ and in-situ chelonian conservation programming in nations that are centers of turtle diversity, including Brazil, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Notable field-based WCS projects on species in the Top 25 include the conservation of the Central American river turtle (Dermatemys mawii), the Magdalena River turtle (Podocnemis lewyana), the Burmese roofed Turtle (Batagur trivittata), the Burmese star tortoise (Geochelone platynota), the southern river terrapin (Batagur affinis), Cantor\u2019s giant softshell turtle (Pelochelys cantorii), the Roti Island snake-necked turtle (Chelodina mccordi), and the Yangtze giant softshell turtle (Rafetus swinhoei). We combine knowledge of demography, ecology, and genetics in our conservation actions to increase the likelihood that a given species can respond/adapt to environmental/ecological changes (e.g., climate change, land use modification). We also engage in countering the illegal trade of chelonians by working with range countries as well as on the larger international stage. We aim to continue to be proactive in our global chelonian conservation programing with the goal of assuring that the most imperiled species can once again be self-sustaining in the wild and that current self-sustaining wild populations remain that way.

GWC conserves the diversity of life on Earth by preserving wildlands, restoring wildlife and engaging with global guardians. Driven by science, GWC max- imizes its impact through conservation solutions in research and exploration, land purchase and protected area establishment, protected area management, poaching prevention, and capacity building. GWC targets species and ecosystems at imminent risk of disappearing forever, for the benefit of nature and society. Over the past eight years, GWC\u2019s leading scientists, with field experience in more than 50 countries, have built an extensive network of allied researchers and conservationists. This network supports GWC in the implementation of its exploration, research, education and conservation strategies. GWC has worked to conserve wildlife and habitat in more than 40 countries, helped establish more than 20 new nature reserves, protected more than 100 endangered species and 20,000 species overall, and helped educate more than 50 undergraduate and graduate students. GWC\u2019s work for turtles is closely integrated with the programs of the Turtle Conservancy, leveraging their combined skills, con- tact networks and resources to secure the future for highly threatened tortoises and freshwater turtles at sites around the world. For nearly 30 years, Conservation International (CI) has been protecting nature for the benefit of all. CI knows that human beings are totally dependent on nature \u2014 and that by saving nature, we\u2019re saving ourselves. To that end, CI is helping to build a healthier, more prosperous and more productive planet. CI does this through science, policy, and partnerships with countries, communities and companies. Over the years, CI has helped support 1,200 protected areas and interventions across 77 countries, safeguarding more than 601 million hectares of land, marine and coastal areas. CI has a strong history of working to protect natural areas in Biodiversity Hotspots and High-Biodiversity Wilderness Areas, as well as focused work for highly threatened species. CI has been an early and strong institutional force for the conservation of tortoises and freshwater turtles worldwide, through its scientific program as well as through in-country initiatives. Moreover, CI is a co-founder of the Turtle Conservation Fund and a strong supporter of the IUCN SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group, Chelonian Research Founda- tion, Turtle Survival Alliance, and Turtle Conservancy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c7edc7f-c276-4e15-b236-ec6e1f784f97": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c7edc7f-c276-4e15-b236-ec6e1f784f97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Turtles in trouble", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73c0db63b16f518b6ca50bd432751c90a200fe58076f44ee82707c0477c65edf"}, "2": {"node_id": "90f6c6c5-6090-44c7-908a-c6441c3f7fd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/turtles-trouble", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "807beda51f52a46ad9a5e3ea2a9ebc04067e39152bb21333cd7847edb5fb918d"}}, "hash": "7290b095a4f9c41b168423b3bc82e25409cb49fcf66736a79ff848a3a564d809", "text": "Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC; www.globalwildlife.org) Conservation International (CI; www.conservation.org) 75 The World\u2019s 25+ Most Endangered Tortoises and Freshwater Turtles CREDITS FOR SPECIES ACCOUNTS Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle Text by Gerald Kuchling Photo by Gerald Kuchling Ploughshare Tortoise Text by Richard Lewis & Andrew Terry Photo by Turtle Conservancy/Eric Goode Yunnan Box Turtle Text by Torsten Blanck Photo by Torsten Blanck Northern River Terrapin Text by Brian D.

These turtles were destined for the international pet trade and exotic food markets in China and northern Southeast Asia. Over 90 percent of the rescued animals were successfully returned to their home range on the island of Palawan in the Philippines. This seminal effort was led by Katala Foundation with help and collaboration from all the organizations in the Turtle Conservation Coalition, plus Angell Animal Medical Center, Chester Zoo, Columbus Zoo, Csaba Geczy, Friends of Wuppertal, Full Circle Foundation Hong Kong, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden, Los Angeles Zoo, Monterey Bay Aquarium, New England Aquarium, Ocean Park Hong Kong, Oxbow Animal Health, Philippine Center for Terrestrial & Aquatic Research, Plinky Limpingco, Pro Wildlife, San Diego Zoo, Shaggy\u2019s Pet Station, Stichting Turtle Sur- vival, Western Philippines University, Wroclaw Zoo, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, ZGAP, Zoo London, Zoo Leipzig, Zoo Med Laboratories, Zoo Parc Beauval, and Zoo Schonbrunn Vienna.

In this report, it was recognised that the critical step in the sustainable rehabilitation of biodiversity and habitats of oil spill sites in the Niger Delta is the prevention and/ or quick and efficient clean-up of the oil spill in the first place. Therefore, a large number of the recommendations in the report related to oil spill response procedures and effective remediation techniques that best take account of biodiversity requirements. In respect to biodiversity itself, the 2013 report recommended follow-up analyses that would lead to: \u2022\ufffd Redefinition of receptors in SPDC\u2019s internal environment management process to include representation of key native biodiversity; \u2022\ufffd Introduction of conservation and management of important areas of natural habitats and biodiversity hotspots in SPDC\u2019s oil spill response procedures; \u2022\ufffd Initiation of programmes to rehabilitate critical habitats, including mangroves, in SPDC\u2019s bioremediation and rehabilitation procedures; \u2022\ufffd Development of a socio-environmental strategy to engage communities in biodiversity management and restoration; and \u2022\ufffd Development of a best practice strategy for the biodiversity of the wider Niger Delta. This new report, Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta: Integrating biodiversity considerations into SPDC\u2019s operation, presents the findings and recommendations arising from one of these analyses, which reviewed the biodiversity value of the Niger Delta, the main threats from oil spills, and various attempts to develop a wider biodiversity strategy for the region. The Panel also examined SPDC\u2019s internal processes and procedures for biodiversity management. The above exercise led IUCN-NDP to formulate two sets of recommendations. The first set is addressed to SPDC itself and focuses on the ways and means to improve the company\u2019s internal processes in a manner that achieves a more effective integration of biodiversity conservation concerns into its operations. The second set of recommendations refers to major stakeholders in oil & gas operations in the region and relates to actions needed to develop an effective and coherent biodiversity strategy for the wider Niger Delta. These latter recommendations are beyond the scope of SPDC and are mainly addressed to government agencies but will require the support of all players in the oil and gas industry. The two sets of recommendations are summarized in the two tables presented below. The recommendations are categorized into short-term (by the middle of 2017), medium-term (2017-2019) and long-term (beyond 2019). vii Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta Table 1: Recommendations to SPDC for better integration of biodiversity Considerations into its operations Recommendations to SPDC Time frame SPDC Biodiversity Strategy 2012\u20132017 Recommendation 1: Speed up the implementation of the 2012\u20132017 SPDC Biodiversity Strategy by completing the Gbanran-Ubie BAP and a Mangrove Management Guidance Document for the Niger Delta in the first half of 2017 and commence their implementation immediately thereafter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a495fad4-c6fe-431e-93e2-5692bd230bb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a495fad4-c6fe-431e-93e2-5692bd230bb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/developing-biodiversity-conservation-strategy-niger-delta", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/developing-biodiversity-conservation-strategy-niger-delta", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f3289cf56274a6157b9d31d3a6458b2021c0aeb46ed6fa12e3b2c6943ca19635"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9dffb72-c6bb-4963-8113-f1be954098e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/developing-biodiversity-conservation-strategy-niger-delta", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd320bf86faf76d7e9fba4fdb5e818719f165068d222d05ee23060d4523625e3"}}, "hash": "30f6378dcd06800e197d6b3483794e50c3d38fa3e24b88ac46954a17a3852190", "text": "Short term Also SPDC strategy should set quantitative targets for the number of Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) to be developed/ implemented in known Areas of High Biodiversity Value (AHBVs) threatened by its operations.

Short term Remediation Standard Recommendation 5: Update the definition of Areas of High Biodiversity Value (AHBV) in the SPDC Remediation Standard and develop a detailed manual and guidelines to support relevant SPDC teams involved in various remediation and rehabilitation stages in implementation of updated standard. Short term Recommendation 6: SPDC\u2019s Relationship with Host or Neighbouring Communities Strengthen SPDC relationship with its host or neighbouring communities by ensuring that community leaders comply more strictly with the terms of any Memoranda of Understanding agreed with communities; Promote the employment of better fortified and organized Pipeline Protection Task Forces (PPTFs) formed from the communities to guard segments of pipelines traversing the communities; Short term SEPCiN Impact Assessment Process Recommendation 7: SPDC to take advantage of the findings of this report and Appendix II to identify specific indicators to apply in monitoring biodiversity changes in different ecozones. Medium term \u2022\ufffd Ensure effective linkage between SPDC teams responsible for EIAs with those responsible for BAPs so that EIA recommendations will extend beyond avoiding or minimizing impacts to include activities that result in benefits to biodiversity such as support for research. Medium term \u2022\ufffd Where appropriate, make EIAs more thorough by stretching them to cover: a. Two seasons \u2013 dry season and wet season; b. Field observations of at least 2 \u2013 4 weeks duration; and c. Sampling also at night to accommodate nocturnal animals; Medium term \u2022\ufffd Where appropriate, include equipment (such as camera-traps and binoculars with cameras) in the contract for EIAs so that consultants will be able to acquire them; and Short term \u2022\ufffd In areas where significant biodiversity impacts are envisaged and/or AHBVs, consider pre-construction, con- struction and post-construction ecological monitoring for flora and fauna in all habitats, for better prediction of changes in biodiversity. Medium term Conceptual Site Models (CSMs) Recommendation 8: When developing CSMs for specific sites, use the recommended receptors for the three main ecological zones of the Niger Delta as summarized in Table 8 which are based on the information in Appendix II to this report. Short term Community and Other Stakeholder Engagement Recommendation 9: Reformat and re-introduce the annual Biodiversity Stakeholder Forum to contribute to regular engagement with biodiversity experts to exchange information for conservation of biodiversity. Medium term viii Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta Recommendations to SPDC Time frame Biodiversity Considerations in the Off-shore Environment Recommendation 10: SPDC\u2019s transfer arrangements with new owners of its divested assets should include provisions for passing on SPDC-developed biodiversity conservation practices. Short term Recommendation 11: SPDC should expand its biodiversity conservation responsibilities to cover adequately the marine environment in its off-shore undertakings. Short term Table 2: Recommendations to major stakeholders for developing and implementing an effective Niger Delta biodiversity strategy The recommendations in this section are beyond the remit of SPDC and are mostly addressed to Government agencies who have the primary interest and mandate to develop a wider Niger Delta biodiversity strategy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES 1.1 Background Biodiversity in the Niger Delta is facing tremendous threats. Most arise from pressures on habitats due to anthropogenic factors such as high population, pollution, urbanization, demands for more farmland, better roads and waterways. There are also significant direct threats from hunting and unsustainable harvesting of biodiversity resources, including widespread logging for timber. The main report of the IUCN-NDP, released in July 2013, recognized that in order to conserve habitats successfully, these threats need to be addressed from a much larger platform than the SPDC alone, and in a way that makes resources and methodologies to be pooled and shared by all stakeholder groups. Since oil spills disperse across large areas and in many cases across operational areas of more than one operator, especially in offshore settings, it is imperative that they address the issue in synergy. It will require the involvement of government authorities, the wider oil industry, communities and NGOs in order to jointly address issues of major concern. It will also require the development of a region-wide strategy that sets out the ways and means to halt the massive degradation of biodiversity, mitigate future impacts of the oil industry and address those that have already happened. Since the development of oil industry activity began in the Niger Delta in the 1950s, there has not been a comprehensive strategic plan that will conserve its biodiversity and ensure its sustainable use. Oil and gas related activities are rampant in the Delta, including in its most sensitive sites and habitats. This has led to serious damage to the environment and severe loss of biological resources. Biodiversity rehabilitation has to some degree been addressed through a disjointed set of activities undertaken by disparate stakeholders with the result that not enough is being done, in time or in scale, to remedy the situation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29b37aa3-21e1-4d20-b1c7-59a4ba4089ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "29b37aa3-21e1-4d20-b1c7-59a4ba4089ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/developing-biodiversity-conservation-strategy-niger-delta", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/developing-biodiversity-conservation-strategy-niger-delta", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "992b324f5eb24e966f29b32fe0f17ec40018b1c11fa0bdc09ead466312f54e43"}, "2": {"node_id": "5121c76b-68da-41ed-875f-b6d9cf21fcd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/developing-biodiversity-conservation-strategy-niger-delta", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb1e451c48909428036c127cafe39e6f5e05e9c0c837113b00d43e79d899be52"}}, "hash": "9d97a5d1b3a40695f8601c6ecc8ca2ecbbcd0aa03da69cbd5b530503264218ef", "text": "It is the view of the IUCN-NDP that based on SPDC\u2019s position as the largest explorer and producer of oil and gas in the region, it should be a major contributor to the establishment of a regional level collaborative platform to address the direct and indirect threats to the biodiversity as well as the development of a comprehensive biodiversity protection strategy for the wider Niger Delta.

He is Nigeria\u2019s foremost ornithologist and led the study and compiled the inventory of Important Bird Are- as (IBAs) in Nigeria. For the Nigerian team to carry out its assignment, the objectives and key questions were resolved into four 5 Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta sets of tasks (a, b, c & d) allocated to four specialists to accomplish: a. Provision of good background information on the critical biodiversity endowment of the entire Niger Delta, in terms of habitats and species, to guide proactive action in SPDC operations. In the process major threats and their key sources can be established, determining aspects of these threats that SPDC can address, acting alone, or in concert with other stakeholders. b. Delineation of the important areas of natural habitat in the Niger Delta, in the process identifying biodiversity hotspots and key species, to provide a baseline for understanding the impact of oil and gas operations on biodiversity of the region. Along with this is the need to assess the efforts at developing a region wide strategy for biodiversity management in the Niger Delta, balancing the pressures from all stakeholders. c. Evaluation of SPDC\u2019s efforts at biodiversity management by: \u25ca\ufffd determining the components of the Delta\u2019s biodiversity (critical habitats and species) that have been most impacted by oil spills; \u25ca\ufffd assessing the efforts to rehabilitate and restore impacted biodiversity; and \u25ca\ufffd mapping past and on-going SPDC initiatives towards contributing to developing a region wide biodiversity strategy for the Niger Delta. d. Assessment of SPDC\u2019s performance by examining the company\u2019s internal policies and processes, with respect to biodiversity management, against national and international standards to suggest best restoration options for severely impacted biodiversity in SPDC operational areas. The above tasks were to be accomplished against the background of a review of the biodiversity findings and recommendations in the IUCN-NDP 2013 report. A report synthesizing the findings of the specialists that worked separately on the above sets of tasks is available upon request to IUCN. During discussions between IUCN-NDP and SPDC staff on biodiversity issues, it became clear that there is a gap in knowledge regarding specific components that will work best as biodiversity receptors in developing Conceptual Site Models (CSMs) for the remediation and rehabilitation of biodiversity in oil spill situations. IUCN-NDP therefore found it expedient to extend the scope of the work of the team of Nigerian biodiversity experts to undertake this exercise. This led to the production of a second report which is attached as Appendix II to this report. The synthesis report of the team of Nigerian biodiversity experts, their report on biodiversity receptors, field visits and interviews conducted by Panel members in the Niger Delta and beyond, as well as further desk study by the Panel were used in developing this report. 2.2 Structure of the report The report is divided into two parts. Chapters 1\u20135 provide the introduction and context for the recommendations and form Part I of the report. Chapters 6 and 7 provide the main recommendations and comprise Part II of the report. In Part I, Chapter 1 states the background and main objectives of the analysis while Chapter 2 outlines the study methodology. Chapter 3 highlights what we know about the biodiversity richness of the Niger Delta and demonstrates its significance at national, regional and global levels, but also concerns over lack of recent inventories and status reviews. Chapter 4 identifies the main threats to biodiversity, focusing particularly on the threat posed by oil spills to various components of biodiversity. In Chapter 5, we give an overview of past and current efforts to develop a region-wide biodiversity strategy for the Niger Delta. Using the findings in Part I of the report, Part II presents the recommendations of the IUCN-NDP. Specific rec- ommendations to SPDC aimed at the improvement of its biodiversity policies, procedures and plans are set out in Chapter 6; and recommendations geared towards the integration of biodiversity considerations into oil and gas operations in the wider Niger Delta are addressed to major stakeholders in Chapter 7. 6 Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta 3. BIODIVERSITY ENDOWMENT OF THE NIGER DELTA 3.1 Ecological zones There are several classifications of the ecological zones of the Niger Delta (eg NDES, 2005; IUCN- NDP, 2013 and Okali et. al., 2015).

Table 1 attempts to align the zones recognized by the Panel with other existing classifications. For consistency, this report adopts the classification earlier used by the Panel in IUCN-NDP (2013) whereby the Niger Delta essentially consists of four main ecological zones: \u2022\ufffd lowland forests \u2022\ufffd the upper freshwater riverine floodplain; \u2022\ufffd the lower tidal floodplain comprised of estuaries, mangroves, and creeks; and \u2022\ufffd the outer chain of barrier islands (a special dynamic and ephemeral land formation/coastal vegetation type similar to the lowland rain forest).

An additional threat to the biodiversity is the widespread poaching for bush-meat. An elaborate and systematic survey of the biodiversity of the Niger Delta was conducted by Powell (1993). Although relatively little field work has been carried out in the area in the past 15 years, due to social insecurity, existing data and some limited information available in recent times reconfirm the ecosystem richness of the Niger Delta. Blench (2007) has presented an overview 7 Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta of the mammals of the Niger Delta developed from materials left by Bruce Powell and Kay Williamson and incorporating updated field materials and analyses but that in itself is about 10 years ago. Several researchers from universities in the region have undertaken limited and focused surveys since but these have had a narrow focus due to the challenges mentioned. Despite the limitations of chronology or scope, available studies have shown that the Niger Delta is very rich in biodiversity. Some of the most highly endangered species of primates in the world such as the Sclater\u2019s guenon, the White-throated guenon, the Niger Delta red colobus, the Nigeria-Cameroon Chimpanzee (Angelici et. al. 1998; Angelici and Luiselli, 1999; Luiselli et. al., 1999; Eniang and Luiselli, 2002; Angelici, 2005; Angelici and Luiselli, 2005; Lea et. al., 2005; Luiselli et. al., 2006 and Eniang, 2010) and the Cross River Gorilla are known to still exist in the Delta. The brackish water environment supports a rich fauna. The Delta is the home of some remarkable coastal wetlands and a high diversity of avian fauna (Ezealor, 2003). Investment of time and finance is required to develop biodiversity action programmes in the Niger Delta and the complexity of biodiversity of the Niger Delta needs to be better understood as part of the integrated regional development of the area.

The warm tropical water of the Gulf of Guinea offshore is separated from deeper, more-saline, and colder water by a shallow thermocline\u2014a layer of water between upper and lower levels that lies usually less than 100 feet (30 m) deep. Coastal upwelling, and hence a rich production of plant and animal life, occurs seasonally and locally off the central gulf coasts of Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The entire northern coast of the Gulf of Guinea is washed by the eastward flow of the Guinea Current, which extends 250\u2013300 miles (400\u2013480 km) offshore from Senegal to the Bight of Biafra. The gulf\u2019s tropical water is separated from the Equator-ward flow of the cool Benguela current from the south and Canary current from the north by sharp frontal regions off the Congo and Senegal rivers, respectively. The Benguela Current, as it swings westward, forms the South Equatorial Current to the south of, and running counter to, the Guinea Current. The diversity of the marine flora and fauna of the Gulf of Guinea is limited when compared with that of the western tropical Atlantic and, especially, with the Indo- Pacific biogeographic realm. This relative biological poverty results from (1) a lack of coral-reef ecosystems because of low salinity and the high turbidity of Guinea Current water and (2) the climatic regression to cool conditions during the Miocene Epoch (i.e., some 23 to 5.3 million years ago), during which far fewer refuges for tropical species of animals and plants were available in the Atlantic than in the Indo-Pacific region. Figure 2: Distribution of some marine species in the Niger Delta 10 Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta Large marine mammals in the Gulf of Guinea includes seven species of cetaceans. The seasonal presence of three confirmed humpback whales, leads to the hypothesis that these whales may comprise the north- westernmost range of the population that breeds/ overwinters in coastal waters of the Bight of Benin, northern Gulf of Guinea. Small cetaceans are landed as by-catch but there is no evidence of substantial takes of this group, either targeted or as by-catch. However, concern is raised about even minimal takes of the vulnerable Atlantic humpback dolphin. The Gulf of Guinea contains a number of islands that are of great interest from a biodiversity and evolutionary perspectives. Each island, of greatly differing size and degree of isolation, has evolved its unique sub-set of plants and animals separately from the neighbouring mainland. In particular coral reef fish and marginellid molluscs, whilst not particularly species diverse, show high levels of endemism. The area has been studied as part of the GEF- funded Large Marine Ecosystem programme. As part of such studies the productivity of the ecosystem has been surveyed using for example Continuous Plankton Recorders providing information on the pelagic micro and meio flora and fauna of the Gulf of Guinea. \u00a9 Shell 11 Developing a biodiversity conservation strategy for the Niger Delta 4. DAMAGE AND THREATS TO COMPONENTS OF BIODIVERSITY FROM OIL SPILLS 4.1 Sources of threat Not all of the threats to the Niger Delta\u2019s biodiversity are linked to the oil and gas sector. Threats such as from hunting, land clearings for agriculture, bush burning, unsustainable harvest of trees, fish and other biological resources are commonly seen throughout the Delta. These threats are highly significant. Threats related to the oil industry are locally affecting both land and water. These include impacts of spills, gas flaring and land clearings for establishing various infrastructures such as wells, pipelines and other facilities. A significant direct threat from the oil and gas industry arises from oil spills and hence the focus of IUCN- NDP on this aspect. Water pollution such as from oil spills is the single most important threat to freshwater-, coastal-, and marine ecosystems of the Niger Delta. Such spills in fresh water regions of the Delta impacts the drinking water quality, fisheries and the survival of mangroves. The main causes of oil spills in the Niger Delta are sabotage of oil installations, illegal refining of stolen oil, corrosion of pipelines and storage tanks as well as accidents in oil production operations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ddbc854-1084-489e-ac46-c04cfb8df3d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ddbc854-1084-489e-ac46-c04cfb8df3d0", "e
