KAZAKHSTAN IMPROVED WEATHER FORECASTING ASSISTS AGRICULTURE The world\u2019s ninth largest producer and seventh largest exporter of wheat, Kazakhstan is especially vulnerable to rising temperatures due to its arid climate and landlocked landscape. Without accurate forecasting, inconsistent and inaccurate weather forecasts harm harvests and threaten the food security of the entire Central Asian region. Through a UNDP-supported project on improved forecasting32, the following has been achieved: \uecd6 Meteorologists can now issue accurate climate forecasts for the whole season in a few seconds. \uecd6 600 farmers are receiving up-to-date weather and climate forecasts. Participating farmers have reported a 20 percent higher yield on average. \uecd6 22 advanced wheat cultivation agricultural technologies were introduced; these technologies are resilient to climatic shocks. \uecd6 The Central Asian Wheat Genetic Resource Center was established, with a capacity to store over 300 wild relatives and species of wheat seeds and bringing new collaborative research opportunities. TAJIKISTAN SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT Since early 2000, Tajikistan\u2019s capital city, Dushanbe, has experienced rapid expansion in the use of private motor vehicles. This has led to a significant increase in urban air pollution and GHG emissions. It is estimated that 87 percent of the total air emissions in Dushanbe are associated with mobile sources. UNDP is supporting the Government of Tajikistan to promote sustainable mobility practices in Dushanbe as a means of achieving significant reductions in GHG emissions. This involves: \uecd6 Improving the quality of public transport services and the promotion of soft mobility modes (walking and cycling). \uecd6 Creating dedicated bus lanes for public transport, which cover 15 km and help achieve government-adopted fuel efficiency standards. \uecd6 In May 2014, a city-wide awareness campaign was launched under the slogan \"I'm for safety on the roads, and what about you?\" in collaboration with the Mayor\u2019s Office, the State Automobile Inspectorate of Dushanbe, the Public Organization \u2018The 21st Century Youth\u2019 and UN Volunteers.

These savings, due to lower operating costs, have been used for enhancing patient care and purchasing medicine (e.g. the capacity to provide a therapeutic treatment increased from 10 patients per week to 10 patients per day). \uecd6\ufffd The project also supported the launching of El Salvador\u2019s National Strategy for Energy Efficiency in the public sector, which establishes targets in energy consumption for the national government and also defines a financial mechanism to achieve these targets. \uecd6\ufffd In addition, through a specialized energy efficiency course developed in collaboration with Universidad Centroamericana \u2018Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as\u2019 and the National Energy Council, 72 public institutions have received technical training on equipment and techniques that save energy and reduce GHG emissions. \uecd6\ufffd The project placed particular emphasis on the strengthening of the 112 Committees on Energy Efficiency (COEEs): multidisciplinary working groups responsible for ensuring the efficient management of energy by public institutions. \uecd6\ufffd Further sustainable social benefits of the project include: improved working conditions for hospital staff and the promotion of gender equality in the formation of the COEEs. Overall, the project contributed toward creating a culture of energy saving and efficiency within public institutions.

Attention to the needs and human rights of LGBTI people is therefore essential if countries are to achieve the post- 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a key feature of which is the underlying principle and commitment to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019. Aims and objectives The report, \u2018Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific\u2019, aims to transform the state of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) rights and inclusion in Asia and the Pacific. The report proposes an agenda for action in the context of the SDGs. It does this by drawing from the wealth of data generated by the literature reviews undertaken and the country and regional dialogues convened as part of the Being LGBTI in Asia initiative. The Being LGBTI in Asia initiative is supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Being LGBTI in Asia Being LGBTI in Asia1 is a partnership between Asian LGBTI organizations, community leaders and development partners. Phase 1 of the initiative covered the period of 2012-2015 and was a partnership between UNDP and USAID. The objective of phase 1 was to conduct a participatory review and analysis of the legal and social environment for LGBTI persons in Asia. Being LGBTI in Asia works with a range of partners including the ASEAN Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) Caucus, the Asia Pacific Transgender Network, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Asia-Pacific Forum on National Human Rights Institutions (APF). A Technical Advisory Group provides guidance to the initiative, comprising experts from academia, civil society, government and the private sector, including LGBTI people. In phase 1, the partnership reviewed the rights of LGBTI people in 18 countries in East Asia and South-East Asia. Building on the review, national dialogues were held in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. The dialogues examined LGBTI lived experiences from a development and rights perspective, and included perspectives from government representatives and LGBTI communities. As the project developed, the rights of intersex people were increasingly included within the scope of the work. National reports were published that included recommendations based on inputs to the dialogues and additional research and analysis.2 An Asia-wide literature review was also conducted and further data, resources and experiences were drawn from civil society organizations, academic institutions and private sector partners. 1 The initial name of the project was Being LGBT in Asia. As the project developed, it became more inclusive of intersex people. For consistency, this report refers to the project\u2019s current name, Being LGBTI in Asia, throughout the report, even in reference to work in its earlier phases, except for the official titles of reports, such as the Being LGBT in Asia country reports. 2 Being LGBTI in Asia country reports can be found at http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/ operations/projects/overview/being-lgbt-in-asia/ 2 UNDP also convened a Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia- Pacific in February 2015 with support from the Embassy of Sweden in Bangkok, USAID and other partners.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0aa2b420-2195-47fb-951d-9ecafc230a27": {"__data__": {"id_": "0aa2b420-2195-47fb-951d-9ecafc230a27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "824dce704b4fb7ae5796b36a0d2e8fc7e5eb542de31b880ef3f973f9ab13dc18"}, "2": {"node_id": "567f69bd-bd20-4ad9-b8cf-fd881edf43f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4220267aef5dcbdf82fc21482df98c292868b0f0681f5d73b53a9e79c1c05f0"}}, "hash": "57c7d39045ef8ab9c9d02820fb3bd29bf5f5a00415b781fcc9e8d001156900ed", "text": "The Regional Dialogue gathered 225 participants from Asia and the Pacific.3 Participants included representatives and experts from community, government, National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) and development partners.

This collaborative initiative works with civil society, governments and national and regional institutions to advance protective laws and policies. It also seeks to strengthen and empower regional civil society advocacy groups, and community-based organizations. Audience and partners The primary audience of this report is governments, policy-makers, national human rights institutions, human rights defenders, and community groups. The information and data in the report can also be used to provide substantive linkages between LGBTI inclusion efforts and broader development and human rights agendas of bilateral and multilateral donors, development partners and the UN system. Geography and diversity The Asia-Pacific region is one of vast sociocultural, religious and linguistic diversity that covers a vast geographical area and a large number of countries. The report includes information and experiences of communities from throughout Asia and the Pacific, although less research and data are available from some Asian countries and from the Pacific Islands. Concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity vary greatly across the region. There is a long history of culturally specific indigenous gender identities in Asia and the Pacific. In Asia, examples of these identities include waria in Indonesia, metis in Nepal and kathoeys in Thailand. Many of these communities have a history of recognition by local cultures, and experience varying degrees of acceptance by contemporary society. There are also hundreds of local terms used to describe sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) subcultures in contemporary societies across the region. Terms typically have meanings that combine aspects of both sexual orientation and gender identity or gender expression. Sometimes these terms are considered derogatory, depending on the context, and are used to varying degrees within communities. Alongside local identities, there are communities concentrated mainly in urban areas whose identities correspond more closely with Western subcultures of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender people. 3 Countries represented at the Regional Dialogue from outside Asia included Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Tonga. 3 Examples of indigenous gender identities in Asia and the Pacific \u2022\ufffd Hijras (India and Bangladesh), thirunangais (Tamil Nadu) and khwaja siras (Pakistan) have been a part of South Asian cultures for centuries and have recently been recognized by law as a third gender. \u2022\ufffd The Bugis people of Sulawesi, Indonesia, recognize five gender categories: male, female, calalai \u2013 female-born individuals who identify as neither woman nor man; calabai \u2013 male- born individuals who also identify as neither man nor woman; and bissu \u2013 shamans who embody female and male elements.4 \u2022\ufffd Pacific Island countries also have unique communities including people assigned a male sex at birth who identify as having a gender identity or expression that is either female or who exhibit both feminine and masculine traits. These include the akava\u2019ine in the Cook Islands, vakasalewalewa in Fiji, fa\u2019afafine in Samoa, fakaleiti/leiti in Tonga, pinapinaaine in Tuvalu, and mahu in French Polynesia. Males who identify with these groups often assume female roles in the family, and are usually broadly accepted as part of society,5 although some may experience stigma. Indigenous populations in Australia and New Zealand also have culturally specific gender identities, including whakawahine in New Zealand, \u2018sistagirls\u2019 in Australia and yimpininni in Tiwi Islands (Australia). Examples of local terms used to describe sexual orientation, gender identity and expression \u2022\ufffd In Cambodia, there is a distinction between male \u2018short hairs\u2019 (sak klay), male \u2018long hairs\u2019 (srei sros) and \u2018real men\u2019 (boroh pith brakat). \u2018Short hairs\u2019 are usually married, but also engage in sex with men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8dcecf3-32a7-4409-acc0-486cc6e0b2b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8dcecf3-32a7-4409-acc0-486cc6e0b2b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0bc9994b88e217c076459502a9d010df4b4260a5566d22de9af509381934d8d"}, "2": {"node_id": "1167a222-a530-490e-aab3-f0930649e2dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1993e71efc409b75bcb6f47bd9b4ce447dc0b5ab1a9a372807bfe824ec9eefd"}}, "hash": "f5e0c8ed367135b49de801f1306596c0a16b8b265933ed194065cf48ae9755e6", "text": "\u2018Short hairs\u2019 are usually married, but also engage in sex with men. \u2018Long hairs\u2019 are males who identify and act as women and generally only want to have sex with \u2018real men\u2019.6 Others are described as being \u2018short hair\u2019 by day and \u2018long hair\u2019 by night, illustrating the fluidity of gender identities and expressions.7 \u2022\ufffd In South Asia, there is a distinction between kothis (or their local equivalent) who are males who feminize their behaviours and who prefer to be sexually penetrated by men, and panthis (or their local equivalent), which is a term given by kothis to males who sexually penetrate them.

This includes country dialogues convened in eight countries, the regional LGBTI dialogue, the regional meeting of NHRIs, and their corresponding reports. Other major research included a broad analysis of existing evidence related to SOGIE issues and LGBTI rights in Asia and a regional analysis of all of the country reports. Through these various activities, Being LGBTI in Asia established an evidence base on LGBTI issues in Asia and the Pacific, drawn from academic and epidemiological reports; reports from media, NGOs and multilateral organizations; and most importantly from LGBTI individuals and communities from within the region and beyond. This publication specifically draws on the following reports that were produced with project partners: \u2022\ufffd Being LGBTI in Asia country reports for Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, and the Being LGBTI in Asia: Regional Overview Report on the National Consultations Phase 1 \u2022\ufffd Analysis of Existing Evidence Related to SOGI issues and LGBTI Rights in Asia \u2022\ufffd Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific \u2022\ufffd Report of the Workshop on the Role of NHRIs in Promoting and Protecting the Rights, including Health, of LGBTI People in Asia and the Pacific \u2022\ufffd Meeting Report: Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity/Expression, 15\u201317 June 2015, Bangkok, Thailand \u2022\ufffd Blueprint for the Provision of Comprehensive Care for Trans People and Trans Communities in Asia and the Pacific. Summary The movement for greater social acceptance of LGBTI people is entering a historically significant phase in Asia and the Pacific. The evidence generated by Being LGBTI in Asia identified numerous examples of improvements in the social and legal status of LGBTI people across the region, despite highly challenging social and political contexts. This report illustrates the range of measures taken to advance the greater social, economic and political inclusion of LGBTI people and highlights developments in the key areas of violence protection, education, health, employment, family affairs and political participation, as well as obstacles to further progress. The report describes how in some cases the judiciary has provided leadership when governments have failed to act. It cites positive examples in areas such as discrimination protections, social protection programmes, legal recognition of a non-binary or third gender, and constitutional protections of human rights. The report highlights progressive social and political forces, including the increasing role of LGBTI groups in advocacy, that are propelling progress towards more widespread acceptance of LGBTI people and recognition of their needs and rights. It explores the factors that are contributing to advances in some countries in areas such as legal recognition and social protection. The report also describes the factors that contribute to the neglect of LGBTI people\u2019s needs and rights. It describes the social drivers of oppression and social exclusion including patriarchal traditions, conservative interpretations of religion and lack of democratic governance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ef90a43-090e-4c15-8661-ac7f66562fd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ef90a43-090e-4c15-8661-ac7f66562fd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3066d9a3e9c69a0c7aae1396fe76f7e3ec430f2ae96e711f3fac5af6d500f1b9"}, "2": {"node_id": "eaf472db-0694-4bef-b847-bc954a45f461", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62952d3480d6bda4123d02ba9e675af0e452d61e5988a2e402844b22211655a2"}}, "hash": "518e97a4eed1b6f8cfae575f9ab525f6c5d91fe510bf889f8a41fcdade8d1f7c", "text": "The main outcome of the report is an agenda for action within the context of the SDG agenda.

The commitment to \u2018leave no one behind\u2019 is a key feature of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda. Conservatively estimated, there are at least 100 million LGBTI people living in Asia and the Pacific. Their issues must not continue to be marginalized. Ignorance, intolerance and hatred based on homophobic and transphobic prejudices result in social exclusion and fuel violations of rights, including intolerable levels of violence. It is essential that actions be taken to ensure LGBTI people can fully and securely participate in and benefit from the post-2015 development agenda. A summary of the report, \u2018Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific\u2019, is as follows: Chapter 1 of this report includes the Executive Summary with aims and objectives, audience and partners, geography and diversity, sources and a summary of the report\u2019s chapters, as well as terminology used and a condensed version of the report\u2019s more comprehensive set of recommendations found in Chapter 5. Chapter 2 provides an overview of regional trends and developments relevant to the greater social, economic, political and cultural inclusion of LGBTI people and recognition of their human rights in Asia and the Pacific. A series of significant developments have occurred over the last decade though not every country in Asia and the Pacific has seen progress and in some cases, there have been significant setbacks. Where progress has occurred, the pace of change has been unpredictable and erratic. Nonetheless, the overall trend is towards a more accepting and supportive social and political context for LGBTI people in much of Asia and the Pacific. Key progress has been identified that can be described in three areas. Firstly, the response to HIV has been used as an entry point to advocacy for LGBTI rights. It has led to policies, statements and resolutions that address SOGIE, and the mobilization of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women has built advocacy skills, networks of influence and social capital within these communities. It has also increased visibility of MSM and transgender women, led to partnerships between communities and government, and brought greater attention to the legal and human rights contexts. Secondly, LGBTI visibility is increasing in general in Asia and the Pacific with community mobilization, and pride marches and festivals, assisted by the growth of social media. LGBTI people are more visible in politics, media and the private sector. All this contributes to a more supportive environment for LGBTI people across the region. Arguably the most important of the positive developments is a series of landmark developments in law and policy reform that are creating more positive social environments for LGBTI people. These include the decriminalization of homosexual conduct, and the enactment of legal protections from discrimination relating to sexual orientation and gender identity or gender expression in some countries. The past five years have seen a wave of progressive judicial decisions on the rights of transgender people from Hong Kong SAR, India, Malaysia, Nepal and Pakistan. In recent years, LGBTI issues have also been considered for the first time by many government agencies and national parliaments. In another positive legal development, NHRIs of Asia and the Pacific have recognized that their responsibilities extend to protection and promotion of SOGIE-related human rights. Taken together, these wide-ranging developments in law reform, judicial leadership, and action by governments and NHRIs represent remarkable progress when compared to the situation at the beginning of this century. However, the pace of social change across the region is patchy, and where positive is typically gradual and should not be overstated. 6 Selected milestones towards LGBTI inclusion in Asia and the Pacific East Asia \u2022\ufffd China repeals Hooliganism Law, effectively decriminalizing male homosexual conduct, 1997. \u2022\ufffd Taiwan (Province of China) enacts laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment (2002) and education (2004), and debates proposals for marriage equality for same-sex couples (2014). \u2022\ufffd Hong Kong SAR court recognizes the rights of gay men to equality before the law and non- discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, 2005. \u2022\ufffd Chapter on LGBT rights included in the Mongolia Human Rights Commission annual report on human rights and freedoms, 2013. \u2022\ufffd LGBTI Business Summit held in Shanghai, China, 2014, and LGBT Inclusion Index recognizes corporate good practice in Hong Kong SAR, 2015.

Chief among them are the hostile social, legal and policy environments that persist in many Asia-Pacific countries. For a variety of reasons, including those linked to factors such as conflict, religious extremism, weak governance and economic underdevelopment, some countries have not benefited from the progressive social and political developments summarized above. There has been no notable progress in recognition of the human rights of LGBTI people in a number of countries in the region, and in some, oppressive legal and political environments are contributing to an erosion of the human rights of LGBTI people. Traditional social values and religious beliefs can sometimes create barriers to LGBTI inclusion, and cultural taboos can restrict the open discussion of sexuality in many societies. Resurgence of religious orthodoxy in some countries has been associated with a rise in violence and intolerance of LGBTI communities, including religious laws that create punitive offences affecting LGBT people. In a few countries, LBGTI communities are demonized for political reasons. Another challenge is that certain LGBTI communities are neglected or invisible. While HIV brought attention to gay men, MSM and transgender women, the health needs and human rights of lesbians, transgender men and bisexual people, including young LGBT people, have received little attention and intersex issues are almost completely absent, with both misunderstandings of what are intersex issues and a lack of organized advocacy for the rights of intersex people. A final challenge noted is that intersecting factors influence social exclusion across the region and compound each other, pointing to the need for holistic solutions that comprehensively address all factors that contribute to marginalization. For example, if an LGBTI person has a disability, has HIV, is poor, a migrant worker, a sex worker, a young person or an old person, or is a member of a cultural, ethnic or indigenous community, their vulnerabilities are heightened. International human rights standards At the international level, there has been growing recognition of human rights relating to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and intersex status.

Union of India and Ors, (2014) 5 SCC 438. 13 Sunil Babu Pant v Nepal Government, Writ No 917 of 2007. 8 Chapter 3 provides detailed information on progress and challenges in key areas of relevance to the SDGs (violence, decriminalization, legal recognition, discrimination, health, education, employment, family affairs, media and political participation). Examples are provided of laws, policies and practices that protect and fulfil the human rights of LGBTI people in these key areas and thereby support achievement of the SDGs. The report illustrates developments by reference to diverse country experiences, including information from the Being LGBTI in Asia country and regional dialogues. Laws and policies Violence towards LGBTI people is a key issue, as recognized, for example, by the unprecedented joint statement by 12 UN entities in September 2015 calling for an end to violence and discrimination against LGBTI people. The Being LGBTI in Asia dialogues confirmed the shocking nature and incidence of violence against LGBTI people across the region. Yet existing legal protections as applied to LGBTI people are limited. Hate crime laws may be useful but have not been adopted in many countries. \u201cIn the Pacific, a more robust human rights-based approach to HIV and sexual and reproductive health and rights is urgently required. This includes the need for anti-discrimination legislation, the decriminalization of homosexuality and sex work, which continue to be criminal offences in most countries... In the 21st century, countries must adopt legislation that recognizes sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, President of Fiji, Address to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific Intergovernmental Meeting on HIV and AIDS, 2015 Criminalization of LGBT people legitimizes prejudice in society at large, contributes to mental health problems common among LGBT people, and exposes people to hate crimes, police abuse, torture and family violence. Yet consensual homosexual sexual conduct between adult males is criminalized in at least 19 countries in Asia and the Pacific. Some countries criminalize consensual homosexual conduct under Islamic sharia law. Lesbian sexual conduct is also criminalized in some countries. Laws also criminalize cross-dressing, although there have been successful cases of overturning these laws. Asia-Pacific countries that criminalize adult male homosexual sexual conduct Asia Pacific Islands Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, India, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Singapore, Pakistan, Sri Lanka Cook Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu Legal recognition of transgender people is crucial for achieving a number of SDGs such as gender equality and ensuring healthy lives. But the vast majority of transgender people in Asia and the Pacific cannot obtain identity documents that give them recognition before the law, and thus legal protection. There is an international trend towards legal recognition of gender identity, through introduction of procedures to enable transgender people to register a change in sex or gender details to match their gender identity. But the area is complex and success in Asia and the Pacific has been mixed. In Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, there is legal recognition of a third gender. 9 \u201cTransgender people experience some of the highest levels of hostility, violence and discrimination. This is because others regard the demand of transgender people to be themselves, and to act in ways that appear normal and rational to themselves, as challenging to the heteronormative binary division of humanity into male and female categories... The opponents and critics of transgender people regard this binary division of humanity as immutable \u2013 ordained by God or nature and thus not to be denied or challenged by individual conduct, advocacy or law. At its worst, these attitudes deny any legal recognition to transgender identity... Whilst this may be comfortable for a majority of society, it has been burdensome and discriminatory towards transgender people.\u201d14 The Honourable Michael Kirby, former Justice of the High Court of Australia Intersex variations are generally not well understood by policy makers, and are often conflated with transgender identities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2e2ab59-fd70-4813-bfb1-61d095026044": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2e2ab59-fd70-4813-bfb1-61d095026044", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9750a49f04d6870612d0e487988f7f389122622020157db1dee780c1962d6a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f930190-6aec-40b3-954d-e1ebf519fe17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f6d3e767bd91fe46b6824cf843813c54de8a56c49a293cc9f36203838f6536b"}}, "hash": "4a72b321bd2823d0ae84e713fd2f91e025b87a76018817903902ae9bc6b9298b", "text": "Largely due to ignorance of the nature and extent of intersex variations, few countries in Asia and the Pacific have attempted to develop laws and policies to recognize and protect the rights of intersex people.

Marriage equality is only allowed in some Pacific Islands that are territories of France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The marriage rights of transgender people are also an issue. Protection from discrimination includes both constitutional and legislative protections. Anti- discrimination laws can provide practical protections from unfair treatment and support to social inclusion. Relatively few countries offer comprehensive protection, though some individual laws or acts can cover sexual orientation and/or gender expression, as do measures at sub-national levels such as cities and municipalities. Health, education, employment, family, media and political participation The Being LGBTI in Asia dialogues emphasized the need to understand the health needs of LGBTI people according to each distinct population, and that particular attention should be given to the neglected health needs of lesbians, transgender men and intersex people. Key health issues in the region include banning conversion therapy, ensuring health care services that are non-discriminatory, addressing mental health issues, and recognizing and addressing the health rights of transgender and intersex people. While HIV and sexual health is a dominant issue for MSM and transgender women, lesbian and bisexual women\u2019s health tends to be neglected. Ensuring that LGBTI people have access to inclusive and equitable quality education requires attention to bullying and other mistreatment within the school system. Extensive harassment was described in written reports and at the national and regional Being LGBTI in Asia dialogues. School uniforms are a particular issue for transgender people. Inclusive curricula and teacher training would be beneficial but is found in few locations, though awareness of SOGIE issues is being raised in colleges and universities throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Employment discrimination includes being rejected for positions or denied promotions, harassment including sexual harassment, dismissal or being forced to leave jobs, and denial of partner benefits available to heterosexual couples. HIV-related stigma is a contributing factor to workplace discrimination particularly for gay men, MSM and transgender women. Transgender people can have fewer employment options and be pressured to conform to gender norms to keep their jobs. Legal protections against workplace discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation exist in some countries, though fewer address gender identity and/or expression. Some leadership is being shown in the private sector by large companies operating in Asia and the Pacific who have progressive LGBTI policies or initiatives. 14 Kirby M. (2015). Transgender persons, legal disharmony and attitudinal change (paper), pp. 12\u201313. 10 Family life plays a central role in Asian and Pacific island cultures, and the Being LGBTI in Asia dialogues placed considerable focus on describing family dynamics in each country, and how LGBTI individuals are treated within the family. Traditional patriarchal family structures are often at odds with LGBTI identities. Some societies were reported as generally tolerant of male homosexual behaviour, so long as it is secret and men still marry and have children. The positive roles of NGOs like PFLAG were noted for encouraging family acceptance of LGBTI members but accurate information for families and positive role models is still needed. The media has tremendous influence on public perceptions of LGBTI people as well as the political context. While standards are gradually improving, media reporting is still typically more negative than positive in its portrayal of LGBTI people across Asia and the Pacific. Censorship of positive LGBTI content was noted as an issue, though several positive media initiatives were highlighted. Many countries have their own LGBTI media, and this is increasing with social media and the internet used as a substitute for traditional print media. The final area addressed in this review of progress and challenges in key areas related to the SDGs is that of political participation. The challenge to being involved in mainstream politics for LGBTI people is clear, and yet political parties representing LGBT populations have been established in the Philippines and Thailand. There has also been visible LGBTI political participation in Australia, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal and New Zealand. Chapter 4 summarizes progress in LGBTI organizing in Asia and the Pacific, and discusses the challenges faced by LGBTI organizations in different social and political contexts. One of the most important factors in LGBTI lives is the strength of their communities. Investing in LGBTI organizations financially and recognizing their work publicly is important for strengthening communities. It allows for empowerment of LGBTI people to engage in effective advocacy to change laws and policies, to respond to and defend against human rights violations (including through mounting public interest litigation) and to influence public attitudes.

Constraints on civil society in general, such as difficulties for NGOs to register, can affect LGBTI groups. Divisions within LGBTI movements include different priorities and strategies, and competition for funds. LGBTI groups can also face harassment or attacks from police and religious groups, though sometimes turn challenges into advocacy success. The great diversity in strength and capacity between and within countries and between LGBTI organizations is noted, as well as the use of the internet and smart phones for networking and community mobilization. A snapshot of LGBTI organizing in Asia and the Pacific is provided, as well as regional organizing. The chapter notes that opportunities at national and regional levels for sharing of lessons and experiences, and the development of strategic alliances among LGBTI organizations and with other allies in civil society, are increasingly important in the context of LGBTI organizing being generally more positive now than ever. Chapter 5 provides conclusions and a comprehensive set of recommendations for LGBTI inclusion. They are aimed at governments, donors and multilateral organizations, national human rights institutions, the private sector and LGBTI organizations \u2013 and are placed within the context of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals which provide the development agenda and framework over the next 15 years, underpinned by principles of just and inclusive societies, and human rights. Most of the recommendations are directed at governments, which have primary responsibility for delivering on the SDGs and which have the power to change the laws and policies that directly impact on LGBTI people\u2019s lives. The recommendations are organized with reference to the SDGs to guide countries on how to address LGBTI people\u2019s issues in their national planning, with specific reference to the following SDGs: ending poverty (SDG 1), ensuring healthy lives (SDG 3), inclusive and equitable education (SDG 4), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), decent work for all (SDG 8), reducing inequalities (SDG 10), making settlements safe, resilient and sustainable (SDG 11) and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, access to justice and accountable and inclusive institutions (SDG 16). 11 Terminology The terminology used around gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation is complex, and sometimes contested as terminology can have deep effects on both individuals and communities. The definitions below are a guide to how these expressions are used and referred to in this report, although they are not definitive and may change with time. LGBT, LGBTI: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex. The terms \u2018LGBT\u2019 and \u2018LGBTI\u2019 are increasingly used by community-based advocacy organizations in Asia and the Pacific. While these sexual orientations and gender identities should not necessarily be grouped together at all times, it can be helpful to group issues affecting LGBTI populations together for the purposes of advocacy and solidarity, while acknowledging that there are significant differences between the issues and priorities of each of these populations. Policy makers sometimes prefer other umbrella terms such as \u2018gender and sexual minorities\u2019, \u2018SOGIE minorities\u2019 or \u2018SOGIE-diverse communities\u2019. However, for consistency, this report uses the terms \u2018LGBT people\u2019 or \u2018LGBTI people\u2019. The term \u2018LGBT\u2019 is used in this report where the context does not include intersex people. Because awareness of intersex issues and people has been relatively low until recently, and remains low, it is not always accurate to use the term \u2018LGBTI\u2019. For example, if LGBT advocacy in a country does not yet include intersex issues, it would be inaccurate to add the \u2018I\u2019 to describe it. This report also wishes to note recognition that concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity vary greatly across the region, with a long history of culturally specific indigenous gender identities in Asia and the Pacific. There are hundreds of local terms used to describe SOGIE subcultures in contemporary societies across the region. Terms typically have meanings that combine aspects of both sexual orientation and gender identity or gender expression. Alongside local identities, there are communities concentrated mainly in urban areas whose identities correspond more closely with Western subcultures of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e5070ef-4c74-4170-965b-af1a13e3c14f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e5070ef-4c74-4170-965b-af1a13e3c14f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9aba70c93e42173ed15a70f991b6d08247ba24f2b8d935f28b9d1a81eb4aa596"}, "2": {"node_id": "24e8c973-7f91-483c-bcf1-7d6a3cabe2bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f8639ad9b1162cf2e0422ef8684a3f1748334ed3e379f8088e5baad9e9af46a"}}, "hash": "a655fefb30136757d4229d598217b253dcbad4c7528fe6e174e37f0aebb798ef", "text": "However, in this report, the term \u2018LGBTI people\u2019 is intended to be inclusive of all gender and sexual minorities in Asia and the Pacific, regardless of whether they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or as another culturally specific identity.

While the use of \u2018LGBTI\u2019 has a stronger emphasis on communities and individuals, these terms refer more strongly to the broader concepts of how individuals identify themselves or are attracted to others. Gender identity: A person\u2019s gender identity is a deeply felt sense of being male, female, transgender, or another non-binary gender identity. A person\u2019s gender identity may correspond to, or be different from, the person\u2019s male or female biological sex. There are many gender identities, including those that describe a third gender, being both male and female, or identifying as gender non-conforming or gender variant. There are a wide range of gender identities and communities based on gender identities across Asia and the Pacific. Gender expression: Gender expression refers to a person\u2019s expression of their masculinity, femininity or other gender characteristics, for example through their behaviour, clothing, jewellery and hairstyle. Every person has their own sense of how they express their masculinity and/or femininity externally. People are particularly vulnerable to discrimination when their gender expression is different from their biological sex, or when it combines elements of both masculine and feminine gender expression. Transgender: The term \u2018transgender\u2019 is used to refer to all people whose internal sense of their gender (their gender identity) is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Someone assigned a female biological sex at birth who identifies as male is referred to as a transgender man. He might also use the pronoun \u2018male\u2019 to describe his identity. A transgender woman is someone assigned as male at birth 12 according to biological sex who identifies as female. She might use the pronoun \u2018female\u2019 to describe her identity. In this report, \u2018third gender\u2019 people are considered to fall within the umbrella term \u2018transgender\u2019. Third gender: The term \u2018third gender\u2019 is used in some countries to refer to people who identify as neither male nor female. In some countries, people who identify as neither male nor female have a legal right to documentation confirming their identity as belonging to a third gender or a non-binary category. In South Asia, people who may register as third gender include hijras in Bangladesh, khwaja siras in Pakistan, metis in Nepal, and hijras and thirunangai in India. Transsexual: The term \u2018transsexual\u2019 is sometimes used to describe transgender people who have undergone or want to undergo medical procedures related to a transition from one biological sex to another, such as gender affirming surgeries. Gender affirming surgeries: This is a term used to describe genital reconstruction surgeries and associated medical procedures. The alternative term \u2018sex reassignment surgery\u2019 or \u2018SRS\u2019 is often used. However, this is problematic because it creates the impression that genital reconstruction is just one rather than multiple surgeries. Transgender people around the world are increasingly using the terms \u2018gender affirming\u2019 surgeries and \u2018gender affirming\u2019 health services. Intersex: \u2018Intersex\u2019 is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. An intersex person is a person born with atypical sex characteristics, such as sexual anatomy, reproductive organs and/or chromosome patterns that do not fit the typical definition of a biological male or female. Intersex describes a person\u2019s biological sex characteristics, rather than their gender identity or gender expression. These biological characteristics may be apparent at birth or emerge later in life, often at puberty. There are many different intersex conditions. Many intersex infants are subjected to procedures, including genital surgery, to adapt their bodies to culturally dominant definitions of maleness and femaleness. Typically, intersex people do not want to be defined by a medical condition or term such as intersex, and most identify to be either female or male. An intersex person may identify as female, male, both or neither. Sexual orientation: \u2018Sexual orientation\u2019 refers to a person\u2019s capacity for profound emotional, physical and/or romantic attraction towards other people. Same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings and behaviours are normal and positive variations of human sexuality. Attractions, feelings and behaviours may be oriented towards people of the same biological gender or gender identity, a different biological gender or gender identity, or to variations including towards both same and different genders and expressions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edd93e81-f864-4ba7-bb69-b897cdc269d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "edd93e81-f864-4ba7-bb69-b897cdc269d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Leave no one behind: Advancing social, economic, cultural and political inclusion of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific - Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ccd05db4f5beb5d45b272cbfa4b3799d4557f9080db2ae783e2c392dc9e914b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ac60cfb-34d9-4214-b86c-5c761149d137", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/leave-no-one-behind-advancing-social-economic-cultural-and-political-inclusion-lgbti-people-asia-and-pacific-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d90bcb09d4068d1752c8fa1d6ad0fb0354c78deb80e0a20d4b1fce06c397c02"}}, "hash": "62936141929d835b2bb7de6d6d749d46016ef5a1f6d3750cc52e8b63be3fe1ff", "text": "Biphobia, homophobia and transphobia: These terms indicate a dislike, hatred or fear of or prejudice against bisexual people (biphobia), homosexual people (homophobia) and transgender people (transphobia).

While the roles of communities, NGOs, multilateral organizations, the private sector and other actors will all be essential for LGBTI inclusion, policies and action at the level of national and local governments are among the most important. The recommendations below are therefore primarily aimed at governments, in addition to other actors (the full set of recommendations is found in Chapter 5 of the report). Achieving the SDGs requires States to take actions to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all people, including LGBTI people. Governments should include the following actions in their national plans for achievement of the SDGs: 13 End poverty in all its forms everywhere (SDG 1) Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all (SDG 8) Many LGBTI people experience poverty and social disadvantage due to a complex intersection of social and economic factors, often compounded by family rejection, restricted education and employment opportunities due to discrimination. Governments and partners should: \u2022\ufffd Provide programmes to reduce social and economic marginalization of LGBTI people through multipronged, holistic approaches that recognize diversity in sexual orientations, gender identities, gender expressions and sex characteristics. \u2022\ufffd Ensure these programmes address intersecting factors that contribute to marginalization including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, sex characteristics, caste, class, health status, disability, occupational status, religion, race, ethnicity and migration status. \u2022\ufffd Ensure LGBTI people are not excluded from employment and driven into poverty due to stigma and discrimination in the workplace, education and training. Governments as employers should lead by example in efforts to eradicate stigma and discrimination including through enacting comprehensive anti-discrimination laws. \u2022\ufffd Work in partnership with the private sector to promote inclusive workplace diversity policies and programmes that value and support LGBTI employees. \u2022\ufffd Provide social protection programmes for economically disadvantaged LGBTI people, including access to welfare support, housing and microloan programmes to expand livelihood options. \u2022\ufffd Address LGBTI people\u2019s needs as a component of poverty reduction and food security programmes. Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages (SDG 3) LGBTI people\u2019s mental and physical health needs are often poorly served by existing health services. LGBTI people\u2019s health issues should be included in the professional education and training of health care workers. Governments and partners should: \u2022\ufffd Reduce stigma and discrimination affecting LGBTI people in access to health care through inclusion of LGBTI issues in medical school curricula, and ongoing professional education, and training and sensitization of health care workers. Ensure health care workers do not treat homosexuality, bisexuality, transgender status and intersex status as diseases, illnesses or forms of moral deviance. Ensure hospitals and other care facilities are safe for LGBTI people. \u2022\ufffd Provide non-discriminatory health services and health promotion programmes that address the specific physical and mental health needs of each LGBTI population. \u2022\ufffd Ensure health services are able to address the mental health needs of LGBTI people in a sensitive and evidence-based manner, recognizing the social causes and personal consequences of LGBTI experiences of stress, social isolation, depression, addictions, low self-esteem and self-blame. \u2022\ufffd Provide transgender and intersex people with access to medically necessary health services without using diagnostic categorizations that stigmatize and pathologize their identities. \u2022\ufffd Ensure people are not subject to \u2018conversion\u2019 therapy or other interventions that purport to alter a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. \u2022\ufffd Ensure all HIV services and sexual and reproductive health services respect the diversity of sexual orientations, gender identities and bodies, and are inclusive of intersex people.

It brought together more than 200 representatives of governments, development partners, national human rights institutions, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people and other civil society members. The Regional Dialogue discussed achievements in LGBTI rights in key areas such as health, education, employment and social protection and explored avenues to further strengthen the protection of LGBTI human rights across the region. The Regional Dialogue aimed to identify opportunities, build trust, and promote innovation and action. It also actively encouraged private sector involvement in LGBTI rights and provided a forum for LGBTI community organizations and development partners to forge strategic linkages in order to take their agendas forward. The Regional Dialogue was an important step in building consensus and strengthening the movement for legal and social change to advance the human rights of LGBTI people in Asia and the Pacific. The following section provides an overview of the key themes captured during the Regional Dialogue. 1. Advocacy LGBTI communities are calling for protections from violence, police abuses, and stigma and discrimination in employment, health, education, housing, justice and government services. Law reform priorities include decriminalization of homosexual conduct, gender recognition laws, anti-discrimination laws, hate crimes laws, violence protection laws and constitutional rights to equality. A key advocacy theme is that LGBTI rights are not special rights. LGBTI people seek recognition as equal citizens with rights to non- discrimination and equality before the law that must be respected, protected and fulfilled. A common issue for the LGBTI advocacy agenda is the harmful impact of binary male/female gender roles, which are often promoted by conservative moral and religious frameworks. Binary gender concepts contribute to social alienation and the climate of hostility and violence experienced by many LGBTI people across Asia and the Pacific. Non-binary gender systems, such as official recognition of a third gender or \u2018other\u2019 gender identity, give formal recognition to the diversity of gender expressions and identities. Some South Asian countries are making progress through legal recognition of \u2018third gender\u2019 people for certain purposes. There have been some notable advocacy successes for gay men and transgender people, e.g. ordinances in some cities of the Philippines and constitutional measures in Fiji that provide protection against discrimination. By comparison, intersex issues are largely misunderstood or ignored. A nascent intersex advocacy movement exists in Australia and China. An advocacy priority for intersex people is stopping surgery performed on children at a young age, which raises human rights issues relating to rights of self- determination and bodily autonomy. Bisexuals are often invisible, and their issues are either ignored or not taken seriously. This makes advocacy challenging as people do not accept or understand the nature of bisexuality. Lesbian issues are also marginalized given this community\u2019s lack of visibility and power in most communities, although the recent emergence of lesbian activism in China was noted. Civil society leadership: Advocacy is most effective when led by LGBTI communities. Community-led activism increases the visibility of LGBTI people in society and educates the public and governments about the nature of rights violations affecting LGBTI people. Activism is key to challenging harmful attitudes, combating stigma and changing harmful laws, policies and practices. LGBTI activists stressed the importance of linking their advocacy to broader human rights movements, including the rights of ethnic and indigenous minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, youth and the poor.

In India, the lengthy campaign to decriminalize homosexuality was set back by the Supreme Court decision upholding section 377 in 2013. The Supreme Court decision has had ramifications beyond India in other countries with similar laws, such as Malaysia and Singapore. Legislation and constitutional reform: The law can be either an enabler of, or an obstacle to, the enjoyment of human rights by LGBTI people. Advocates seek the repeal of punitive laws and the enactment of protective laws. However, law reform is a slow process and examples of progress in law reform are rare. Some jurisdictions appear to be going backwards, for example, Brunei and Aceh province of Indonesia have introduced harmful laws that criminalize and stigmatize LGBTI people. Fiji provides a positive example \u2013 its 2013 Constitution prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Palau decriminalized homosexual conduct in 2014 as a result of a recommendation from the Universal Periodic Review process. Australia is the first country in the region to recognize intersex status separately in law from transgender status and sexual orientation. New Zealand is the first country in the region to legislate for marriage equality. Gender equality laws and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) can provide an entry point for advocacy, particularly for lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people. Advocacy should target the bureaucracy responsible for implementing laws as well as the parliamentarians responsible for legislative reform. National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs): NHRIs of Asia and the Pacific are committed to implementing the Yogyakarta Principles, which were adopted in 2006 to guide efforts on LGBTI human rights. NHRIs promote respect for the Yogyakarta Principles by state and non-state actors. Some NHRIs are particularly active on sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) issues including Indonesia and the Philippines. In a meeting convened immediately prior to the Regional Dialogue, NHRIs agreed on a Programme of Action and Support to continue and expand this work, and will report on progress in 2016. International human rights mechanisms: LGBTI rights can be advocated through international mechanisms such as the UN Commission on Human Rights. There is a growing body of legal decisions confirming that LGBTI people are protected by international law. Criminalization of sodomy has been found to be in breach of international law by the UN Human Rights Committee (Toonen v. Australia). Sexual orientation and gender identity issues have also been addressed by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council through thematic reports and communications. The Universal Periodic Review process has been important in some cases, for example, for the decriminalization of sodomy in Palau. Media: Television, press and social media can be useful advocacy tools to influence opinion and change attitudes. A television series called \u2018Love Patrol\u2019 had a huge impact in the Pacific Islands by changing audience understandings about LGBTI people and challenging stigma and discrimination. Sri Lanka has a history of censorship of LGBTI issues but there has been recent progress with the performance of a play based on the true experiences of gay and bisexual men. 2. Health Priority health issues of LGBTI people include adolescent health, mental health, HIV, sexual and reproductive health, violence protection and response, and transgender people\u2019s access to sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy. Mental health: Mental health problems are common among LGBTI people. Negative factors impacting mental health include criminalization, pathologization, corrective counselling, intrusive psychological therapies, and religious and cultural transphobia and homophobia. Many LGBTI people experience social isolation, depression, low self-esteem, addictions, low confidence, self-doubt, self-blame and paranoia. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 3 There are high rates of suicide. Mental health services are often uninformed about LGBTI people\u2019s needs. In some countries, LGBTI groups provide peer support and counselling in safe places, but most countries have few or no services. Mental health services and support for LGBTI people should be integrated into government social services. Decriminalization, legal recognition of gender identity and legal recognition of same-sex relationships would encourage stable relationships that are good for people\u2019s mental and physical health.

There are no guidelines on best practice for intersex health. In 2013, the Australian government initiated a Senate Inquiry that made recommendations for guidelines, multidisciplinary teams and resourcing to ensure effective peer support and involvement in the medical pathways offered to intersex people. It is crucial not to pathologize intersex conditions. Provision of information and support to families of intersex people would help to address the high incidence of suicide among intersex people. HIV: Criminalization and stigmatization of people because of their sexual orientation or their gender identity makes it harder to engage people in HIV prevention and treatment. Sodomy is still a criminal offence in many countries, particularly Commonwealth countries. Fiji and Palau have removed the sodomy offence from their laws, but otherwise across the region there is a lack of progress on law reform. Criminalization of sex work means that male and transgender sex workers hesitate to take an HIV test or to carry condoms. Young gay men and transgender people are at very high risk of HIV and therefore require targeted, rights-based interventions. Health care workers: LGBTI issues are not included in the health care curriculum of workers, so most are unaware of how to address the specific needs of LGBTI people. Inclusion of SOGI issues in the professional curricula of health care workers is required. Many medical colleges still treat homosexuality as a disease or a form of moral deviance and there is little professional education available to health care workers on transgender and intersex issues. 3. Economic impacts and private sector roles Research shows a relationship between economic growth and the protection of LGBTI rights. People who are discriminated against at work or in school are likely to be less productive. Productivity is undermined by depression, suicide and unemployment. Markets recognize that countries that protect rights have more productive workers. There are economic costs to homophobia and transphobia. Discrimination and abuse from family members impacts people\u2019s social capital and life chances including access to education, health care and employment. Economic models can measure the financial cost of social exclusion. There is a significant impact on Gross Domestic Product. Many transgender people are excluded from workplaces because of their gender expression. Gay men and lesbians face stigma, violence and verbal abuse at work. Companies should have a human resource policy that gives employees the right to express their sexual orientation and gender identity and to choose the gender that they prefer at work. A more inclusive workplace culture increases productivity, improves corporate image, and increases employment loyalty and satisfaction. Companies should: put LGBTI anti-discrimination policies in their corporate guidelines and codes of conduct; provide training to managers and employees on handling LGBTI issues; provide partner benefits to attract talent; support non-government organizations (NGOs) to provide training to staff members; and create friendly environments for LGBTI subcultures in the Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 4 workplace. Companies should also recognize that LGBTI people comprise a significant market for goods and services, and meeting their needs can be profitable, for example the provision of tailored financial products and LGBTI tourism. 4. Personhood and legal gender recognition Rights to self-defined gender identity and gender expression are basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. It is profoundly important to transgender people to have the legal right to have their gender of choice officially registered. The right to change gender on documents such as passports and birth certificates has practical implications in terms of accessing health care, employment and rights to travel, but is also of fundamental significance to a person\u2019s self-esteem and dignity. The right to change gender registration must not be linked to surgery, sterilization or other types of medical treatment. Young people should have the right to change gender and to attend school as their chosen gender. Very few countries in the region provide legal gender recognition to transgender people. There is concern about the harmful impact on transgender people of laws that prohibit gender expression such as the law against cross-dressing recently introduced in Brunei Darussalam. Positive legal developments include court decisions supportive of legal gender recognition and third gender status in India, Nepal and Pakistan, government recognition of a third gender in Bangladesh and a supportive court decision from Hong Kong SAR on the right of a transgender woman to marry a man. In addition to identity documents, practical measures to be implemented that respect personhood include pension rights and welfare support to transgender people and access to appropriate bathroom facilities.

Research is required to understand the adverse impact of the absence of gender recognition laws on the lives of transgender people, the beneficial impacts of the enactment of gender recognition laws, and evidence of strategies that are effective in protecting rights. 5. Education LGBTI students are more likely to be bullied than other students, including through the internet. Heteronormativity and the male/female gender binary are deeply entrenched in school education systems. Incidents in which teachers witnessed assaults on LGBTI students but took no action were reported from several countries. In Malaysia, guidelines were prepared to guide teachers on how to identify gays and lesbians in schools based on superficial criteria drawn from stereotypes. As a result, schoolboys were identified as gay based on their feminine behaviour and sent to a corrective camp so they could become more masculine. Transgender university students also face discrimination for example in Thailand where universities impose rules that require transgender women to cut their hair, conceal breasts and dress as males. There is generally no education on intersex issues or support to intersex students in schools. Intersex people advocate for education on intersex issues to be included at all levels of education system including elementary school. LGBTI people and their allies can change social norms to promote diversity and acceptance in and through education. Governments should consider interventions in the following areas: Policies: Schools require policies that go beyond a general anti-bullying policy. Comprehensive and inclusive education policies are required that specifically address sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Without a policy, teachers may fear that taking action might affect their own employment. Teacher support: Ensuring teachers actively support LGBTI people is crucial and teachers need to be supported to play this role. Teachers should be sensitized and given pre-service and in-service education Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 5 on SOGI and homophobic bullying. Having a teacher who is affirming and supportive can make a huge difference to LGBTI students in improving their self-esteem and supporting them to stay at school and achieve better educational outcomes. Medical textbooks in China and India still recommend outdated and harmful forms of conversion therapy that have no scientific basis. Peer support: Support from LGBTI peers and gay\u2013straight alliances inside and outside of schools affect positive change in the school environment. Inclusive curricula: LGBTI issues can be integrated in the curriculum through sex education, health education or other entry points. Development of a SOGI-inclusive curriculum is important to address bullying, harassment, low enrolments, high drop-out rates, poor mental health and poor performance. In Nepal, sexual orientation and gender identity issues have been introduced in the curriculum. This contrasts with some Indian states where all sex education is banned in schools. Research: Governments should conduct research to document the harms caused by homophobic and transphobic bullying. Collecting data can provide an evidence base to demonstrate that bullying is a serious problem and to inform changes in policies and programmes. 6. Families Many LGBTI people struggle for family acceptance. Rejection, violence and abuse in family settings cause many LGBTI people to seek new families from among their LGBTI peers. \u2018Family\u2019 are people who love you and who you love, and may include allies, friends, neighbours, and accepting relatives. Parents often are ill-prepared to accept their LGBTI children due to lack of information and the influence of culture and religion. Parents can cause harm to their children by treating their sexuality or gender identity as a psychiatric condition or immoral conduct. Pressure to marry including arranged marriages can be very harmful and lead to suicide. It is important to provide safe spaces for young LGBTI people to access peer support. Young LGBTI people can also have a role in educating their parents when coming out, provided their parents are willing to engage and be educated. Educational resources specifically designed for parents and family members are very helpful. Organizations such as Pink Dot in Singapore and Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) in Viet Nam provide recognition to family members who are accepting and supportive of LGBTI people and provide a platform for parents and other family members to demonstrate their support. Children should be protected from being victimized because they are perceived to be different. Intersex children are often subject to specific violations of involuntary and medically unnecessary surgery and other interventions that call for special protections in response.

Laws on family violence should protect LGBTI children from violence from their families. Same-sex marriage is legalized in New Zealand, and some Asian countries including Nepal and Viet Nam are beginning to debate possible legal frameworks for the recognition of same-sex relationships. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 7 Opening remarks Helen Clark, Administrator, UNDP The reviews conducted as part of Being LGBT in Asia revealed that many countries have laws and policies that directly or indirectly discriminate against or criminalize people on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity. The inclusion of LGBTI people and the fight against homophobia and transphobia are core to the sustainable development agenda and human rights for all. Equal rights are not special rights. The Universal Declaration on Human Rights promised a world that is just and inclusive of all, including LGBTI people. For generations, many LGBTI people have been subject to institutional and social discrimination, and to violence on the basis of their sexuality, gender identity and gender expression. This hurts all of us. When it comes to human rights, an injury to one is an injury to all. There is also a large economic cost to discrimination and exclusion. The World Bank has found that the cost of homophobia to the Indian economy is at least US$1.9 billion per annum. Discriminatory laws that are used to stigmatize, criminalize and punish LGBTI people must be replaced by laws that protect LGBTI people from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Public education and access to employment are essential to challenge the negative stereotypes and create greater understanding, and we must not forget the importance of family support to young LGBTI people. Luc Stevens, UN Resident Coordinator, Thailand It is inspiring to see more than 200 people from more than 30 countries of Asia and the Pacific in attendance at this Dialogue. It is testimony to the principle that human rights are for everyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The individual and collective experiences of participants reflect the diverse histories, cultures and economies of Asia and the Pacific. Far too often LGBTI people are stigmatized by society, overlooked when seeking employment, and discriminated against in health services, schools, communities and families, and are thereby excluded from development opportunities. Laws and policies that cast LGBTI people as criminals and deviants increase their vulnerability to HIV and create further marginalization. There are some positive changes led by communities. In many countries, communities are enabling LGBTI people, including young people, to claim their rights and realize their goals. In the Philippines, community groups have worked with local governments to pass anti-discrimination ordinances. In India, the courts have articulated the human rights of transgender people as a result of advocacy efforts of communities and allies. In Bangladesh, hijra and transgender communities held their first pride festival in 2014. The second phase of Being LGBT in Asia was launched this week. This is the first regional UN initiative on LGBTI rights. Over the last two years, Phase One of Being LGBT in Asia has helped to establish a database of information. This Regional Dialogue will help to shape the priorities for Phase Two and to build solidarity and forge new partnerships. In 2015, we are entering the new era of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. In order to achieve these goals, there must be greater attention to the people that have been left behind and excluded from development. This requires greater inclusion and the full realization of the rights of all people no matter their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon has called for action to tackle violence, decriminalize consensual same-sex relationships, ban discrimination and educate the public.

Today, I am proud to introduce the leaders of the Mongolian LGBTI community. Our LGBTI community is small and mostly active in the capital Ulan Bator. LGBTI people who live elsewhere still live a secret and torturous life. Our challenges include the highest priority of stopping violence against LGBTI persons, changing social and cultural expressions affecting LGBTI people, and stopping discrimination in the workplace, education, health and the law. We have to change harmful attitudes of police, health care workers and teachers. People need to listen to each other\u2019s truths without judging and harassing one another. Hopefully, one day, Mongolia will also be able to benefit from an open-minded, tolerant dialogue, so we too can have a respectful dialogue in the community and parliament. Honourable Louisa Wall, Member of Parliament, New Zealand All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. We need an approach that recognizes LGBTI people as equal human beings and equal citizens within our countries. Governments must govern for everyone, not just the majority or those with the loudest voices. Our first priority must be to eradicate state discrimination, to repeal all laws that discriminate against LGBTI people. Homosexual law reform in the Asia-Pacific region is a collective priority so we are no longer defined as criminals. From this foundation, each of our nations working with LGBTI communities can identify how to best give expression to collective and specific LGBTI rights. Parliaments have a role in protecting the rights and inclusion of LGBTI people including in the provision of goods and services by the state and society as a whole. New Zealand achieved homosexual law reform in 1986 and marriage equality was achieved in 2013. But we still have challenges, particularly for youth. Issues of youth suicide and physical abuse are too high. There is a petition before parliament urging our government to address the inadequate supply of publicly funded gender reassignment health services. Improving our responses to the intersex community is another area of challenge. New Zealand\u2019s Marriage Equality Act defined marriage as a union of two people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. Marriage is a civil and social institution. Only the government can issue marriage licenses to consenting adults. My principal argument in the marriage equality debate was that the state must not discriminate against any of its citizens in its role of issuing marriage licenses. Where, how and who is involved in a marriage is private. However, in advocating freedom from discrimination, we must also recognize the right to freedom of religion. Under our law, celebrants are authorized but not obliged to marry a couple, thereby protecting religious institutions and the practice of their own definition of marriage. This strikes a balance between freedom from discrimination perpetrated by the state and freedom of religion. The realization of human rights can be achieved by mutual respect. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 9 Geena Rocero, Trans Activist and Founder of Gender Proud, USA and the Philippines Growing up in the Philippines, I would experience pain. When I walked home from school, tuk tuk drivers would feel entitled to shout and swear at me. The LGBT community was the first family outside of my blood family that showed me love. When I was five years old, I wore a t-shirt on my head. My mother would ask me why, and I replied: \u201cThis is my hair, I am a girl.\u201d This was my first act to self-identify. The pursuit of self-expression is the most powerful gift to the world. When my mother told me my green card had been approved to migrate to the United States of America (USA), she told me that the USA has a law allowing me to change my name and the gender marker on my legal documents. It changed my life to be able to look at my identity card to see it reflect who I really am. It made me finally feel validated and dignified. As a result I followed my dream to become a model in New York in 2005. When I travelled to Tokyo, immigration officials asked me why my Philippine passport that has a male gender marker did", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bd34882-a17a-484a-8542-ccc36e9c6c1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bd34882-a17a-484a-8542-ccc36e9c6c1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-regional-dialogue-lgbti-human-rights-and-health-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-regional-dialogue-lgbti-human-rights-and-health-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88b8dbbda015f1671b083bd3a4520266a93e1301322b1e17a9d5a680e318b526"}}, "hash": "88b8dbbda015f1671b083bd3a4520266a93e1301322b1e17a9d5a680e318b526", "text": "not match my appearance.

The main challenge is overcoming people\u2019s negative attitudes. My spinal cord was severed in an accident 12 years ago, and since then I have relied on a wheelchair for mobility. It is often assumed that people with physical disabilities have little capacity to contribute to society. However, since my accident I have dedicated myself to various causes, including raising awareness of the rights of people with different abilities through media work. Although I experienced financial hardship as a result of the accident, I have not been deterred from pursuing an active career, through which I have tried to encourage a more open discussion of sexuality, gender and disability issues in society. People who are gay or do not conform to gender norms are sometimes treated as secondary in society and there is little understanding that people with disabilities are also sexual beings. My sexuality is important to my self-esteem. Fundamentally, people value you for what you achieve. Being an active member of society with a career in the media, I seek to demonstrate that differences of physical disability and sexuality should not affect how you are valued by society. Professor Douglas Sanders, Mahidol University, Thailand In 2011, the UN Human Rights Council passed its first resolution supportive of LGBT rights. It recognized equality rights for lesbians, gay and transgender people, but the resolution did not include intersex people. This was significant because the Human Rights Council is a political body at the UN, and takes its instructions from its member states. UN member states have opposed LGBT organizations gaining consultative status. This status is required to allow organizations to speak and to access government and NGO representatives at official UN meetings. For many years the Economic and Social Council of the UN (ECOSOC) refused to grant consultative status Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 10 to LGBT organizations. When the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) applied to ECOSOC, the Government of Malaysia opposed the application and insisted on having their opposition placed on the record because ILGA in their view promotes immoral behaviour. The shift that occurred in 2011 arose because LGBT rights were no longer defined as only a Western issue. Latin America had become supportive, as well as South Africa. Asian countries have not been very active in these UN debates although occasionally Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Thailand have indicated support. In 2014, 22 states of the UN Human Rights Council confirmed their commitment to sexual orientation and gender identity rights and instructed the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to monitor the situation of LGBT people globally. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has been consistently supportive and willing to criticize the sodomy laws of African governments. Three roads led to acceptance of LGBT rights by the UN and ultimately to this Dialogue in Bangkok: women\u2019s rights, equality rights and HIV.

The first lesbian or gay organizations to gain official NGO consultative status at the UN were lesbian organizations working at the women\u2019s conferences. At the Fourth UN Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, 33 states wanted wording in the declaration to recognize sexual and gender diversity. The Chair recognized that it was the first time this issue was to be discussed at a UN event. However, the Chair dropped the section because of the strength of opposition. Equality rights: The UN Declaration on Human Rights does not exclude LGBTI people. The UN has a campaign for SOGI rights, titled \u2018Free and Equal\u2019. The discrimination that was most blatant was the existence of sodomy laws in half of the world that justified police abuses, blackmail and bashings. As a result, many gay people stayed in the closet to protect themselves. France decriminalized homosexuality in the 1800s, and much of Europe followed. However, the British included a sodomy offence in their penal code, which was exported to its colonies. The result is a checkerboard in Asia. Muslim Indonesia had no sodomy prohibition, but Muslim Malaysia had a prohibition. Both Buddhist Cambodia and Myanmar had no prohibitions. Confucian Singapore had a prohibition but mainland China had none. Homosexual criminal laws became the clearest example of ongoing discrimination condemned by the UN Secretary- General and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights. The first legal victory was the 1994 ruling of the UN Human Rights Committee in the Toonen case. It found that the sodomy offence in Tasmania was a violation of human rights. The proposed anti-homosexuality law in Uganda has been the most high profile issue in recent times. The controversy over these proposals led to threats of economic sanctions. The reaction to a prosecution of a gay couple in Malawi resulted in donor pressure leading to pardoning of the couple. These events kept the issue of gay rights as an equality issue alive at the UN. Eastern Europe decriminalized sodomy after the collapse of the Soviet Union in order to support new states to enter the European Union. However, the situation changed with Russia\u2019s introduction of the anti-gay propaganda law, which prohibits positive media coverage of homosexuality. This prompted protests at the Winter Olympics. There is now a clear divide between Russian-affiliated countries and African countries on the one side, and the Latin American and Western countries on the other. For Asia, the situation is more mixed. We do not have a regional pattern. LGBTI people do not have the same level of broad support in Asia as is provided by the Western bloc and Latin America. Recent developments include the punitive Aceh law in Indonesia, Brunei\u2019s Sharia laws and the prosecution of Anwar Ibrahim for sodomy in Malaysia. There has been decriminalization in Hong Kong by stages and China seems remarkably relaxed on these issues. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 11 HIV and AIDS: AIDS made gay men visible in the West in the 1980s. It became clear that gay men are everywhere. HIV also brought LGBT rights into the agenda of UN agencies, the World Bank, the regional development banks and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We became part of the new international health and human rights agenda. Few would have predicted that UNDP would become the lead intergovernmental agency for LGBT rights in Asia. It began with UNDP\u2019s work on HIV. In 2012, UNDP creatively managed to link with USAID\u2019s LGBT programme to create Being LGBT in Asia. Sweden also came on board. This is a unique achievement. There are no parallel programmes in other regions of the world. Session 1: The role of advocacy in advancing rights and inclusion Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 14 Key messages \u2022 Advocacy priorities include protections from violence, police abuses and stigma and discrimination in employment, health, education, housing, justice and government services. \u2022 Law reform is required for decriminalization of homosexual conduct, gender recognition laws, hate crimes laws, violence protection laws, anti-discrimination laws and constitutional equality rights. \u2022 Binary male/female gender roles contribute to alienation and a climate of hostility and violence. Non-binary approaches, such as legal recognition of \u2018third gender\u2019 people, give formal recognition to the diversity of gender expressions and identities. \u2022 Civil society activism, leadership from the judiciary and supportive parliamentarians have advanced LGBTI rights in some countries. However, conservative religious and political forces remain challenging.

Parliamentarians are also required to uphold the National Constitution. Our Constitution is inclusive of all citizens and guarantees enjoyment of constitutional rights to food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, non- discrimination and equality. Issues for LGBTI people in a rights-based approach include the eradication of gender-based violence, recognition of the right to love, and the incorporation of different international human rights instruments. It is important that anti-discrimination laws enable access to health care without discrimination. Political commitment is required to carry out advocacy to remove stigma and discrimination, mobilize resources and to train health care workers. In Bangladesh, we have recognized hijra as a \u2018third gender\u2019 and we have special hijra budgets to fund student stipends and rehabilitation programmes for hijra communities in 14 districts. Social transformation takes time. We have to work together for this common goal. LGBTI persons\u2019 rights and the role of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), Chris Sidoti, Expert Advisor to the Asia Pacific Forum of NHRIs (APF) The APF works with the 22 NHRIs in the region, stretching from Palestine to Samoa. Many countries have not established an NHRI. NHRIs are established by law, but are intended to be independent of government and to challenge government when rights are violated. The Yogyakarta Principles were adopted in 2006 to guide efforts internationally on LGBTI human rights. One of the recommendations from Yogyakarta was directed at NHRIs, stating: \u201cNHRIs (should) promote respect for the Yogyakarta Principles by State and non-State actors, and integrate into their work the promotion and protection of the human rights of persons of diverse sexual orientations or gender identities.\u201d In 2009, an APF workshop was held on implementation of the Yogyakarta Principles. The following year, the APF\u2019s Advisory Council of Jurists (eminent jurists from Asia and the Pacific) provided an authoritative legal statement about sexual orientation and gender identity human rights issues and developed recommendations for implementation in Asia and the Pacific in areas such as education, capacity building, monitoring, research and advocacy. NHRIs met this week in Bangkok and we heard reports from NHRIs of 16 countries about SOGI activities undertaken. Some NHRIs reported expansive activities, whereas others reported limited engagement, Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 15 but all indicated that they are prepared to commit to this area of work despite the domestic sensitivity of SOGI issues. At the end of the two-day meeting, the NHRIs agreed to a Programme of Action and Support to continue and expand this work, with an undertaking to give serious consideration to the agreed action points. To support implementation, APF is preparing a manual on the role of NHRIs in relation to SOGI, and will commence a training programme early next year for NHRIs. Close collaboration with civil society organizations will be a key priority in implementing the Programme of Action and Support. The meeting also made recommendations to UNDP to continue their technical and financial support to NHRIs to address SOGI issues. To mark the tenth anniversary of the Yogyakarta Principles, Indonesia\u2019s Human Rights Commission has offered to host a meeting of NHRIs on SOGI issues in 2016. This will provide an opportunity to assess progress in implementation of the Programme of Action and Support. Inclusive engagement of LGBTI people: Progress from Fiji, Ashwin Raj, Media Industry Development Authority Fiji has undergone legal transformation. Fiji\u2019s 1997 Constitution prohibited discrimination on the grounds of gender and sexual orientation. The 2013 Constitution went further, with an expanded list of prohibited grounds including sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Both the state and NGOs had an instrumental role to play, and civil society organizations worked tirelessly to achieve these outcomes. Social change cannot be achieved only with a change in legal infrastructure. The media needs to be educated on these issues too. Hate speech in social media is very prevalent. The state should facilitate minority media so society hears a plurality of voices. We need to explore what it means to have meaningful debate outside the privileged mainstream media, which is dominated by discourses of medicalization and criminalization. Media can be a catalyst for the epistemic shifts in society that are required.

Its members are elected in a personal capacity and do not represent their countries in the Commission. In the past 10 years, there has been increasing recognition of LGBTI rights in countries of the Americas through decisions of courts or actions of parliaments. About three years ago, IACHR created a specific office in charge of LGBTI issues known as the Rapporteurship on LGBTI Rights. IACHR\u2019s role is to prepare reports on specific issues such as violence, review and process complaints against member states, develop standards and conduct visits to countries. The Asia Pacific region has no regional human rights body. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights is constrained compared to IACHR because it is comprised of representatives of member states. Despite our differences, there is still much to learn and we should focus on similarities not differences. In each region the problems are similar, such as violence, killings of transgender women, police abuse, torture, criminalization and suicide. Progress in addressing these issues has been supported by political will, the institutional backing of IACHR and the strong backing of civil society organizations. Useful strategies have included coordinating with general human rights NGOs, engaging with NHRIs and local governments, and using health as an entry point to LGBTI rights. It can be useful to address the most obvious human rights violations first, such as violence, torture and police abuses. It is also important to remind countries that obligations regarding LGBTI rights arise from the major international human rights treaties, so these rights are not up for negotiation or debate. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 16 Opportunities for advancing rights through international human rights mechanisms, Christian Courtis, Human Rights Officer, Office of the High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) Regional Office for South East Asia Recognition of the rights of LGBTI people is an ongoing struggle. Although enormous progress has been made over the last 10 to 15 years, there is still a long way to go. Human rights mechanisms can be an effective arena for the struggle. Civil society organizations, NHRIs and government officials can bring LGBTI rights issues to international human rights mechanisms such as the UN Commission on Human Rights. This can highlight the issue globally and place pressure on the country concerned to comply with human rights requirements. SOGI has been an invisible issue because LGBTI people are not specifically referred to in international human rights treaties. Nonetheless, progress has been made by interpreting the spirit of treaties to include SOGI issues. Criminalization of same-sex intimacy was found to be in breach of international law in the Toonen case, in which the UN Human Rights Committee found that the sodomy law of Tasmania (Australia) was contrary to the human rights to privacy and non-discrimination. There is a growing body of legal decisions confirming that LGBTI people are protected by international law under the category of an \u2018other status\u2019. SOGI issues have also been addressed by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council through thematic reports and communications. The Universal Periodic Review process has been important in some cases. For example, Palau decriminalized homosexual conduct as a result of a recommendation from the Universal Periodic Review process. In all of these cases, civil society organizations have played a crucial role in documenting violations and bringing cases to the international level framed in human rights language. OHCHR has also led the UN\u2019s \u2018Free and Equal\u2019 campaign to raise public awareness about homophobia and SOGI rights, including a Bollywood video clip that became the most watched UN video in history. Dialogue Community perspectives Hijra from Bangladesh: As a young man, my parents tried to make me more masculine by sending me to do construction work. My parents assumed I only had the skills to be employed as a labourer. I pursued a career in providing support to the hijra community at the Bandhu Social Welfare Society. After 15 years, I obtained a masters degree and became an established artist. I use the arts as an advocacy tool to promote the rights of hijra people. This has helped to promote broader community acceptance. For example, the police commissioner attended a recent exhibition. A highlight has been supporting the Hijra Pride festival in 2014, attended by 1,000 hijra. The event attracted global media coverage.

Despite the conservative religious and cultural context of Bangladesh, we have demonstrated how to build a social movement. Transgender woman from Vanuatu: Being transgender in Vanuatu is not easy. My early childhood was relatively normal. At school, threats and verbal abuse commenced and when I attended high school, I was brutally bashed by a group of boys. It was a planned attack that involved endless punches and smashing of plates on my head. I thought that I would die. The worst memory was of a teacher who witnessed the incident but allowed the bashing to continue. After this event, I lived with fear and was threatened regularly on the streets. But I did not change how I wanted to dress. In 2009, I became involved in a television series called Love Patrol, in which I played myself as a transgender person. This television show had a huge impact in the Pacific Islands and changed audience views and understandings about LGBT people. It helped challenge stigma and discrimination. I am proud that through this role, I could be a model to young gay men and transgender people. Schools and village communities across my country are beginning to be educated about sexuality, gender and human rights issues. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 17 Transgender man from Nepal: I served in the army from 2003\u20132006, which was rare for a person born female at that time. However, when they found a female soldier spending time with me, they accused me of having sexual relations and kept me in jail for 60 days. It was damp and cold. They did not inform me of the grounds for my detention. I signed a paper not knowing the legal consequences. This was against my will. I felt discriminated against on the grounds of my gender expression but was unaware of my rights. After my release, I filed a case against the government challenging the legality of my detention; however, this claim did not succeed. Transgender sex worker from Nepal: The realities of life on the street as a sex worker are harsh in Kathmandu. Police have broad discretion to enforce the public offences law against transgender people by accusing them of creating a nuisance on the street. The Supreme Court ordered the government to give transgender people citizenship as equals, but the order has not yet been implemented. In reality, there is no equal opportunity for transgender people even though many are skilled. I was sacked from my job at a restaurant when the owner discovered I was transgender. Sex workers are at constant risk of violence from police and customers, particularly in the tourist areas where the police are active. Transgender people are often arrested for no apparent reason as they are going about their daily life. Even if we are just shopping, police harass us. I act as a human rights advocate for transgender sex workers, but I also face harassment from police and the risk of imprisonment. Transgender woman from Indonesia: International Transgender Day in 2013 was the most unforgettable day of my life. I was the Project Officer for a beauty pageant in Southern Sulawesi. The event included a workshop about sexuality, laws, human rights, and HIV for transgender women. Five minutes before we started, people who claimed they came from a religious group ambushed us. A sword was used to threaten us, a wooden chair was thrown, and my fellow transgender friends ran in fear of the threats to kill us. Transgender sex worker from India: Ethnic communities that have existed in this region extend beyond the labels of LGBTI to include hijra and many other specific cultural identities. Governments should expand access to education to create a pathway for the coming generations. A priority should be given to effective dialogue with the bureaucracy as well as the parliamentarians. Preventing violence including killings of transgender women requires urgent attention. Gay man from India: Section 377 of the Penal Code still criminalizes sex between men as \u2018unnatural\u2019. Since the decision of the Supreme Court that found section 377 to be valid, there has been an increase in harassment of LGBT people by police and families. Incidents of blackmail, torture and sexual abuse are reported. This gives rise to physical, mental and emotional harms. Most people in the LGBT community are scared to file cases against the police because they fear that this will lead to disclosure of their identity to their families.

Gay man from India: LGBTI people were thankful that the National Human Rights Commission called for the Penal Code to be amended after the 2013 Supreme Court judgement on sodomy. However, until the law is changed the rights of people to lodge complaints with the Commission remain unclear. In 2001, the National Human Rights Commission refused to consider a complaint lodged by a gay man because homosexuality was criminalized. The complaint was about a man who was subject to psychiatric abuse by a mental health practitioner. In the case of complaints against the police, the reality is that it can be very difficult to lodge complaints to police of assault by police. Bisexual activist from India: Bisexuals are often invisible, and their issues are too often ignored or not taken seriously within society and also within the LGBTI movement. There are few safe spaces for a serious discussion of the experiences and emotional challenges of bisexuality. People wrongly assume that bisexual people are confused or pretending to be gay or straight, are trying to be cool, or are overly sexual. This makes advocacy challenging as people do not accept or understand the nature of bisexuality. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 18 Transgender lesbian from Hong Kong SAR: LGBTI people use media as a tool for advocacy. It is hard to control the media but we can at least try to touch the media with our own stories. We can move and inspire people with our own stories. People ask me why I work in the LGBTI movement. In 2004, my transgender friend committed suicide in her home. Another good friend of mine jumped to her death in 2008. These events motivate me. We need to talk more about our personal stories to let everyone know what is happening. Since 2008, I have advocated publicly through telling my stories through newspapers, magazines, radio and television. Participant from China: The way we label ourselves can be constraining. The current framework of \u2018LGBTI\u2019 is not sufficiently inclusive and can itself reinforce binary notions of gender. For example, the term transgender may not be sufficiently broad because the dominant normative way of thinking about transgender people is female-to-male or male-to-female, i.e. people who have undergone the full process of transition. This is reflected by rigid laws and also by some approaches within LGBTI advocacy. For some people, surgery or treatments are not affordable. Further, maintaining gender fluidity may be necessary to survival particularly if they are from a poor rural area. Some prefer a unique third gender identity, rather than being either male or female. Our conversation would benefit from looking at non-binary gender systems, such as third gender, so we can push the agenda forward, recognizing a diversity of gender expressions and identities. South Asia appears to be making progress through legal recognition of \u2018third gender\u2019 people for certain purposes such as voting. Transgender man from the Philippines: Being a female-to-male transgender person can be difficult in the patriarchal society of the Philippines. After a TV documentary aired in which I disclosed being transgender, I received sexual proposals from many gay men curious to know how it feels to have sex with someone with female genitalia. This demonstrates how transgender men are often objectified. Rather than being treated as people, we are reduced to being perceived as a different kind of rare physical experience. This is a form of discrimination within the LGBTI community. We are stronger if we can stand together. An intersex person from Australia: I belong to an intersex-led support and advocacy group. Intersex issues receive relatively little attention in LGBTI advocacy. Many intersex people do not identify with the LGBTI framework. Intersex is an umbrella term referring to 30 to 40 genetic variations of the body. Human rights issues for intersex people start very early in life. Intersex can be tested prenatally for variations. Rather than being an issue of \u2018identity\u2019, being intersex is about the lived experience of the body, given these genetic variations. The critical period for many intersex people is when they are an infant or child. This is the period in which surgical pathologization and gender surgery occurs to make intersex people conform to stereotypical gender binaries. These procedures happen at an age when a child cannot consent, so doctors and parents make these decisions. This raises human rights issues relating to the right of bodily autonomy. Inclusion is difficult for intersex people who are silent because they are invisible or because they have been surgically erased.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e19645d-8205-45ae-bc6a-804f9c3c631e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e19645d-8205-45ae-bc6a-804f9c3c631e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-regional-dialogue-lgbti-human-rights-and-health-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-regional-dialogue-lgbti-human-rights-and-health-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf1534d452dd13b22d0f18403146078032bdbcd10f1d118340bdbf7557cc932e"}}, "hash": "cf1534d452dd13b22d0f18403146078032bdbcd10f1d118340bdbf7557cc932e", "text": "Australia is the first country to declare intersex status separately in law from transgender status and sexual orientation. This legal recognition has been very useful but how this interacts with policymaking and service provision in the LGBTI context is still in its infancy. Intersex person from Hong Kong: I was born with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. My genitals are different from other men and women. It is a biological issue, not a gender identity issue or a matter of choice. When I was a child, I experienced over 30 painful genital reconstruction surgical procedures without my consent. My family wanted me to be male for cultural reasons. It is a benefit for families to have male children. Intersex people are fighting for the human right to life. Babies are abandoned or killed just because they are born intersex. Children should not be forced to have unnecessary treatment, such as reconstructive surgery. Let us grow up as we are. Give us full information so we have the right to choose to be a man or woman. Let it be our own decision. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 19 Lesbian from Indonesia: I am a self-identified queer person, and a Christian. I have been pressured by other Christians to reject homosexuality. A Christian colleague asked me, \u201cHow can you believe in God if you have a relationship with another woman?\u201d Another sent me an article on how God condemns homosexuality. My faith is different; it is my personal spiritual journey and is not defined by family, society or government. God created each of us as unique. Faith and sexuality are inside us as human beings. Religion is too often misinterpreted to justify violence and discrimination. In Indonesia, the Youth Interfaith Forum on Sexuality provides safe spaces for young people to discuss how to integrate faith and sexuality. Gay man from Malaysia: In 2011, the police banned Seksualiti Merdeka (a sexuality rights festival) on the grounds of it being a threat to religious harmony and national security. Politicians and anonymous bloggers asked that it be shut down, and that the organizers be arrested or stoned to death. In the community debates that followed, it became clear to me that not all LGBT people want the same types of equality. Some self-identified Malaysian gay men prefer that \u2018the gay agenda is best served quietly\u2019 and to \u2018practise our homosexual activities not in public but in private\u2019. Initially, this frustrated me. It seemed that our freedoms would be reduced to smaller spheres. On reflection, I concluded that the different modes of citizenship \u2013 ethno-religious nationalist citizenship, economic citizenship, and international citizenship \u2013 formed conflicting political subjectivities among gay men in Malaysia. But we do not have to share the same politics to support each other\u2019s right to exist. Gay man from the Philippines: I grew up in an indigenous community and I joined their struggle for land and self-determination. But I hid my sexuality. When I came out as gay it was met with ambivalence. It was suggested I should marry a woman and hide my sexuality from the village. I was told that our right to land comes before my right to love. In my struggle for non-discrimination, I found myself as part of a new tribe of LGBT friends. The social divide is strong between the rich and poor. The upper- class LGBT people are less engaged in our struggle for rights, while the larger population of low-income LGBT people struggle for hand-to-mouth survival. The small middle class takes leads in advocacy. But the middle class tends to be stuck within its comfort zone. Our struggle is part of a larger resistance. There needs to be greater focus on the realities faced by a lesbian working in a textile factory, a gay man in the rural countryside, a person living with HIV living in an urban informal settlement or the experiences of a transgender person who is also indigenous. Governments, companies and civil society organizations need to provide safe spaces for LGBT people. We need affirming policies that grant us equal rights, not special rights. Homophobia and transphobia should be regarded as a people\u2019s issue rather than the exclusive domain and burden of the LGBT community. Gay man from Bhutan: Bhutan is a very religious country but there are not strong feelings against homosexuality in Bhutan, as the issue has largely been ignored. LGBTI rights are not discussed.

I started a Facebook page in 2012 as a platform for discussion of LGBTI issues. I have never faced discrimination and hate crimes are not experienced. However, the people of Bhutan are not well informed about sexuality. There are strong preconceived binary gender roles. Lots of gay people are scared of admitting they are gay. Normal life is defined as being married. No one has come out publicly. We need role models to show what it is to be \u2018out\u2019. Gay man from Sri Lanka: There are people who have attempted to \u2018come out\u2019 in the media but this has been censored. Films and plays have been censored for their content because they dealt with LGBTI issues. We use the creative arts to spread the word about the realities of being LGBTI in Sri Lanka. We were threatened with stoning when we sought to perform a play at a state university. There has been some recent progress. Permission has been given to perform the play \u2018If You Promise Not to Tell\u2019, with a script based on the real experiences of gay and bisexual men. The script was presented to the Censor Board. The play was given a censor licence to be performed in public, subject to removal of some swear words and on the condition that it is advertised as containing \u2018adult-only themes\u2019. Improvement in the lives of LGBTI people is slow in Sri Lanka. LGBTI issues have been sidelined by issues of ethnicity, which have been prioritized during the national conflict. With democracy there is a new sense of hope. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 20 Comments from government experts and NHRIs National Human Rights Commission of India: The Supreme Court of India has recently recognized that transgender people have equality rights in areas of education and employment. Some state governments are responding with new programmes. For example, Tamil Nadu state has established a specific welfare programme for transgender people. Human Rights Commission of Australia: NHRIs can play a role as a conduit or point of contact in which community can have engagement with police or other agencies of state. Violence is unacceptable against anyone in society. There is no place for harassment or violence against anyone. The role of the Human Rights Commission is to insert itself as a middle party between the community and police, educate and engage police, and take them on a journey so they can understand why there may be disproportionate harm to certain parts of the community such as LGBTI people and try to fix it. Ensuring NHRIs perform this role is important to ensure that NHRIs are taken seriously by the state. Government expert from Sri Lanka: Research has recently been published by UNDP, UNFPA and partners on sex workers and violence in Myanmar, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The report demonstrates that problems are very similar across the region. Sri Lanka\u2019s NHRI and Ministry of Justice agree that there is a need to find a solution to these problems by changes to the law and awareness programmes to politicians, health care workers and lawyers. Government expert from Nepal: A landmark decision of the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2007 decriminalized same-sex sexual activities and recognized the third gender in Nepal. However, police conduct remains a widespread concern particularly as it affects sex workers. Sex work is not legalized yet, so law enforcement officials enforce the Anti-Trafficking Law against sex workers. This suggests that maybe the time has come to revise Nepal\u2019s Anti-Trafficking Law. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 21 Session 2: LGBTI marginalization: Addressing health needs and reducing HIIV vulnerabilities Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 24 Key messages \u2022 Priority LGBTI health issues include mental health, HIV, sexual and reproductive health, violence, transgender people\u2019s access to sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy, and performance of surgery on intersex infants that is not medically necessary. LGBTI suicides are a concern across the region. \u2022 Criminalization and stigmatization of people because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression makes it harder for HIV services and other health services to reach LGBTI people. \u2022 Stigma and discrimination can be addressed through education and training of health care workers to ensure homosexuality, transgender status and intersex status are not treated as diseases or forms of moral deviance.

There is some progress addressing MSM issues at provincial levels and in China\u2019s cities. There is an understanding that there is a need to address the clinical needs of LGBT people and to educate government and clinical doctors that LGBT needs exist in areas such as health and employment. Areas that require focus include research on mental health needs and the types of discrimination that are commonly faced to inform the services. International organizations provide funding for many of the MSM and LGBT services. Funding is required to provide more comprehensive services, and government officers and social organizations need to be mobilized in the context of a five-year health plan. Why the criminalization of behaviours and identities is not good for health, The Hon. Michael Kirby, Former Justice of the High Court of Australia Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) rights are part of human rights generally. Whether the struggle is for women\u2019s rights, gay rights or indigenous rights, the common enemies are ignorance, lack of science and the unkindness of human beings to one another. We must make common cause. UNDP organized the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, which concluded that the laws against LGBTI people are extremely bad for health. If you stigmatize people because of their sexual orientation and their identity, you make it harder to reach out to the stigmatized group, especially if they are criminalized. It is much harder to get into people\u2019s minds if they are criminalized. This is the AIDS Paradox \u2013 you have to reach out with laws that are not unfriendly. If you stigmatize people and push them into a corner you harm them and society. Similarly with sex workers, many are prosecuted on the basis of having condoms in their pockets. This discourages carrying condoms, which is bad for them, for their clients, their clients\u2019 sexual partners and for society as a whole. There have been good court decisions from Bangladesh, India and Pakistan on transgender rights. But for MSM, the Supreme Court of India reversed the wonderful decision of Justice Shah of the Delhi High Court in 2013. The Supreme Court judgement upholding section 377 was inconsistent with the decision of the same Court a few months later on transgender rights. In Singapore, the Court of Appeal declined to intervene to hear a constitutional challenge to that country\u2019s sodomy provision partly because of the Indian Supreme Court decision. The courts of Malaysia have upheld the sodomy conviction of the politician Anwar Ibrahim who has been sentenced to jail. So long as the sodomy law exists it will be used for political purposes and to blackmail people. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 25 Many Commonwealth countries still have the section 377 offence against sodomy. There is an association between the criminalization of sodomy and the high levels of HIV in the Commonwealth countries of the Caribbean, as compared to French or Hispanic countries of the Caribbean. Science and rationality must be put in the place of ignorance and prejudice. In our region, Fiji and Palau have removed the sodomy offence from their laws, but otherwise across the region there is a lack of progress. We need to ask what can we do to break this logjam. There is overwhelming evidence that stable long-term relationships are good for people\u2019s health. The law should be sustaining and respecting of people\u2019s health and their equality rights. Marriage equality falls within a citizen\u2019s right to equality under the law. The looming crisis for LGBT youth: Young MSM, transgender people and HIV vulnerabilities, Prof. Frits van Griensven, Senior Advisor for Pevention, HIV Netherlands Australia Thailand Research Collaboration Data from Asia on young MSM and transgender people show that HIV prevalence has increased over the last decade. Recent data show a frightening picture. The HIV incidence for these groups of people over 25 years old is 15 percent but for 15\u201321 year olds is much higher, e.g. 30 or 40 percent. Young people are twice as much at risk of acquiring HIV than their older counterparts. This is because young people are more vulnerable. It is how the epidemic develops. The chances of a young person having sexual relations with an older person are greater than with a person the same age or younger. For example, in Thailand there are 60,000 young MSM and 500,000 MSM who are older, so HIV is being transmitted to youth.

Older MSM may have a prevalence of 30 percent. In MSM above 40, this rises to 50\u201360 percent of people who are already infected and who will likely stay alive because of ARVs. Mental health issues related to gender-based violence, Ging Cristobal, Project Coordinator Asia and the Pacific, International Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) Data on LGBT mental health are available from a five-country study involving Japan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Philippines titled \u2018Violence Through the Lens\u2019, and from the Being LGBT in Asia country reports. If we \u2018come out\u2019 and express ourselves, we may face family abuse, violence, verbal abuse, being thrown out of our homes, and discrimination in work, schools, police and government services. If we do not come out, isolation can kill us. Many of us do not assert our rights because we think we do not deserve them. The position is complicated further if an LGBT person is a person with a disability, is poor, a migrant worker, a young person or an old person, or a member of a cultural, ethnic or indigenous community. Other negative factors include criminalization, pathologization, corrective counselling, intrusive psychological therapies, and religious and cultural transphobia and homophobia. This combination of factors makes it harder for government to provide services and for LGBT people to seek help. These factors affect how we negotiate personal and sexual relationships and assert our rights. Many of us experience mental health problems including social isolation, depression, low self-esteem, addictions, low confidence, self-doubt, self-blame and paranoia. There are high rates of suicide as people seek to end the suffering. Many have no access to mental health services and services that exist are often uninformed about LGBT people\u2019s needs. In some countries, LGBT groups provide support and counselling. In the Philippines, the Psychological Association is becoming more sensitive to our issues and is providing counselling services to LGBT people. In Viet Nam, PFLAG provides support. However, most countries have few services. Mental health services and support programmes for LGBT people should be integrated into government social services. Ignored communities: Intersex health and rights priorities, Hiker Chiu, Organization Intersex International The term \u2018intersex\u2019 is poorly understood but was first applied in the early twentieth century to describe people whose biological sex could not be categorized as clearly either male or female. An intersex person may have biological attributes of both sexes or some of the attributes considered necessary to be defined Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 26 as one or the other sex. Intersex is always congenital and can result from genetic, chromosomal or hormonal variations. The term is not applicable to a person who has deliberately altered his or her own anatomical characteristics and is different from transgender status. Intersex people represent 1.9 to 4 percent of the global population. It is a wide biological variation in humans and encompasses a spectrum of physical conditions. Intersex people can identify as LGBTI or as straight. However, intersex is not an identity as such, it is just what we are. Like LGBT people, we face stigma and discrimination from the binary gender system. Many want us to be either male or female. In most countries, there is still only a male or female box to choose from. Many intersex people would prefer to be themselves, which in itself is a health and human rights issue. Most surgery that we are submitted to is not necessary but is done for cosmetic reasons. Our right to be ourselves is taken away by surgery, often when we are under two years old. ILGA has held three International Intersex Forums since 2010. These Forums issued statements that provide useful guidelines on the human rights of intersex people to bodily integrity, physical autonomy and self-determination. Dialogue Community perspectives Intersex person from Australia: I was diagnosed as intersex at infancy. It was treated as a medical emergency. My parents were given medical information but were not given any peer support. My parents were not given enough information to look after my best interests. The surgery imposed on intersex people reinforces the stigma, secrecy and shame associated with intersex status. My gonads were removed when I was 11 years old and I have been on hormone replacement therapy since then. I have been required to do painful vaginal dilation exercises since the age of 13 to prepare for heterosexual sex.

In 2013, the Australian government initiated a Senate Inquiry into the coerced sterilization of intersex people. The submissions from the medical profession confirmed that there is no professional consensus about treatment and surgery for intersex variations and there are no long-term studies to show the benefits and detriments of treatment and surgery. Surgical normalization often happens only for psychosocial reasons such as to reduce parental stress or reduce the stigma that children may experience from society. These are very circular justifications, because you are erasing the intersex body with surgery, which in itself perpetuates stigma. The Senate Inquiry made recommendations for practice guidelines, the use of multidisciplinary teams to provide care and support, and resourcing to ensure effective peer support and involvement in the medical pathways offered to intersex people. There is a lot of education required and intersex peers need to be able to influence policies and guidelines. Intersex person from China: Government policymakers should listen to intersex people, and educate the general public that intersex is not a disease or disorder. This is needed to combat stigma. It is crucial not to pathologize the condition. It is also very important to provide accurate information and support to families of intersex people. This would help to address the very high incidence of suicide among intersex people. A young gay man from Indonesia: The issue about the law is not just about decriminalization but also about the laws and policies that control young people\u2019s bodies, such as laws relating to parental consent and marital consent as a requirement to access health services. The government controls our bodies by these laws, particularly for adolescents. In Jakarta, HIV testing and treatment is available in government clinics, however services for other needs such as mental health needs is more difficult to access. We need to consider not just HIV care but all Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 27 health needs for LGBT people including those related to mental health and associated with violence and harassment, and these health needs should be covered by the universal health insurance coverage scheme so that unemployed youth can also access services. Education of young people about SOGI issues happens in LGBTI community settings. We also need to address SOGI issues in schools through comprehensive sex education to reach those who have not come out yet. It is not just a matter of the curriculum. We also need to change the attitudes of teachers and principals towards SOGI. Participant from Lao PDR: It is difficult to speak up about LGBT human rights in Lao PDR because the government says we already have equal rights, although this does not reflect our reality. Stigma and discrimination affecting LGBT people still exists and affects access to health care. The government listens to us but does not respond. The LGBT community does not know where to go to access health care. There is limited access to peer education and support. Activists cannot say anything directly to government, so we need international support to advocate and inform our government to better understand LGBT issues. Gay man from China: We consider sex work to be a career. Therefore it is important that we take care of our bodies, because our bodies are our business. Some of my gay and transgender friends in China were diagnosed with late-stage AIDS when they suffered from opportunistic infections, which were too late for treatment and they passed away. Although antiretroviral treatments are free in China, we need to pay for treatment of opportunistic infections which is very expensive, e.g. for TB meningitis. We also need legal protections. Criminalization of sex work in China means that sex workers hesitate to take an HIV test. If we are diagnosed with HIV, the government (Center for Disease Control) keeps a record, and if we are sex workers, it is a criminal offence. Sex workers fear going to the doctor because of this. In Hong Kong, selling sex is not illegal but organizing sex work is illegal. Sex workers are more willing to attend health services in Hong Kong because selling sex is not illegal. The law in Hong Kong protects people living with HIV from discrimination, but in Mainland China legal protections are weak. Anti- discrimination regulations in China are not working. For example, a teacher who is HIV-positive was prevented from teaching in China. Many people living with HIV lose their jobs because of discrimination.

Many MSM and transgender people move within their country to seek work or a new life. However, they may only be entitled to access health care services in their town of origin where they are registered. As a result, many do not attend health care services. Participant from India: The Indian Psychiatry Association developed a statement a year ago that homosexuality should not be included in the list of mental disorders. The main issue is that LGBTI issues are not included in the curriculum of health care workers. So many are unaware of how to address the needs of LGBTI people. Education is needed for health care providers including through professional curricula. Participant from India: Health issues of LGBTI people have mostly only been looked at from an HIV perspective in targeted intervention programmes. Other issues are not covered such as access to medicines for fever, adolescent health services, mental health, sexual and reproductive health for young people under 18, and the health needs of transgender people to access hormone treatment and sex reassignment surgery. Many transgender people go to private practitioners, but are not covered by insurance and the costs are prohibitive. Participant from India: Multiple stigmas are experienced by kothis, who are effeminate men who have sex with other men. Many kothis are HIV-positive and many are married but do not disclose that they have sex with other men. Even if services are available, many kothis fear coming forward to access treatment because of stigma. Many kothis are not literate and have low incomes so the cost of health care is also a factor. Many hijra in India are also poor and opt for castration rather than sex reassignment surgery. Gay man from India: Although the law is unhelpful, there is beginning to be some progress within the medical profession. Many health care workers have been educated on LGBT issues through several government and NGO educational projects. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 28 Gay man from India: It is important to address the rights of young people. I do not feel comfortable going to the doctor and speaking about sexual health in India. Many medical colleges still treat homosexuality as a disease. If you challenge this, doctors are not prepared to listen. There is no space to talk about it in an informed way. Transgender woman from the Philippines: As a transgender woman, I have to take hormones for the rest of my life. Many of my transgender sisters in the Philippines can only access hormones through the Internet in an unregulated way. This is very dangerous. Many die as a result of an overdose when they are self-medicating. It is important to enable safe access to hormones. It may be possible to collect data from small retail outlets about hormone use. We need data on demand to devise a safer system, and to reach some kind of deal to make hormone access more manageable, so that hormones are accessible and safe for transgender people. Transgender man from the Philippines: We need the full range of health information, services and commodities. This includes for our sexual and reproductive health, mental health and hormone therapies. We need health care providers who understand us as people. The medical sector requires evidence-based clinical guidelines to inform them how to treat us with respect and dignity. As a transgender man, I find that health care providers do not know how to treat me, as it is usually the first time they have come across such a case. We need to ensure communities are part of this process. One of our community-led efforts is to link health services to our peers. We have monthly group consultations. We go to the hospital as a group, so we can all learn health-seeking behaviour. We attend for health care not only as patients but as people with health rights seeking to be treated with dignity. Gay man from the Philippines: Medicalization of the identity of gay men is an issue in the Philippines. When I attended for an HIV test at a sexual health clinic, health care workers asked me about my last sexual contact. They labelled me as being high risk, as if being gay equates with risk. The reason I attended for a test was because I was coerced to have unprotected sex with my ex-partner. I needed professional counselling but the medical sector was only concerned about my HIV status.

Participant from Mongolia: Access to health care is dismal for LGBT people in Mongolia. With the exception of HIV, health care needs of LGBT people are marginalized. Usually only HIV issues are funded and discussed, although HIV prevalence is actually very low. Lesbian and bisexual women do not access sexual and reproductive health services or gynaecological services because services assume they are heterosexual. The first thing they are asked is if they have a boyfriend or husband. There is no hormone therapy available for transgender people. Participant from Mongolia: HIV prevalence is growing. Mongolia has a national HIV law that addresses HIV-related discrimination, however the law is not implemented and people experience double and triple discrimination because of their sexuality and gender identity as well as their HIV status. It is very tough. There are three NGOs working on HIV issues with LGBT people but the government does not support these groups \u2013 they rely on foreign donors exclusively. Transgender women are particularly disadvantaged as they are unable to access services or HIV information and many are unemployed. Transgender woman from Tonga: Transgender people\u2019s health needs are neglected in most Pacific Island countries. There is no access to hormone therapy or treatment, unless it is bought over the counter, in which case there is no counselling or monitoring of health. LGBT peer educators from Papua New Guinea: The Poro Sapot project implemented by Save the Children works in Papua New Guinea to reduce the negative impact of HIV on LGBT people. The project provides the only clinic in the country with specialist health services for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people. In addition to addressing clinical services for HIV, voluntary HIV testing and counselling, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence and family planning, the project also sensitizes police on human rights issues affecting MSM and transgender people and conducts community education. The project started in response to research that found very high HIV rates and Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 29 discrimination against MSM and transgender people in schools, health facilities, employment and by police. Since the project was established, access to information and services have improved but resources have not been sufficient to expand to other provinces. Ongoing challenges include punitive criminal laws and the public perception that the project promotes homosexuality. In response, we are trying to sensitize government policymakers, parliamentarians and law enforcement personnel. The project is peer led. Most of the staff and educators are MSM and transgender people. Lesbian from Papua New Guinea: We were born to be who we are. Lesbians are blocked from accessing health services. The government should give us the services we need. We do not want violence and stigma. Let the community accept us for who we are so we can live freely in society. LGBTI do not access government clinics, they only use the clinic provided by Save the Children. Peer educators ensure LGBTI access the NGO services, but government services are very difficult to access. Transgender person from India: The HIV epidemic has declined nationally but among transgender people, HIV prevalence is still very high with up to 40 percent of transgender woman living with HIV. Twenty-two percent of hijra survive through begging, and 38 percent survive through sex work. Livelihood is a key issue for transgender people. Section 377 remains a source of police harassment for transgender people whose sexual behaviours are still criminalized. Eighty-five percent of family members refuse to accept transgender children. The Supreme Court judgement on transgender rights was an important advance, and the state is required to implement measures within six months. However, the new government of India is reducing funding of health services and has filed a petition challenging transgender rights, so major challenges remain. Researcher working on gender recognition: The WHO is revising the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) guidelines. Through this process, there is great effort to depathologize issues related to sexual orientation, gender expression and bodily integrity. Several LGBTI issues are still categorized by ICD as mental health disorders. According to the WHO Secretariat, recommendations have been prepared to delete sexual orientation, cross-dressing, and gender identity disorder from the list of disorders. It is proposed that gender identity disorder will be reclassified as gender discordance and moved to a new chapter called \u2018conditions\u2019 related to sexual health, not diseases or disorders.

Comments from government experts and NHRIs Myanmar National Human Rights Commission: A Human Rights and Gender Working Group was established one year ago to address legal aspects of HIV in Myanmar. The Working Group has monthly meetings. The main focus is to review existing laws and regulations and to propose amendments and new laws to address discrimination. The Working Group is drafting a national HIV law that focuses on stigma and discrimination in access to health care services, employment and education. We are also looking at the need for education, awareness and engagement of key stakeholders including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Attorney General, lawyers, people living with HIV and civil society organizations. We engage with the community through the national MSM network, national sex worker network, and national network of people living with HIV. National Commission on Violence Against Women, Indonesia: HIV testing of transgender and sex worker target groups for surveillance purposes sometimes occurs without consent. Voluntary counselling and testing should be the preferred approach. CEDAW may provide an important entry point for advocacy. Session 3: LGBTI inclusion, economic implications and the private sector Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 32 Key messages \u2022 People who are discriminated against are less productive. There are measurable economic costs to homophobia and transphobia. \u2022 Companies should recognize the right of employees to express their sexual orientation and gender identity, address workplace bullying, and provide benefits to same sex partners. A more inclusive workplace increases productivity. \u2022 LGBTI people comprise a significant market for goods and services. The private sector can provide services tailored to the specific needs of LGBTI people such as financial services. \u2022 Corporate social responsibility programmes can sponsor LGBTI organizations and activities such as \u2018pride\u2019 events and provide support for human rights cases. Panel discussion The economic impact of homophobia in emerging countries, Andrew Park, International Programme Director, The Williams Institute, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Governments are centrally concerned with economic development. Our research looked at 39 countries in the world, two-thirds of which were emerging economies including China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand. We looked at economic growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and also at whether these countries protected LGBT rights over the last 20 years including through decriminalization, recognition of relationships, protection from hate crimes, and discrimination in parenting and employment. We found a relationship between economic growth and the protection of rights. Higher-income countries are more likely to have protections for the full range of rights. However, the level of national income did not determine whether a country is able to move forward on a rights agenda. Lower-income and emerging countries adopted rights as much as higher-income countries. The main finding is that rights and growth move together. The assumption that rights are too expensive for an emerging economy is wrong. The protection of each additional right in these countries over these years correlates with an extra US$340 of GDP per person. We cannot prove causation but there is an association. People who are discriminated against at work or in school are likely to be less productive. Markets pay attention to rights and know that countries that protect rights have more productive workers. The economic cost of LGBT exclusion and homophobia in India \u2013 what does this analysis tell us? Phil Crehan, Nordic Trust Fund Coordinator, The World Bank Group People on the ground drive progress, such as the groups fighting section 377 of the Penal Code in India. Progress comes from grass-roots activism. Sometimes policymakers shut down human rights arguments so we need to show economic costs of homophobia and transphobia. We need to be able to articulate the economic arguments as another tool to engage policymakers. Institutionalized discrimination is bad for communities and economies. The World Bank in partnership with the India HIV/AIDS Alliance and Humsafar Trust has been engaged in analysis of the relationship between discrimination and socio-economic status in India. We found that discrimination begins at home. There are high rates of abuse from families and intense pressure to marry. Many people are cut off from family resources. This impacts LGBT people\u2019s social capital and life chances including access to education, health care and employment. We see a clear relationship between discrimination and socio- economic status. The burden of homophobia and transphobia falls on the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fbe9fa0-c422-4d23-a484-16c399b4dee8": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fbe9fa0-c422-4d23-a484-16c399b4dee8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-regional-dialogue-lgbti-human-rights-and-health-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/report-regional-dialogue-lgbti-human-rights-and-health-asia-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bcce75576c3ac503fd2bc69976f1c942862f7f98e45b6a934f7d6dd2af353ac"}}, "hash": "8bcce75576c3ac503fd2bc69976f1c942862f7f98e45b6a934f7d6dd2af353ac", "text": "It is harder to shield oneself from harsh impacts of discrimination when you are poor. There is a clear poverty dimension to discrimination. We have developed an economic model to measure the financial cost of social exclusion of sexual and gender minorities in the sectors of health and employment. Productivity is affected by Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 33 depression, suicide and unemployment. There is a large impact on Gross Domestic Product. Our model provides a way to measure this when more data is available. The role of banks in providing LGBTI-friendly services, Saksit Pitipongsoonthorn, Senior Vice President, Standard Chartered Bank (Thailand) Standard Chartered Bank is committed to a culture of inclusion, diversity and equal opportunity. We looked at LGBT needs and identified that there were unmet needs in relation to financial planning of couples to ensure future financial security, insurance coverage, rights to own a home together including access to mortgage products, and estate planning arrangements when a partner dies. We developed a financial product specifically marketed to LGBT people called \u2018We+\u2019, which allows for joint financial arrangements without the requirement of a marriage certificate. We approached our insurance partner Prudential Insurance to underwrite arrangements. This is the first time such a product has been offered in Thailand. We sold the concept to our company and our partners on the basis that LGBT people are an untapped market. We tested the market and we had positive feedback. The traditional approach to underwriting is very narrow and conservative so it required a willingness to adopt a new approach. How can law practices support the rights of LGBTI organizations and people, Tze-wei Ng, Hong Kong Director, The Global Network for Public Interest Law (PILnet) PILnet operates as a matchmaking service for NGOs to receive pro bono legal support from commercial lawyers. Lawyers registered with PILnet either work in large law firms or as in-house counsel in corporations. The interest of our lawyers in LGBTI issues is increasing and we have established an LGBTI taskforce within PILnet. For people located outside of Hong Kong, we can direct inquiries to our global clearinghouse that accepts requests from around the world. In June 2015, we will be conducting a workshop on LGBTI issues jointly organized with UNDP at a pro bono forum to be held in Bangkok. The areas in which pro bono lawyers are able to assist are broad, e.g. advocacy in individual cases of discrimination, research and analysis of new laws or comparative research, providing legal training to staff or preparing training materials and \u2018know your rights\u2019 pamphlets, and other legal awareness activities. An example of an intervention where we can assist is making representations to banks to request that a person\u2019s preferred gender is used in their dealings with the bank. Our lawyers have conducted research for the Hong Kong Equal Opportunity Commission on the approach of different countries to recognition of de facto marriage. NGOs have a variety of organizational legal needs including establishing a legal entity, applying for tax exemptions, trademark protections, and drafting disclaimers for websites. Employment needs of LGBTI people, Emma Hoo, Former Head of Human Resources for EMI Asia Company leaders care about profit and revenue. Winning the talent war and having a more sustainable working culture are key to corporate success. Standard Chartered is very inclusive but other companies are less so. The whole umbrella of LGBTI people is a significant component of the market and of workforce talent. There is huge profit potential from LGBTI people, given the population of the Asia-Pacific region. A more inclusive diversified workplace culture increases the productivity of LGBTI people and the rest of the workforce, which benefits from an inclusive culture than can act to boost everyone\u2019s performance. LGBTI inclusion is good for recruitment, improves the corporate image, and increases employment loyalty and satisfaction. All US Fortune 100 companies include LGBT equality rights in guidelines and policies. If the richest companies are doing it, why isn\u2019t everyone? Research conducted on 2,000 companies in China and the USA in 2013 found that 66 percent of LGBT people were not open at all to their co-workers and bosses. Male workers tend to feel more pressure than women to remain hidden. The research found that the higher a worker\u2019s education level, the less willing they were to come out, which suggests that people are afraid of losing their position.

Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 34 Dialogue Community perspectives Participant from Cambodia: I graduated in Communications from Royal University of Phnom Penh. My ambition was to be a journalist. I gained international experience working for a newspaper in Kolkata. Returning to Cambodia, I found it hard to gain work. I was told I was not selected because my background included working as a journalist on LGBT issues. This was traumatizing for me. I moved to public relations work in the private sector and eventually found work as a marketing manager. As a member of the LGBTI community, I have creativity and skills that are now highly valued by my employer. Participant from India: The educational barriers that LGBTI people face present barriers to their workforce participation. People who experience bullying in schools find completion of education difficult. Although 38 percent of transgender people in India have completed primary level education, few are able to find formal work because of stigma. We do not see companies working proactively to employ transgender people. Many transgender people are not even allowed to enter company offices because of their gender expression, so they are unable to attend interviews. Gay men also face stigma and derogatory remarks. Companies should have a human resource policy that gives employees the right to choose the gender that they prefer at work. Transgender man from Hong Kong: My Australian passport identifies my gender as \u2018x\u2019 (not a female), whereas my Hong Kong identity card states that I am female. I have tried to change the way my bank addresses me on the phone and in mail. Usually the bank asks for \u2018Miss\u2019 but when my voice is low they do not accept that I am who say I am. Standard Chartered Bank removed the female title before my name. Citibank gave me the title of \u2018Mr\u2019. I have also tried to get banks in Hong Kong to provide mortgage products for transgender people. I have applied to my life insurance company to change my gender to male. Insurers do care about gender. After a year, the insurance company agreed to change my gender but I was asked to pay extra for life insurance as a man. I am happy to pay that extra small amount to be recognized as a man. Transgender people can find it difficult to identify the right insurance plan because we have different body parts to be covered. It would be great if insurance companies recognized this. Gay man from China: I am currently a consultant on workforce diversity at Aibai Culture & Education Center in Beijing. Non-profit organizations should understand how firms are structured in aspects of sponsorship to improve prospects of partnership. There is a challenge in the limited talent pool for LGBTI community organizations in China. In some cases we have access to funds but we do not have the talent to carry out projects. Solutions include broadening the LGBT community by building professional networks to energize LGBT people to participate, as we have done in Shanghai, by expanding the pool of LGBTI talent and allies. We can also engage with LGBT people working in other countries such as India and Singapore to exchange good practice. Corporate actions to support LGBT advancement include: i. A supportive corporate employment policy. Multinational firms based in Beijing often have glob- al diversity policies in place to address issues such as LGBT partner benefits but they need to ensure local understanding and enforcement of these policies. ii. Corporations should nurture subcultures of LGBT community to exist in the workplace so as to improve the working environment and performance of employees. iii. There is a trend towards LGBT-specific commercial activities, including the world\u2019s first LGBT invest- ment management company, LGBT Capital, registered in Hong Kong. Gay man from Mongolia: Mongolia was a socialist country until 1992, when we shifted to a market economy. The concept of corporate social responsibility is very new. In 2014, the LGBT community approached 35 international companies with diversity and non-discrimination policies to request funding for Pride Week. None of these companies gave us money. Companies appear scared of associating their products or brands with the LGBT discourse, even though they could be invisible in their support. We need to find a way to engage with the corporate sector to remind them of their social responsibilities and gain support for our advocacy.

LGBT people are a high-spending segment of the tourism market. Few LGBT people have children, so many have a relatively high disposable income to use for tourism. Also, LGBT people are often highly valued as employees because we have a reputation for innovation and creativity. In relation to insurance, when I applied, the insurance company saw that there was a conflict between my appearance and my identity documents, so I was asked to undergo a blood test. I considered this to be discrimination so I refused to apply for insurance. Participant from Thailand: The implementing rules for the 2012 Social Welfare Act of Thailand included provisions for LGBTI people but these regulations were not implemented and most people have not heard about them. The law required that SOGI rights violation complaints mechanisms be integrated into employment discrimination rights, but nothing has happened. The government is yet to take action to implement these provisions. Lesbian from Indonesia: Religious values and culture in Indonesia are strongly patriarchal. As a lesbian, I was anxious and feared that no one would accept me because of my gender expression and sexual orientation. Working with an LGBT organization, I had the opportunity to be involved in community empowerment and advocacy activities. One of the cases I documented was of a woman who was forced to quit her job because she appeared masculine and was known to be lesbian. Many companies are not accepting of masculine women. Gay man from the Philippines: Human rights is not about charity or pity, it is about our entitlements by virtue of our humanity. The state has the primary duty to fulfil and protect human rights, embodied in the international covenants that our countries have signed. LGBTI rights are therefore primarily an issue of state obligations to citizens. The private sector has an important role in supporting LGBTI human rights. However, the state has the primary duty to fulfil all human rights including social, economic and cultural rights in areas such as employment and food. Should the state delegate its duty to fulfil human rights to the private sector? A market approach to LGBTI rights could mean that only those who can afford to pay for services will enjoy their rights. A market approach is not a human rights-based approach. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 38 Key messages \u2022 Change of gender on identity documents enables transgender people to enjoy equal rights in accessing health care, employment and travel, and is fundamental to a transgender person\u2019s self esteem and dignity. Amendment of gender should be possible through a simple administrative procedure. \u2022 No one should be required to undergo medical procedures as a precondition for legal recognition of their gender identity. \u2022 Transgender people should have the right to choose their sex and marry as a person of that sex, without undergoing surgery or other treatments. \u2022 Laws that prohibit gender expression such as cross-dressing are harmful. \u2022 Legal recognition of third gender in some South Asian countries is a welcome development. Panel discussion Legal gender recognition: Why does it matter? Jack Byrne, Former Senior Human Rights Specialist at the New Zealand Human Rights Commission The third principle of the Yogyakarta Principles is the right to recognition before the law. Self-defined gender identity is a basic aspect of self-determination, dignity and freedom. Sometimes there is an assumption that all intersex people do not identify as male or female. The vast majority of intersex people identify either as male or female, but some identify as third sex. Many transgender people self-define as male (although born female), and others self-define as female (although born male). Some transgender people identify as a third gender, either for cultural reasons or because they think it is the best term for them. Some choose their own terms such as \u2018gender queer\u2019. There are many countries where identity documents cannot be changed. In daily activities people have to show identity documents for many purposes, e.g. when crossing borders and in medical emergencies. Not having the right documents means we are denied full citizenship. Even in countries that allow change of gender on documents, there are many exclusions. There are very few countries where young people can change gender identity in documents, even with parental consent. People who are married or have children or want to have children often cannot change their documents. For some transgender people, the only way to be recognized legally as a male is to undergo sterilization.

The leadership of Argentina and Malta in protecting the rights of transgender and intersex people through progressive legislation should be recognized. The recognition of transgender, hijra and third gender in South Asia, Amritananda Chakravorty, Senior Legal Officer, Lawyers Collective (India) Just a few months after the shocking judgement of the Supreme Court of India upholding section 377, the same Court handed down a landmark judgement recognizing the rights of hijra and transgender people. We are left with two contradictory judgements. Non-binary gender identities and expressions have long existed in South Asian societies. Under the British rule the Criminal Tribes Act criminalized the status of hijras or \u2018eunuchs\u2019. This law was repealed in 1952, but the legacy of criminalization and marginalization continued. Although hijras have long been part of our society prior to 2014, they had never enjoyed legal recognition of their rights. Until the 2014 Supreme Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 39 Court judgement, the legal rights of people were strictly defined by the binary distinction between males and females. In 2012, the national legal aid service filed public interest litigation on behalf of third gender people. In the court proceedings, the Lawyers Collective argued the importance of the right to self-determination. The court victory was entirely unexpected. The judgement emphasizes rights to freedom and equality and confirms the constitutional right and freedom of citizens to choose their gender and how to express oneself through dress. The court found that the constitutional right to freedom of expression extends to gender expression. Non-recognition or protection in law is a violation of equality rights and people enjoy the right to non-discrimination on the ground of gender identity. Hijras, third gender and transgender people now enjoy rights to equality in public employment, health care, education and housing. The judgement is not only about third gender, it is about self-identified gender and therefore applies to hijras as well as transgender men and transgender women. Gender recognition and its progress in Hong Kong, Sam Winter, WPATH, Associate Professor, Curtin University In a case decided by Hong Kong\u2019s Final Court of Appeal in 2013, a transgender woman sought the right to marry her boyfriend. Although she had undergone sex reassignment surgery and held a female identity card, the government argued that she had no legal right to marry because she was still legally male, and the marriage law does not provide for same-sex marriage. The Court found against the government and said she could marry. The Court noted the importance of granting legal gender recognition in areas of life including and beyond marriage, and that this is important even for transgender people who have not undergone sex reassignment surgery. The Court gave the government one year to draft an appropriate law, and suggested that Hong Kong follow the legislative model of the United Kingdom, which gives legal recognition to transgender people regardless of their surgical status. The Bill that the government drafted in response (the Marriage Amendment Bill) proposed to make it possible for transgender people to marry only if they had undergone sex reassignment surgery involving full genital reconstruction and sterilization. The Bill also proposed to entrench in the law the existing administrative requirements for the issuing of identity cards only to people who have undergone surgery. Many people in the transgender community fought hard against the Bill. The argument against the Bill was that linking basic rights to the requirement to undergo surgery undermines a person\u2019s ability to give full and free consent to medical procedures, and introduces coercion into the practice of medicine. It is a threat to the integrity of the body and denies the right to self-identify. We drew attention to international developments such as Argentina\u2019s progressive law. An article was published in an academic journal in the hope that lawmakers would be educated. A high-level roundtable was held with UNDP support that issued 10 key messages, which were quoted in the Legislative Assembly debate. Ultimately, the Bill that would have made rights dependent on people undergoing medical treatment was defeated. The Court of Appeal decision remains in place, and another case is pending in which a transgender man is challenging the requirement of surgery prior to issuing an identity card.

The conditions of the red light area in Mumbai were very poor. Our people were dying like flies. People were surprised when we became activists and started our own hijra organization, as there was an assumption that we could not manage an office. Targeted HIV intervention projects of the National AIDS Programme were helpful, but the government now is not so supportive of the AIDS programme. HIV gave us a strong platform for advocacy. We were angry because doctors would not touch us because of preconceived notions. HIV gave us a sense of our rights. Then the focus shifted to a broader agenda. We have been able to use the platform of HIV to talk about our other rights. We need housing and food to ensure human dignity. Rights and dignity are our birthright. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 40 The National Legal Services Authority took the transgender case to the Supreme Court, and UNDP convened a series of national and regional workshops on hijra and transgender rights. The Chief Justice of India attended and was moved by our stories. The Ministry of Social Justice approached me. A decision was made to form the Standing Committee on Transgenders, and a report was prepared for the Supreme Court case. The Court said that the Ministry of Social Justice\u2019s recommendations should be taken into consideration in developing policies. After the judgement directed the government to protect our rights, the real work started. I participated in the steering committee of the University Grants Commission, which looked at scholarships for hijra and transgender students. Some of the biggest abuses happen to adolescents. For example, we pointed out that access to school toilets is a problem. Circulars were issued saying there should be toilets in every college. Pension rights are also being addressed. In 2014, the Indian State of Maharashtra established a Welfare Board for protection of hijra and transgender rights. Talking to the bureaucracy made the biggest difference in ensuring implementation. Dialogue Community perspectives Intersex person from Australia: In drafting protective laws, it is important to ensure accurate terms are used so that no one falls through the cracks. When the law to protect people from discrimination was proposed in Australia, the first version included intersex people under the category of gender identity, which was inappropriate. Fortunately we have an organized intersex community who could be mobilized to advocate for the draft to be revised. As a result, the final version of the law clearly defines intersex so it is not confused with gender identity. Transgender person from Brunei. The Malay Islamic monarchy is the dominant ideology of Brunei and people are forced to conform to social norms. Brunei has always practiced Sharia law but there has been a much stronger emphasis on Sharia as a result of new laws introduced from 2014 including laws against cross-dressing. Transgender people are particularly impacted because the way we dress is obvious, whereas the gay community can still outwardly conform. The police are given very wide powers and can arrest you when they feel like it. If you are going about your daily life shopping for food, police can detain you if you are not dressed in a certain way. Further, government officials have proposed that we be rounded up and kept in a place so they can cure us \u2013 it is assumed that we are unwell and in need of help. Under Sharia law, you can get fined, imprisoned or subject to corporal punishment such as whipping. Some transgender people are already changing how they dress, causing deep unhappiness. There is no organization to represent the LGBTI community in Brunei. Public institutions do not acknowledge us. There is an AIDS Council, which provides a platform to reach the LGBTI community, but it is very controlled. We are a small community, and people are scared of government supervision and police action. Transgender women from Sri Lanka: A major issue we face is our gender as registered on our birth certificate, which must be shown for education and employment purposes. Very few transgender people have been able to get an amended birth certificate. We have to go through full sex reassignment surgery to change the birth certificate, but this is not possible for most transgender people in Sri Lanka.

Transgender man from Sri Lanka: Growing up as a transgender man, I behaved like a male since my childhood and as a result my father did not accept me. At school, I was mistaken for a lesbian. My teacher informed them I was having relationships with girls. When I sought treatment and support, the social services did not know how to handle my situation and I was sent to a psychiatric clinic. Nurses refused to give me injections when I was in hospital for my hysterectomy. When I went for an interview for work, I was rejected because I am transgender. I have been attacked several times by men who had heard about my transition, including a taxi driver who attacked me in a field. People have threatened to kill me. I could not complain to the police because I was afraid of their response, as the police are not supportive. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 41 Transgender man from Indonesia: I am a female-to-male transgender from Aceh Province. We are still hidden in the closet, due to the threats from our local government to impose Sharia law and the religious organization called the Movement for Anti-Adultery of Aceh. The movement is very dangerous. Recently, the movement exposed pictures of transgender sex workers on Facebook. The situation led us to move underground. Traditional families in Aceh are very dedicated to Islam and local laws. They are ashamed if they have a transgender person in their family. The shame in families leads to violence. People are afraid to report violence to the police, or the police do not process complaints because of Sharia law. The city government of Banda Aceh plans to criminalize LGBT people. This would impact severely on transgender people because we are easily identified through our physical appearances. In response, we formed Learning Together (LeTo) for Lesbians, Bisexual women and Transgender in Aceh as a community organization. We are looking to international partners to help us create a safe haven for lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender men to express themselves. Transgender man from Indonesia: Most of my life, I have experienced improper treatment from employers and others in society. It is challenging for me that I live in a Muslim society where same-sex relations are forbidden. In 2006, I joined the LGBT community and started to be open about my status. As a community organizer for a women\u2019s human rights group in East Java, I was concerned that the women I worked with in the community would not accept me because they are very religious. Eventually, after they got to know me they accepted me, although they suspected my sexual orientation and gender identity from my appearance. They trusted me as I was working with them on sexual and reproductive health issues and violence against women. I now identify as a transman, although I do not always behave in a totally male way. People who see me think that I am male. If I go to a ladies toilet, women scream at me or stare at me, which is traumatizing. If I choose the men\u2019s toilet, I risk violence so I am not comfortable. I prefer to use the disability toilet if it is available. The biggest challenge comes from fundamentalist groups, including harassment and violence. Violent attacks have occurred at several events including a transgender celebration in Jakarta in 2014. Those who were attacked did not know where to go for counselling and did not receive help from the police. These attacks leave psychological trauma. There are limited information resources available for transgender people, as information is usually only in English language. Lawyer from Nepal: Nepal is advancing in the protection of LGBTI rights. The landmark decision of the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2007 recognized two grounds of illegal discrimination: sexual orientation and gender identity. These were found to fall within the category of \u2018other status\u2019 in the non-discrimination article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The court\u2019s decision was consistent with the rules emerging from the Yogyakarta Principles. The Court also directed the government to provide appropriate identity documents and to look into the possibility of enacting a same-sex marriage law. The government has examined relevant laws to identify the provisions that conflict with the Supreme Court decision and the government is committed to change several of them. It is proposed that the new Constitution will include sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds of non-discrimination.

The Same-sex Marriage Committee formed in 2010 has provided its recommendations. The Council of Ministers has accepted some of the recommendations and it is expected some provisions will be included in the new Civil and Criminal Codes. The reform process will take some time but progress is occurring. The main reasons for positive changes are the human rights legal framework and the role of civil society. Nepal has ratified international human rights instruments. The advocacy of the Blue Diamond Society, lawyers, doctors and other civil society allies has also been very important. Lawyer from India: The legislative response to these issues should include both the application of existing laws and the enactment of new laws. Consideration should be given to extending existing laws on gender-based violence, family and domestic violence to ensure that they protect transgender people. New laws that are required include anti-discrimination laws and gender recognition laws. In India, legal redress for MSM and transgender people who are sexually harassed or assaulted by the police requires clarification because the sexual assault law is gender-specific. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 42 Transgender woman from the Philippines: I come from an indigenous minority from a mountainous area. We were treated as lower-level people than those from the lowland cities. I experienced difficulties when my parents sent me to secondary school in the lowlands. I experienced discrimination as a transgender woman and a member of an ethnic minority group. I submitted an application to run as president of the student organization. One of my competitors challenged me, saying I had no right to file my candidacy. This made me feel that I was doomed not to be able to reach my dreams. When I returned to my hometown, I started to organize a support group for transgender women. We partnered with Local Government Units, and we organized a beauty pageant with support from local officials. I told them that the government could not ignore our existence. We are part of the community and have the right to live and work with them in the development of society. The Association of Transgender People of the Philippines has helped us in our advocacy to stop discrimination and pathologization. Transgender woman from the Philippines: My father physically abused me since I was five years old because I was not masculine. I was placed inside a chicken pen and I was taken to cockfighting to toughen me up. My hair was cut short, and I was prohibited from expressing myself. As a student, I also experienced discrimination from other students. I would wear women\u2019s clothes and high-heeled shoes to school. My province on the island of Mindanao introduced an Anti-Discrimination Ordinance to protect LGBT people. I was threatened with being kicked out of school. I challenged the government through the Commission for Higher Education and won my case on the basis that transgender rights are human rights. Transgender woman from Pakistan: I have experienced discrimination in the workplace. I was sexually harassed and threatened with losing my job and eventually I was fired. In Pakistan, it is possible now to have an identity card for transgender persons but there are no services and benefits from having the card. Stigma and sexual harassment are also problems in education. We demand equality from government, not privileges or exclusive rights. Transgender man from Viet Nam: There is no provision for changing gender on the identity card in Viet Nam. The identity card is required for many aspects of daily life, such as opening a bank account, obtaining a drivers license or arranging travel. Lack of identity rights means we cannot find a good job to survive. Instead we are only offered demeaning jobs, such as work in a circus. Using a restroom can be a nightmare. Many transgender people have committed suicide. LGBTI activists are seeking to legalize same-sex marriage and transgender people are seeking the right to be themselves and to be able to access appropriate health services including hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery. Lawyer from India: Supportive legislation is vital because it educates policymakers and the general public on issues such as rights of gender identity and expression. However, even if we have a good legal framework, personhood is not feasible if people are constantly under the threat of violence. Therefore, policymakers and activists need to address violence as the fundamental obstacle to the enjoyment of rights to exist and to be who we are.

The WPATH gender recognition statement is a valuable international resource. WPATH can provide country support to communities seeking to advance transgender health rights, as it has already provided to communities in Malaysia, Hong Kong SAR and the Republic of Korea. Comments from government experts and NHRIs National Commission of Human Rights, Indonesia: Human rights are at the core of social development. We have a decentralized democracy, with an emphasis on rule of law. The Yogyakarta Principles provide a fundamental platform to address LGBTI issues. They are promoted as common guidelines for the nation to strengthen social cohesion. We have trained police, law enforcement officials and religious leaders to recognize the Yogyakarta principles as the platform for addressing LGBTI issues. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 43 We have a central office and six provincial offices that have human rights monitoring mechanisms, complaint handling and capacity-building mechanisms. LGBTI issues are a top priority on our agenda. There is legal protection provided by the Human Rights Law of 1999 and the Anti-Discrimination Law of 2008. The Law on Conflict Management and the Law on the Human Rights Court provide frameworks for resolving disputes. Government expert from Indonesia: The impact of marginalization includes violence, limited access to health services and discrimination in education settings. Many transgender people have to do very menial work including working as sex workers or beggars. It is hoped that the government will improve access to health and social services without discrimination and provide social security services for those without income. Most people including in government are not well informed about the diversity of SOGI, the difference between male-to-female and female-to-male transgender status and the existence of bisexual and intersex people in society. It is difficult to develop a plan of action to address people\u2019s needs if there is little or no understanding of the diversity of SOGI. The influence of some aspects of religion and the developments in Aceh are concerning, but with the growth of a human rights movement there will hopefully be progress. Member of Parliament from Mongolia: In response to the Dialogue, I intend to propose a law on equality and anti-discrimination for LGBTI people. I have been discussing this with LGBT community representatives. I am also eager to educate other parliamentarians from Mongolia. We have ignored these issues for too long. Registration of a change in gender is not difficult under existing law because our law is very vague, such that anyone who has a medical procedure (even a minor procedure) can change their legal sex. However, it is not satisfactory that officials can impose their own interpretations on this requirement and exercise discretion in an unpredictable or capricious way. Therefore, this registration law should be clarified. Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines: The Commission on Human Rights is supporting a national Anti-Discrimination Bill to address LGBTI issues. The LGBTI community has been leading the push for an Anti-Discrimination Bill for over 20 years. The pressure of community activism has been successful at the local level. Several cities have introduced local Anti-Discrimination Ordinances protecting LGBTI people. It is important for civil society organizations to work with policymakers to build the arguments and push for change. The Supreme Court has decided that transgender people cannot change their sex on their birth certificate even after surgery, although intersex people can. It has been suggested that transgender people have another legal avenue, which is to seek the protection of the women\u2019s equality law, known as the Magna Carta of Women. The Commission on Human Rights would be supportive of a legal case to clarify the rights of transgender women under the Magna Carta of Women to change their registration details on their birth certificates.

Panel discussion A short video produced by UNESCO, entitled \u201cWhat If\u2026\u201d launched the panel discussion. The film explores the challenge of stigma, discrimination and violence faced by LGBTI youth in school settings in Asia and the Pacific. Drawing on published news articles and study findings throughout the region, it shows visually how LGBTI are affected and promising practices emerging in the region. It will be formally released in 2015 at a follow-up regional consultation on LGBTI exclusion in education planned through the Being LGBT in Asia initiative. SOGI-based bullying and exclusion in schools: What do we know? Thomas Guadamuz, Assistant Professor of Medical and Health Social Sciences and Deputy Head, Center for Health Policy Studies, Mahidol University In 2013, we conducted the first national bullying study in Thailand. We found that almost all teachers and school administrators think bullying does not happen. However, when we ask about specific activities, such as being excluded socially, hit, threatened, cyber-bullied or having a hate web page aimed at them, we find that all these incidents are common. Over 50 percent of all students are physically, verbally or socially bullied at some time during their school years. Over 30 percent are sexually bullied online. Compared to other students, LGBT students are two times more likely to be verbally bullied, three times more likely to be physically bullied, three times more likely to be socially bullied, and four times more likely to be sexually bullied and cyber-bullied. This suggests that a culture of violence is accepted as the norm in Thailand\u2019s schools. Among those who are bullied, there is a significant association with clinical depression and illicit drug use. In one case, a boy in junior high school said he had learned to hold his urine in and not pee because if he goes to the bathroom he gets bullied. Changing school climate and culture: GLSEN\u2019s experience creating LGBTI-friendly schools, Dr. Joe Kosciw, Chief Research and Strategy Officer, Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) was founded in the USA 25 years ago by volunteer teachers who wanted to develop responses to LGBTI bullying. When they raised concerns with school authorities and politicians, responses were minimal because cases were considered to be isolated. There was an absence of research to document the widespread nature of bullying, so GLSEN established a research initiative that has become instrumental in our advocacy. The data has helped us to demonstrate the harms caused by bullying and how positive interventions can improve students\u2019 experience of school and educational outcomes. Since 1999, GLSEN has been studying student populations systematically and repeatedly. Our eighth and most recent study conducted in 2013 showed that 80 percent of LGBT students are frequently harassed at school. Most students are hearing negative remarks about LGBT people such as the derogatory expression \u201cthat\u2019s so gay\u201d. Collecting data such as this gives us the ammunition to go to teachers and authorities and argue that bullying is a serious problem. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 47 It is very important to have anti-bullying policies to restrict bullying behaviours targeting LGBT students because it gives permission to teachers to act to prevent this type of bullying. Teachers may fear to act to prevent LGBT bullying unless an official policy exists. Without a policy, teachers may fear that taking action might affect their own employment. Having a teacher who is affirming and supportive can make a huge difference to LGBT students in improving their self-esteem and supporting them to stay at school and achieve better educational outcomes. Peer support is also crucial, including from after-school clubs and gay-straight alliances through which students can work together to affect change in the school environment. When students learn about LGBT people as part of the curriculum, such as their role in history and events, they feel more connected to their education. It creates an atmosphere in which learning about LGBT people is considered normal, which is good for all students. We aim to develop advocacy materials based on our research that are accessible and can be used as tools for students and activists and which can be provided to politicians and educational authorities. In addition to our work in the USA, GLSEN can support NGOs in other countries to do similar work.

The background to changing the curriculum to include SOGI issues was several policy developments. The Government of Nepal is seeking to meet its commitments to provide education to all by 2015 and to end all types of discrimination throughout the country. Further, in 2007 the Supreme Court directed the government to end LGBTI discrimination, recognize the legal status of third gender people and to establish a committee to examine options for same-sex marriage. A sexual and gender minority taskforce was established in 2009. Civil society organizations including an LGBT NGO, the Blue Diamond Society, made representations to government to address school education issues. Civil society, including young people, helped inform changes to the curriculum. Sexual orientation and gender identity issues have been introduced in the curriculum for grades six to eight. The curriculum covers HIV, adolescent sexual and reproductive health, gender identity and third gender status, sexual orientation, and sexual behaviours. Teacher training is also an important element and the Blue Diamond Society is supporting this work. Student engagement in making education safer for all, Xu Bin, Director/Founder, Common Language, Board Member of Beijing LGBT Center and Advisory Board Member of the Chinese Lala Alliance Violence against LGBTI people exists across cultures and takes different forms. Thirty years ago, China hosted the UN Women\u2019s Conference in Beijing in 1995. There was a lesbian tent in the NGO section, which gave Chinese people their first exposure to these issues as human rights issues. However, the assumption of the state media was that lesbians were only from foreign countries. Thirty years later, people from the Chinese government are participating in this UN event advocating for LGBTI rights, so nothing is impossible. I founded Common Language in China 10 years ago. At that time, there was no support to LGBTI students because we were not allowed to exist. There were no role models, no anti-bullying programmes and no curriculum support for LGBTI people. There has been some small-scale research that found 90 percent of students are abused physically or verbally and 30 percent of LGBTI students attempted suicide. Recent research also found more than 50 percent of textbooks still talk about how to convert students to be heterosexual. Such textbooks are based on outdated information including China\u2019s outdated classification of homosexuality and bisexuality as psychiatric disorders. Some LGBTI people are sent by their teachers to counsellors, and some teachers report them to parents. It is very common practice for these counsellors to provide conversion therapy to homosexual students. We provide training camps to empower young people to become leaders and allies in advocating for LGBTI issues to be appropriately addressed in schools. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 48 Dialogue Community perspectives Participant from Malaysia: Controversial guidelines were prepared to guide teachers on how to identify gays and lesbians in schools. The guidelines were prepared by a consultancy company and included criteria such as boys wearing a tight shirt, wearing bright colours or a V-neck shirt. As a result, 56 school boys were identified based on their feminine behaviour and sent to a corrective camp so they could become masculine. The Education Department of the Federal Territory treats gender confusion as a serious offence for which a student can be suspended from school or taken to court. The LGBTI organization Sexuality Merdeka was banned. A Malay extremist supremacy group, in collaboration with the Parents and Citizens Association, went on a national road tour to spread the message that homosexuality is immoral and deviant. In another case, a lesbian student was kicked out of school for being lesbian. She was unable to complete high school, and as a result could not find employment. Gay man from Malaysia: It is not easy being LGBTI in Malaysia because heteronormativity and the gender binary are deeply entrenched. I was constantly teased because of being effeminate and the way I expressed myself. I kept my sexual orientation to myself as an adolescent. LGBTI youth are blamed for how they express themselves. Without support and resources around them, they have to deal with it internally, leading to depression and health problems. When I went on an exchange programme to the USA, I spoke to a counsellor and had support from others at the campus, which meant I had a very positive coming out experience.

Transgender woman from Fiji: Six students assaulted me when I was 16 years old. They punched me for 20 minutes. Instead of disciplining the assailants, I was suspended for two weeks. I was admitted to hospital. I lodged a complaint with the police and sought redress from Fiji\u2019s National Human Rights Commission. They took up my case. I received a letter from the school seeking to reconcile and asking me to drop the case. However, I was determined to take the school to court. In 2003, I won my criminal case against the students who were sentenced to community service and required to undergo counselling. My civil case in the High Court was based on the school\u2019s duty of care. Eventually I withdrew the civil case because I was concerned that pursuing it would interfere with my education. A thirty-minute radio play was produced to tell my story and it was played nationwide to inspire young people in schools to speak out. Fiji has made some progress by including SOGIE rights in the 2013 Constitution but there are still some limitations. We do not have full equality because we cannot get married or adopt children, and there is no legal recognition for transgender people. Young people should not be restricted in accessing services by laws that require parental consent. LGBTI people should have access to legal advice and support including to be represented in court for cases relating to violations of their human rights. It is important that civil society holds governments to account including through the Universal Periodic Review process. Gay man from Fiji: My parents sent me to an all male boarding school where I was bullied repeatedly. Teachers took no action. Homophobic bullying includes violence, rape and public ridicule. There is a need to strengthen anti-homophobic bullying policies in all learning institutions including primary and secondary schools. In Fiji, there is a behaviour management policy for schools but it needs to be strengthened to include all forms of homophobic bullying. Enforcement and policing of the anti-bullying policy is very weak. There should be policies requiring all complaints to be taken seriously and investigated by school authorities (e.g. \u2018no drop\u2019 policies where cases are not dropped if the complainant does not participate). Disciplinary penalties for perpetrators should be harsh enough to deter recurrence of bullying behaviour. Counselling and peer support should be offered to victims. Students should be able to access the formal justice system if the school response fails. The curriculum on family life education includes reference to SOGI Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 49 but the component is weak and should instead be comprehensive. Teachers should be sensitized and given pre-service and in-service education on SOGI and homophobic bullying. Research on homophobic bullying should be conducted to provide evidence to change policies and programmes. Gay man from the Philippines. I am the founder of Pinoy Deaf Rainbow and I have experienced the double discrimination of being deaf and gay. Classmates and teachers bullied me. My parents were worried that I would not be able to get a job and that I would not be able to support them. At school I complied with policies and expectations. I did not understand why people were angry with me. I believe it is the negative influence of religion and values. At the age of 20 I became aware of the LGBT community and joined in LGBT campaigns. I volunteered for different organizations and was able to express my true identity. Attitudes of my family, friends, classmates and teachers are now much more positive. I am proud to be who I am, deaf and gay. Gay man from the Philippines. I am the treasurer of Pinoy Deaf Rainbow and a hearing impaired person. My relatives are strongly religious. My uncle and cousins are pastors. When I came out as gay, they scolded me. I resigned as a member of the church. In school, I was a very good student. One of the teachers and some students bullied me. Although I had high grades in maths and science, I was not given any honours. My teacher said this was because I was too gay. I was told there was no access for interpreters to assist me to participate in the vocational training programme as a hearing impaired person.

I am now advocating for LGBT rights to challenge discrimination. Lesbian from the Philippines: I am a teacher and am active in the LGBT rights movement. Being active can mean that you are vulnerable to discrimination because you are in the frontline. The Philippines is a strongly Christian country and religious standards are imposed in sectors like education. In the university where I first taught, initially I had the impression that being lesbian would not be an issue provided that I was a good teacher. I received high evaluations from my students. In private universities, you can be assured of your teaching load for the next semester if you get good evaluations from your students. However, my department chair took my teaching load back after the administrators learned that I was featured as a lesbian in a national TV show. It was hard to accept that an educational institution viewed lesbians so negatively. Violence and discrimination against LGBT people still persists in Philippine society. My goal is to be part of the community that will create a curriculum that is gender-sensitive and human rights-based. The education sector is one of the key factors in addressing homophobia and discrimination. Educator from Viet Nam: I belong to an LGBT community organization that is invited every month to talk about sexuality in schools and universities. There is no history of sexuality issues being taught at school. Five years ago, we would not have believed that it could be possible to be invited to conduct SOGI education in schools and universities. We work with students directly and support them to advocate with their teachers to request that information be provided on SOGI. The teachers then contact us to request we attend to provide an education session. We give a full rehearsal of our presentation in front of school authorities. Although each school reacts differently, often we are welcomed and are recommended to other schools. Transgender woman from Thailand: I have been advocating for my university to improve its treatment of transgender people. I gathered documents from the World Health Organization and the Medical Council of Thailand, the Code of Conduct from the College of Psychiatry, and medical certificates to confirm the situation for transgender students. I was told that the rules of the university require us to cut our hair, conceal our breasts and dress as males during the graduation ceremony. We complained about the discriminatory rules for wearing male attire. The university replied that people who have already completed their sex change operation can wear female dress, but otherwise we must wear male clothes. I explained that surgery is the end of the process and occurs after a period of living as a woman. Finally, we succeeded and we are now allowed to attend graduation ceremony as women. There are still many issues to be addressed, such as being made to wear male uniforms and being refused access to some classes. If educational institutions can create a supportive study environment then this will motivate transgender people to complete their higher education, so they can hold professional positions in society. Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 50 Lesbian from China: The perception of LGBTI people is pathologized. We are seen as people with a mental illness as is still reflected in textbooks, or as immoral. When I enrolled in my master\u2019s degree, my male supervisor said gays are disgusting and lesbians are also, but less disgusting. Problems about education include outdated learning materials, and very conservative and homophobic educators. I urge the government to reform learning materials and provide compulsory workshops on SOGI issues for all educators in all fields. In addition, it is important to educate all teachers and school students about intersex from elementary school. Guangzhou University is the only university that offers a course that addresses LGBTI issues under the course title of \u2018Diversified gender and civil society\u2019. It is not considered acceptable to include LGBTI rights explicitly in the title of the curriculum or as a title on a thesis. However, it is possible to include LGBTI discussions within this course. Teachers of this course are able to invite activists from Guangzhou and Hong Kong to share their experiences with students. This can act as a bridge to LGBTI students.

I left the school and moved to another city, Yogyakarta. I became involved in the local LGBT movement to improve understanding of stigma and discrimination relating to SOGIE. Schools need to have a diversity policy that includes the rights of teachers and LGBTI students. Teachers need to be able to ensure rights to access education and the quality of education to all students. Initiatives on homophobic bullying in schools are coming from LGBT communities, not the government. This is particularly a problem in Aceh. The education authorities should provide teaching materials that are not heteronormative, e.g. positive examples of same-sex parenting. Intersex representatives from Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan: There is no education on intersex issues or support to intersex students. We are advocating for education on intersex issues to be included at all levels of the education system including elementary school. It is also important to ensure that health care workers are educated about intersex issues so that they can support parents in a positive way. Many intersex babies have been abandoned by their parents, so it is important to educate health care workers to give positive messages to parents. Gay man from Indonesia: While studying at the University of North Sumatra, I prepared an article on LGBT issues in the college magazine. I encouraged other students to write their papers from a SOGI perspective. The college religious association and others attacked us. It is clear that Indonesia\u2019s education system is still patriarchal and hetero-normative. The gender binary dominates and it is taboo to talk about sexuality. There is a need to sensitize the government about SOGI issues and for the educational system to be modified to be more LGBTI-friendly. Participant from India: Any form of sex education is completely taboo in some Indian states where it is banned. I have been an educator and I could have been arrested for addressing sex and sexuality when teaching in schools. It is important to engage with other governments to exchange experiences in addressing sex education. India and other South Asian nations need to look at the initiative taken by Nepal to include SOGI in the school curriculum. Gay man from the Philippines: Nothing is more important than being positive about your sexuality. Coming out at school can create social change and acceptance. Schools and colleges in the Philippines are strongly influenced by religion, which makes coming out difficult. I decided to speak publicly about my sexuality at school, and my peers and teachers were actually very supportive. SOGI-inclusive education must be age-appropriate, gender-sensitive and human rights-based. Comments from government experts and NHRIs National Commission on Human Rights, Indonesia: The government is committed to spend at least 20 percent of the national budget on education and to address the vulnerability and exclusion of marginalized groups. Government priorities include addressing marginalization through information Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 51 technology, training to support entrepreneurial skills, and special financial support through the \u2018Indonesia smart and healthy\u2019 programme. The National Commission on Human Rights will monitor the government to ensure attention to LGBTI people as a marginalized population. Timor-Leste National Human Rights Institution: As human rights educators, we train police officers, community leaders, teachers and prison guards on issues such as human trafficking and women\u2019s rights. We have tried to include some LGBT rights issues but police are not receptive to these messages. These issues are very new for us. In 2014, the Hivos Project Office (ISEAN-Hivos Multi-Country Global Fund Programme) organized a workshop, which was the first time we had heard directly from transgender people and MSM about their experiences and problems including abuses from police and other public entities. Our culture and the dominant Christian religion require consideration. Transgender people are considered by the Church to be living in sin. We hope to work with the community to provide solutions to these problems. Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines: The Department of Education has issued a circular against bullying in schools. Nonetheless, bullying still exists.

Many intersex children are subject to unnecessary surgery. These issues arise because of prejudice and lack of knowledge. Family members require information and education to help them understand and accept their children. \u2022 The concept of family is continuously evolving and governments can recognize this by adopting inclusive laws and policies that recognize LGBTI relationships. Panel discussion How parents, families and friends can support LGBTI persons, Lily Dinh and Teddy Nguyen, PFLAG Association, Viet Nam Lily Dinh (mother) and Teddy Nguyen (son) described their relationship and the son\u2019s coming out experience. After coming to terms with her son\u2019s sexual orientation, Lily became a community educator with PFLAG. Lily Dinh: \u201cI found out my son is gay when he was in Year 11. I read his diary in which he expressed his love for a boy in year 10. I was angry and confused. I did not understand why he behaved so strangely. I thought he had emotional problems so I sent him to psychologists. They said he was normal. I took him to the temple, and the monk recommended a diet to address an imbalance of yin and yang. I prepared the recommended food but this did not change my son at all. This was a tearful process. It was depressing and sad to think my son was not normal. My son wrote to me saying: \u2018I know if I was disabled you would love and protect me. I was born gay and cannot live differently than being myself.\u2019 I listened to my son and realized he was suffering greatly. I attended seminars to learn about sexuality, and I met other parents and children and learnt to accept my son.\u201d Teddy Nguyen: \u201cYou cannot choose your family, so it is important for them to know who you are. At the time I came out to my family, Vietnamese society did not accept homosexual people, so initially it was very difficult. I was not accepted so I wrote a letter to my mother saying I would leave home after finishing university in a year. When I live as the person I am, I feel very happy. After my mother accepted me I became very proud and now believe I have the best mother in the world.\u201d Lesbian, bisexual and transgender case documentation as an effort to strengthening women\u2019s position in the Constitution of Indonesia, Budi Wahyuni, Interim Chairperson of the National Commission on Violence Against Women The National Commission on Violence Against Women implements activities to address violence against lesbians, bisexual women and transgender people (LBT) as part of our role. These populations were identified in the Commission\u2019s strategy for 2010\u20132014. Our mandate is the elimination of all forms of violence against women following the framework of CEDAW. We conduct monitoring, case documentation and seek to understand intersecting forms of violence. The Commission is committed to working with LBT community organizations in its role. The Commission has been monitoring LBT cases since 2009. In 2010, cases included the attack on the ILGA Conference, disruption of the national transgender women\u2019s meeting organized by the National Human Rights Commission and the attack on the Q Film Festival by the Islamic Defenders group. In 2012, 10 cases were reported including inhuman and degrading treatment of transgender women and lesbians forced into unwanted sexual intercourse. In 2013, there were 49 cases reported, including incidents of sexual violence and sexual abuse involving Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 55 family and police. Ninety-five cases of violence and discrimination have been identified from case documentation conducted in the provinces including cases involving 41 male-to-female transgender people, 16 female-to-male transgender people, and 38 cases involving lesbians.

There are also effects on inclusion in the workplace, as LBT people often do not have safe environments in which to work. Reaching out to young LGBT people and addressing self-stigma, Ben Xue, Pink Dot Singapore, and co-founder of Young OUT Here (YOH) Singapore is a multiracial and multireligious society, yet deeply conservative. Pink Dot is an annual event that started in 2009. The Pink Dot message is supporting the freedom to love. It is an event for LGBT community and our allies who support our cause. In 2014, 30\u201340 percent of participants identified as LGBTI; the rest were straight allies. Pink Dot provides a visible show of support for LGBTI people and their families. In 2009, there were 2,500 people attending, and in 2014 this rose to 26,000 people. The event is reported positively in the media, bringing LGBT issues into the family home. Pink Dot has become a stepping stone to talk about LGBT issues, in that people can ask whether you were at last year\u2019s event to find common ground. YOH is Singapore\u2019s first support group for LGBT youth aged 16 to 25. It provides a safe space for young LGBT people, in which they can share their coming out stories. We respect that some people may not be ready to come out, but need access to peer support. Social media \u2013 Safe spaces for LGBT youth and resources for families, Laurindo Garcia, Executive Director, B-Change Foundation It is not just about changing laws and policies; it is also about how to change attitudes. We have created videos to tell the stories of 13 LGBT people in Asia. These include stories of violence, traditional healers being brought in to correct children\u2019s sexuality, and stories of people running away. For every story of alienation, there are also stories of resilience and coping. We are trying to share what it is really like to be LGBT in Asia. We chose to do this through social media as an efficient way to get the message out to people. In addition to the videos, we aim to create safer spaces where people can discuss the content of the videos through a web app. The app provides a way for users to connect with peers. Information about coming out is provided in five Asian languages. The app enables peers to ask questions and seek support from each other. The app directs people to local services and community-based organizations. People can use online maps and access online community managers to connect them to services and support groups. Jeffrey O\u2019Malley, Global Director of Policy and Strategy, UNICEF In 2014, UNICEF issued a Position Paper on Eliminating Discrimination Against Children and Parents Based on Sexual Orientation and/or Gender Identity. The Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified international convention in the world. The legislative frameworks to protect children are also universal. The universality of the understanding of children\u2019s rights, in areas such as education and protection from bullying, is an important foundation for UNICEF\u2019s work. Our Position Paper acknowledges that violations of children\u2019s rights include those children who are victimized because they are perceived to be different, although some may grow up to be heterosexual. The Position Paper also acknowledges that intersex children are often subject to specific violations of involuntary, inappropriate, medically unnecessary surgery and other interventions that call for specific protections. Dialogue Community perspectives Gay activist from India: When I came out to my parents my family took me to a psychiatrist who said I was suffering from a hormonal imbalance or a tumour in my hypothalamus that could be sliced out. I lost my advocacy voice at this point and was left as a terrified person with a terrified family. We should not underestimate how disempowering family can be in such situations. There needs to be openness from the family to engagement, which does not always exist. While groups such as PFLAG do wonderful Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 56 work, it is also a legitimate choice to say I want to walk away from my biological family and build my own community of love elsewhere. We also should recognize that medicine and science are not always objective. Medical resources such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders can be useful tools for advocacy but we cannot let them set the terms of the debate.

Yet this decision was overturned. Our framework for engagement should not rely on the law, medicine or religion for our legitimacy. We should exercise caution in relying on such higher authorities, as these are unreliable institutions. Families should accept us for who we are and not rely on these higher authorities. Gay man from India: Family are the people who love you and may include allies, friends, neighbours, and accepting relatives. My coming out experience was positive, and my straight male friends were very supportive. It seems to me that Indian society is not that intolerant after all. In refusing to amend the sodomy law, the government refers to people of India as not ready for change, but in my view these are old prejudices. I recorded testimonials from 350 allies coming out in support of LGBT people. In this way, we can let the government of India know that many people are accepting. It is important to provide an Indian voice to support our case. Transgender woman from Viet Nam: I came out when I was 19 years old. My parents were shocked to see my women\u2019s clothes. My father beat me a lot, my mother cried. My father asked a shaman to treat me with charms. My mother took me to hospital, and doctors gave me medicines to \u2018cure\u2019 me. I was isolated, and my family controlled me closely. I had to leave home to not embarrass my family. I dropped out of school. I was looking for work but I failed because of being transgender. Feeling useless, I attempted suicide. I recovered and learned skills in make-up. I saved money for surgery. After many painful surgeries, I am able to be myself, and my family has accepted me. I still have some difficulties. I have not been allowed to change my civil status [gender identification], but otherwise for me everything is better. As a member of the LGBT community, I advocate for equality and hope that Viet Nam will be more welcoming for transgender people. Lesbian from Nepal: When my parents found out about my sexuality, they beat me. They wanted me to marry a man and gave me no opportunity to go to college. My partner and I took poison to commit suicide. We were hospitalized for five days and survived. We left my home because my parents and community did not accept me. I moved to Kathmandu. I joined the Blue Diamond Society, learned about rights and advocacy and met many other LGBTI people. Gay man from Singapore: Youth have a role in educating their parents when coming out. There are many educational resources available to show parents and family members. Rather than just demanding they accept us, we can find resources for parents and help to effect change. Transgender woman from Mongolia: In Mongolian society, most people are conservative and my parents have no information or background about transgender people. I was not accepted initially but I was determined to be recognized by my family. I tried to improve my situation through work to help me to be acknowledged by my family. I participated in a beauty contest to raise awareness about transgender people. It was a success and I became quite famous in Mongolia for this work. My family started to accept me. The main tool to get acceptance from family and society was my occupation as a beautician, as a partner in a makeup studio. I spoke about my story to my clients. My story spread and I attracted more clients. I achieved respect. My immediate family now accepts me, but still not my extended family. I could not influence all of them directly so I decided to change social attitudes, which will help my family to accept me. Previous generations of transgender people usually left Mongolia to seek asylum in Europe or elsewhere. My generation is determined to stay to fight for acceptance. Transgender woman from the Philippines: As a boy I did not aspire to be a fisherman or farmer. I was more ambitious and wanted to study in the city. I did well in my high school but in second year, I was raped. I thought that being raped was a natural part of growing up. I could not tell my story to my family because I was afraid I would have to go back to my island. Since leaving school, I have become successful.

Three years ago, I became a member of the council of the national Anti-Poverty Commission for the youth and student sector and I use this to gain more support for my LGBT peers. I tried to run for a government seat as well. I now work as a community organizer and mobilizer for the local community, including fishermen and farmers. Transgender woman from Nepal: I am married with a son. I was married against my will because of pressure from society and family. My father said if I did not marry, he would poison himself. Living with my wife, I feel like I am dying every day. I feel that I am not giving what my wife expects, so I feel sorry for her as well. I made a deal with my wife not to interfere with her personal life if she does the same for me. Even though I receive support from my wife, my family discriminates against me. My father says that he does not care if I die. Sometimes I feel like committing suicide. My son knows that I am transgender and he wants me to send a photo of myself as a woman. I worry about what society will say when my son grows up. Transgender woman from Tonga: I was the eldest child in a family of eight. The first-born child must provide leadership to her siblings, to be a princess of the family. I ran away from home for a month. I tried many ways to convince parents to accept me as transgender, as a gift from God. One day, we celebrated with my whole extended family. The connection of my parents to my aunty and uncle and grandparents is very strong, so they were included. On this occasion, they accepted me for who I am. Young gay man from Indonesia: Most people want to have family. We want to expand the concept of the family beyond traditional husband and wife. In 2012, youth activists involved in LGBT rights and sexual and reproductive rights met to discuss the meaning of family. The meeting made the recommendation that the government must adopt laws and policies that recognize a broad concept of families as continuously evolving. The form of the family includes same-sex couples, cohabiting partners, divorced and separated people, foster children, grandparents raising children, couples without children and LGBTI people. Comprehensive sexuality education should include SOGI and human rights education, informal and formal education in school and out of school. Governments should adopt UNESCO\u2019s International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education. Participant from China: We have been working on a new national law on family violence. We are advocating for this law to be LGBTI inclusive. It is important that this law protects LGBTI children from violence from their families. Ten years ago, only one parent came out publicly to support a gay son. Now there are several hundred parents willing to come out publicly to support their gay and lesbian children. In 2014, one hundred parents signed a petition to the National People\u2019s Congress of China calling for same-sex marriage.

LGBTI people suffer from social stigma and marginalization that is often reinforced through repressive legal and policy frameworks in many countries.

Report of the Regional Dialogue on LGBTI Human Rights and Health in Asia-Pacific 67 with men and transgender women, particularly in urban areas of Asia and the Pacific, is a stark reminder of the urgency of the situation. \u201cFar too often, LGBTI people are stigmatized by society and excluded from development opportunities,\u201d said Luc Stevens, UN Resident Coordinator for Thailand. He added, \u201cHowever, there are positive changes underway in many countries, cities and communities that are enabling people \u2013 and increasingly young people \u2013 to claim their rights and realize their goals and aspirations.\u201d The dialogue featured a session on legal gender recognition, which noted progressive advances in India where the courts have clearly articulated the human rights of transgender people as a result of the efforts of communities and allies. In Bangladesh, transgender and hijra communities held their first pride event in November 2014 to mark one year since the legal recognition of hijras as third gender. \u201cI believe that among our LGBTI family, some of you are \u2018intersex\u2019 like me. After living as a transwoman since I was 3 years old, it\u2019s time to declare to the world that \u2018I\u2019m intersex to transwoman\u2019. The power of self- identification belongs to us and shall not be taken away by the state,\u201d said Nada Chaiyajit from Thailand. The substantial contingent of civil society participants attending the dialogue were chosen through a voluntary submission and review process to ensure a balanced representation of lived experiences from the diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Government experts, academia and the private sector provided informed inputs to compliment the community perspectives. Honourable Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a Member of Parliament from Mongolia stated \u201cthe experiences of stigma and discrimination shared by LGBTI participants have inspired me to call for the introduction of a protective anti-discrimination bill in the Mongolian parliament.\u201d \u201cWe have a right to exist, we are equal human beings and equal citizens,\u201d said the Honourable Louise Wall, Member of Parliament, New Zealand. \u201cParliaments, political parties and politicians have a significant role in protecting the rights and inclusion of LGBTI people, and to ensure all aspects of those rights are protected in the provision of all goods and services not only by the state but by society as a whole.\u201d \u201cWe must continue to bring LGBTI issues to the fore of global development\u2013not only to help change attitudes and introduce LGBTI-affirming policies, laws, and programmes, but also to lift LGBTI persons out of extreme poverty, and give them access to democratic processes and social services that are enjoyed by their fellow citizens and are essential for personal well-being and growth,\u201d said Todd Larson, Senior LGBT Coordinator for USAID. Other issues discussed during the dialogue included the role of advocacy in advancing LGBTI rights and inclusion, addressing the health and employment needs of the LGBTI community, tackling exclusion in education settings and how to create supportive family environments and safe spaces for LGBTI youth. These sessions were also jointly organized with UNESCO, UNICEF, UNAIDS and Out Leadership. \u201cIn China up to 50 percent of lesbian and bisexual women have experienced violence in the family,\u201d said Xu Bin from Common Language, a civil society representative from China. \u201cThe family should be a place of love and acceptance. Over the past two days, we have shared the importance of engaging with families and support groups such as PFLAG to protect the rights of LGBTI people and families.\u201d The Dialogue was supported by the Multi-Country South Asia Global Fund HIV programme and the Being LGBT in Asia initiative\u2013the first regional UN initiative working directly on LGBTI rights and inclusion.

The GAR will fulfill three main objectives: \u2022\ufffd It is expected that the report will establish itself as a credible and widely accepted reference point for information on global hazard patterns and trends. \u2022\ufffd It will strengthen the ISDR system\u2019s capacity for planning and joint programming at all levels by providing a global review of achievements and gaps in hazard risk reduction from national, regional and thematic reporting. \u2022\ufffd Each issue of the GAR will increase understanding and awareness of the mutually supportive relationship between development and hazard risk reduction, through an in- depth analysis of key linkages and interfaces between hazards and a development theme of global concern. Related to the third point, a series of major developments at both the international and national level have reasserted the need to understand and reduce poor people\u2019s exposure to external and largely uncontrollable climatic or geological hazards that reinforce the poor\u2019s sense of ill-being and exacerbate their material poverty. The findings from worldwide consultations with the poor carried out by the World Bank in preparation for its report on Attacking Poverty (World Bank, 2000), UNDP\u2019s recognition of the mutual links between disasters and development (UNDP, 2004) and the UK Department for International Development\u2019s explication of the links between development and disasters in view of the long-term impacts on poverty trends (DFID, 2004), have helped to prioritize policy attention on the links between poverty and disaster risk over the past years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd3acf67-319e-4a6b-919a-f532a9f8456c": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd3acf67-319e-4a6b-919a-f532a9f8456c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec66078e223679c0f7274e24180a9a829bbe390b212c109de85784491c567b71"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1ffcaf9-9f0b-4489-8dd6-3ede69a5c642", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68335a3afe3528e2d2c6bda96d8d0ecf79c092d8d2308e0d87782afccdc486fa"}}, "hash": "d4cb1fc338962961adaf4905f73397e93c6fef4c5856c65d4a751e9ee749bb4c", "text": "Significant social and economic consequences of major recent natural hazards in different parts of the world have reiterated the need to place hazard concerns higher on the global poverty agenda.

The evidence presented will make the case for hazard risk reduction as a key instrument to reduce poverty and for poverty reduction strategies in turn, to contribute to reducing people\u2019s susceptibility1 to hazard events. 1.2 Methodological considerations The growing concern with the foreseeable effect of geological and climatic hazards on poverty has not yet translated into a coherent and systematic empirical research agenda that illustrates their connection, thus paving the way for policy-oriented action. Major reviews investigating poverty dynamics have noticed the scant evidence in this respect mainly due to the absence of hazard information in standard household surveys (Baulch and Hoddinott, 2000; Yaqub, 2000b; Dercon and Shapiro, 2007). This situation has started to change recently with the design of hazard modules in household surveys (including questions on natural hazards), some of which are still waiting to be transformed into longitudinal studies. A series of large-scale composite risk Atlas preparations in many parts of Asia has also initiated a process of national, regional and subregional risk assessments that could be linked to poverty (BMTPC, 1997, 2008; Beijing Normal University, 2004; TARU, 2005, 2008). 1 This proposal employs the concept of susceptibility rather than vulnerability for two reasons. First, vulnerability might lead to confusion as practitioners from different disciplines use different meanings and concepts of vulnerability, which, in turn, have led to diverse methods of measurement and frameworks to understand it (Alwang et al., 2001). And second, within economics there seems to be an increasing agreement that should remain a forward-looking concept associated to a negative welfare outcome (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003). This brings practical difficulties to map the effect of hazards on poverty given the data sources available in the GAR countries (see Annex I). 1 2 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal Where previous work on exploring the link between poverty reduction and hazard risk reduction exists, it has mainly focused on assessing poverty outcomes of large- scale catastrophic hazards. While these events have extreme impacts on poor populations, their infrequence makes it very difficult to establish a relationship with poverty trends over time, except at the macrolevel. In contrast, there is a large number of frequently occurring but highly localized events, such as fires, flash floods, landslides and storms that may represent a significant and unreported source of livelihood loss and disruption for marginal rural and urban populations, and thus, have a crucial interactive relationship with poverty patterns and trends. Therefore, it is also necessary to focus attention on the impacts of highly localized, low intensity hazards on poverty. At the same time, some livelihood practices, especially under dire circumstances, are conducive to increased exposure to hazard loss or damage (Holloway, 2007). For instance, immigrants of poor households seeking to escape poverty in rural areas often arrive into or form urban squatter settlements, where land values are lowest and where the pressing need to acquire housing and basic services translate into substandard urbanization, characterized by unsafe dwellings, precarious or non-existent public infrastructure, and overcrowding. Altogether these factors create the breeding ground for a hazard (say a storm) to bring a disproportionate impact on such informal settlement residents. But while qualitative narratives abound in this respect, there is a lack of survey-based evidence to support the poverty-hazard nexus (Alwang et al., 2001). Given the above reasons, this methodological proposal provides a selective overview of quantitative methods and tools that could be employed to assess the two way relationship between poverty and natural hazards (see Annex I for the working definitions). As entry point for such purpose the following question are posed: \u2022\ufffd Do natural hazards contribute or exacerbate poverty? This first overarching question can be tackled from various angles depending on the interest of research \u2013 \u2013 The time dimension ascribed to the effect on welfare (short-run or medium-run); \u2013 The scale of the hazard in question (extensive or covariate); and \u2013 The component(s) (consumption, health, nutrition) and metric of wealth (levels, trends or states over time) that are being analysed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4d7cb44-191a-4f58-acba-f35467732c05": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4d7cb44-191a-4f58-acba-f35467732c05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fe9fbf17078bf0eb820ea45aba0e51a9f121f3966b61effc5b82622a13d529e"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a054747-b7c2-45aa-9b3d-ed5a8adea430", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d20fd36a87460c3beb85d36b7157f49a021fc569275843424673798d7936c5f"}}, "hash": "579258b68fae2ac29fd88228f6d3b22d9a808a25e1c27ffdbca07632c8d06aa7", "text": "Further key questions to explore regardless of which mix of aspects drives research are the following: \u2022\ufffd What economic sector or types of occupations will be affected by hazard impacts? \u2022\ufffd What sorts of households are affected by hazard events? \u2022\ufffd What makes some households protect their consumption on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a775b487-cdd9-4f5b-bcaf-ab62c4874c13": {"__data__": {"id_": "a775b487-cdd9-4f5b-bcaf-ab62c4874c13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e4474639baa40d55927b295c87fb13f2d0da77c8c3a984e0c9813d217af25f5"}}, "hash": "2e4474639baa40d55927b295c87fb13f2d0da77c8c3a984e0c9813d217af25f5", "text": "items such as education and health better than others during difficult times? \u2022\ufffd Are the impacts of hazards on poverty levels gender specific/sensitive? This proposal is also organized around the effect that poverty might have on the exposure of households to hazard loss. Therefore, a second group of questions that the methods proposed will try to address are the following: \u2022\ufffd Can poverty in turn reproduce or exacerbate the loss or damage when hazards strike? \u2022\ufffd Does poverty impact the susceptibility to loss of life, buildings and agricultural assets? 1.3 Outline of methodological proposal The paper is organized in three sections to tackle the above research questions: \u2022\ufffd Section 2 introduces the main working hypothesis underlying this proposal. \u2022\ufffd Section 3 presents the theoretical framework suggested for exploring the two-way relationship between natural hazards and poverty. \u2022\ufffd Section 4 introduces the measures and (statistical and econometric) techniques proposed to test the aforementioned hypothesis. The list of methods proposed will not be exhaustive. Only those methods considered relevant for the sources of data at hand within the selected country case studies for the GAR report will be examined. Presentation in section 4 will follow the steps involved in any standard poverty study, namely: \u2022\ufffd Identification of poverty that requires defining and measuring a welfare indicator to signal poverty; \u2022\ufffd The experience of poverty that explores its incidence, depth and severity; and \u2022\ufffd The explanations of poverty that ideally entails generating statements about its causes and not only reporting its correlates. A few empirical examples and potential applications will be provided throughout the last section for illustrative purposes. Any explanation of results is guarded against as this is not a review of empirical findings. It should also be noted that econometric jargon and notation is kept to a 3 MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES minimum to appeal to a wider audience. Finally, being a quantitative proposal, there will be an orientation towards the final welfare outcome to be able to quantify the impact of hazards on poverty. This will come at the expense of missing explanatory power over the interactions that take place between natural hazards and responses to them that eventually lead to such a final result. Therefore, prospects of cross-disciplinary collaboration with qualitative work are still necessary and desirable. 4 Two key hypotheses are proposed to tackle the central lines of research. Hypothesis 1 Poverty is likely to correlate with (a) the exposure of households to natural hazards, and (b) their susceptibility to suffer loss from hazard events. Part (a) stems from location factors as both rural and urban households are typically being pushed due to land ownership and market factors to marginal hazard prone areas (i.e., steep land or squatter settlements). Part (b) refers to housing materials of poorer quality, infrastructure, and production activities that are typically unsafe or less resilient to hazard impacts. Hypothesis 2 Natural hazards are likely to (a) contribute to poverty by affecting human development indicators and assets directly, as well as indirectly through affecting their attributes of value and productivity; and (b) exacerbate the household\u2019s inability to avoid or recover from poverty due to their aggregate nature, in combination with the absence or inadequate application of coping mechanisms.2 Part (a) relates to the more visible impact of hazards on household members and assets themselves. Physical assets can be used for income-generating activities to entitle households to goods and services that facilitate achievement of different dimensions of well-being, such as consumption. Their depletion in turn, can lead to short-term welfare fluctuations and push people into sudden poverty. Human capital assets (i.e., nutrition and health), which can also improve people\u2019s ability to take advantage of income- generating opportunities, are important in their own right. Any effect on the bodies of household members (death, sickness, injury), therefore, can also lead to poverty. 2 To be able to test the proposed hypothesis in empirical work, it was decided to categorize the impact of hazards on poverty as being the direct result from the hazard, or a ramification of its impact on their value or productivity due to their aggregate nature and the absence or inadequate application of coping mechanisms, both at the household and district levels. More conventional typologies could have been ex ante and ex post impacts relative to the hazard occurrence; or short, medium and long-term impacts relative to the welfare indicator (de la Fuente, 2007). Part (b) alludes to the fact that natural hazards are often highly covariate rendering co-insurance mechanisms less effective, which combined with lower physical and human capital endowments characteristic of poor households, make them badly situated to handle risk-related losses.

Inadequate safety nets, unsound growth conditions alongside restricted access to credit and insurance markets, and uneven distribution patterns may lead to a less conducive environment for coping. This effect on poverty could also be appreciated where the district and subdistrict are the units of analysis. 2Hypothesis 5 The proposed framework to appraise the two way relationship between natural hazards and poverty has its building block in assets, first, because it makes sense to focus on the things that poor people have, rather than start from what they do not have (i.e., a certain amount of income). And second, because from the perspective of poor people, assets play a central role in determining the extent and ways in which they feel or become vulnerable to natural hazards and poverty (Narayan, et al., 2002; Vatsa and Krimgold, 2000). 3.1 Access to and ownership of assets Households are the starting point of analysis and have tangible and intangible assets at their disposal (see Annex II section 2.2).3 While this focus can be kept for looking at the effect of natural disasters on poverty, it can also make sense to scale it up as asset responses to hazards are often affected by the broader policy context. Moreover, the predisposition of households to hazard loss can and has been traditionally scaled up to higher levels of aggregation (UNDP, 2004). It is the number of people located in certain areas combined with the human, material and environmental circumstances of households, and the localities where they live that shapes their collective possibilities to deal with a natural hazard. Therefore, the regional or district level of analysis was referred to while considering the implications that low asset endowments and their poor management can have for the susceptibility to experience larger hazard impacts, as well as for the implications that hazards can have on poverty. But households and communities do not only rely on the asset endowments of varying size and composition they have ad infinitum. They also care about the processes conducive to their accumulation or improvement, which are asset-specific. These processes depend, among other things, on the rate of utilization of the asset itself, as well as the availability of and exchangeability with other assets, and on whether the household experiences any hazards or not. Empirically, the authors were less interested in describing the accumulation of each asset than observing its actual level at household and community levels. 3 Household is understood here as a group of people living in the same dwelling, whether linked by kinship or not, who share living expenses and prepare food in the same kitchen. 3.2 Asset transformation People manage and transform their asset stock into income and other outputs while pursuing a living (i.e., land is employed for obtaining staples or income rent from commodity sales). This could happen in a variety of ways. The main channel would be through their return as a consequence of getting involved in income-generating activities or letting other people use them (i.e., renting land) and thus earn a return from this. In addition, households can either invest or enhance the benefits derived from the possession of assets by selling, renting, loaning or exchanging them; or can try to substitute one asset for another (i.e., substitute remittances from a migrant household member for his or her direct labour); or combine one or more of these strategies (Bebbington, 1999; Rakodi, 1999). Accessing, defending, transforming and mobilizing assets can happen at normal times or during extraordinary situations, such as the aftermath of a natural hazard. An adequate regulatory environment for housing in urban contexts or land titling in rural areas; state provision of socio-economic infrastructure, as well as public services to the population; and a sound economic environment for employment opportunities, can all facilitate the deployment and accumulation of assets during normal times. They improve household preparations against natural hazards (including a major accessibility for emergency services). In times of contingency, the transformation of assets would be subject to various ex ante conditions, including institutional capacities at different government levels, available technologies, exogenous prices, infrastructure, and various other resources and market constraints, along with the type of hazard experienced (i.e., slow onset events: droughts versus rapid onset events: hurricanes or tsunamis). The reliance on informal strategies undertaken at the household and community level, such as asset-based self-insurance and group risk-sharing mechanisms is often insufficient to deal with natural hazards. Consumption smoothing is often not achieved through these", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c278ebfc-9012-4ff8-a087-f32e1c41864c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c278ebfc-9012-4ff8-a087-f32e1c41864c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c5112a847b0fa81dfc487feb3402748c2e8aa6862f5f6091f0614ee9c22f73b"}}, "hash": "6c5112a847b0fa81dfc487feb3402748c2e8aa6862f5f6091f0614ee9c22f73b", "text": "private means due to numerous constraints, including the riskiness of assets and the covariance of natural hazards. For instance, guaranteed livestock purchases would avoid the problem that comes when the terms of trade between goods for consumption and assets change as a result of a common shock. Otherwise, if a negative shock occurs and everyone Conceptual Framework 3 6 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal tries to sell assets at the same time, asset prices will collapse and the amount of consumption that can be purchased with the proceeds will fall. Moreover, households can end up resorting to non-optimal coping strategies, such as cutting back food consumption below adequate levels. Altogether this evidence calls for the extensive and accessible involvement of government and other instances to support households and their communities (de la Fuente, 2007a). Governments tend to embark in multiple ex ante and ex post strategies to deal with natural hazards. In the past, they have traditionally responded through in-kind disaster relief, but more recently there has been a tendency to emphasize cash transfers as well. Even if both measures are adopted, further effectiveness could be accomplished by adopting hazards reduction and mitigation mechanisms that address the structural factors that make households more exposed to natural hazards. Having mechanisms in place before the realization of hazards is fundamental. At the macrolevel, early warning systems and social funds that can involve community-based initiatives seem particularly relevant, so do subsidies, debt or revenue recovery write-off, as well as tax incentives for households or communities to adopt mitigation measures. Another form of defending the value of assets at the macrolevel could be through economic diversification. The increase in sectoral and spatial activities in the economy, resulting from the spread of input and output markets can provide a wider pool to spread the risk of suffering hazard losses, and additional opportunities to increase and stabilize returns. Conversely, the concentration of economic and sectoral activities would be consistent with reduced ability of households to manage and respond to hazards. At the microlevel, providing households with safer assets, especially savings, and avoiding physical asset-based risk management strategies by focusing on the provision of credit for productive purposes and insurance products, are the best solutions devised. The provision of effective insurance mechanisms against the impacts of natural hazards, including employment guarantee schemes as a form of insurance or weather-based insurance would ideally be tied to removing behaviours that could reinforce the underlying conditions of precariousness and exposure to hazards. There is also a set of intangible features that might potentially limit (improve) the household efforts to surmount the effect of natural hazards on them, just as unfavourable socio- economic opportunities might well do. The political economy and institutional features of the context where assets are deployed, along with the system of convictions, norms and beliefs embedded in the behaviour of communities\u2019 members might prove fundamental while employing and mobilizing assets for confronting hazards. Ideally, one should be able to explain how culture and governance arrangements come into play when they interact with the broader setting of hazards, assets and welfare outcomes. However, most of these features will be hard to operationalize empirically during a technical survey analysis. The analysis for this study is limited to acknowledging the potential for rich cross-fertilization between the proposed methods in this document and qualitative work in this respect. From this integrated thinking it might become more evident as to how and why these intangible features need to be incorporated into the analysis of the poverty-hazards equation. 3.3 Entitlements into welfare outcomes All the above transformations of asset holdings can have a positive impact on welfare in three different ways. First, individuals extract higher utility revealed through consumption from owning higher asset levels. The second effect is that in theory higher asset levels can increase the income-generating potential of poor households leading to a reduction in poverty during normal times. This is so because income can entitle households to obtain consumption, nutrition, health and other dimensions of well-being, which in turn have a feedback effect on the asset base of households. And the last, and very important effect for welfare, is that asset holdings can buffer income fluctuations and thus improve poor people\u2019s ability in dealing with adverse hazards. Conversely, a reduced endowment and hostile circumstances to transform it will only exacerbate the poverty conditions of the household and its exposure to further hazards. The role played by the consumption smoothing property of assets depends on the importance of the hazards, and the level of development of the different asset-specific markets (i.e.,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9d74984-577b-47c3-b4ff-6bfec8f7a85e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9d74984-577b-47c3-b4ff-6bfec8f7a85e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc95b6a0336032475123df0e5cc5e7a8126146cc9adb9c7dc72a10dd4893e4f6"}}, "hash": "bc95b6a0336032475123df0e5cc5e7a8126146cc9adb9c7dc72a10dd4893e4f6", "text": "credit and insurance) and state- funded mechanisms (safety nets). In practice, asset-based smoothing analysis will be difficult without multi-period panel datasets. 3.4 Hazard effects on poverty The transformation of assets into welfare described above is not deterministic and unidirectional. This process can experience sudden disruptions and reversals through the various impacts of natural hazards. The physical contact of natural hazards with humans and/or with property can bring death, injury, disruption of socio-economic activities and damage or destruction to property and natural resources and other physical assets. In urban areas, livelihood outcomes of hazards are principally reflected in damage to housing, which in many contexts, constitutes a source of livelihood and not just welfare. Other outcomes may be reflected in the loss of infrastructure in which the poor have invested (water, sanitation, electricity) or in welfare facilities (schools, health centres). Drastically, an outcome may be the loss of land per se: for example, when a squatter settlement is destroyed by 7 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK a major mud-slide and it is impossible to rebuild on site. In rural areas, livelihood outcomes of natural hazards may be the loss of crops and livestock due to drought and flood with a consequent reduction in income and food intake, loss of income due to interruption of transport or access, and/or destruction of housing and infrastructure in urban areas. Since some of the above assets can be transformed into income-enhancing productive activities, their depletion can lead to short-term welfare fluctuations and push people into sudden poverty. Arguably, the above effects can be explained regardless of the hazard scope and the coping capacity of each household. But these two factors can also conspire against the capacity of households to lift from or stay out of poverty after a natural hazard. This could be observed at the household and district level. When households have restricted means to protect the most vulnerable members inside them, such as the aged or children under 3, hazards can affect them through nutrition shortfalls. For the latter group, this in turn could have an impact on their human development later in life. Sometimes, even when adequate mechanisms to mitigate and cope with hazards are in place, their application might not impede falling into poverty if the covariate nature of the problem is not well understood. The value of assets could drop if all affected households try to sell them at once or if the loss came over a key irreparable asset of the household, such as the death of the head. It is hard to assert in advance that asset prices will depress if households sell off all at once to face a sudden shock, but it is not unlikely for villages to experience the presence of high covariance between income and asset prices when aggregate shocks hit (Dercon, 2001). Similarly, the presence of droughts and floods can be a deterrent to labour mobilization as they extensively affect the land, limiting the working opportunities of people around it. Likewise, being members of a rural financial institution where the majority of deposits are from community members engaged in agricultural activities may be of little help for lending purposes at the time of a natural hazard because most probably those deposits will be withdrawn to face any resulting flood or harvest failure (Skoufias, 2003). On the other hand, the inability of households to maintain, or mobilize their meagre asset bases in the presence of natural hazards (which may condition the extent to which they can avoid falling into poverty) will also be shaped by \u2018transforming structures and processes\u2019 such as \u2013 governance and institutional arrangements, broader policies and existing conditions at subdistrict and district level, private sector activities, international agencies, civil society organizations, and socio-cultural influences. Successful coping against hazards is harder to attain in a context of low productivity, staled economic growth, lack of access to productive assets (such as water, credit, etc.), absence of reserves and safety nets in place, and wide inequalities across geographic, racial, religious or ethnic lines. Lack of health facilities, remoteness and low levels of education may also compound these vulnerabilities. As a result, the covariate nature of many natural hazards and the policy-induced macro conditions affecting the speed and chances of successfully coping with them might reflect varying welfare impacts across district and subdistrict levels. 3.5 A dynamic reconfiguration: Poverty effects on the propensity to suffer hazard losses The above framework intends to be dynamic, recognizing changes over time due to both external fluctuations and the results of household\u2019s own actions.

In other words, households have to make decisions over time with regard to access and maintenance of assets, their transformation into income and its implications for the living conditions of households. For (poor) households constrained by their assets and the conditions they face to transform them into valuable instruments to achieve well-being, this constant rearrangement of strategies and conditions can also render them more likely to bear the brunt of natural disasters (i.e., more likely to suffer damages from natural hazards) (World Bank, 2000). This is true in the following senses: First, settling in places that can aggravate the exposure to hazards, such as living in hazard prone areas, where they usually can only afford to live in as a result of the narrow prospects faced. For instance, most major cities in developing countries have a significant proportion of their population living in squatter settlements or similar, and these often occupy hazard prone areas where land values are lowest. Many case studies have shown that households may accept increased hazard exposure in order to achieve an urban location that provides access to employment and services (Lavell, 1994). In rural contexts, poverty would also seem to be a key factor in explaining the increased likelihood to suffer hazard damages: Often the poor are located on marginal land, with greatest exposure to drought and flood or in areas where access and commerce is also exposed to interruption by floods and landslides (this point also applies to urban areas). 8 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal Second, poverty during normal times or in response to critical situations can lead to undesirable livelihood practices that magnify hazard levels or generate new hazards. In urban areas, this could happen through the destruction of vegetation cover on hillsides; the obstruction of water courses and drainage by housing constructions and through garbage disposal; drainage of wetlands, and so on. While this second order processes are not to be explored in the country analysis, some of them may be captured through Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques or community-level questionnaires to further inform the analysis of exposure to hazards. Likewise, for rural areas, the over-exploitation of available resources in the form of overgrazing, deforestation, and excessive extraction of groundwater that result from overcrowding and persistent conditions of poverty are often cited in the literature as means through which hazard levels are increased (Blaikie et al., 1994).4 This could happen as a short or medium-term coping strategy for communal land, despite being a highly valuable asset for its capacity to provide food and shelter, and sometimes for its income- generating potential. The population pressures on land 4 Very possibly, land ownership and tenure rights may be a more powerful explanatory variable of hazard exposure levels in the first order. through a disproportionate exploitation of forest woods, coupled with over harvesting, and slash and burn agriculture, can lead to soil erosion. This can affect soil fertility and quality, making it not uncommon to find dry spells and droughts in the midst of acute environmental degradation, thus undermining its long-term sustainability. These examples are not an exhaustive listing, there are many other mechanisms at work through which hazard levels can be exacerbated ranging from over fishing and exposure of coastal fishing populations, to the challenges faced by forest and mountain communities. It is equally important to highlight that governance and regulation failures with regard to managing a habitat and natural resources in a sustainable manner, can actively shape and compromise the household\u2019s ability to mobilize their assets. For instance, across South Asia input intensive farming practices at the local level, largely influenced by the Green revolution regimes, which utilize ground water heavily, have contributed to the alarming rate of ground water depletion across the subcontinent. In addition, the continuous and extensive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides pollutes rivers, lakes, canals and other sources of fresh water. At the macrolevel, national governments are pressurized to create new settlements, job opportunities and infrastructure, expand the area under agricultural production and invest in rapid industrialization.

Further, there are global pressures to replace traditional food crops with cash crops, and to expand the area under cultivation systems designed for high productivity. These policies are rapidly contributing to degradation of natural resources and intensified conditions for disasters. (ITDG South Asia, 2005) Finally, communities can aggravate these natural, location and practice-specific factors through disinvestment in physical and social infrastructure at the household (housing materials) and community level (roads and bridges). Both as a result of poor geographic (location), physical and financial capitals. In the case of rural areas, these shortages can be compounded by a high incidence of hazards as a result of being encrusted hazard-prone areas, deepening the susceptibility of households to suffer hazard losses. 10 Statistical and Econometric Methods This section puts forward different statistical and econometric methods to assess the proposed working hypothesis. The order of exposition is based on the type of data available that divide mainly into single cross-sections and panel data at different levels of analysis. At this stage, each country team should have already decided the survey and hazard data requirements for carrying analysis with the provided guidelines in Annex II. There will be illustrations of empirical work already done or potentially doable in each case. Three further clarifications should be restated: 1. The proposal is not a template, but rather a general overview of what can be done to better understand the hazard-poverty equation. 2. The proposal does not exhaust the methods to carry out poverty analysis; it only considers those attainable given the frontier of data possibilities (see Annex III). 3. There are some formulations in econometric notation and jargon even though these are kept to a minimum to widen the scope of diffusion of the document. Three main strands of poverty research will be considered: 1) static poverty analysis that comes from a single cross- section of households or individuals; 2) aggregate poverty trends analysis based on panel at district and subdistrict level; and 3) poverty micro-dynamics that captures the economic mobility of households or individuals, by measuring their well-being at different points in time, most likely two periods (see Table 1). In each block of research, the focus would be on the standard components covered in a poverty study, namely: \u2022\ufffd Identification of poverty, which consists of categorizing and quantifying distinct groups that emerge from a poverty study (i.e., poor versus non-poor in cross-sectional analysis, or chronic versus transient poor in poverty dynamics), and requires identifying poverty indicators and measuring them; \u2022\ufffd Experience of poverty, which explores the incidence, depth and severity of static poverty measures, and their temporal analogues for dynamic poverty measures; \u2022\ufffd Explanations of poverty, which entails generating statements about poverty once the headline figures have been obtained. This is often done through poverty profiles (i.e., descriptive statistics of the characteristics of the poor versus the non-poor) followed by multivariate analysis of the welfare indicator or poverty outcome on multiple correlates (in particular, a statistical regression of the poverty measures on a set of characteristics).5 4.1 Static poverty analysis \u2013 Hypothesis #1 Identification of poverty The identification of poverty involves three steps. First, the choice and measurement of a welfare indicator (see Annex II section 2.3). Second, the choice of a means of discriminating between poor and non-poor, typically via a poverty line.

The generic form is: 4 5 Correlates are characteristics that are found to be closely linked to poverty \u2013 for example, family size might be linked to poverty \u2013 but no causality pattern can be inferred from their analysis. For example, it is impossible to say whether a family is poor because it is large or whether a family is large because it is poor. On the contrary, determinants of poverty provide information on the causes of poverty and can be analysed by looking at households over time and analysing their welfare changes in light of their characteristics (Coudouel et al., 2002). 4.1 Static poverty analysis \u2013 Hypothesis #1 Identification of poverty The identification of poverty involves three steps. First, the choice and measur of a welfare indicator (see Annex section 2.3). Second, the choice of a means o discriminating between poor and non-poor, typically via a poverty line. This c stems from the selection of the socially acceptable norm for what constitutes a reasonable level of welfare. Some tend to favour a minimal absolute level of w that translates into minimal requirements expressed in a fixed poverty line.

If \u03b1 = 1 then P is equal to the mean distance that separates the poor po from the poverty line, or in other words the depth of poverty.

If \u03b1 = 0 then P is equal to the share of the population that is poor.

And if \u03b1 = 2 then P is a measure sensitive to the inequality among the poor, meaning that weights are higher as the depth of poverty increases. Varying explicit and implicit assumptions and decisions are taken along the way to get a poverty measure (the main ones being: equivalence scales, treatment of missing and zero incomes, and poverty lines), leading to varying outcomes. It is therefore good practice to report all choices made in the quantitative treatment of data in terms of the welfare indicators and measures selected, poverty lines and aggregation. Explanation of poverty Once poverty is defined over individual households it can be aggregated over N households and make poverty figures available at a subdistrict, district, regional or national level. The next step is tabulating this cross-sectional poverty against a set of characteristics to create a profile. Since this does not allow more than one correlate to vary simultaneously, poverty status regressions are also employed.

This can be addressed with panel data as changes in welfare cannot explain initial household conditions. 4.1.1 Spatial correlations A starting point of analysis could be to explore spatial correlations between poverty incidence and natural hazards using cross-section data, without implying any causality. While the scope of representativeness of the household surveys from which poverty figures are often retrieved varies across countries, typically these are not representative at district or subdistrict level. Only recently, with the development of new techniques these figures have been brought down to such levels. In those countries where census and household survey data are available for the same year, poverty maps have been developed to illustrate relevant indicators at these levels, including incidence of poverty (P), poverty gaps (P1), severity of poverty (P2), inequality, and human development indices (HDIs). (see Annex III for a list of GAR countries with poverty maps). Censuses on their own do not contain income or consumption information with the level of detail required to yield reliable indicators of poverty or inequality within subdistricts; however, they can provide reliable estimates for other welfare indicators, such as health and literacy. This is the case of existing maps for unmet basic needs across countries derived from census data (http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/povmap/).

Second, the hazard index data required for this calculation has only been calculated for a few major risks (drought, earthquake, flood, landslide and volcano). National disaster loss datasets contain a wealth of information about many other hazards, including flash floods, heat and cold waves, hurricanes, storms and tornadoes, among others. However, the methodological and theoretical approach for estimating these hazards can be a major undertaking. Instead, the authors propose a simplified methodology that, taking into account the data limitations, will do the following: \u2022\ufffd Concentrate on using the \u2018housing destroyed + housing damaged\u2019 fields as key variable for analysis. The interest is not so much to proxy for economic loss, but to focus on a key \u2018asset\u2019 in the livelihoods of both the rural and urban poor. \u2022\ufffd Given the lack of hazard index indicators for a large number of hazards in the disaster databases, running the correlations with and without normalizing hazards is suggested. \u2022\ufffd To establish the possible correlation between hazards and poverty, the process will be followed over the entire set of hazards and over extensive risk events only. A very significant number of physical hazard-related losses are far more dispersed and extensive over territory, and are far more pervasive over time, with large numbers of frequently occurring events, following a uniform distribution. This justifies the lack of normalization of the hazard index. The equation (5) above would then become: This would be equivalent to taking the sum of losses (for each type of hazard considered) and divide it by a \u2018normalizing\u2019 exposure factor, dependent on the type of hazard considered (assuming a uniform distribution of extensive risk hazards over the target geographic units). could be considered as proxy for S. Analysis will then be carried out in two stages, first, normalizing with population only; and second, normalizing by population and hazard index: 1. Using the bulk of data (from all types of hazards) corresponding to both Intensive and Extensive Risk, the authors suggest normalizing the loss data (houses damaged +destroyed) using population figures from census or from gridded country population figures using GIS (i.e., converting raster values to vector shape files for each political-administrative area). This method will display a variable of houses damaged and destroyed per year per 100,000 inhabitants used to run a first correlation with poverty data as will be explained below. The researcher might also want to re-run the correlation with \u2018the rest\u2019 of the hazards, which include all the extensive risk events relating to relatively \u2018endogenous\u2019 hazards such as local fires, flash floods and landslides, etc. 2. The second stage of analysis will comprise the following steps: a. Normalize the loss data by population as in point 1 above. b. Make use of available hazard index data (from UNEP \u2013 Preview or from the new Global Risk Update on cyclone, earthquake and flood hazard) to find a correlation between a fully normalized susceptibility index and poverty. The composite indicators of hazard H and exposure E indices could be constructed from geo-referenced data at the lowest point of resolution available for the relevant hazards (i.e., 10x10 or 5x5 km). Then, taking advantage of GIS techniques the researcher can extrapolate the aggregated loss information from the disaster databases over the resolution squares and solve the equation for susceptibility required to run the correlation with poverty. Alternatively, one could extrapolate the information on exposure to hazards by political-administrative units. c. Run the correlation with the poverty dataset on hazard losses for each individual normalized hazard. d. Run the correlation with \u2018the rest\u2019 of those losses that cannot be ascribed to the three normalized hazards (cyclone, earthquake and flood). This second stage of analysis would enable the researcher to differentiate various levels of correlation by hazard type (for example, it may be that flood losses are far more closely correlated with poverty than earthquake losses).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c7129f9-f7a4-46dc-a03d-e6c000703ccf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c7129f9-f7a4-46dc-a03d-e6c000703ccf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b56f0dd76189708fa74c187355f87cb45701af6e605ee6793659f8f2dbb4b9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "cab40051-51d0-4254-8585-9233fdd4c79c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9dd2f48871b985d9861e3d220166a1dc104c76be767081f43de74671567b46c5"}}, "hash": "130dadcabeff6d6b38e78840ae80fd822da97c1637a4f7ab6beac4c56785b157", "text": "Overall, the spatial analysis of the endogenous component of natural hazards with poverty maps or census data would therefore be done by indicating correlations as shown below between categories of hazard loss (or hazard type) and identified areas of poverty, say by k districts: (5a) k l j j k l k l j k j j k l j j D S S H E \u2032 = \u22c5 \u22c5 = \u2211 \u2211 \u2211 (5a) ld be equivalent to taking the sum of losses (for each type of hazard d) and divide it by a \u2018normalizing\u2019 exposure factor, dependent on the type of nsidered (assuming a uniform", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4078ef95-208a-4734-bc18-60d0f0e0b9f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "4078ef95-208a-4734-bc18-60d0f0e0b9f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2b480d2367c3828462733c4c934da55ebdf15240286956433ab1ef79702130f"}, "3": {"node_id": "92d2cbf6-a057-4e76-8e33-c73252353be6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce90b6e1a71847c6d10d2e45771932e8645032de806bc42712a41699957475f4"}}, "hash": "4872a779de88c36967297e9e7e16bd998e480e4b92c0951775183270004e6fab", "text": "distribution of extensive risk hazards over the ographic units).

Knowing the Primary Sampling Unit to which households belong will help to make a decision whether standard deviations are acceptable for the unit at which analysis is planned. This would be less of a problem where poverty remapping has been carried out periodically. In such cases, it might be possible to examine how spatial patterns of poverty at subdistrict level co-evolve with other variables over time. While population censuses are usually available every decade, there are cases like Ecuador for which two household surveys and two population censuses have already allowed to create a panel of poverty maps from 1990 and 2001 (Araujo, 2006). There might be instances where supplementary population counts conducted in-between censuses provide the inputs for updating poverty. For instance, in Mexico poverty maps for 2000 have been updated using narrower information produced by a population count in 2005 (Lopez-Calva et al., 2006). Identification and experience of poverty Poverty figures at the selected district or subdistrict panel would result from the aggregation of household-level data using appropriate sample weights. The dependent variables constructed could be mean household expenditures per capita, and headcount and depth indices of poverty. For control variables one can construct a number of district (subdistrict) level explanatory variables including the share of individuals, households or localities with a particular characteristic within the district (subdistrict).

As for hazards, this can be captured as one-off events, or alternatively the cumulative exposure of the district or subdistrict. Experience of poverty The evolution of poverty over time at subnational level and its possible association with natural hazards could be assessed in the following fashion: First, compute changes in poverty at the subnational level and test whether these are significant (through two-tail and one-tail tests). The main way of checking whether changes in terms of incidence are statistically significant is testing difference in means relative to their standard errors: Samples carry a margin of error, and so do the poverty measures calculated from household surveys. The standard errors depend on the sample design \u2013stratification and clustering, essentially\u2013 and the sample size in relationship to the size of the total population (Deaton, 1997). When the standard errors of poverty measures are large, it may well be that small changes in poverty, although observed, are not statistically significant (Coudouel et al., 2002). Second, get profiles of poverty rates at period t-1 and t, as well as for poverty changes (in those districts or subdistricts where changes were significant) with census-level data. In addition to hazard prevalence, use groups of covariates that are likely to bear an effect on poverty, such as education, labour markets, housing services and facilities, socio- demographic characteristics, and infrastructure (see Table 4). This will highlight major characteristics of poverty (regional distribution, gender, age groups, ethnicity, rural-urban location, etc.), and will help to detect whether new groups of poverty might have arisen, possibly due to the occurrence of natural hazards. The next step would be to correlate changes in district (subdistrict) poverty rates with a series of initial characteristics (Xt-1), including hazards, at the same level of analysis. This would be a more direct approximation (than profiling) to the degree of association between changes in hazard and poverty losses. One may also examine how poverty changes correlate with urban growth rates, demographic trends, trends on environmental degradation, housing conditions, and economic indicators. Correlation analysis might be suggestive of the importance that some variables play in determining poverty levels and dynamics. Now, hazards may not necessarily raise poverty incidence \u2013 their impact will depend on multiple factors, for instance in the case of a drought: in the availability of proper irrigation systems, types of crops cultivated, diversity in occupations of the people subject to rainfall anomalies, and migration rates into and away from affected areas. Controlling for other confounding factors, especially migration, will be necessary. This can happen through multivariate regression analysis between poverty measures for each district (subdistrict) and the large array of observable characteristics mentioned before. At this stage, the authors propose to inspect the impact of specific past hazard events (t-1) on poverty at time t, considering that initial hazard losses might condition how the poor benefit from the shares of growth if this occurred at subsequent stages. One would have to first detect the presence of a large-scale disaster through the country hazard profiles. Then link changes in poverty or poverty levels between t and t-1 to hazards and a series of covariates at t-1. Changes in consumption poverty for k districts (subdistricts) between period t-1 and t can be expressed as follows: Here X represents the bundle of time variant household and district characteristics in district k. \u0444k is a vector of parameters describing district dummy variables to control for time-invariant characteristics, such as distances to roads, markets, clinics, water supplies, etc., HAZARDk represents the hazard factors to which the district is exposed and might contribute to differential welfare outcomes observed, and ek are the residuals. Function (7) could transform into regression analysis that includes hazard events in the initial period; base-year conditions Xt-1 on aspects described beforehand, including inequality, human capital, physical capital, region, socio- economic status and economic composition; time-invariant district characteristics encompassed under a vector of dummies D; and changes in the rate of growth and other covariates over the period of analysis. It is particularly relevant to account for migratory dynamics across time and space, considering the population dynamics that a large-scale natural hazard might involve. Population censuses usually contain information on the place of birth of persons, their current residency and place of residency some years prior to the collection of census data allowing the construction of total and recent net migration flows at district level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49b11853-6b43-447b-be7f-a06de4067389": {"__data__": {"id_": "49b11853-6b43-447b-be7f-a06de4067389", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48177d3b50b4223eba0524086ac49a8aceb52d2b3d0c025255387623e223242c"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a51d4a5-8fc7-476b-a50b-cfb445b1dce6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7663474840c34a25bb045629f67355c9b77def05d1c3e07108379e8f5892483b"}}, "hash": "e1544b51be935a9ea9031f7c101361c720376fde95d4bd7c67852942b3403fe8", "text": "It is also critical that the welfare measures and poverty thresholds are consistent over time.

HAZARD could also be a moving average for hazard losses corresponding to a fixed span of time prior to each period t for which state poverty rates are available. This regression could be estimated for the full sample and then, for instance, by rural and urban areas separately or any other relevant characteristic under study. If there are enough rounds of time-series observations before and after the hazard analysed, one can attempt a counterfactual assessment of welfare impacts using two methods. First, projecting forward the time series of poverty rates available across each state before the hazard happened and use that prediction as counterfactual to be compared with the actually observed poverty indicator. And second, a regression across districts again to explain growth over the period after the hazard as a function of the estimated impact of the hazard on the base year in each state and controls for pre-hazard trajectories and other covariates (Ravallion and Loshkin, 2005). Alternatively, function (9) could take the following specification: Where a change in poverty over time could be explained by changing district characteristics X (which encompass all district-level differences), by changes in their returns to poverty over time (or impact of these characteristics on poverty), and by the remaining district disturbances. Variations over time will be reflected in changes in beta coefficients or parameters. A final possibility is to use parameters from the regression model obtained for year t-1 in order to predict household income or consumption in year t, and to compare this prediction with the prediction obtained using the regression estimates for year t applied to the data for same year t. The differences in the predictions with the two models can then be analysed, and one can test whether changes in welfare between years is due to changes in structural conditions or changes in the behaviour of households between the two years (Wodon, 2000). Under the analysis of poverty trends with district or subdistrict panels, the mechanisms that operate at the household level to determine welfare levels are obscured by the aggregations used thus far. Hence, if the aim is to inform about poverty at the microlevel there is still room for introducing improvements. 4.3 Poverty micro-dynamics \u2013 Hypothesis #2 4.3.1 Poverty transitions Identification of poverty The poverty dynamics literature emulates static poverty analysis up to establishing whether an individual or household is poor or not. After this stage poverty dynamics diverts by qualifying the temporal attributes of poverty. When panels contain two waves (a baseline survey and one resurvey) the analysis is geared towards showing mobility between both waves, usually done through transition matrices.

The categories in the matrix that define such status may be poor/non-poor, absolute income bands or quintiles, among others. The diagonal cells in the matrix represent those occupying the same welfare state i in both periods, and the remaining off-diagonal cells represent those who are mobile between periods from state i to state j. The matrix T below shows the absolute number of households for a sample in rural Pakistan entering and exiting poverty between 1986\u20131988 (Baulch and McCulloch, 1998): With probabilities of entering poverty state j (first below) and exiting poverty state i defined as follows: Here N is the total number of households, and i and j are states of poverty and non-poverty, respectively. For instance, the probability that a non-poor household in 1986 becomes poor the year after is 0.15 (80/548). Transition matrices and probabilities can be computed for as many sequential dyads as there exist within the panel. The extent of mobility across categories can be further assessed by a series of correlation measures (Glewwe, 2005), with the most popular mobility index M for a two-way matrix given by: Where tr(T) is the trace of the matrix T (sum of elements in its diagonal), n is the number of categories (poor and non- poor in T), and normalization to make the index take values between 0 (no mobility) and 1 (full mobility) is accomplished by dividing it by n/n-1 (Shorrocks, 1978).

The profiles can bring in those indicators of most interest, including geographical regions, rural/urban residence, household and community characteristics, and the occurrence of natural hazards. For instance, drawing on two rounds of panel data (1989 and 1994\u20131995) for 354 households in rural Ethiopia, Dercon (2006) breaks down four resulting poverty groups by a number of characteristics to find that those remaining poor and those becoming poor suffered the highest incidence of meagre rains in this period, while the best rains in the long- run were for those turning non-poor. Multivariate regression analysis is commended as the next step to improve the above type of analysis. A poverty status regression can be built to determine whether the occurrence of a hazard is significantly associated with the probability of being poor or non-poor. This is typically accomplished using binomial probabilistic models (probit or logit models \u2013 also called binary response models) in which the dichotomous variable (Y) representing the state of poverty or non-poverty is regressed over a set of supposedly exogenous explanatory variables, including hazards, to model its probability of happening (i.e., probability of Y equalling one). The choice of the logistic versus probabilistic models formally depends on the structure of the error term, with the latter assuming a normal distribution. Precisely because of this link to the normal distribution, the probit model is slightly preferred and can be expressed as follows: Where Yh = 1 if the household has become poor and Yh=0 if not.

One way of setting the asset poverty line is at the median of assets for households under the poverty line (although this requires relying on monetary poverty for identification). For instance, in rural areas, this could happen through Tropical Livestock Units (TLUs), which are standard ratios that approximate the value of a full range of animals relative to one unit of livestock obtained from their respective weight, subsistence and market values (i.e., 1 TLU = 1 cattle = 0.5 horse/donkey or mule = 0.1 goat/ sheep, etc). This can also be done with housing or farming tools (Carter et al., 2007; Porter and Dercon, 2007). One can then work out asset transitions matrices among different categories of households, as well as asset poverty transitions. Experience of poverty The researcher can characterize the experience of asset poverty through the same attributes of money-metric poverty (incidence, depth and severity) using, for instance, livestock monetary values. Alternatively, in line with the literature on money-metric poverty, the researcher can treat asset poverty as a dichotomous (yes/no) variable, ignoring its depth or severity. Explanation of poverty Having created binary indicators for a whole set of asset poverty indicators (nutrition, health, education, livestock) one can investigate the susceptibility of falling into this situation as a result of hazards. For instance, in the case of nutrition poverty one would control for a full set of other correlates (child and mother characteristics, housing and spatial location).6 6 More sophisticated analysis has been done under dynamic asset poverty traps, which set a threshold of assets below which households stay on low-level welfare equilibrium or go into a downward trajectory. This asset threshold is not simple to operationalize and may be liable to criticism for its narrowness. It is uni-dimensional being expressed mostly in terms of asset values, when in fact thresholds could be multi-dimensional, affecting empirical analysis (Dercon, 2007a). There is also no systematic development of empirical strategies to identify poverty dynamics and critical asset thresholds, which might explain the scant evidence on this type of work to date (Barrett et al., 2007). 20 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal Here Xi is the vector of household and community-specific characteristics relating to household i, and \u03b2 corresponds to the parameters that describe being in jth poverty transition status. This exponential beta coefficients represent the change in odds of being in the poverty status category (i.e., being chronic poor) versus the comparison category associated with a one unit change in the dependent variable. The multinomial logit model works under the assumption that the various transition states are independent of each others\u2019 outcomes. For instance, the probability of entering poverty should have no relative impact on the probability of being chronic poor relative to never been poor. Intuitively, one might expect that some factors driving households into poverty are unrelated to those keeping them in that state permanently. But for this type of analysis it is essential to ensure that this is the case more formally through a statistical test. Its logic is quite simple, but details are omitted for space reasons (see Hausman and McFadden, 1984). The loss of information that results from collapsing consumption, incomes or any other welfare indicator into binary categories remains a valid concern, but it is believed that modelling poverty transitions makes sense for assessing the impact of natural hazards on poverty, as the hazards are expected to raise the probabilities for entering into or prolonging hardship. Another factor that qualifies the validity of the poverty transitions approach is the presence of measurement error, but in fact binding consumption can limit the biased caused by measurement error. Moreover, panel data allows using methods that assess and minimize \u2013 or correct \u2013 measurement error (see Glewwe and Gibson, 2006). It has been also suggested that defining transition categories might produce arbitrary results to the extent that estimates are sensitive to the poverty lines and the choice of the welfare indicator. But again, if the poverty line is set at a meaningful absolute level it would be valuable to continue doing poverty transition analysis (Lawson et al., 2003). In addition, the researcher can inspect changes and trends in transitions matrices brought about by the use of alternative poverty lines to determine whether poverty transitions are sensitive to the choice of benchmarks. A second way to estimate the effects of natural hazards on households across time when two rounds of panel data are available is to look at changes in outcome levels (e.g., changes", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fd789ad-889e-4e69-a727-89abff0361fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fd789ad-889e-4e69-a727-89abff0361fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2c13d8a4b8b2372b43bf34591aa5640e481cde48ef13c1964981e9e7a400a91"}, "3": {"node_id": "eee98e55-2d0b-474e-99a7-294179cec1ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a94b1a9a09d50a6a4dfa64be6a4c1d388d533394f83e828997c3d83b272fd839"}}, "hash": "d253570758e0aa915d31899314a5bd2b79ec3509d24cfe53bc9d032be7ca32ed", "text": "in consumption), rather than converting them into dichotomous categories. This in practice would avoid throwing away useful information contained in the inter- temporal variation of the outcome (Baulch and McCulloch, 1998). A first candidate would be the standard household consumption smoothing analysis in mean levels of consumption. Here one can regress some measure of changes in welfare (i.e., consumption expenditures) on sources of hazards to determine if their realization (or variation) can account for a significant proportion of variation in expenditure. However, unlike this type of exercise that often ignores the initial and ending position in the welfare distribution, the idea would be to restrict attention to the downside impacts on those groups affected by poverty. A very generic form to illustrate how this could be done is the following: Where \u0394ch t is the change in consumption levels (or the growth rate in total consumption per capita of household h in period t if consumption is expressed in logarithmic form). HAZARD denotes the occurrence of hazards between periods t-1 and t, which can be treated in different ways (household hazard data or rainfall records or both) as explained in section 4.1.2. Dv stands for a set of dummy variables identifying each community separately (regional dummies for locality level fixed effects), and X being the vector of household characteristics. P is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 for poor households with some observed characteristic (i.e., land hectares below the median of their respective locality) and 0 for households lying above. Lastly, \u03b5h is a household- specific time-invariant error term capturing unobservable components of household preferences (fixed tastes or technology effects). If interest lies in testing whether a group of households can keep consumption smooth after being affected by a hazard it would suffice to measure (14) without estimating \u03b22. With a sample composed by impoverished villages (i.e., low-income beneficiaries targeted for a social programme), the coefficient summarizing the partial covariance between hazard and consumption (\u03b21) would already indicate the resilience of poor households (Skoufias, 2003). However, this specification would be insufficient to test whether consumption of poorer households may be affected by hazards as opposed to better endowed households. Fully considering equation (14) would allow capturing more explicitly the group-specific effects of hazards. In principle, one would choose some observable and preferably time invariant characteristic, say landholdings in rural areas or education of the head in an urban setting. Then classify households into poor or non-poor (i.e., land-poor versus land- rich households) on the basis of such attribute relative to the (14) 21 STATISTICAL AND ECONOMETRIC METHODS median in their respective community. This dichotomous variable could then be interacted with hazards to capture household- or group-specific abilities to deal with them once regressing consumption over the full set of community and household controls.7 The above analysis could be accomplished on samples where the majority of or all households are below a minimum welfare benchmark (as is the case for programme evaluation samples targeted at poor constituencies) or within a broader population. Alternatively, one can make a distinction between rich and poor households in the sample along some asset category, or more generally stratify the sample on the basis of some characteristic before the hazard event and then estimate equation (15) separately for each group, making sure this is not liable to problems of endogeneity (two-way causality) (Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2001; Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003; Quisumbing, 2007). Gender-based analysis could also be accomplished in this fashion. While this should ideally be undertaken individually, data rarely exists as poverty measures are typically at household level and per capita analysis rarely captures gender differentials. Nevertheless, female-headed household are often a poor proxy for this and thus, this is one measure that can be used when censuses or large enough sample data sets are available. An alternative procedure to assess the effects of hazards on poverty levels is to estimate regressions on per capita household consumption (or its natural logarithm) evaluated at different parts of its distribution. This could be done through quantile regression, with quantiles corresponding to each poverty transition category (Quisumbing, 2007). A quantile regression model is preferred over a discrete choice model method when one wishes to disentangle the relative influence of hazards at different parts of the welfare distribution, and even has some advantages over conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) techniques.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eee98e55-2d0b-474e-99a7-294179cec1ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "eee98e55-2d0b-474e-99a7-294179cec1ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2c13d8a4b8b2372b43bf34591aa5640e481cde48ef13c1964981e9e7a400a91"}, "2": {"node_id": "7fd789ad-889e-4e69-a727-89abff0361fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d253570758e0aa915d31899314a5bd2b79ec3509d24cfe53bc9d032be7ca32ed"}}, "hash": "a94b1a9a09d50a6a4dfa64be6a4c1d388d533394f83e828997c3d83b272fd839", "text": "While OLS methods estimate changes at the mean of the distribution, and are not robust to outliers or heteroscedasticity (i.e., when the random variables have different variances leading to wrong inference), quantile regression follows a least-absolute deviations technique based on the weighted sum of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f660850f-7bea-49b0-800f-203ddc44872b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f660850f-7bea-49b0-800f-203ddc44872b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0901a11efde5f9e6db140103d6ed1e8e4f2e0c166a5528afb4f3a2b76f8ab67"}}, "hash": "c0901a11efde5f9e6db140103d6ed1e8e4f2e0c166a5528afb4f3a2b76f8ab67", "text": "absolute errors, giving 7 One can use micro-growth models to measure hazards impacts on welfare dynamics by considering hazard events as natural experiments. For instance, one can assess the nutrition levels of those who were affected by a natural hazard compared with those who were not in a sort of before-after fashion. In doing so, those households affected by the hazard become a treatment group whose welfare outcomes can be compared against the outcomes for those who were not affected (control group) (Premand, 2007). With this basic set up one can borrow tools from impact evaluation techniques, including difference-in- difference or propensity score matching followed by logistic regressions on the poverty status. less weight to outliers.

The first step would be to estimate a regression on consumption, which can take various forms depending on the type of hazards observed. A generic form to express this would be: Here \u0109h is predicted consumption, HAZARD denotes the occurrence of hazards prior to the date of the survey, and subscripts h and v whether this hazard hits the household or village, respectively. Dv stands for a set of dummy variables identifying each community in the survey separately (regional dummies for locality effects), and X being the vector of household and community characteristics. Lastly, the vector of parameters to be estimated is \u03b2, and \u03b5h is a household-specific error term. One could map whether the incidence and scope of hazards have a differentiated effect on poverty from direct pre- coded questions to the main respondent in the household questionnaire. In this case, HAZARDh would be the existing 8 The presence of a good retrospective module on the history of natural disasters and where individuals recall their ancestors past welfare can be another alternative to work with cross-sectional data. The authors choose not to elaborate further on this aspect, first, because there are no surveys with good retrospective modules in the selected country studies; and second, many researchers do not regard this as a credible method for collecting quantitative data given that people tend to develop selective memories over time (Addison, Hulme and Kanbur, 2008). vector of hazard data. Provided there is access to secondary or indirect measures of hazards (i.e., rainfall and temperature records, or perhaps hazard loss databases) instead of direct information from household surveys, the researcher can map them into consumption poverty after properly matching those rainfall records into the communities under study (Christiaensen and Subbarao, 2004). HAZARDv would be the only vector of hazard data available in this case. Finally, both of the above sources can be combined to come up with a more complete hazard distribution of each household to inform the variance of consumption as in Dercon and Krishnan (2000) and de la Fuente (2005). Running an OLS regression of consumption levels (or its logarithm) on any combination of the above vector(s) of hazards can give a pre-figuration of their impact on consumption and, in consequence, poverty levels. For instance, Dercon, Hoddinott and Woldehanna (2005) found in a regression linking consumption per adult to rural households in Ethiopia in 2004 to a series of hazards and other household and community time-invariant conditions that reporting a drought in the two previous years was correlated with 16 percent lower consumption (mainly food consumption), and a drought experienced four years before reduced consumption by 14 percent. With the parameter estimates of consumption readily available, the welfare outcome can be predicted for the case in which the shocks would not have occurred (vector HAZARD Hh=Hv=0). If consumption had been calculated under vector HAZARDv above one could also predict the counterfactual situation with rainfall at a given percent below its mean level or a combination of bad household-level hazards reported as dichotomous variables (HAZARDh=1) with poor rainfall in equation (17). The computation of poverty rates from alternative predicted scenarios would simply result from plugging in the predicted values \u0109 in the relevant poverty measure. The vector of poverty rates that ensue would allow observing the contribution of each significant hazard to overall poverty.

Nature of survey (cross-section or panel) and hazard data employed (hazard databases, rainfall) based on the quality of data available and the purposes of research. With regard to the household surveys, the most likely options are to carry out single or combined analysis with following sources: \u2022\ufffd Cross-sectional data, without being able to control for unobserved household-specific effects, but covering a great deal of spatial conditions within countries; \u2022\ufffd District or subdistrict panels to follow poverty trends at an aggregate level and gauge the impact of policy responses on them, but at the expense of not having valuable information on household behavioural responses; and \u2022\ufffd Household panel to model welfare micro-dynamics, but given the data constraints of research, one would be looking at most one period ahead from the baseline survey. While better for modelling dynamics, the sunk costs of investing in panel data and possibly not finding meaningful associations given this temporal narrowness as opposed to quick setup through cross-sectional analysis should be considered. Most likely, the bulk of the country analysis would be undertaken using methods suitable for single and repeated cross-sectional data, whereas panel data analysis will be undertaken for a small set of countries. 2. Available indicator(s) of well-being. Consumption is the preferred welfare measure employed by poverty studies and most likely will be found in the GAR country-study surveys. Yet, it is still true that a number of factors make current consumption a noisy welfare indicator as well. In that sense, the study can certainly be related to other dimensions such as education, nutrition and health, or even a relationship between assets and hazards can be brought into full consideration. 3.

Outcomes presented. Some deliverables expected from the GAR country case studies are climatic and geological hazard profiles of the country or region assessed; an explicit reference as to whether any of the proposed hypotheses for the study has been corroborated, expanded or rejected; and possible explanations for this. In the build up for reporting the main findings, it would also be desirable to find reported possible motivations for choosing the dataset in turn, indicators of well-being, and estimation decisions. 5Conclusion 25 Annex I \u2013 Concepts and Definitions 1.1 Hazard Hazards (risk in economics literature) are potentially damaging physical events or phenomenon that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation (ISDR, 2007). The first part of this definition shows that the probability of occurrence of hazards is associated with a threat to welfare until they materialize or vanish. This allows to point out that households can have some sense of the likelihood of events occurring a priori (i.e., can attach a probabilistic outcome to the hazard), without really having any direct control over them (i.e., they are not perfectly certain that will occur in any given future). The impacts resulting from the hazard will depend on the related exposure and vulnerability9 of a given population, which can be summarized by household and community endowments (see Figure 1). The above characterization has important implications for analysing the temporal nexus of hazards with poverty. Being exposed to a hazard per se can be welfare damaging in the sense that households due to risk-averse behaviour typically adopt less than optimal income-generating activities to reduce this exposure, which in low-income contexts can translate into poverty, even if the hazard event never materializes. Simultaneously, if a contingency occurs, since the poor tend to lack adequate access to financial and social insurance institutions, they usually end up using their few assets, which could plunge them further into persistent deprivation. Therefore, the effect of hazards on poverty could be understood from two temporal angles with respect to the hazard itself: before it happens (ex ante) or once it occurs (ex post assessment). The route of analysis taken in this proposal (and therefore proposed for the country case studies) is in the latter fashion (i.e., once the hazard manifests 9 This proposal avoids the concept of vulnerability for two reasons: It might lead to confusion as practitioners from different disciplines use different meanings and concepts of vulnerability, which, in turn, have led to diverse methods of measurement and frameworks to understand it (Alwang et al., 2001). Second, the concept of vulnerability is not as well developed as that of poverty, at least within economics. And even then, there seems to be an increasing agreement that should remain a forward-looking concept associated to a negative welfare outcome (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003). This brings practical difficulties to map the effect of hazards on poverty. explore its effect on poverty as an ex post backward-looking exercise).10 1.1.1 Typology Hazards can be conveniently classified according to their origin into two broad categories: natural, including earthquakes (geological), droughts (weather-induced), and epidemics (epidemiological); and/or human induced, such as financial crisis (economic), ethnic, gender or religious discrimination (political), civil strife and war (social), nuclear hazard (technological), and pollution and deforestation (environmental) (World Bank, 2000; ISDR, 2007). This proposal focuses on natural hazards associated with geological and climatic factors. This comprise earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions in the first case; and cyclones, droughts, floods, hurricanes, mudslides and typhoons, in the second case. In addition, the scope, frequency, length, strength and degree of autocorrelation with other hazards can vary widely across natural hazards having different implications for poverty. For instance, a flood can affect isolated individuals or households living on the edge of a community remaining highly idiosyncratic, while similar rains in another state can strike entire groups of households in various communities or regions becoming covariate. Torrential rains can occur frequently while volcanic eruptions are rarer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4fb8bc2d-13b3-4968-8ee5-1d014e5e1275": {"__data__": {"id_": "4fb8bc2d-13b3-4968-8ee5-1d014e5e1275", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e6af40c7e9312041e3d453c73e12c0ada0f4844bced07578887d68d14e87ce0"}, "2": {"node_id": "d53e384d-d26c-468c-865c-a784cbc603f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc8363aa5119b659c784f13a70c98bee73e0c7d146ace1f5e04b5b2ea633ec7a"}}, "hash": "6368760250b2063afceced1191c1692124fc50fc9bc461fa19d60ed2facb9167", "text": "Torrential rains can occur frequently while volcanic eruptions are rarer.

Finally, the impact of natural hazards can compound over time with others. Hurricanes might reduce the people\u2019s capacity to withstand other hazards in the future such as droughts. If shocks concatenate and lead into further hazards (i.e., earthquakes leading to fires, floods and landslides), they will be highly auto-correlated (Siegel and Alwang, 1999; World Development Report 2000; Lavell, 2000; Sinha, Lipton and Yaqub, 2002; UNDP, 2004; ISDR, 2007). 10 With some exceptions (Ligon and Schechter, 2003), mapping the effect of a covariate welfare-damaging event (with backward-looking data) on future poverty has been done without quantifying the welfare loss associated with its possible realization. Therefore ex ante forward- looking measures are not considered in the analysis. 26 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal 1.2 Poverty An individual, household or community is said to be poor when it falls short of a level of welfare deemed to constitute a reasonable minimum, either in some absolute sense or by the standards of a specific society (Lipton and Ravallion, 1995). Poverty encompasses four overarching dimensions that need to be spelled out to confine the empirical and methodological reach of this proposal: 1) breadth and multidimensionality; 2) depth and severity; 3) duration; and 4) spatial distribution (Clark and Hulme, 2005). 1.2.1. Breadth and multidimensionality The conventional aspects of people\u2019s lives that are used to determine a situation of poverty are money-metric measures such as income or consumption, at least within economics. The most commonly used poverty measures are food insecurity (calorie-based) headcount measures mapped onto consumption expenditures. It has also been common to incorporate into such expenditure variables other basic needs (i.e. nutrition and health, including proxies like water supply, sanitation and education, and more rarely energy, durables and rents). However, these other aspects of welfare should have been gradually included in the study of poverty through their own metrics rather than compressing them into consumption expenditures (Kanbur and Squire, 1999). In that sense, rather than reinforcing the idea that consumption poverty is the only desirable measure of welfare, emphasis on different dimensions of well-being \u2013potentially liable to damage while households or individuals are struck by natural hazards \u2013 is encouraged while conducting analysis for the GAR report. It should also be stressed that headcount measures in any of this aspects is very different from measures of depth and skewness, which as explained below are distributional measures that can be applied to each of these dimensions of poverty. The established truism with respect to the multidimensional nature of poverty has been followed by methodological and theoretical considerations and proposals to measure such breadth (Bourguignon and Chakravarty, 2003; Duclos et al., 2006; Alkire and Foster, 2007), some of which are still unfolding. While promising, most of these applications are still waiting to be endorsed empirically. In poverty dynamics, multidimensional concepts and measures of poverty lie even further behind or are simply not there yet (Addisson, Hulme and Kanbur, 2008). Therefore, this proposal considers safer ground to assess the effects of natural hazards on poverty looking at single dimensions of poverty (and explore distributional issues within them when deemed convenient by the researcher). 1.2.2 Depth The measurement of poverty has been constantly refined. It has progressed from counting the poor towards capturing the severity of poverty (i.e., the extent to which welfare falls below any given threshold) as well as its distribution across the units of analysis (Foster, Greer and Thorbecke, 1984; Clark and Hulme, 2005). All three aspects add something different to our understanding of poverty and have become part of the standard toolkit for its assessment. As a result, exploring the incidence, depth and severity of poverty should be part of the analysis on the effects of natural hazards on poverty.

While this poverty trend contrasts headcounts of poverty snapshots across A in two points in time, it says nothing on whether the observed 15 percent of poor households was the same over both periods of time or if new households left or entered into this group in-between periods. This major shortcoming has given rise to the poverty dynamics literature that distinguishes between transitory and chronic poor, and the factors correlated with the observed mobility or lack of mobility, respectively. The two basic ways of modelling inter-temporal poverty dynamics are the spells approach that focuses on transitions from one welfare status (poor/non-poor) to another (non-poor/poor); and the components approach that breaks down welfare into permanent and transitory components. Both types of approaches only make sense when more than two waves of panel observations are available. This represents a major constraint in the GAR countries as only three of them have 27 ANNEX I \u2013 CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS panels with more than two waves of data (see Annex III).11 For this reason, this proposal mainly considers mobility when two waves of panel data are available (a baseline survey and one resurvey). This proposal also gives consideration to static poverty analysis coming from a single cross-section of households and the analysis of poverty trends based on a series of longitudinal cross-sections. As discussed below, time- invariant poverty analysis cannot be informative about the effects of natural hazards on poverty trends. However, a nationally representative cross-section can provide a good geographical overview of the diversity of living conditions of households within a country. This can give way to the analysis of spatial patterns of poverty (arguably another dimension of poverty) and their possible association with hazard patterns if the survey can be supplemented with databases for all major hazard types, including earthquakes (GSHAP), flooding (Dartmouth Flood observatory), along with rainfall records that provide data on meteorological drought/flooding. 1.3 Assets The exposure of households to poverty and natural hazards may have an important connection with their access to assets and the way people call on them, along with the liabilities that may exercise claims on family resources, such as being in debt. Therefore, clarifying the concept of assets is important. The definition and categorization of assets is detailed in Annex II section 2.2. 11 The spells approach defines the chronically poor as those who are poor in every wave as opposed to the transitorily poor who might cross the poverty line (or other welfare boundary) through the period of study. It receives its name from counting the number of periods (or \u2018spells\u2019) in poverty that a person or household experiences. The approach has two main failings. First, it ignores that some spells are in progress when the panel starts and ends (i.e. censored), when in fact the span and timing under poverty or non-poverty should matter. And second, it ignores dynamics between the base and terminal years, and hence does not distinguish between transitory and permanent trend effects or trajectories (Dercon and Krishnan, 2000; Oduro, 2002). These shortcomings give birth to modelling poverty dynamics through components that isolates statistically the permanent component of a household\u2019s welfare from any transitory fluctuations around the permanent level, by modelling the welfare indicator itself. The extent to which the permanent component falls below the poverty line is the degree of chronic poverty since deviations in poverty around the permanent level are seen as transitory poverty. This approach has also important shortcomings: First, it requires large time-periods as its estimation involves averaging consumption over time. And second, it can render a less intuitive notion of chronic poverty as this can result from one-period poverty in multiple periods due to averaging. The two approaches are not equivalent. The poverty spells approach distinguishes chronically poor people from other people in general (because the categories are not all beyond a well-being benchmark), whereas the component approach distinguishes between people\u2019s chronic poverty from its transitory poverty. 28 To test the aforementioned hypotheses in section 2, one requires information on three fronts: 1. Natural hazards, with an identification of their context- specific frequency, scope and severity, when possible; 2. Existing household, community and extra-community assets; and 3. Welfare outcomes that, crudely speaking, result from the interaction of the first two and can span from money- metrics to human development indicators. Most data for components 2 and 3 is contained, or can be elicited from household and community surveys and censuses.

However, this will still be missing by and large in the surveys of the selected country studies (see Annex III). Therefore, secondary hazard-related data, such as historical hazard databases, rainfall records from meteorological stations or satellite technology as well as seismological data, should also be integrated into quantitative work to model natural disasters and their impact on poverty. 2.1 Hazard data 2.1.1 Household surveys Climatic and geological hazard data at household level would enable the consideration of differentiated poverty experiences on the basis of their occurrence. This matching will be less relevant while looking at how poverty helps to configure the exposure of human settlements to hazard damage. Information on natural hazards at household level would capture events as perceived by households irrespective of their scale. This could redress the neglect that more frequent, but less intensive hazards experience relative to large-scale catastrophes. At the same time, once the number of hazard-affected households within a locality is known the researcher can get a sense of its scope rather than assuming that all hazards are de facto covariate and will affect everyone simultaneously.12 For instance, a series of droughts, earthquakes, floods, frosts and hurricanes experienced by a sample of rural households in Central Mexico between 1998 and 2000 were for most part of the period quite idiosyncratic (de la Fuente, 2005). If hazard information is available in longitudinal form, the analysis can concentrate on their persistence in household\u2019s welfare dynamics. With hazards recorded in consecutive periods of time the researcher can also get an estimate of whether successive calamities (i.e., hazard bunching) had a higher impact on welfare outcomes. Obviously, there should be an effort to control for the potential trade-off between the number of consecutive disasters experienced and their respective intensities. This requirement is not unattainable, but the hazard module contained in the survey would require that respondents quantify the impact of the peril in monetary terms to proxy its magnitude. For example, the percentage of their wealth, income or consumption that was lost, or the cost of any damage done by the hazard (Carter et al., 2006). Other caveats of survey hazard data to keep in mind are the time lags that hazard questions work with (Did your household experienced a drought in the last six months?). The survey could miss important events, especially one- off large-scale disasters unless it was conducted for that purpose. The infrequency can complicate the study of extreme impacts on poverty trends over time. This shortcoming could be attenuated by the importance that the GAR wants to concede to low-profile hazards as well. The lagged nature of hazard questions in household surveys may also imply not capturing their date of occurrence and length, making comparisons across hazards fairly uneven. For 12 To distinguish the scope of weather-related hazards one can follow the procedure suggested by Tesliuc and Lindert in Guatemala (2002), which consists in counting the number of households within each locality to aggregate them at the locality level; then, estimate the proportion of households reporting the incidence of the shock in each locality. Finally, estimate the proportion of villages with a small, medium, or large share of households that reported experiencing the hazard. One can also get a sense of the extent to which hazards are common or idiosyncratic by looking at the contribution of the village effects in the total variance of the indicator. This can be achieved by decomposing the variance of each hazard event allowing for time-varying village level means on a pooled dataset across survey rounds. In practice, the village-level variance is like the R2 of a regression on a full set of time-varying village level dummies (Dercon and Krishnan, 2000; de la Fuente, 2005). Annex II \u2013 Data Sources 29 ANNEX II \u2013 DATA SOURCES instance, floods happening six months ago or a week before the interview date will be lumped into one single period, possibly clouding their impact on poverty in the first case. A household may have suffered a flood five months ago and the income reported may have already recovered to some extent from the shock. For this reason, ideally comparisons should be made \u2018like-with-like\u2019 (i.e., assess the flood impact over the same group of people within the survey). Second, hazard answers are typically converted into dichotomous variables, which imply modelling them as if they were of the same magnitude, even though their impact could be very different across households. As Tesliuc and Lindert (2002) pointed out from their data for hazards in Guatemala: given that unlike consumption, hazards in surveys do not have their own measurement unit, it is possible that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23c16b25-956b-44b4-8bb1-1a770ebbac1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "23c16b25-956b-44b4-8bb1-1a770ebbac1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a59109f8d565e14358101e7192a08bd7ced179ac96e4134ef6681127905b72a0"}}, "hash": "a59109f8d565e14358101e7192a08bd7ced179ac96e4134ef6681127905b72a0", "text": "the same qualitative response (Did you experience a flood? Yes or No) masks heterogeneous responses. This deficiency could be corrected with more detailed information on hazard impacts as suggested above and not simply dichotomizing answers. It remains to see whether modules with these characteristics exist inside the household surveys considered for this project (see Annex III). Finally, as all self-reported information, hazard answers are subject to respondent bias or self-attributed causality. This means that certain groups are more likely to report certain hazards for reasons related with their own characteristics rather than for being more affected, with the possibility that better-off families complain more than poor respondents about any hazard (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003; Hoogeveen et al., 2004; de la Fuente and Fuentes, 2007). This has been more clearly observed for idiosyncratic illness episodes, and only in a few cases for natural disasters (Quisumbing, 2007). The potential reporting bias should be verified on a case-by-case basis by cross-tabulating responses with wealth indicators and other information on relevant categories found in the household survey. In sum, household surveys containing data on natural hazards (including programme evaluation samples) can make an assessment of their effect on poverty much more informative. Thus, it is worth paying special attention to those sources that deal with them explicitly, without neglecting the sorts of problems that can be encountered in their quantification. 2.1.2 Secondary sources In those instances where household surveys (main input for poverty assessments) and programme evaluation samples have no information on natural hazards, it will be essential to bring in alternative sources of data, including national hazard databases, rainfall records and seismological data. And even when valuable climatic and geological data is in place at the household level, in the current state of most surveys it is extremely difficult to capture some of their attributes, especially their severity (de Weerdt, 2006). National hazard databases Each country considered for this assessment will have at its disposal national hazard loss databases containing the following features over a 25-year period on average: the date of occurrence and location (at subnational political- administrative units) of a wide range of natural hazards; and the extent of their severity, mainly measured through impacts on three categories of losses (houses damaged and destroyed, hectares of crops lost, and mortality rates). The advantages of such databases are self-evident: First, they can convey the inter-temporal dimension of hazards (including seasonal and monthly variations) as well as their spatial component at lower levels of observation compared to global hazard databases like EM-DAT.13 Second, the higher resolution will capture manifestations of frequent small-scale hazard events, including fires, flash floods, landslides and storms, associated with climatic hazards. And third, they capture the severity of hazard, which constitutes a most relevant, but highly elusive attribute.14 In principle, this information can be assembled with survey and census data for two different purposes. First, to cross- validate hazard accounts contained in household survey data or to convert other valuable sources of information, such as rainfall records, into meaningful hazard events. Second, provided the administrative codes are the same for the areas in which hazard and poverty data were collected (i.e., district level), and considering that the analysis of exposure to hazard events is carried out at subnational level, the availability of hazard incidence and impacts can be overlapped to cross-sectional data in an effort to indicate correlations with identified areas of rural or urban poverty by hazard type and loss category. Some contextual variables might not be accounted for in the above analysis. In particular, if poverty data is only available for one particular time interval, what would that interval imply in the overall context of a period of intense accumulation of hazards? What are the dynamics of settlement and migration in the area in question over the period of intense hazard accumulation and 13 EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database) contains data entries from 1900 through the present, and registers events as disasters if they produced 10 or more deaths, affect 100 or more people, or where a situation of emergency was declared or a call for international assistance was made. Most losses associated with frequent, but small-scale scenarios are below these loss thresholds, and therefore, are not documented in the database. Finally, it has a global level of observation and a national scale of resolution (ISDR, 2007). 14 This last feature will still be difficult for hazards that have no established scales e.g. flooding, storm surge. But for rainfall, a deciles-based method could be used as a working method. 30 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal prior to the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2b1cbc0-a373-4e3f-8bab-bece1c2bded8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2b1cbc0-a373-4e3f-8bab-bece1c2bded8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3b1bd24288265d914c733f05c10dc92306302a90910de6b4a775a12d47d2b44"}}, "hash": "d3b1bd24288265d914c733f05c10dc92306302a90910de6b4a775a12d47d2b44", "text": "interval in which poverty data was collected? These aspects would be beyond the scope of the exercises proposed here, and at best can be captured qualitatively. This second line of analysis will not be able to move beyond correlations towards the establishment of meaningful causalities, but will facilitate the location of spatial trends, if any. In fact, when panel data is available at district or subdistrict level, hazard databases can be used to assess the hazard effects on poverty trends at this level of analysis (see section 4.2). In a similar vein, hazard data at district level can be employed to capture welfare dynamics or impacts on human development indicators of certain groups by interspersing hazard events in-between two periods for which outcome data is available. There are various issues to consider while connecting hazard data to household surveys for analysing poverty. First, the level at which this imputation will happen is beyond households implicitly assuming that everyone is being affected. And second, there will be a restricted period of observation as most panels in GAR countries comprise two rounds spanning from the second half of the nineties to the first part of this decade. This narrowness might impede to capture large-scale highly infrequent catastrophes that are more likely to cause noticeable poverty. Ultimately, this is an empirical matter, but the sunk costs of setting up a panel data at the household level combined with the possibility of not capturing observable hazard effects on poverty for the above reasons should be borne in mind. This fact reinforced the authors\u2019 decision to leave out of this proposal two common ways of modelling inter-temporal dynamics (spells and components) as the three household surveys with more than two waves of data within the GAR countries have no hazard modules in them (see Annex III). Beyond the different ways of connecting hazard data for analysis, there is a key issue to be addressed that refers to whether the hazard event itself or its impacts should be used as the key variable to represent the effect of natural hazards on poverty. There is an argument in favour of using impacts to capture the severity of hazards; however, the reporting of some impacts might be fundamentally endogenous to the livelihoods of the population under analysis. If this were the case, one cannot ascertain to what extent the severity of the calamity and not the individual capacity of households to cope with it are responsible for the observed outcomes. Take the cases of Peru and Japan where despite similar patterns of natural hazards, fatalities average 2,900 a year in Peru but just 63 in Japan (World Bank, 2000). Most likely these figures are a combination of earthquake severity and the households\u2019 capacity to cope with them. In its extreme version, a selection problem might crop up if the least or most able families exit the hazard-affected community, distorting any possible appreciation of its real severity. Suppose two contiguous communities experience a flood of similar intensity. In community A, many people decide to leave due to their inability to stand the rains leading to an underreporting of only 2 households affected. By contrast, in community B characterized by more economically dynamic households, those who decide to move on to avoid constant floods will leave behind the most vulnerable. The reported impact will throw 10 households affected giving the impression of a highly more devastating flood in B. The presence of \u2018selective attrition\u2019 affecting community- level hazard loss variables can be problematic for any cross- sectional analysis of causality in household survey and census data because there is no full proof way of determining the existence or direction of the effect. Longitudinal data can offer more scope to address this concern by looking at the profile of attritors and the possible motivations that led them to migrate (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003). Another critical issue is whether impact information in hazard databases was recorded only for those events with reported impacts. The evidence of losses implies that hazards must be present, but there could be natural hazards with no impacts reported or at least not in the categories mentioned before (i.e., housing and crops). Obviously, only a re-run of the raw data on a case-by-case basis by the country teams will tell how many large intensity events report no loss, typically because of poor newspaper reports that are an important source for DesInventar. In survey data, the impact of climatic and geological events could be used to take advantage of the more precise answer of what experiencing a hazard meant for households.

Unlike the effect of hazard loss on poverty or vice versa, the presence of endogeneity in hazard events themselves can be controlled for in survey analysis. Poverty might configure the propensity to experience losses giving the impression that some natural hazards are endogenous. For instance, strictly speaking a volcanic eruption would be fundamentally exogenous, but fires in a squatter settlement fundamentally endogenous, and other hazards, such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes usually in-between. However, the propensity of a hurricane or earthquake for causing material damage and trigger poverty may be controlled through initial household- and village-level characteristics alone and interacted with hazards. In other words, the problems of endogeneity that may arise in the sense that poorer households may be expected to experience a higher incidence of natural hazards than affluent counterparts can be controlled through wealth indicators. Location is a different matter. The researcher would need to carefully verify if, for instance, spatial position makes some households more susceptible to agro-climatic 31 ANNEX II \u2013 DATA SOURCES hazards than others. This proposal considers that hazard events as exogenous variables in their origin deserve special consideration for analysis. Rainfall and seismological records An alternative way to capture the intensity of hazard events is through units of measurement associated with the phenomenon in turn \u2013 rainfall for drought and floods, temperature for frosts, earthquake magnitude, and so forth. In doing so, the focus on severity is switched from hazard losses to hazard inputs and is exogenous to household coping mechanisms, mending potential troubles contained in some of the impact-based indicators of hazard severity discussed above, in particular mortality. In addition, climatic and seismological data may complement the absence of locally covariate hazard information in household surveys. In principle, community questionnaires can provide data related to locality-specific hazards. However, retrieving the degree of aggregation or the severity of hazards from this piece of data is often impossible, and since the respondent is habitually a community representative the self-attribution of causality in his/her response might crop up again. In contrast, one can compile a detailed account of rainfall records expressed on a monthly basis for a given period of years coming from meteorological stations or satellites. Once available, this data can be matched to the geographical position of the localities under study. At this point it would be necessary to establish whether rainfall matters over a span of time or only for a specific month(s) during the period under analysis. For this purpose, the cross-matching of hazard databases with rainfall records can pinpoint the dates (historical occurrence) of relevant hazards and their length, avoiding the need to make wrong calls on when to consider rainfall deviations a hazard event. Indicators can be created on the extent to which monthly rainfall magnitudes in percentage terms are above or below the long-run means for the respective localities (say for capturing a flood) or on median rainfall precipitation for a given interlude (in the case of a drought). If daily precipitation databases exist at decent spatial resolution a number of small-scale and highly-localized hazards, such as flash floods, can also be stochastically modelled from conventional meteorological catalogues (World Bank, 2005b). Each step above involves some degree of circumspection. The researcher needs to make sure that rainfall data covers the relevant geographic areas of analysis \u2013 the whole country or a region. In rural areas, rainfall stations might simply not be there or have low quality and insufficient data in regions with low potential and limited commercial farming interests (most likely poor geographically inaccessible areas). In addition, rainfall data tends to be available at different geographical units or boundaries than those of the survey, making interpolation necessary. Topography can pose a great difficulty for matching mean rainfall data in places liable to microclimates with large differences in weather patterns within a few kilometres (i.e., when stations are encrusted in mountains characterized by drops of various hundred of metres over a few kilometres) (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003). Both shortage of stations and location can create a potential mismatch between rainfall data to proxy hazard severity and poverty. Fixing this problem is not insurmountable, but would require a careful effort to integrate data into the locality frame and make findings meaningful (for instance, GIS can help in developing appropriate smoothing algorithms and spatial models).15 Needless to say, this task will not be possible for hazards without relevant measurement units, including tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.

In these cases, the national historical databases may provide the only source of information on the full range of hazard events within countries. 2.2 Asset data The second source of information required to determine the extent to which households mitigate hazard impacts is linked to assets. Household assets are the stock of wealth used to generate well-being (Siegel and Alwang, 1999). The usefulness of coping strategies during times of stress has to do with the ownership and accumulation of different types of assets, but also with the capacity to mobilize them. This appendix focuses on the former aspect, which is more widely available in household surveys. Clearly, it would be desirable to conduct an analysis of returns and transformation of different types of income-earning assets during hardships, 15 A study of vulnerability to poverty in 506 localities of Central Mexico made use of rainfall data expressed on a monthly basis for a period of 40 years (from 1961 through 2000) coming from meteorological stations spread across the localities under study. Given the highly demanding nature of data and the fact that most of the stations did not correspond to delimited political boundaries, it was necessary to perform imputations in the following way: 1) create correlation matrices between core rainfall stations (those next to localities and with the highest number of observations) and the rest to identify pair wise secondary stations based on the highest correlations observed; 2) calculate the respective long-run means for both types of stations; 3) compute the corresponding mean ratios assuming then that the variability in the records is the same across stations, but not the mean; and 4) interpolate values multiplying the values of the secondary stations by the means ratio to scale them (de la Fuente, 2005). 32 Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty: A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal but will be hard to attain given the information at disposal and the time constrains faced during research.16 2.2.1 Household-level data This proposal refers to tangible assets to designate natural, human, physical and financial capitals, and intangible assets to designate social and political capital. Human capital alludes to the level of education (literacy and years of completed education) and health condition (nutritional and disease status) of household members. Both groups of indicators are instrumental to raising individual income- generating capacities, but also reflect welfare in their own right. Hence, they can be used as dependent variables in the poverty-hazards analysis (see section 2.3). The household composition in terms of its size, sex and life-cycle of its members as well as their occupations (especially for the head) will be encompassed under household characteristics. Physical capital can be associated with productive assets such as land, cultivated areas, working tools, equipment and work animals (in rural areas), and with housing size and type of materials, and household services (especially important for the urban poor as productive asset or investment); or stocks including livestock, food, jewellery, household appliances and other durable goods. Finally, financial capital refers to cash, savings and access to credit. Intangible assets are understood in the traditional sense of social, institutional and political relationships among households within and outside the community, including gender relations, social ties and networks (proxied by inter-household transfers), participation in associations and organizations, and intra-household relations (Moser, 1998). Clearly, the mapping of this group of variables into appropriate indicators for their quantitative measurement is more difficult. 2.2.2 Community-level data The capacity of households to mobilize their assets during natural hazards has a direct connection with the broader context in which these are deployed (i.e., existing structures of opportunity at the community level). This refers to the institutional support that can complement or replace household coping strategies (i.e., safety nets), as well as the provision of infrastructure and services from government institutions to the community. In particular, the existence of 16 The usefulness of assets when it comes to coping with natural hazards goes beyond their ownership and households having access to them. To generate income in case of hardship, assets need to have a high return and be liquid (readily available to be transformed into cash). Typically high return assets are more risky posing a trade-off in the type of asset held. For instance, livestock is usually highly illiquid and hard to mobilize. In a similar vein, the fact that assets can hold their value during times of stress (being stores of wealth and saving to manage risk) is an important attribute that needs to be considered when assessing specific assets.

This includes safe and dependable water supply system, sanitation and drainage, schools, health clinics, marketplace, local administrative centres, transportation and communication infrastructure, protection and enhancement of the natural asset \u2018commons\u2019, and storage facilities. This information collected from \u2018community questionnaires\u2019 on local infrastructure, health and education facilities, added to market prices, can be valuable for eliciting the returns to assets and their utilization. However, community surveys alongside household data are not always available. At the community level, geographical and environmental capital influences the availability of natural and communal resources as well as the connections of the community with the regional and macro economies. This can determine the comparative advantage of the community or, by the contrary, increase its predisposition to suffer damage or loss when exposed to hazard events. These capitals include land, water, trees and so on, but also the climatic conditions that result from location. In addition, one can incorporate GIS/mapping software to produce a spatial representation of existing variables such as terrain, agro-ecological zone, distance from major cities, etc. Households interacting with each other inside the community and beyond portray some sort of assets that result from this interaction. For instance, households can strengthen linkages with other communities participating in marriage and migration, but also being part of inclusive political systems and markets (Siegel and Alwang, 1999). While the commons are important in practice, they might be rather difficult to break out from the sum of household assets without intense empirical research. 2.2.3 Census and administrative data Undertaking the analysis of poverty on hazard losses will have to consider information beyond the community level. A combination of secondary sources, such as administrative data and information collected by government statistical services, in particular census data can become a prime source. Some indicators beyond community level that could be considered for poverty analysis at district or subdistrict level would result from the aggregation of individual, household or community data. For instance, the degree of geographical isolation (availability of roads and paths usable at all time of the year) per district; average availability of public services and human resources, access to employment and share of economic activities of its population; land distribution; 33 ANNEX II \u2013 DATA SOURCES and degree of inequality across gender, racial or ethnic lines inside the district.

Money-metric indicators In quantitative work, the conventional aspects of people\u2019s lives that are used to determine a condition of poverty are income or consumption. This choice stems from their tractability and easy operationalization. Among them, consumption is usually preferred over income for the following reasons: 1. It is a better outcome indicator \u2013 Actual consumption is more closely related to a person\u2019s well-being in the sense of having enough to meet current basic needs, whereas income is only one of the elements that will allow consumption of goods (others include questions of access, availability, etc.); 2. It may better reflect a household\u2019s ability to meet basic needs \u2013 Consumption expenditures reflect not only the goods and services that a household can command based on its current income, but also whether that household can access credit or insurance markets at times when current income is low or even negative. Consumption can therefore provide a better picture of actual living standards than current income, especially when income fluctuates a lot; and 3. It may be better measured than income \u2013 Especially in poor agrarian economies, incomes for rural households may fluctuate during the year, in line with the harvest cycle. This implies that it may be difficult for households to correctly recall their income, making the information on income of low quality. Finally, large shares of income are not monetized if households consume their own production or exchange it for some other goods. But even if consumption is the chosen measure, there are a number of factors that should be borne in mind. First, people in general will not prefer constant consumption over the life-cycle. In fact, different households may face different constraints on their consumption smoothing. Poor people tend to be more constrained than the non-poor in their borrowing options, so that not only lifetime wealth, but its distribution over the life-cycle affects lifetime welfare. Second, even if current consumption varies less around long- term well-being than current income for a given household, it may not be the best ordinal indicator to convey long-term living standards. And finally, even if better measured than income, it is still bound to some measurement error. The degree of sophistication in the construction of the expenditure variable depends on the information available. Most studies divide consumption into food and non-food (transportation, personal and household hygiene, clothing, education, health, and durable goods) components, and report expenditures per capita to account for the number of members sharing resources inside the household. This has to be so as income and consumption are typically only observed at the household level. A further refinement is often achieved by employing adult equivalent scales that are weighs used by age and gender to adjust for different household structures. Put together, the above adjustments render comparability of poverty outcomes across households of different size and composition. 2.3.2 Non-money-metric indicators While focusing on income or consumption flows can facilitate the analysis of poverty, their use for assessing the effect of hazards on well-being is not always self-evident. For instance, extending the analysis of poverty transitions into non-income dimensions provided they display some change over time can report the following advantages: \u2022\ufffd The presence of measurement error in consumption and income data leading to spurious fluctuations in welfare might be attenuated with the use of information on human or physical capital. \u2022\ufffd If the aim is to capture the persistence of poverty, it might be more relevant to focus on those aspects that determine the structural capacity of household to earn a living. This would include household human and physical capital (anthropometric measures and material asset levels), rather than flows that are more volatile over short-time periods, especially in the context of poor households (Clark and Hulme, 2005). \u2022\ufffd It makes sense to centre attention on assets given that assets themselves are often the main target of natural hazards. Provided any other dimension of well-being can be properly quantified, say health or nutrition, there is no impediment for taking up morbidity and poor nutritional status as core indicators of poverty. In both cases, international benchmarks can be called on to assist the definition of poverty. The researcher can identify \u2018poverty lines\u2019 for health, nutritional and educational deprivation for children and adults. For children, one can use stunting (height for age) and wasting (weight for height) as indicators of nutritional deprivation, whereas for adults 18", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6044650d-feee-4920-b316-eb0e6b5d66f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6044650d-feee-4920-b316-eb0e6b5d66f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a98966b7003a5b3a75603e0f5427a1e3a4f7b7b33630d7e3d9bc3d7a5a779917"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7f6aff5-244b-4fa5-9807-0ad045a59245", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71202c040e84fd11796f0a9cda4430a32564e23838725cc33f2add4f1c30aa40"}}, "hash": "aeb6a50a9bc05d94300ae388c8fb7d69cabde63addc74b27083f790b0d45ce53", "text": "years and older, the body mass index. For stunting the z-score is calculated as the height for a child minus the median height of an international reference standard (of well nourished children of the same age and sex), divided by the standard deviation of that reference standard. As for wasting, the median reference value is calculated as the quotient between the weight of a given child and the median weight for a given child of that height. Finally, the body mass index is obtained by dividing weight in kilogramme by the height in centimetres squared of individuals. Under-nutrition (or nutrition poverty) can be defined as being below a z-score of -2 for children (meaning that given age and sex, the child\u2019s height is two standard deviations below the median child in that age/sex group) or 35 ANNEX II \u2013 DATA SOURCES being below a body mass index of 18.5 for adults (Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2001). One can also compute moderate (severe) education poverty in terms of literacy or schooling attainment, but obviously the resulting categorization is clearly more arbitrary and context specific. For instance, Gunther and Klasen (2007) defined educational poverty for Vietnamese adults of 16+ years as having less than 9 (4) years of education, which was equivalent to completed lower secondary school and primary school, respectively. Moderate education poverty for children aged 6\u201315 years was defined as having dropped out of school within the first 9 (4) years. The choice of human development indicators will not be exempt of controversy and pitfalls. The two main drawbacks to consider are that many non-income dimensions of well- being do not change much over time and often seem to exhibit a great deal of inertia in the sense that usually measure improvements. And second, that most current survey instruments lack the tools to systematically track poverty in the non-income dimension or simply miss this type of information. For instance, a compilation of 28 panel datasets in developing countries found that 23 of them assess the standard of living in terms of income or consumption (Lawson, McKay and Moore, 2005).

For instance, if the concern lies on short-term hazard-led welfare fluctuations, two waves of data might suffice. But if interest revolves around their potential to keep people on a low- level steady state of welfare (i.e., create chronic poverty) clearly the data requirements will be more stringent. For this reason, any consideration of the association between natural hazards and poverty should start from an assessment of the informational basis available.

If the aim is to follow the effect of a hazard on the same unit over time either of these are obviously ill-suited. That said, they constitute the most common source of household data at hand and are most suitable for studying the interaction between natural hazards and poverty from a spatial perspective given their ability to capture the diversity of household living conditions within a country. For instance, the integration of detailed information on income and consumption from household surveys with census data has brought to fruition the creation of poverty maps down at subnational level in countries like Peru, Guatemala, Ecuador, Mexico, Nepal and Sri Lanka (see Annex III).18 17 For a thorough discussion on pros and cons of different types of data sources for risk-related welfare analysis see Hoddinott and Quisumbing (2003). 18 Briefly, poverty mapping involves, first, discovering relationships between household characteristics and the welfare level of households as revealed by the analysis of a detailed living standards measurement survey. And second, applying a model of these relationships to data on the same household characteristics contained in a national census to determine the welfare level of all households in the census. The resulting estimates of household welfare and poverty derived from the census are spatially disaggregated to a much higher degree than is possible using survey information (Benson, 2002; Elbers et al., 2004; Bedi, Coudouel and Simler, 2007). 2.4.2 District and subdistrict panel data A succession of cross-sections can become a panel at the level for which sampling has been defined (i.e., rural/urban, regional or district level), and therefore add some dynamism to the analysis of poverty by allowing to consider changes in poverty. It might even be possible to analyse poverty dynamics at subdistrict level where poverty maps have been updated. While this exercise is more difficult given that population census are usually available every decade, there might be instances where inter-censal population counts provide the inputs for updating poverty (Lopez- Calva et al., 2006). The averaging that results from getting aggregate poverty figures may also conceal measurement errors in welfare outcomes at the household level, refining estimations of changes in aggregate poverty figures (McKay and Lawson, 2003). At this level of analysis one could assess the impact of state or regional policies that could block (exacerbate) the effects of hazards on poverty, for instance, economic (distortions on) growth or (non)redistributive policies implemented to reduce inequality. Obviously the examination of poverty experiences across groups would only hold when the same sampling frame is used for both cross-sections and the clusters remain relatively homogenous (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003). The downside of this approach is that household samples differ from year to year cancelling the possibility to focus on the welfare experiences for the same group of individuals or households. 2.4.3 Household panel data Unlike the above sources of data, panel datasets tracking the well-being of the same individual or household over time make possible the estimation of changes in their mobility, while controlling for household-specific factors \u2013 observed and unobserved19 \u2013 that might impinge on poverty. Despite being most suitable for modelling poverty dynamics, panel data also presents important caveats that need to be considered and, if daunting, corrected while conducting an analysis of this nature. A first problem is measurement error in the outcome of interest that could exaggerate dynamics since not all the observed inter-temporal variation would be ascribed to mobility. This is particularly acute when the analysis is based on already difficult to measure data such as consumption and income, but it could well happen with anthropometrics. The presence of measurement error in the 19 To control for household-specific unobserved factors that may affect outcomes (for instance, psychological resilience of household members or their motivation to strive forward) one needs to assume that those factors are fixed over time, and that those households that remain in the sample do not differ from those who have left (Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003). 37 ANNEX II \u2013 DATA SOURCES welfare indicator is often credited to its recompilation or construction. Other sources could be inappropriate price deflation or misuse of adult equivalence scales (Kamanou and Morduch, 2002). A second source of trouble arises when households drop out from the panel in a non-random fashion (attrition). This can happen either because they are very dynamic (better endowed and thus move elsewhere) or extremely precarious to the point of physical extinction or implosion in the form of breakup or migration. On the contrary, if the loss of households occurs in a non-systematic way there should be no cause of concern other than", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0191e50d-6d06-4525-a633-d9ebc613e70a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0191e50d-6d06-4525-a633-d9ebc613e70a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing the Relationship between Natural Hazards and Poverty \u2013 A Conceptual and Methodological Proposal", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83142b92ae862914107b15adb2ad712bea12a7f6cbde0484d499c84210784d26"}, "3": {"node_id": "5162328f-ffaf-4489-98a6-f502d7e10278", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-relationship-between-natural-hazards-and-poverty-conceptual-and-methodological-proposal", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1c9aba1c81fa5f3c7603d11813e571a94a386432b15fd5ecbab6f7bf414273e"}}, "hash": "cca492cb38b7860f524b043cde0bb0e8766f50f311c2795a85cbfbd7e590f323", "text": "shrinking the sample size (Dercon and Shapiro, 2007; McKay and Lawson, 2003; Hoddinott and Quisumbing, 2003; Kamanou and Morduch, 2002; Baulch and Hoddinott, 2000; Yabub, 2000).20 For space reasons, this proposal does not elaborate on the techniques developed to capture the presence and extent of measurement error or attrition, nor the solutions to address them. There are ways to adjust for the presence of substantial measurement error (Glewwe, 2005). As for attrition, it would be good practice to report the rate of attrition, compare profiles between attritors and non-attritors, as well as discuss possible determinants of attrition, and carry out probabilistic models to estimate the probability of attrition from the survey conditional on initial household characteristics (Dercon and Shapiro, 2007; Glewwe and Gibson, 2005; Fitzgerald, Gottschalk and Moffitt, 1998). While these limitations of panel data must be taken seriously, this proposal recommends panel data to be considered as their effect can be mitigated. More importantly, panel data will provide information on household behavioural responses to natural hazards that would otherwise be absent at the other levels of analysis proposed. 20 The analysis of welfare dynamics may also be affected by the choice of the poverty line. This choice may have an unpredictable effect on the number of people who move into and out of poverty from period to period. One way of establishing the robustness of the poverty dynamics encountered (sensitivity of results to the choice of poverty line) is by conducting regression analysis of the transition categories on correlates for a range of poverty lines (Baulch and McCulloch, 2003). 38 Risk\u2013Poverty data availability for Latin American case studies Annex III \u2013 Databases of Country Studies Country Data for monetary and non-monetary poverty measurements Time Geographic unit Social indicators at geographic unit Years Are there panel surveys?

Migration never happens during \ufb02ood, it happens when river erosion starts. But in Sirajganj, a northern district of the country river erosion and \ufb02ood come together. Most of the northern district is under threat of \ufb02ood. People have to move their homes with their belongings and take shelter on the highland. Continuous increase in water level causes inundation of river beds and marooning thousands of people. Sirajgonj, Bangladesh. July 30, 2007.

The \ufb01rst few days and weeks after the disaster were extraordinary for journalists and broadcasters: it challenged them professionally, personally, ethically and technically. Some of the region\u2019s leading communicators look back at their post-tsunami experiences, drawing insights and lessons.

But they have very di\ufb00erent agendas. Journalists have to access and verify real time information, conform to communication ethics and get their story ahead of the competition. In the information age, disaster managers have to balance their own humanitarian priorities with the need to manage information \ufb02ows and maintain good relations with the media. Five authors o\ufb00er their perspective on how this might be attempted.

A regional brainstorming meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, held on the eve of the Indian Ocean Tsunami\u2019s second anniversary on 21 \u2013 22 December 2006, brought together over 30 leading media professionals, disaster managers and communication specialists from South and Southeast Asia. The discussions and recommendations of this meeting form a key part of this book, which has been compiled in the months that followed, pooling the knowledge, expertise and diverse perspectives of some meeting participants as well as other acknowledged practitioners in media and development spheres. We would like to thank all participants of the Bangkok brainstorming, especially Chin Saik Yoon who co- moderated the meeting with Nalaka Gunawardene. As editors, we relied heavily on all our contributing authors who not only wrote their individual chapters but also responded to our many editorial queries and suggestions. A special word of thanks to those who have provided the diverse array of photographs used to illustrate this book: Drik Picture Library of Bangladesh; Mangala Karunaratne; Pamudi Withanaarachchi; Photoshare service of the Information & Knowledge for Optimal Health (INFO) Project, USA; Reuters AlertNet; and UN Volunteers. Photographs of the Bangkok brainstorming were by Thananuch Sanguansak and Janaka Sri Jayalath. We have given individual photo credit where relevant; others have been drawn from TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c (TVEAP) inhouse image archive. The project has been ably supported at the UNDP by Shahid Akhtar, Programme Co-ordinator of the UNDP Asia Paci\ufb01c Development Information Programme (APDIP) and his team comprising Christine Apikul, James George Chacko and Chanuka Wattegama. Additional support and inputs were received from Pablo Torrealba, Risk Reduction Specialist, UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok. At TVEAP, the project has received programmatic, administrative and coordination support from several colleagues, notably, Wipula Dahanayake, Janaka Sri Jayalath, Geeta Saravanan, Indika Wanniarachchi and Manori Wijesekera. We also wish to thank Mathi Parthipan and his team at BT Options in Colombo for design, layout and production of this book. We acknowledge with gratitude the \ufb01nancial support provided by UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok for both the brainstorming meeting and this book.

A main priority of the Regional Centres is to provide UNDP Country O\ufb03ces in the Asia and the Paci\ufb01c with easy access to knowledge through high quality advisory services based on global applied research and UNDP lessons learnt. The second priority is to build partnerships and promote regional capacity development initiatives, which allow UNDP, governments and other partners to identify, create and share knowledge relevant to solving urgent development challenges. The Regional Centre in Bangkok mainly focuses on support to Democratic Governance, Energy and Environment and Crisis Prevention and Recovery.

Media can be an invaluable conduit to alert communities of impending disasters, to update the situation during a disaster, and to pro\ufb01le real-life stories when the rebuilding begins. Media can bring us up close and personal to the site of the disaster, and show us images as they unfold in real time. Journalists have the power to both inspire positive action as well as ignite fear, depending on the nature and content of the stories they shape. On the second anniversary of the tsunami in December 2006, the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok and TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c organised a meeting on Communicating Disasters: Building on the Tsunami Experience and Responding to Future Challenges. It provided an opportunity for over 30 media professionals, disaster researchers and managers, and development communication specialists from tsunami-a\ufb00ected countries in Asia to take stock of media coverage, personal experiences, issues and lessons learned from the tsunami. The meeting speci\ufb01cally explored the role of media professionals and their use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). They shared incisive lessons and re\ufb02ected on their role during the tsunami and its aftermath. Their experiences helped to shape guidelines for engaging the mass media and ICTs for more e\ufb00ective communication before, during and after disasters. This joint publication of UNDP Asia-Paci\ufb01c Development Information Programme and TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c seeks to capture the essence of the discussions and provide a forward-looking insight into the role of the media in disasters. Their personal observations, and in many cases, dramatic participation in covering the tsunami, o\ufb00er a new perspective on the many facets of journalists\u2019 work. There are certainly great bene\ufb01ts to be reaped if strengthened understanding and common ground can be forged between di\ufb00erent media outlets, government departments and development agencies when disasters strike. This publication is one contribution toward leveraging the reach of the media and ICTs to better inform citizens and save lives. Elizabeth Fong Regional Manager UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok Preface VIII Foreword Disasters have been a favourite element of story tellers over millennia \u2013 and we science \ufb01ction writers have used more than our fair share, sometimes involving calamities beyond our home planet. In my own novels and short stories, I have imagined many and varied disasters that happen at the most inconvenient moments, just when everything is going according to plan. A tsunami arrives towards the end of the story in Childhood\u2019s End (1953). In The Ghost from the Grand Banks (1990), an ambitious plan to raise the Titanic is wrecked by a massive storm in the north Atlantic. And The Songs of Distant Earth (1986) suggested a planetary rescue plan for the ultimate disaster: the end of the world when our Sun explodes. In real life, however, I have been enormously lucky not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when Nature unleashes her fury, or humans bungle matters on their own. But two tragedies that happened 92 years apart have left deep impressions in my mind: they illustrate how communications failures can compound the impact of a disaster. I was born \ufb01ve years after the biggest maritime disaster the world had known: the sinking of the \u2018unsinkable\u2019 HMS Titanic while on her maiden voyage. My home town Minehead, in Somerset, was not more than a couple of hundred kilometres from Southampton, from where the Titanic set o\ufb00.

It was the second wireless operator, Harold Bride, who suggested half-jokingly, \u201cSend SOS -- it\u2019s the new call, and this may be your last chance to send it.\u201d Phillips, who perished in the disaster, then began to intersperse SOS with the traditional CQD call.1 As things turned out, responses to this distress call came too late to save the ship\u2019s 1,500 passengers and crew who perished. A series of unfortunate factors compounded the disaster. The most ironic among them was that the wireless operator on the Californian, located closest to the Titanic, had shut down for the day just 30 minutes before the \ufb01rst distress call was sent out. Had the Californian been listening, it could have responded hours before the Carpathia, the eventual rescue vessel.2 O\ufb03cial enquiries into the disaster also revealed that the wireless operators on the Titanic had, in fact, received alerts from other ships about massive icebergs in the vicinity. But the operators, overworked transmitting private messages of the ship\u2019s wealthy passengers, failed to pass that vital information on to the bridge. The Titanic disaster prompted the shipping community to introduce a 24-hour radio watch on all ships at sea. It also consolidated the role of maritime radio in distress signalling and rescue operations. We can only guess how many thousands of lives at risk have since been saved thanks to timely warnings or distress calls. Communicating Disasters: A Century of Lessons By Sir Arthur C Clarke Communicating Disasters: A Century of Lessons By Sir Arthur C Clarke IX But the absence of a timely warning once again characterised the second disaster to touch my life. Arriving 10 days after my 87th birthday, the Asian Tsunami of December 2004 left a massive trail of destruction in my adopted country Sri Lanka and several other countries bordering the Indian Ocean. (While Colombo, where I live, did not su\ufb00er any damage, two thirds of Sri Lanka\u2019s coastline were battered, killing nearly 40,000 people and causing much damage.) Astonishingly, a full century after the invention of radio, the Tsunami arrived without any public warning. The disaster\u2019s death toll could have been drastically reduced if its occurrence -- already known to scientists -- was disseminated quickly and e\ufb00ectively to millions of coastal dwellers living on its predictable path. Even a half hour\u2019s notice would have allowed people to run away from the coast, and in many a\ufb00ected locations there was just enough time to get to safety. But alas, that didn\u2019t happen -- and tens of thousands perished. It was appalling that our sophisticated local and global communications systems completely failed us that fateful day. The communications satellites that I invented, and the global Internet that one of my stories inspired, could have spread the warning, with the hundreds of radio and television channels across coastal Asia amplifying it. What happened, how and why has been analysed repeatedly since then. It is now known that the failures were human, not technological. To ensure better results next time, we need to achieve an optimum mix of technology, management systems and community preparedness -- not just for tsunamis, but for many other hazards that we live with. We have to remember that delivering credible early warnings to those who are most at risk is both an art and a science. Shortly after the Boxing Day Tsunami, I was reminded that, I had, in fact, written about another tsunami that happened more than 120 years earlier. My \ufb01rst book about Ceylon, The Reefs of Taprobane (1957), contains this description: \u201cOne August day in 1883, the water suddenly started to drain out of Galle harbour.

(An exception was the village of Galbokka, where a retired sailor recognised the tell-tale signs and rushed the entire community to safety.3) Hundreds of men, women and children were killed because they had rushed out to see the spectacle of a suddenly receding sea. TVEAP image archive X Referring to the Krakatoa-inspired tsunami, I had written: \u201cIt was a moment unique in recorded history, and one which will probably never come again. I would have given anything to have been present then with a camera, but would probably have been too terri\ufb01ed to use it.\u201d Well, never say never. On 26 December 2004, many holiday-makers on a\ufb00ected beaches were armed with video cameras, and it was their \u2018amateur\u2019 images that later showed us the full force and fury of the unfolding disaster. Because it was distributed over a large area and occurred during peak holiday season, the Asian Tsunami was probably the most widely \ufb01lmed disaster in history. And we shall never know how many others were consumed by the very waves whose onset they started \ufb01lming. It was hours later that professional journalists and camera crews arrived at the multiple scenes of disaster. Then something remarkable happened. Concerned ordinary people continued to o\ufb00er \ufb01rst hand narratives and personal perspectives to a world anxiously following the unfolding humanitarian crisis. Relief workers, volunteers and other public-spirited individuals turned to the Internet where they kept publishing their own personal web logs. These blogs developed a wide following among those who wanted a counterpoint to the \ufb02eeting coverage -- or helicopter journalism -- coming out in some sections of the mainstream media. In some cases, bloggers went where no news reporters or camera crews could reach, partly because so many locations had been a\ufb00ected. This was not the \ufb01rst disaster that \u2018citizen journalists\u2019 covered, but it marked a turning point in the growing phenomenon enabled by information and communications technologies (ICTs). The post-Tsunami coverage showed that the professional and amateur divide had now blurred; there is a clear (and complementary) role that each can play. The Tsunami also reminded us how disasters can make our information society vulnerable. When electricity and telephone services -- both \ufb01xed and mobile \u2013 went down in the worst a\ufb00ected areas, a century old technology came to the rescue: amateur radio enthusiasts restored the \ufb01rst communication links with the outside world, sometimes using the Morse Code to economise the power of car batteries. Courageous and resourceful \u2018radio hams\u2019 were at the forefront of relief e\ufb00orts in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in India, and Hambantota in Sri Lanka. In those early hours and days, Marconi\u2019s faithful followers helped save lives and allowed a rapid appraisal of damage. As the President of the Radio Society of Sri Lanka remarked, \u201cWhen all else is dead, short wave is alive.\u201d Communicating disasters -- before, during and after they happen -- is fraught with many challenges. Today\u2019s ICT tools enable us to be smart and strategic in gathering and disseminating information. But there is no silver bullet that can \ufb01x everything. We must never forget how even high tech (and high cost) solutions can fail at critical moments. We can, however, contain these risks by addressing the cultural, sociological and human dimensions -- aspects that this book explores in some depth and detail, from the perspective of both media professionals and disaster managers. The lessons of history are clear: if we are not careful, we can easily lull ourselves into the same kind of false con\ufb01dence that doomed the Titanic.

Convened by TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c and UNDP, the meeting brought together 33 leading media professionals, disaster managers and communication specialists from South and Southeast Asia to probe the role of the mass media and communication in times of disaster inspired crises and emergencies. The meeting sought to discern the key communication lessons of the Indian Ocean Tsunami (December 2004), Pakistan earthquake (October 2005) and other recent disasters that impacted the lives of millions of people. It discussed both recent successes and failures in timely communication using a range of information and communication technologies, or ICTs. Early on during the meeting, it became clear that both media practitioners and disaster/development professionals had different attitudes and approaches to managing information before, during and after disasters occur. Some of these arose from a failure to appreciate the different needs and priorities of these two groups. Yet, this division blurred as they agreed on the essential functions of information and communication, and recognised the need to serve the public interest over individual, corporate or agency interests. The meeting agreed that the mass media must evolve their own ethics, guidelines and strategies for covering hazards and disasters, balancing the public's right to know with the right to privacy and human dignity of disaster affected persons. These cannot and should not be imposed from outside. At the same time, greater understanding among media Introduction Nalaka Gunawardene and Frederick Noronha Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 2 practitioners, development professionals and disaster managers on each sector's needs and limitations would engender more sharing and collaboration. The \ufb01nal report of the meeting, presented as Appendix 1 of this book, captures highlights and recommendations of the Bangkok meeting. The discussion on the role of information and communication in disaster situations continues. Media-based communication is vitally necessary, but not suf\ufb01cient, in meeting the multiple information needs of disaster risk reduction and disaster management. Other forms of participatory, non-media communications are needed to create communities that are better prepared and more disaster resilient. The recent spate of trans-boundary mega-disasters in Asia and elsewhere offers a \ufb01rm reminder, if any were needed, of the increasing frequency and intensity of such calamities. Climate change, which the scienti\ufb01c community now acknowledges as already unfolding with far reaching consequences, will only exacerbate our vulnerability to new forms of emergencies at national, regional and planetary levels. This presents formidable challenges to governments, aid agencies, civil society and the media. It calls for more strategic and collaborative approaches in our preparedness and response. It also demands that we think and act beyond the conventional framework of disaster risk reduction to take advantage of new technologies, methodologies and opportunities. Old and new ICTs -- ranging from telephones, radio and television to computers, Internet and mobile devices -- can certainly play a part in responding to these challenges. But success depends less on technologies, and more on policy, institutional and human resource factors. After the Indian Ocean tsunami, Asia realised the inadequacies of existing communications systems and arrangements in relation to hazard warning dissemination. The region that leads the world in many areas of modern communications -- for example, having the world\u2019s largest TV audience and fastest growing Internet and mobile phone markets -- failed to provide any public warning of the disaster.

There were also disturbing anecdotes of other experts who had forewarning about the tsunami but held back from raising the alarm owing to apprehensions about reprisals from restrictive gate- keeping regimes in case disaster did not occur.\"1 The tsunami communication failures inspired much re\ufb02ection in the global humanitarian community. In the World Disaster Report 2005, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) made a strong case for a greater role for information and communication in disaster situations. The report argued: \"Information is a vital form of aid in itself \u2013 but this is not suf\ufb01ciently recognised among humanitarian organisations. Disaster-affected people need information as much as water, food, medicine or shelter. Information can save lives, livelihoods and resources. Information may be the only form of disaster preparedness the most vulnerable can afford. Yet aid organisations focus mainly on gathering information Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 3 for themselves and not enough on exchanging information with the people they aim to support\u2026\u201d2 Asia's recent experiences have shown how governments, civil society and aid agencies mismanage information and communication, aggravating the agony of affected people and wasting limited resources. There is growing recognition on the need for a culture of communication that values proper information management and inclusive information sharing. The 19 chapters in this book explore the different elements and combinations that could help evolve such a culture in Asia, home to more than half of humanity. Our 21 contributors -\u2013 most of them from Asia, and representing media, development or humanitarian sectors -- do not engage in mere theoretical discussions. In 19 chapters of this book, they draw on their rich and varied experience working in either preparing disaster resilient communities or responding to humanitarian emergencies triggered by speci\ufb01c disasters. Some are journalists who have reported on disasters from the 'ground zero'; others are aid workers, public information of\ufb01cials or development professionals who have been at the forefront in emergency responses or are engaged in disaster risk reduction. Diverse as their backgrounds and experiences are, our contributors share a belief in the central role that communication can play before, during and after disasters occur. Within this, they offer a kaleidoscope of perspectives as well as a great deal of practical advice on how to communicate hazards and disasters at inter-personal, inter-agency, inter-sector and public levels. The tools, technologies and methods may vary, but there is a broad consensus that to be effective, communication needs to be two-way, inclusive, participatory and sustained over time. It is not an 'add on' to other development interventions, but an integral component in its own right. This book comes out at a time when both the media industry and the global humanitarian sector are undergoing rapid change. Our contributors are among the 'change agents' leading or consolidating these changes, and thus able to offer insights from the cutting edge in their respective spheres. The proliferation of ICTs has enabled many forms of new media with higher levels of interactivity and audience engagement than is typically possible in newspapers, radio or television. This, in turn, has inspired a movement of citizen journalists who provide independent reporting and analysis on many areas of public interest, including post- disaster situations. It marks the media's return to the grassroots where most stories originate and develop. As Sir Arthur C Clarke, futurist and communication guru who has written a foreword to this book, noted in an essay written in 2005: \"Historically, organised and commercialised mass media have existed only in the past \ufb01ve centuries, since the \ufb01rst newspapers \u2013 as we know them \u2013 emerged in Europe. Before the printing press was invented, all news was local and there were few gatekeepers controlling its \ufb02ow. Having evolved highly centralised systems of media for half a millennium, we are now returning to a second era of mass media -- in the true sense of that term. Blogs, wikis and citizen journalism are all signs of things to come.\"3 The new media tools and platforms provide more opportunities for disaster affected persons to directly voice their concerns, in\ufb02uencing how the mainstream media and humanitarian players react to ground realities. For too long, media professionals and aid Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 4 workers have carried out their professional work with little or no meaningful interaction with the affected people (sometimes called 'victims'). As we \ufb01nd out in this book, the affected people are not only asserting their place in the relevant discussions, but expressing themselves using digital technologies ranging from mobile phones to grassroots radio.

While this book was under compilation, the United Nations Of\ufb01ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) convened the Global Symposium +5 on \u2018Information for Humanitarian Action\u2019 in Geneva, Switzerland, from 22 to 26 October 2007. Representatives from governments, aid agencies, non-governmental organisations, academia, private sector and the media discussed and debated the state of humanitarian communication in the digitally-empowered and media-rich world. Their statement (still in draft as this book went to press in November 2007) attempted to de\ufb01ne a common vision of the central role of information and communication in support of effective humanitarian preparedness, response and recovery. It noted: \"Information [and knowledge] has always been a key element in humanitarian action but recent emergencies and disasters have demonstrated how vital its role is in providing a basis for effective and informed advocacy, decision-making and resource allocation for affected population as well as humanitarian actors. Timely, accurate [and independent/objective/impartial] information is central to saving lives and strengthening recovery; the power lies in its effective management, analysis and application\u2026\"4 What does all this mean to a reporter or aid worker who is thrust into the midst of an unfolding humanitarian emergency, challenging all professional training and norms that work well under 'normal' circumstances? How can a community development worker or school teacher add elements of disaster risk reduction to their regular work, trying to raise awareness and preparedness at the local levels? And how can everyone enhance their capacity to listen, re\ufb02ect and learn -- essential steps in good communication? This book does not claim to provide all the answers, but we hope it has at least raised many pertinent questions. Instead of trying to be comprehensive or de\ufb01nitive, our contributors are being provocative and imaginative. As editors, we have resisted imposing our heavy hand on their diverse styles of expression, allowing a free play and free \ufb02ow of ideas. Thus, the book re\ufb02ects the plurality that is characteristic of both the mass media and wider communication processes. If this comes across as a cacophony as a result, that is as intended. This book is aimed at media professionals, disaster managers, development workers and civil society groups across Asia -\u2013 in short, all who share an interest in using information and communication to create safer societies and communities. We hope the contents of this book challenge and engage them in ways that expand their horizons.

A disaster is usually de\ufb01ned and reported by media as an event. In reality, it is also a process, which means the complete story goes much beyond the deluge of column inches and soundbites about immediate damage, destruction and the must-do anniversary stories. Today, over two years after the tsunami that killed nearly 230,000 people, how much do we really know about the communities and countries it affected? The stories were saleable in the weeks and months after the tsunami. Freelancers fanned out across the region, because disaster makes journalists sit up. But the usual de\ufb01nition of news also means that the media\u2019s attention span is limited. The tsunami slid down the news ladder as the big international camera crews packed up, as the immediacy of the disaster faded. Soon, in the usual news parlance, nothing much new was \u2018happening\u2019. How communities are coping, somehow, often seemed to be less newsy that describing death, or churning out the latest numbers of the dead and injured. Beyond what happened In a global information society where there is a constant race for who delivers the news \ufb01rst, such news undoubtedly \ufb01ll a need -- the need to know. But does reporting on disaster, con\ufb02ict, international politics or other issues, throw up other questions beyond \u2018what happened\u2019? Questions like: What does Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 11 Action IEC Cambodia, TVEAP image archive this mean? How did this happen? How do other communities cope? Are the funds being put to good use? Is the kind of assistance coming in sensitive to different communities\u2019 needs? Which communities are left out from receiving aid and why? These are some of the questions that beg to be delved into, and are the niche for media organisations, whose mission it is to try to look at the bigger picture and put the issues behind the events in context. This is not to say that some are always better than others. It is a way of stressing that \u2018media\u2019 are far from a homogenous crowd, and that different media organizations have different media products, stemming from different assessments of their audiences and mission. How many ways are there to report on a disaster? I use examples from Inter-Press Service (IPS), a development news agency for which I am director for Asia-Paci\ufb01c, to do a post-mortem of sorts in the spirit of sharing the challenges of covering disasters like that of the tsunami and of learning from one another. On 26 December 2004, I was in Manila, the Philippines, for the year-end holidays when the newsbar across the screens of international TV networks began \ufb02ashing reports that \u201cscores\u201d were believed to have been killed by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean. It was, we were told, triggered by an undersea earthquake recorded at up to 9.3 magnitude on the Richter Scale. (This has since been called the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded by a seismograph.) In the following hours, the number kept rising \u2013 \ufb01rst to \u201chundreds\u201d then to \u201cthousands\u201d. Even without much detail and description, it was clear this was quite a different disaster. News desks around the world went into action. The editor for my region was on holidays in Africa. So I was in touch with our regional correspondent, who was then on holidays in Sri Lanka, and also in contact with a regular contributor from Colombo, as well our correspondent in India. We agreed on a few story angles, trying to focus not on what had already been reported and added little to the avalanche of stories out there, but on how, for instance, the effects of the tsunami interplayed with the ethnic tensions in Sri Lanka.

Some articles, such as one from Batticaloa, looked into how the tsunami, which killed over 38,000 people in the South Asian island nation, was bringing temporary rapprochement among ethnic groups that had stayed away from each other despite a three-year cease\ufb01re between the government and Tamil separatist rebels. In a January 2007 story from Sri Lanka, the same contributor, Amantha Perera, follows how rehabilitation is going on some years after the disaster. (\u201cLife is almost normal,\u201d says Mohideen Ajeemaat, whose home has been rebuilt.) But amid such successes, the writer documents the concern that the areas worst-hit by the tsunami, in the north and the east of the island nation, appear to have been grossly neglected at the cost of better rehabilitation and reconstruction in the Sinhala-dominated south, leading to charges of discrimination and political patronage. Stories from near and far Other past IPS stories on the tsunami that complemented straight news reports at the time include one from Geneva, moved the day after the tsunami. It reported how the tsunami showed, once again, the lack of an early warning system for such disasters. Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 12 From Washington was a piece saying that while the world rushed to pour aid to the affected countries, very few were focusing on calculating the long- term economic cost of the tsunami. There were also subsequent articles on how the tsunami highlighted and exacerbated the discrimination that Burmese migrants experienced in Thailand. In retrospect, some stories could have added more to what readers already knew. Some articles contributed from Thailand fell into the trap (and shortcut) of quoting mostly Western tourists who were victims -- and left out local interviewees. This was also signi\ufb01cant, given later complaints, both in media in and out of Thailand, that international reporting appeared to give the impression the lives of foreigners was more than important than that of locals, and that foreigners\u2019 deaths made bigger news. The pressure of deadlines does not make reporting on disasters easy, especially for a development news agency. It was certainly a challenge for news organisations that could not easily send hordes of journalists into other countries or places. But like other media organisations with the same aim of trying to cover the other side or present other angles, the tsunami was also a time to take a second look at how we do the news. It\u2019s not that news agencies like us cannot cover fast-moving news, because we have been doing it for decades. But the difference lies in the creativity and skill in \ufb01nding the relevant, the different angles, the not-so-obvious viewpoints and the ones we might \ufb01nd if we stepped back and scratched the surface a bit more. After all, our news lens was never meant to consist of by-the-second reporting, but contextualised reportage that seeks to help audiences understand and feel the human story behind the event. Certainly, though, there are a lot of media groups that continue to report on the after-effects of the tsunami since 2004, even if the space that these articles and TV material occupy are these days much less than at the height of the disaster. Returning to the scene Our contributions to this effort also include a special series from the tsunami-hit areas in 2005, coordinated by IPS Asia-Paci\ufb01c with the support of ActionAid International. One series, produced by Asian journalists who applied for these reporting slots, was released around the sixth month after the December 2004 disaster. A second one invited applications from journalists from tsunami-affected countries to report on another tsunami-hit nation, to do stories linking the two and learning from each other\u2019s experiences in disaster management and prevention. Issues relating to tsunami-hit areas remain quite de\ufb01nitely in IPS\u2019 regional news priorities. However, more can certainly be done. For instance, this could be achieved by designating speci\ufb01c writers to follow issues around the tsunami as a beat \u2013 not one designed by country or geography, but by issues such as aid and accountability, means of rehabilitation, disaster prevention and management. This conscious effort to stick to the tsunami story \u2013 resisting fully event- driven coverage -- could be one way to ensure intelligent, consistent reporting with a view to coping with disasters and contributing to their prevention in the future. Meantime, the December 2004 tsunami may have ended, but its story continues.

Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 14 As the magnitude of the situation seeped in, I shuttled between TV, computer and cell phone, seeking news, information, ways to help, anything. News there was, aplenty. But nothing about how one could help. I had been exchanging SMSes with Rohit Gupta, founder of an online collaboration project I was part of; it struck us that the best thing we could do would be to collate information, put it all together in one place and tell people about it. Collaboration was the only way to go: no single person could do this. I quickly set up a blog1 on Blogger\u2019s web publishing service; it was free, familiar, permitted multiple contributors, and simple to learn. I put up a post stating our broad intentions, and we began hunting up information, simultaneously inviting bloggers we knew to join us. Dina Mehta, in\ufb02uential blogger and online acquaintance, was one of the \ufb01rst to jump into the effort. Dina and Rohit were contributors on World Changing,2 a highly-regarded blog. They posted there about TsunamiHelp, as we called our blog. One of WC\u2019s members, in turn, tipped off Boing Boing,3 who linked to us. I had mailed Prem Panicker, then Managing Editor at Rediff4 in the US; Rediff\u2019s coverage also immediately began to feature a link to us. From the Sitemeter5 counter I had plugged in, I noticed that from the few hundred initial visitors our mass mailings brought in, we were now getting thousands every hour. By the next day, the New York Times and the Guardian had written about us, and put our URL in their articles, and the BBC\u2019s site linked to us as well, listing us as a reliable resource. Many other news organisations followed suit.6 Google put a (unprecedented) Tsunami Aid link on their home page, and linked to us from their dedicated tsunami page.7 Bloggers and webmasters linked to us by the thousands. Traf\ufb01c, as a result, was overwhelming: over a million visitors in the \ufb01rst eight days. Our mailboxes were bombarded with offers to help, and the team grew rapidly. Adapt, improvise, innovate The group self-organised over email, SMS and instant messengers. An email list8 became the main channel for group communication; instant chats and conferences9 happened via Yahoo! Messenger. From everyone trying to do everything at the same time, the team evolved sets of duties. \u201cJanitors\u201d cleaned up posts; \u201cMonitors\u201d checked information that readers were leaving for us; \u201cLinkers\u201d ensured that data stayed current; a few of us worked out a system for answering questions from the Press; those with the right contacts networked with NGOs and aid agencies. Someone came up with the idea of using Flickr and its tags to help the Missing Persons effort, and quickly set up a Flickr pool.10 Others set up a working-group page that tracked what needed to be done, and who was doing what, on space donated by SocialText.11 Some took charge of creating versions in other languages. A designer corrected my ham-handed initial template, then created a new design, much easier on the eye, that organised the information far more ef\ufb01ciently.12 There was fevered discussion about what exactly we were trying to do. News organisations provided much better hard coverage than we could hope to. Wikinews, in its \ufb01rst real test as a news source, was doing a sterling job of newsgathering via collaboration.13 What was missing was a single repository of information about who needed help at ground zero.

The work-around: split the content into focussed sub-blogs.

Besides, not everyone was wiki-savvy. So, instead of moving to the wiki, we made it a parallel effort. Initially, we were part of Wikinews, but the administrators there had issues with is.16 To end the squabbles, Dina paid to register a domain name, tsunamihelp.info, Rudi Cilibrasi provided server space, and a team of wiki-adepts began categorising and copying content from the blog.

Veteran bloggers, designers, geeks, poets, lawyers, executives, academics, teenagers, foodies, lit-lovers, database wonks, wikians, stay-at-home moms; they put their lives on hold and mailed in information, blogged, commented, wikied, sorted data. Each time we needed something done, someone stepped up with the knowledge and expertise, and just did it. Solutions were improvised, and, somehow, it all worked. We kept each other motivated, encouraging one another to get some sleep, some food, some relaxation, while ignoring similar exhortations directed at ourselves. No one was indispensable -- willing hands took up the slack whenever someone had to leave. Food? Sleep? These were dispensable luxuries. Party invitations were declined without a whimper. People apologised profusely for the time it took to commute between work and home PCs. For those of us who worked independently, it meant non-working (i.e. unpaid) time. The ones holding down jobs juggled everyday tasks with the SEA-EAT effort. I remember pinging our designer about a display problem. \u201cGive me a minute,\u201d she typed, \u201cI just have to tell someone to go away.\u201d She spent an hour painstakingly tweaking the template, and after we were done, I asked, \u201cWho was that you shooed away?\u201d She typed a smiley, and added: \u201cMy boss.\u201d One member excused himself brie\ufb02y just before midnight, December 31.

Another didn\u2019t sleep for several days, fuelled only by rice, coffee and adrenaline. But it wasn\u2019t all good vibrations.

I had begun to think that SEA-EAT was a one- off, but I was relieved to see that when there were a couple of subsequent earthquake scares in the region, many of the team immediately got back in touch and began updating the blog and wiki. Then, on 26 July 2005, Bombay (Mumbai) was hit by 944 mm of rain in one day. The weather people called it a freak storm, a \u201ccloudburst.\u201d Parts of the city stayed \ufb02ooded for days. People were stranded in of\ufb01ces or on the streets. Residents of ground \ufb02oor \ufb02ats found themselves with their possessions unsalvageable. Many lived through days of water-logging, no electricity, phones or -- the irony -- drinking water. In the aftermath, a group of SEA-EAT alumni and friends began to put together two blogs: Cloudburst Mumbai concentrating on information about the current situation, \ufb02ooding, news reports, aid efforts and the like; and Mumbai Help, a resource guide not just for the immediate situation but for future reference as well. (The URLs for these sites, and others mentioned in this section, are at the end of this chapter.) Out of these efforts, an initiative called ThinkMumbai was set up, to look at some of the city\u2019s deep-rooted problems, and to provide some aids for future dif\ufb01cult times. That effort went into a long hiatus, but a few of us plan to revive it. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina smashed into Florida. Several days before that happened, as it became clear that Katrina was likely to hit the coast, some members of the SEA-EAT team had prepared for action. Based on the SEA-EAT experience, the team focussed on a wiki. The site logged a million visitors in two days. Of course that\u2019s largely because this disaster was in the US; internet usage there is of a completely different order of magnitude. The team collaborated on a People Finder and a Shelter Finder, and came up with innovations such as using a Florida Skype18 phone number as a call centre, manned by shifts of volunteers in three continents.

Our campaign got a lot of support across the web. Around the same time, we realised that starting a new blog or wiki each time something bad happened meant establishing credibility and search engine rankings anew. We decided to bring it all under one umbrella, the World Wide Help (WWH) group. We post alerts and warnings to the WWH blog (and, by now, with our links to NGOs, world bodies and relief agencies, we\u2019re able to keep tabs on potential crises pretty ef\ufb01ciently); and if a situation looks like becoming a major disaster, we then look at creating a focused resource. We used the WWH blog during the \ufb02oods in Suriname in May 2006, posting a combination of news reports, translation efforts, on-the-ground reporting, and information from relief organisations. The blog continues to be updated whenever needed. In July 2006, around the time I was writing the original version of this essay, seven bombs went off in Bombay trains during the evening rush hour, killing 181 people, injuring another 890. The city was in chaos; suburban trains, the major commuting artery, stopped running; thus roads were jammed too. As rumours and panic spread, everybody seemed to be trying to call everyone else at the same time. The phone network -- landlines as well as cellular -- were overwhelmed, so huge numbers of people got no information whatsoever, which only fuelled the confusion. Family and friends in other parts of the world frantically trying to make sure their loved ones were safe only added to it. Some of us turned to the web for answers, and MumbaiHelp came back to life, with a \ufb02urry of emails, \ufb01rst-person reports on road conditions, hospital numbers, and more. And, just in case I had begun to think I was becoming a bit of a guru on this online relief thing, the crowd taught me something new. One post, titled \u201cHow can we help you?\u201d got a few hundred comments that night. The comment area became a de facto forum, with worried people leaving names and phone numbers of relatives, and others popping up to make calls, send SMSes and con\ufb01rm that yes, your brother, your friend, your aunt, was indeed safe.

To see how this was possible, one needs only to have a careful look at the time-line of the critical events that occurred on that fateful day. Let us start from the very beginning. At 7.00 am local time on Boxing Day, a large earthquake occurs in the Indian Ocean, near Sumatra, Indonesia. Later, newspapers report that tremors took place within a few minutes in some parts in the island, but the impact was too minor to be taken seriously by a casual observer. Nevertheless, these are recorded at the Pallekele Seismological Station1, in Sri Lanka itself, where sophisticated equipment monitors such events round-the-clock. What is missing though is an of\ufb01cer to have a look at the graphs and tell the rest of the world about the potential danger of the event about to happen in South Asia too in a few hours time. Alas, it is a Sunday following the night of Christmas.2 It is too much to expect a typical government servant to be on duty at that moment. So, the \ufb01rst opportunity to issue an early warning is forever gone. Vital warning Pallekele Seismological Station, of course, is not the only point where this vital information gets recorded. At 7:07 am, the resulting seismic signals make the Hawaii-based Paci\ufb01c Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) trigger an internal alarm that alerts watchstanders located in different regions. At 7:10 am, the PTWC issues another message to observatories in the Paci\ufb01c, with its preliminary earthquake parameters. At 7:14 am local time, the PTWC issues a bulletin providing information on the earthquake, stating that there is no tsunami threat to the Paci\ufb01c nations that participate in the Tsunami Warning System in the Paci\ufb01c (ITSU). India, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives are not part of this Paci\ufb01c-focussed system. At 8:04 am, the PTWC issues bulletin No. 2, revising the earthquake magnitude to 8.5. That bulletin states that there is no tsunami threat to the Paci\ufb01c, but identi\ufb01es the possibility of a tsunami near the epicenter. This means there is a time-gap of 23 minutes before the \ufb01rst waves would eventually strike the east coast of Sri Lanka. If there was to be an island-wide radio broadcast of the warning, time could have well been suf\ufb01cient for local communities to vacate the risky areas. However, in the coastal areas of Sri Lanka there is no warning so no one evacuates one\u2019s house. What happens afterwards is the greatest tragedy. First wave hits At 8.27 am, the \ufb01rst tsunami waves hit the island. The \ufb01rst major town to be hit is Batticaloa, the provincial capital of the Eastern Province, at 8.40 am. Trincomalee, the port-city on the north-east coast, and Hambantota, the town on the south-east coast, are hit within a few minutes of each other, at 8.52 am and 8.55 am, respectively. Areas in the Jaffna peninsula are under water by 9.00 am. At 9.15 Galle, the third largest city in the country on the south-western tip of Sri Lanka, is hit. Areas close to Colombo, on the west coast, are hit between 9.20 and 9.30 am. The undeniable fact is that there had been a nearly 30-minute difference between the time the towns in the east costs and the ones in the west costs were \ufb01rst hit. Statistics tell us that 37 out of every 100 persons in Sri Lanka own telephones, almost 80% of the households have radios, and 71% have televisions.3 Still there were hardly any messages emanating from the east coast to the west, about the impending disaster. When the \ufb01shing communities in the villages TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 23 of the west coast see the 10-meter-high waves coming at them, they have no idea that somebody could have pre-warned them.4 There are other unimaginable tragedies waiting to happen.

They are wrong. The next waves hit the train, carrying it away like a child\u2019s toy. The railway tracks get crumpled like a M\u00f6bius strip. If it can be called a railway accident, this would have been the worst train accident the world had ever witnessed.5 It alone costs more then 2,500 lives. Perhaps many of those lives could have saved if only the engine driver has been given a mobile phone. Is that the end of the story? Sadly, no. Tell-tale signs ignored One key sign of an approaching tsunami, it is better acknowledged now, is the receding of water along the shoreline, exposing areas that are normally always submerged. It has been reported that on 24 December 2004, in some of the coastal areas the water submerged for 1-2 km.6 This had opened the doors of a seemingly-miraculous new world for spectators, in the area. None of them knew of the danger that was about to come. So, when the waves came later, they were not even on the shore where they might have held a tree if they were lucky. They were out there in the sea bed. Many among the 40,000 who lost their lives were spectators of this sort. Most of their bodies were never recovered. Now let me summarize what emerges from the facts above. 1. The monitoring equipment did record the tremors; but by the time someone noticed it, the damage had already been done. 2. Warning messages were issued in time, and most probably might have been available on the Net for even more time. Unfortunately, that never reached the ones who needed it most: the communities at risk. 3. Even when we knew we are hit, we didn\u2019t think it necessary to communicate that information to the rest. 4. We wanted to pass messages to the critical individuals (like the engine drive of that ill-fated train) who however did not have the necessary equipment to receive such messages 5. We had no idea about the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts in the face of a disaster, because nobody had ever educated us on this. So we walked towards the emptied seabed without ever thinking about the impending disaster that was to come our way. Do you see where the gaps are? One, and an important one, was the issue of communication. It had nothing to do with the monitoring of the disaster itself. We had enough indications. What we failed to do was to communicate the right message to the right people, within the required time-frame. Two, the lack of awareness. Even if the message had been passed to the community at the right time, probably they would not have evacuated in time, as they possibly could not have then foreseen the magnitude of the damage to come. This is true for any disaster that happens for the \ufb01rst time. Unfortunately, this sad scenario is not just limited to Sri Lanka. This is exactly what also happened in India, Indonesia and Thailand. In all these countries, costal communities faced the tsunami as a complete surprise. TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 24 Better prepared next time? So what remedies one can suggest so that when the next disaster happens -- which may or may not be a tsunami -- we do not see the same series of events repeated? What exactly is the role that the media can play? Firstly, establishing disaster warning channels is absolutely essential and should take priority among the tasks of any national government: One cartoon widely distributed over the Net in the tsunami aftermath portrayed two scenarios. On the left panel, there were so many satellites, television stations and dish antennas. That was the technology used to beam the horri\ufb01c images of the tragedy to the living rooms of the West. On the right was completely blank. That was the technology used to detect the tsunami and communicate the much-needed warnings. Given the commercial nature of the media and communication industries, it might be too much for any developing country to expect a balance between the left and right panels. However, it might still not be too much for every citizen to expect his or her government to have proper disaster monitoring communication systems set in place. After all, it is a question of life and death, a basic right of any citizen of any country. What can take the priority over that? Channel Advantages What are the challenges?

TVEAP image archive TVEAP image archive Secondly, detection is critical, but without communication, it serves no purpose: No need to elaborate on this, since it is now obvious that what matters is the strength of the weakest link. Failure of communication channel somewhere in the middle -- or perhaps even just an half-hour delay -- is equivalent to having no warning systems at all. A warning delayed is a warning denied.7 Thirdly, when it comes to disaster warning, it should not be a choice of one medium or technology over another: The very reason why there are different modes of communication is because none of them are hundred percent perfect. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. The appropriateness of every channel depends on the environment where they are to be applied. So, the least one expect is a competition of modes and technologies. Depending upon the situation, one should decide what combinations are the best.

A timely telephone call, warning about the impending tsunami, was said to have saved the village\u2019s entire 3,600 inhabitants, as well as those of three neighbouring villages. Nallavadu was involved in the very successful M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation\u2019s Information Village Research Project. 5 According to Wikipedia.org what comes nearest is a train incident happened at Bihar, India in 1981, by a train plunging into Bagmati river killing and estimated number of 800-900, though the o\ufb03cial record was 268 deaths. 6 Uncon\ufb01rmed newspaper reports said that in a place near Unawatuna in the south of Sri Lanka, the manager of a tourist hotel had even witnessed a massive Buddha statue, otherwise submerged, about half a kilometer from the shore. 7 In Sri Lanka, one mobile company started issuing SMS-based warning messages a few hours after the tragedy had happened. These messages continued for a few days, much to the amusement of the users. Fourthly, disaster warning is everyone\u2019s business: Life for most of us would have been easier had the government taken full charge of disaster warnings. Unfortunately, the things do not work that way. These are some of key stakeholders and they have speci\ufb01c roles that they can play: \u2022 The scienti\ufb01c community: Develop the early warning systems based on their expertise, support the design of scienti\ufb01c and systematic monitoring and warning services and translate technical information to layman\u2019s language. \u2022 National governments: Adopt policies and frameworks that facilitate early warning, operate Early Warning Systems, issue warnings for their country in a timely and effective manner. \u2022 Local governments: Analyse and store critical knowledge of the hazards to which the communities are exposed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2292017-669f-4977-a474-607857b7889b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2292017-669f-4977-a474-607857b7889b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11e49521d83df320ff18328589565b2267f6151b106b01f82dec83712b71a390"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e9f339e-6b5c-406e-b31e-d555ee6ceacb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91b82b701b7758eb6a4c1674630376c41db2d6da238db3cf860c0baf27abe406"}}, "hash": "aad5666523c01d2d347f1d22871b336213d280455e0f31864b9b97acdf13b07b", "text": "Provide this information to the national governments \u2022 International bodies: Provide \ufb01nancial and technical support for national early warning activities and foster the exchange of data and knowledge between individual countries. \u2022 Regional institutions and organisations: Provide specialized knowledge and advice in support of national efforts, to develop or sustain operational capabilities experienced by countries that share a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "097f6559-ea60-404a-8ac2-f0f9ad71ff11": {"__data__": {"id_": "097f6559-ea60-404a-8ac2-f0f9ad71ff11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cec1d095243c9f50032be281e82ee526fc54c43e92c06d217fdacb3a629c8ccd"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3d52ea7-8d05-4e58-80ff-2ebe6fd44dc9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "705d7d08c2f14135947ac1480f91c47576181a8df290056581a168ec70653520"}}, "hash": "3ce090439457770bad87bf96e8e7cade91cca94f0807e25b65138b123b01ac9d", "text": "common geographical environment. \u2022 Non-governmental organisations: Play a critical role in raising awareness among individuals and organizations involved in early warning and in the implementation of early warning systems, particularly at the community level. \u2022 The private sector: Play an essential role in implementing the solutions, using their know-how or donations (in-kind or cash) of goods or services, especially for the communication, dissemination and response elements of early warning. \u2022 The media: It has to play an important role in improving the disaster consciousness of the general population, and disseminating early warnings. This can be the critical link between the agency that offer the warning and the recipients. \u2022 Communities: These are central to people-oriented early warning systems. Their input to system-design and their ability to respond ultimately determines the extent of risk associated with natural hazards. Finally, technology matters but people matter more: There is a school of thought that suggests that technology is a panacea every problem humankind faces, be that poverty, a lack of proper healthcare, human rights violations or disasters. Let us not fall into this trap. Technology is important. The sole reason behind the seemingly incredible advancements that have happened in the \ufb01eld of human development is the spurt in the growth of new technology. However without people to handle it properly, the technology per se can achieve little. What we can expect a sophisticate earthquake detecting device to do, if there are no human beings to take note what it indicates? So, while giving technology its due position, let us focus on the people-side of the problems. Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 27 Children of Tsunami: Documenting Asia\u2019s Longest Year Children of Tsunami: Rebuilding the Future was a citizens\u2019 response to largely super\ufb01cial media coverage of the Indian Ocean Tsunami. It tracked on TV, video and web the personal recovery stories of eight a\ufb00ected families in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand for a year after the disaster. In this essay, the originators of the innovative project look back and re\ufb02ect on their experience. Nalaka Gunawardene and Manori Wijesekera (Opposite Page) Indonesia - Yenni lost family members, but treasures who survived Jungle Run Productions, TVEAP image archive For many weeks, Jantakarn Thep-Chuay - - nicknamed Beam -\u2013 did not understand why her father was not coming home. The eight-year-old girl, in Takuapa in Thailand\u2019s southern district of Phang Nga, had last seen him go to work on the morning of 26 December 2004. \u201cOn that Sunday, the day there was a wave, my dad wore his tennis shoes,\u201d she recalls as she gets into his pair of sandals. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t have to do much work -- he just walked around looking after workers.\u201d Beam\u2019s father Sukaroak \u2013- a construction supervisor at a new beach resort in Khao Lak \u2013- was one of thousands of Thais and foreign tourists killed when the Asian Tsunami hit without warning. His body was never found. For months, Beam would draw pictures of her family. These, and family photos of happier times, helped her to slowly come to terms with what happened. The \ufb01rst year was long and hard for the family Sukaroak left behind: Beam, her two-year-old brother Boom, and mother Sumontha, 28. The determined young widow struggled to keep home \ufb01res burning - \u2013 and to keep her troublesome in-laws at bay. As if that were not enough, she also had to engage assorted bureaucracies: even obtaining an of\ufb01cial death certi\ufb01cate for her late husband entailed much effort. Just a few weeks after the disaster, the local authorities approached Sumontha suggesting that she gives away one or both her children for adoption. Apparently a foreigner was interested. She said a \ufb01rm \u2018No\u2019. \u201cHer dad wanted Beam to become an architect.

We documented on TV, video and web the personal recovery stories of eight affected families in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand for a year after the disaster. Our many media products -- distributed on broadcast, narrowcast and online platforms -\u2013 inspired wide ranging public discussion on disaster relief, recovery and rehabilitation. In that process, we were also able to demonstrate that a more engaged, respectful kind of journalism was possible when covering post-disaster situations. Idea born of outrage Children of Tsunami was conceived hurriedly in the \ufb01rst week of January 2005. It was born out of our collective outrage and frustration. The aftermath of the Asian Tsunami was covered exhaustively by the national and international media. We at TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c -- a regionally operating non- pro\ufb01t organisation that uses television and video to communicate development -- felt this coverage focused too much on death and destruction, or on survivors\u2019 misery and suffering. Yes, there was plenty of that in all the many locations affected, but there were also many instances of extraordinary courage, resilience and generosity under duress. These were treated as \u2018soft\u2019 stories, \ufb01lling air time in between main news bulletins that were mostly about deaths or dollars. And this saturation coverage lasted only for a few days. Soon, journalists moved on to other stories, and the tsunami as a news story started going down in the news hierarchy. Yet the story was far from over for those affected. We looked for a way to keep up with the story. We decided to document the gradual recovery process - \u2013 and stay on with many evolving stories long after TV news cameras had left the scene. We realised that the Asian tsunami could be a \u2018test\u2019 for how information and communications technologies (ICTs) can support humanitarian assistance and human development. (The broader de\ufb01nition of ICTs includes television and radio.) We were further inspired by the words of Sir Arthur C Clarke, inventor of the communications satellite, who said shortly after the disaster: \u201cMedia need to move beyond body counts and aid appeals to \ufb01nd lasting, meaningful ways of supporting Asia\u2019s recovery. The real stories of survival and heroism are only just beginning. Let network TV move on to the next big story. I am Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 29 con\ufb01dent that the cyber activists and committed local journalists will keep us informed.\u201d It was this challenge that we took up with Children of Tsunami. A participatory process We chose to cover the four countries that were hardest hit: India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. In each country, we found and commissioned a locally based yet internationally experienced \ufb01lm-maker team who would capture the recovery stories with empathy and authenticity. With their help, we then identi\ufb01ed eight typical families \u2013- two in each country -\u2013 who were affected in one way or another. After obtaining the families\u2019 informed consent, our \ufb01lming started in February 2005. We invited a child in each affected family to guide us through the year, as our \ufb01lm crews returned to them month after month (see Box). We felt that working with children \u2013- even though logistically harder -\u2013 would enable us to tell this complex story in a way that appeals not only to minds but also hearts. In this sense, our story telling approach was very different from the facts-laden documentaries and other media products about the Tsunami and its aftermath. Although we stayed focused on the eight children, we also covered their families and communities. The \ufb01rst year saw some major relief and rebuilding efforts carried out by governments, aid workers and NGOs. Trying to personalise the multitude of statistics, aid pledges and recovery plans, we asked how all this was impacting the eight children, their own families and neighbours. In doing so, we adopted a principle that Mahatma Gandhi had suggested decades ago: \ufb01nd out how a development effort reaches and touches the last man, woman and child.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79983b6d-e755-4adc-b9fe-066db36d548f": {"__data__": {"id_": "79983b6d-e755-4adc-b9fe-066db36d548f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e3797adfc0381ce4efcb5efd14b1cf3c22338c4ea50f014526cdb139e67849f"}, "2": {"node_id": "38aa68c2-73f0-4be0-90ec-cc5f13cb456b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e63735a6148f9ecdf23c1931c0c80e59e7a1d87aaf46105d07e5c7bf4e3031c2"}}, "hash": "68840e6fe6bc0f65ec5a94bf4bea825539b5372b3fa1762cdee1f8b7834ad67f", "text": "Our biggest challenge was not marshalling information, but how we related to the eight survivor families.

And our teams were briefed not to intervene in the aid or recovery efforts by anyone. Meet the Children of Tsunami They have never met each other. Yet they were united \ufb01rst in grief, then in survival. Five girls and three boys, between 8 to 16 years of age, living in eight coastal locations in four countries.

As Asia\u2019s longest year (2005) wore on, our production teams found themselves becoming attached to the families they were \ufb01lming. Sometimes -- acting purely as human beings, not journalists -- they simply had to play good Samaritans: \u2022 On some occasions, our teams found a survivor family close to starvation and bought dry rations or arranged for a cooked meal before any \ufb01lming commenced. \u2022 At other times, when the children appeared restless or aimless, our \ufb01lm teams gifted them a football, kite or another inexpensive toy that later produced hours of joy and cheer. \u2022 In March 2005, our India \ufb01lm crew found Mala's father seriously ill with a lung infection (triggered by his near-drowning during the Tsunami) and his family unable to seek medical attention. When the crew rushed the sick man to a nearby government- run hospital, doctors refused to admit or treat him -- due to his supposedly low caste! It was only when the crew threatened to \ufb01lm the entire episode, and have it broadcast that same day, that medical attention was \ufb01nally provided. Discarding all production plans, our crew stayed with Mala\u2019s family at the hospital through the night and next day to ensure the doctors gave her father the correct medical attention. The family believes that the production team saved her father\u2019s life that day. As commissioners and publishers of Children of Tsunami stories, we had no problems with any of these acts of human kindness. We far preferred journalism with empathy to the cold detachment that journalism schools and textbooks recommended for such situations. (Incidentally, our media- based documentation project did not seek to raise any donations for speci\ufb01c individuals or families. Occasional enquiries for help we received as a result of the media exposure for participating families were duly passed on to local charities best equipped to handle them.)

This was broadcast by TV channels across Asia on the Tsunami\u2019s \ufb01rst anniversary in December 2005, and has since been screened at \ufb01lm festivals and international conferences around the world. \u2022 Children of Tsunami: No More Tears (25 mins) was a shorter version we co-produced with the Singapore-based regional broadcaster Channel News Asia. This too had repeat broadcasts during the \ufb01rst anniversary and afterwards. Signi\ufb01cantly, all material produced under Children of Tsunami was distributed completely free of license fees or royalty to broadcasters, educational institutions and civil society groups. This was consistent with the project\u2019s non-commercial character, with our national \ufb01lm crews donating their services (billing only for logistics), and TV stations across Asia assigning prime time broadcast slots entirely for free. Many stations also versioned our English language documentaries into local languages at their cost. The website continues to archive all these outputs for free public access. Besides public dissemination through different media platforms at regional and global level, Children of Tsunami \ufb01lms were also taken back to the participating families each month while the \ufb01lming was going on. This was part of the engagement we wanted our \ufb01lm teams to maintain. The families saw how their real life story was being told to the world, and also how the other famailies were faring. Highlights and lowlights Children of Tsunami did not set out on a fact- \ufb01nding mission nor did it engage in hard core investigative journalism. We just wanted to document the recovery process of eight affected families over the \ufb01rst year, helping amplify their voices and stories. In that process, we derived some very interesting insights and came across powerful personal testimonies. Taken together, our eight case studies A rare moment of joy for Mala\u2019s sister TVEAP image archive offered an indication of the uneven progress made on the road to tsunami recovery -\u2013 one paved with missed opportunities, broken promises, false starts, donor arrogance, government indifference and political bickering. More encouragingly, we also found, at individual levels, inspiring real life stories of survival, resilience, courage and triumph. Here are a few highlights \u2013 and lowlights \u2013 in the \ufb01rst year of Children of Tsunami: \u2022 What happened to the money? Individuals, groups and governments that donated generously expected that support to help the short-term survival needs as well as long-term recovery needs. While part of this money eventually found its way to those in need, a good deal was dissipated, wasted or pilfered along the way. Rigid government bureaucracies, charity inef\ufb01ciencies, local corruption and favouritism \u2013 among other factors -- made a mockery of donor\u2019s good intentions. Within the same country, we found discriminatory practices that favoured one affected community over another (see box on page 35). \u2022 Governments of the people? Across the four countries, there was wide-spread disillusionment with local and central governments: affected people felt their elected representatives had let them down. Community and religious leaders became more vocal as the year progressed. Some governments Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 32 Thailand - (Top) Having lost both parents, Bao turns bread-winner.

Unaccustomed to living on donations or government rations, and yet unable to raise the capital to restart their livelihoods, most surviving adults were frustrated and bitter. As the year ended, half of our eight families had not bounced back to pre-Tsunami economic activity levels; two were almost destitute. \u2022 Goodbye, school: Tens of thousands of Asian children found their education disrupted -- including some of our featured children. When waves destroyed Theeban\u2019s school in eastern Sri Lanka, he dropped out and soon became an apprentice at a tractor repairing garage. Mala\u2019s school was intact, but her family couldn\u2019t afford to send her to school anymore. Putri, Yenni and Beam had their schools damaged or destroyed but their families managed to keep them in temporary schools. Heshani and Selvam too continued their schooling from temporary shelters. (At 16, Bao had already dropped out of school before the disaster.) \u2022 New roles for survivors: When families were decimated, survivors found new roles and responsibilities thrust upon them. Elder siblings were suddenly bread-winners. Grandparents had to step in to take care of grandchildren. And religious leaders had to play counsellor to thousands of grieving or traumatised people. \u2022 Healing wounded minds: Even though the mismanaged aid effort took care of some physical needs of affected families, there was little external support for their psychological needs. For these, some Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 33 turned to religion. Asia\u2019s many cultural and religious festivals \u2013 when they arrived in their annual cycles \u2013 were low key affairs this year, but provided much needed healing for surviving families. Still, few could answer one question asked by many survivors: why us? \u2022 Salvation for sale? While religions helped many people in their hour of need, other things were happening in the name of religion. The Tsunami\u2019s aftermath attracted thousands of different groups to affected areas. Among them were groups who came offering Christianity as a \u201crelief item\u201d. Families in distress were promised relief or recovery assistance \u2013 if they converted. Two of our eight families came across this phenomenon quite independently \u2013 in places as far apart as India and Thailand. One family (in India) accepted; the other (in Thailand) declined. These and other \ufb01ndings were presented in the two documentaries, supported by visuals and interviews. Although our sample was very small, it nevertheless unearthed or highlighted many disparities in post-Tsunami recovery. By the time our \ufb01lming with the eight families ended in December 2005, only three of our eight families had recovered to some degree of normalcy. The others were still struggling to stay alive and stay together. The families of Theeban (Sri Lanka), Mala (India) and Yenni (Indonesia) were the worst off. Among them, Theeban was to wander aimlessly for nearly two and half years after the disaster before coming upon a fate worse than the Tsunami (see box on page 36). Development impact Children of Tsunami was the most demanding media project that we personally and TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c institutionally have embarked upon.

We did not accept funding from any governments to ensure our editorial independence, and were also careful not to compete with humanitarian charities for post-tsunami funding intended for the a\ufb00ected people\u2019s relief, recovery and rehabilitation.

When the Tsunami triggered massive aid donations, all a\ufb00ected countries pledged to distribute it in a fair, equitable and transparent manner. But as the aid trickled down layers of government and charities, various biases and distortions crept in. The most striking example of disparity came from India. There, we followed the \ufb01rst year recovery of Mala and her family in Kottaikadu village, Tamil Nadu. Even months after the disaster, they had received absolutely no relief or recovery assistance. O\ufb03cially, it was because \u2018no one was killed\u2019 in her village. But the villagers knew the real reason: in the Indian social hierarchy, they occupy the lowest level, known as \u2018Dalits\u2019. That in\ufb02uenced aid distribution by both government agencies and charities. We compared Kottaikadu with its adjoining village of Alambara. Both su\ufb00ered similar damage: people lost their boats and nets, but no one died. Yet the people of Alambara \u2013 who belong to a supposedly higher caste of \ufb01shermen -- received food items, boats and \ufb01shing nets. They are feeling sorry for their neighbouring village. \u201cOn the day of the tsunami we ran over 15 kilometers,\u201d said Kuppuraj, a resident of Alambara. \u201cKottaikadu villagers, who live just 600 meters away\u2026ran with us -- but nobody has helped them to recover.\u201d (Top) India - People in Selvam\u2019s village return to the sea (Bottom) Mala with her neighbours - all step-children of tsunami TVEAP image archive tsunami recovery of affected countries, communities and families. The authentic, sincere testimony of the survivor families was often an eye-opener for policy- makers, diplomats and relief workers, many of who were once or twice removed from the actual ground realities. However, not everyone was convinced of the value of such communication. One senior aid of\ufb01cial asked us how many houses could have been built using the (modest) funds we were spending on our \ufb01lming. This indicated a fundamental lack of understanding of the many roles of communication before, during and after disasters. It is not just a matter of reporting casualties, displacement and relief needs. It goes beyond the publicity for individual agencies involved in disaster management or relief provision. Communicating disasters includes all these -\u2013 plus giving ample opportunity for the directly affected to express their views, even when some of it can be critical of the status quo.

The grandmother watched with mounting dismay how the surviving members of her family struggled to bounce back. The family eventually split up: his father remarried and moved out; Theeban\u2019s two younger brothers were sent to a youth hostel in Ampara, an hour\u2019s bus ride away. In late 2006, Theeban was abducted by an armed group, to be trained as a child soldier. He later escaped, but it is suspected that his abductors tracked him down to \u2018teach him a lesson\u2019. At the time of his untimely death, Theeban and grandmother had been living at the \u2018temporary\u2019 camp for over two years. The odds were stacked too strongly against Theeban. First, he and his family were at \u2018ground zero\u2019 of the tsunami. Within months of that came a resurgence of political violence in eastern Sri Lanka, making it a \u2018double whammy\u2019 for thousands of civilians caught in the cross-\ufb01re. For all of us involved in Children of Tsunami, Theeban\u2019s demise is a death in the family. It is also a grim reminder \u2013 if any were needed \u2013 that man\u2019s inhumanity to man is often more devastating than Nature\u2019s own fury.

Her grandmother in her native Malaysia was among the many a\ufb00ected. Even as she produced television coverage on the disaster, she found herself emotionally involved in the unfolding drama. That reached a new level when she took on executive producing the documentary, Children of Tsunami \u2013 No More Tears for her channel. Joanne Teoh Kheng Yau Video Image, TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 38 I will remember 3 March 2007 with sadness. That day, four gunmen murdered the teenager we had tracked in eastern Sri Lanka for the documentary, Children of Tsunami \u2013 No More Tears. Thillainayagam Theeban was gunned down in front of his grandmother in a tin shed in a temporary shelter in Karaitivu. He had been living there after the Tsunami wrecked his home and killed his mother and baby brother. A child\u2019s murder outrages us. As a sense-maker, I ask the old question. Why do bad things happen to innocent people who have already suffered so much? As a journalist, I learn to move on. I get a unique vantage point on some of the world\u2019s most shattering events as a television news editor with a regional network. The images are indelible. But when a catastrophe hits, no task is more important than to impart the news fast, accurately and fairly. In the crush of facts, it is easy to overlook stories on the margins of the breathless headlines. Stories on disaster boil down essentially to details about individuals and communities. The real stories happen to real people on the side stream. Children of Tsunami enabled quiet, powerful story-telling that is not explosive enough for the mainstream media. It turned the lens on small people to call attention to big issues that demand humane solutions. It returned story-telling to the \ufb01rst force of knowing the world \u2013 the image.

The Children of Tsunami project required the \ufb01lm-makers to immerse in local detail to create a meaningful larger picture. Out of the accounts drawn from four countries with diverse cultures, faiths and geography emerged themes of grace in grief, courage in catastrophe and faith in the future. The children\u2019s testimonies showed remarkable recall for detail. The eye of the camera, un\ufb02inching yet intimate, invited them to gather strength from being heard and understood (see box). Ours perhaps is the most hopeful and the most fearful of eras. Blogs, podcasts, videophones and digital cameras have expanded the space and means available for covering the public interest. Weeks after the Asian Tsunami disaster, the Internet supplanted television as a video platform in disseminating information. Amateur videos shot at ground zero helped the world to experience a disaster in ways not possible just a decade ago. If the Tsunami taught us a lesson in humility, it also tested our humanity. This equal-opportunity catastrophe did not discriminate. It swept away everyone and everything in its path. It orphaned a generation in Asia.

Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 39 The art of interview Children of Tsunami demonstrated the power of quiet, empathetic interviews with disaster a\ufb00ected persons. Fleeting news and current a\ufb00airs journalism rarely bring out the inner feelings of those who are interviewed for a quick soundbyte or two. In contrast, most interviews in Children of Tsunami were conducted in an unhurried setting, where the director and crew slowly slipped into the current reality of the families and engaged in a friendly conversation. That is the only way they could elicit candid, moving insights such as these. Theeban escaped the killer waves but not his human killers. If his life and the tens of thousands of faceless people who died in the tsunami should count for something, we owe it to our children and ourselves to tell their stories. Children of Tsunami \u2013 No More Tears was a baby step on a rough road to ensure that this modern tragedy of almost biblical proportions does not pass without inquiry and memorialisation. \u201cI miss kissing my daddy\u2019s cheek.

Section II Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 45 Capturing Nature\u2019s Fury As disaster survivors sift through what is left of their homes, family photo albums are among the most cherished possessions they seek to recover. Every major disaster produces its own iconic images which determine how the collective memory of the world would remember the incident. Why are snapshots of frozen moments so powerfully evocative to individuals, communities and the world? Shahidul Alam It was many years ago that I met that woman in Shondeep. It was after the cyclone in Bangladesh in 1991. Our helicopter had landed in the damaged airstrip of Patenga airport in Chittagong. There had been no \ufb01re, so why were the leaves all charred? What had happened on that fateful night of 29 April? My questions to the \u2018experts\u2019 resulted in the standard response. The NGO workers told me of the bags of wheat they\u2019d given out. The engineers talked of the torque of the wind. The government of\ufb01cers spoke of the funds they had allocated. Then the woman spoke. In a quiet but controlled voice she recounted, \u2018The land became the sea and the sea became a wave\u2019. It took those words, for me the photographer, to see what had happened that night. Many experts and players The Tsunami had come and gone. While I had felt the pain of the Tsunami victims and their survivors, the predominant media coverage of western tourists and western \u2018experts\u2019 had angered me. As an aid worker and later a photographer after the Tsunami in Sri Lanka, I could relate to the resilience of the victims, but the aid efforts had changed. There were many more \u2018experts\u2019 in the fray and I could see how the media and other major players determined how things panned out. I had arrived after the event. In Trincomalee, the placid water of the ancient tanks gave no sense of the horror on Boxing Day. I then went to Telwatta, on the southern coast, where the train Samudra Devi (\u2018Goddess of the Sea\u2019) had been devoured by the wave. Where the land had become the sea. Shanika, the little girl I\u2019d tried to photograph in the remains of her home, was terri\ufb01ed of the sea. She had lost her twin sister, her two other sisters and her mother to the waters. Priantha, her father, had taken his family to the train for safety, and had watched in horror as the sea moved in. Shanika knew the sea was not to be trusted. She had been with her aunt, and had only heard what had happened. Had she seen the waves? Had she felt the fury? I never found out, but we made friends. The digital camera made it easy to share pictures and we photographed each other and approached the sea together. And she was telling me to be careful. We spoke different languages, but I wanted to know what she felt about the sea. That night after dusk, I went back to the edge of the water, and in that muted light, I tried to see the things Shanika had feared. Where the sea had become a giant wave.

I wanted to go out to Pakistan, but it was different this time. One needed visas, letters of invitation and of\ufb01cial permission. The right time to be there, and capture the unfolding story, came and went. I decided to wait. But as the media predictably moved on, and the people outside affected areas gradually forgot the disaster, the pain gnawed inside of me. As the winter drew near, I worried about what might be happening. My friends in CONCERN, an NGO I had worked for before, were already out there and I decided to join them.

The historic city of Bam, in Iran, had been all but reduced to rubble. The clay bricks, the domed rooftops, and the fact that people were at home sleeping, all led to the huge loss of life. With no light and no electricity, the few that were living could do little to retrieve the dying. Iran is no stranger to earthquakes. Another curious cycle of roughly ten years separates the devastating quakes that have rocked this land. I wasn\u2019t there, but my photographer friends had decided that we would not be allowed to forget this calamity. Over a period of months, they documented the misery, the valour, the strength and the \ufb01ghting spirit of those who survived and remained but refused to give in. The witnesses of our time have ensured that we on the sidelines also bear witness. We later exhibited our work together. Trying to pass on nature\u2019s message. 8 October 2005. Breaking out from the cyclic order of the previous disasters, the quake in Kashmir took on a different form. News \ufb01ltered through slowly. As the death \ufb01gures rose, I remembered how as 3 December 2005: Ballakot city used to be a popular tourist destination, but has been converted to rubble. \u201cThis used to be a city but has now become a graveyard\u201d said Amjad, the driver for CONCERN.

Moving their tables on to the road, a restaurant was serving customers. A solitary telephone, on a rickety table, open to the wind and other elements, was the most popular amenity. People desperately sought news of their loved ones. It was Amjad, the driver, who brought it home as we approached Ballakot. He simply said, \u201cThis was a city. Now it\u2019s a graveyard.\u201d The winter was already setting in when we met a family in a remote mountain near Neelam. Fatema\u2019s husband had been crushed by their falling roof. Her mother in law had been hurled below, survived the fall, but died of a heart attack when she heard of her son\u2019s death. They had not come across the army, government of\ufb01cials or NGOs, but as in Muzaffarabad, they were just getting on with their lives. Their top priority was to rebuild their homes before the snow closed in. The response by ordinary people was overwhelming. Winter came and went. Many survived the bitter chill, but months later, and nearly a year on, much of the talked-about reconstruction had not happened. The pledges seemed to have been forgotten. Return to Kashmir I decided to return. I had worked hurriedly the \ufb01rst time, and felt there were many personal stories that needed to be recorded. Nearly a year after the Kashmir quake, I went back. On the \ufb01rst occasion, I slept in a tent in the garden of the CONCERN of\ufb01ce. This time I stayed indoor. The of\ufb01ce couch became my bed. But nearly a year on, tents were still where most people lived. The after tremors still shook the homes, and even those who had moved back to their houses lived in fear. They would move out to tents at night. They didn\u2019t trust themselves enough to wake up in time and move out in case there was another quake during the night. As we went through the ravaged land, we found people who had suffered many times over. Shabbir and Razia had taken shelter in a tent after their house was destroyed. Their temporary home was washed away by a \ufb02ash \ufb02ood, one of the many after effects of the earthquake. They lost everything that they salvaged after the quake, and some Rs. 17,000 (US$ 282 approx.) that remained of the compensation from government. And they now had a new-born baby to look after.

Now we have nothing, and we must do with nothing, but we are stronger people.\u201d Fazila and her family, con\ufb01ned to a tent in Jalalabad Park in Muzaffarabad, waited for things to get better. Waited with quiet strength. Cluster bombs, warheads, bombs that dig deep before exploding, compete with burning oil wells, toxic spills and nuclear dumping, to shake our fragile earth. Rampant consumer cultures arrogantly shun treaties to curb our destructive habits. In a globalised world where material and human world resources are fodder for exploitation by giant nations and multinational companies, nature in its fury reminds us that our lives are entwined. In the ruins of Telawata, where the fateful train disaster had taken place, I came across a family that had gathered in the wreckage of their home. I wanted to ask them their stories, \ufb01nd out what they had seen, but stopped when I saw them pick up the family album. They sat amidst the rubble and laughed as they turned page after page. Frozen memories I had seen it before. As people rummaged through the ruins of their homes, the \ufb01rst thing they searched for was photographs. Years earlier at a disaster closer to home, I had photographed a group of children amidst the \ufb02oods of 1988. The children insisted on being photographed. As I pressed the shutter, I realised that the boy in the middle was blind. He would never see the photograph he was proudly posing for. Why was it so important for the blind boy to be photographed? Though my entry into photography had been through a happy accident, my choice of becoming a photographer had been a very conscious one. Having felt the power of the image I recognised its ability to move people. The immediacy of an iconic image, its ability to engage with the viewer, its intimacy, the universality of its language, means it is at once a language of the masses, but also the key that can open doors. For both the gatekeepers and the public, the image has a visceral quality that is both raw and delicate. It can move people to laughter and to tears and can touch people at many levels. The iconic image lingers, long after the moment has gone. We are the witnesses of our times and the historians of our ages. We are the collective memories of our
