Both sector-specific and cross-cutting issues of investment, transport logistics, visa facilitation, environment and ecology need to be addressed. Initial efforts could be made in three broad areas. The first is at the subregional level. In addition to certain pairs of countries, such as India-Nepal, India-Sri Lanka and India- Bangladesh where connectivity is good, there are subgroups of countries, such as India-Nepal-Sri Lanka or India-Sri Lanka-Maldives, where there is potential for developing subregional tourist circuits and for promoting transit tourism around those circuits. Some promising subregional tourism themes are nature and adventure tourism involving India, Nepal and Bhutan, and linking Bangladesh with the two Himalayan countries via India; beach and coastal resort tourism involving south India, Maldives and Sri Lanka; religious tourism involving India, Nepal and Sri Lanka for the Buddhist pilgrimage circuit, and India, Pakistan and Maldives for the Muslim circuit. Joint documentation and marketing campaigns at a regional level and better transport connections, special airfares and tour packages would promote travel within the circuit countries. India occupies a central position in developing regional tourism in South Asia, owing to its better connectivity with the other countries, and thus its potential as a source, destination and transit country. This subregional approach would of course need to be supported by efforts to improve transport links, visa facilitation and coordination among national ministries for developing local infrastructure in each of the countries. The second area for cooperation concerns investments. As noted earlier, there is considerable interest among hospitality groups in various countries of the region to invest in other SAARC countries. The countries could provide preferential investment incentives to investors from within SAARC in terms of land acquisition or speedier clearances and approvals for projects. Streamlining of taxes would also be important, as the multiplicity of taxes imposed at various levels presents a burden for investors. Joint ventures with local private sector players or with the host-country government could be encouraged to ensure that local interests are kept in mind, as well as for technology and knowledge transfer to the host country. Cross-border investment facilitation and cooperation would not only help tourism infrastructure development and cross-country learning, but, if targeted properly, it could also complement efforts at developing subregional tourism circuits, as discussed earlier. The third broad area that needs to be pursued is institutional collaboration. This would require not only intergovernmental cooperation across government ministries and 110 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia concerned agencies but also discussions among hospitality groups, industry associations, hospitality management training institutions, tour agencies and even civil society organizations working on tourism, sustainable development and environmental issues in the region. Such broad-based multi-stakeholder forums as well as focus groups need to be formed so that considerations such as environmental sustainability and ecology, soft skills and training, human resources development, regulations, standards and local employment can be taken into account when initiating tourism projects. Institutional cooperation would also be essential for cross-country sharing of best practices and for learning about the success of different models of tourism adopted by countries. The potential human development benefits of regional integration of tourism services in terms of employment creation at various skill levels, helping the development of regional transport infrastructure and poverty alleviation could be considerable. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 111 Access to quality and affordable health care is a prerequisite for development and for attainment of some of the Millennium Development Goals. Health services constitute an integral part of a country\u2019s social infrastructure.. Social sectors such as health care in South Asia present a paradox: While the countries in this region are among the lowest- ranked for human development indicators, including health care indicators, some of them are host to world-class corporate hospitals and telemedicine establishments, competing even in overseas markets. They receive medical tourists from developing and industrialized countries, and attract investments in medical technology. Thus both the highest and lowest standards of health care delivery and services can be found in the region. Health services are considered to be among the most promising sectors for regional cooperation in South Asia. The large regional market provides commercial and collaboration opportunities for companies from within the region and outside in various segments of health care, including pharmaceuticals, clinical trials, telemedicine, hospitals, diagnostics, education and training and medical devices.

This chapter highlights these opportunities and some of the associated challenges. Section 1 of this chapter provides an overview of the basic health indicators and status of health care in each of the countries of South Asia. It outlines the infrastructure and human resource requirements in this sector and thus the segments that offer potential opportunities for regional commercial and collaborative engagement. Section 2 examines the policy trends and regulations in this sector to indicate the extent to which health services have been opened up to private participation and foreign investment. Section 3 discusses the current status of intraregional trade, investment and collaboration in health services. Section 4 outlines some of the challenges to regional cooperation in health services in South Asia, thus providing an indication of what areas of regional cooperation in this sector might be feasible. Section 5 discusses the multilateral and other commitments made by the South Asian countries in health services to emphasize the importance of this sector in their trade with other countries as well as their preparedness for greater liberalization of the sector. The final section summarizes the prospects and challenges in health services in South Asia. 6 1 Status of health care in South Asia The South Asian countries, for the most part, fare very poorly on human development indicators. They are among the lowest-ranked countries in terms of the availability of physical and social infrastructure in the health sector and also for basic health indicators, such as mortality rates. The number of doctors and nurses per capita is much lower than Chapter 6 112 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia the global average in almost all the countries (table 6.1). It is particularly low in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal and is comparable to the global average only in Maldives. There is also a huge gap in terms of hospitals per capita for all the countries except Maldives and Sri Lanka. None of the countries in South Asia meet the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended norms for these parameters. The huge deficit in physical and human resources in the health sector is well illustrated in a CII-McKinsey study (2002) on India\u2019s health sector. The study notes that there is an additional requirement of 750,000 beds in India to meet the growing demand for in-patient services by 2012 and to reach a hospital bed-to-population ratio of 1.9:1,000. An estimated investment of US$24\u201334 billion will be required to develop the appropriate level of infrastructure.

Most of the South Asian countries fall in the bottom half of countries for these social indicators, though there were improvements in all the countries during the 2000\u20132007 period. The poor health indicators are in part a reflection of the low priority given to health care by most of the governments in the region. Health expenditures as a proportion of GDP are low \u2013 at around 3\u20135 percent of GDP \u2013 though this is comparable to those of other developing countries (table 6.2). However, the main difference between most of the countries in South Asia and other developing countries is the small share of government spending in total health care expenditures. This is particularly true of Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, where government spending is a meagre 20\u201330 percent of total health care expenditures, compared with 40\u201350 percent in other developing countries. Private health care expenditure is not only significant but also grew during the 2000\u20132007 period in some of the larger South Asian countries, accounting for around three fourths of total expenditures in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan in 2007. The composition of health care spending in South Asia reflects the growth of private players in health care delivery and also the low priority and inadequate resources devoted to this sector by some of the governments.

The bulk of private spending on health care in South Asia is out-of-pocket, which is indicative of the very low levels of both social and private health insurance coverage. This is broadly comparable to the situation in other developing countries, and it has not changed much over the past few years. In most of the countries in South Asia, access to health care is largely a function of ability to pay (i.e. income level). This dependence on private out-of- pocket spending, when viewed in the context of the poor performance of these countries in terms of social and physical infrastructure parameters, is also indicative of the inequitable distribution of health care and quality of services, with obvious implications for equity and human development outcomes.

Thus, some of the governments in this region are dependent on external funding for capacity-building, health projects and initiatives and technical assistance. Overall, the health status indicators suggest that there is growing private sector involvement in health services in South Asia, and therefore scope for private investment and trade opportunities within the region. The indicators also highlight the need for increased resources for health care, whether internal or external, to overcome infra-structural gaps (e.g. shortage of health care facilities and equipment) in this sector, implying potential opportunities for commercial interests and cooperation in health care in South Asia. They also highlight the commonality of interests within the region in terms of improving basic health indicators, increasing the availability of hospitals, doctors and nurses, and improving Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 115 access to health care and equity in health care delivery. Again, this shows that it would be in the mutual interest of all the countries in the region to collaborate in this sector. 6 2 Health policy trends and reforms It is difficult to obtain a comprehensive picture of the policy trends and reforms in the health sector in South Asia. This is not only due to the wide range of activities and services that constitute this sector but also because of the relatively low priority given to health care in national policies and the lack of an integrated approach to this sector. However, from the scattered information and various vision statements and proposals that are available on health policies and health systems profiles, it is clear that private participation (both domestic and foreign) in health care delivery is being encouraged. Hospitals are considered the most important segment for private participation. Indeed, they have been opened to 100 percent FDI participation in most of the countries (see annex table A1.2). The operating terms and conditions are also very liberal, with full repatriation of profits and income, minimal licensing and registration requirements, and incentives in the form of tax holidays and import allowances in some countries. Also, most countries do not place conditions on the form of participation. Thus, governments in this region appear to be keen to create an environment that is conducive to FDI in this segment. Policy-related information for other segments of the health sector is more difficult to obtain. From what can be gleaned from the literature and from official documents that is pertinent to a discussion on regional opportunities in health services, some of the segments considered important by governments are drugs and pharmaceuticals, medical devices and technology and health insurance. Although pharmaceuticals and medical devices pertain to health care products rather than services, the existing regimes in these segments suggest that there is scope for collaboration and cross-border investment opportunities in related services, such as R&D, clinical trials and testing. Health insurance is directly related to medical tourism, but it tends to be a closed segment. The policy orientation towards pharmaceuticals and medical devices is mixed, with the larger countries having open regimes to attract investments and develop contract manufacturing opportunities.50 The main problem confronting governments is the dual task of financing and providing services. The governments have increasingly abdicated responsibility for delivering services, handing this over to the private sector instead; indeed some governments actively encourage private participation. In recent years, public-private partnerships have been considered to increase the effectiveness of public expenditures on health. Experts and multilateral funding agencies have recommended that the South Asian governments unbundle curative and preventive services and contract out services to private health care providers through competitive processes to improve health outcomes (Bonu and Rani, 2008). 50 Based on official documents in each of the countries. 116 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 6 3 Intraregional trade and collaboration Health care is one sector in which the potential for regional integration and cooperation has been well recognized and also touted from the very beginning. The SAARC Social Charter contains various provisions that pertain to health-related objectives. For instance, one of the general provisions calls for the \u201cpromotion of health as a regional objective\u201d, and for sharing information, capacity-building and a coordinated approach to health-related issues. The general provisions also recognize that the \u201chealth of the population of the countries of the region is closely interlinked and can be sustained only by putting in place coordinated surveillance mechanisms and prevention and management strategies\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fd2cec4-d44a-4f55-b57d-1a338edeb8ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fd2cec4-d44a-4f55-b57d-1a338edeb8ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14bead4f545636966d6620457f87969276d8ad8ab87239a701aaf9426a0b13c0"}}, "hash": "14bead4f545636966d6620457f87969276d8ad8ab87239a701aaf9426a0b13c0", "text": "(SAARC Secretariat, 2009). Article IV of the SAARC Social Charter, which specifically focuses on health issues, states that the member governments will \u201cstrive to protect and promote the health of the population\u201d, in particular \u201caddressing the problems of primary health issues and communicable diseases\u201d. This article also calls for sharing of knowledge and expertise among countries with regard to disease prevention, management and treatment, sharing of capacity for the manufacture of drugs, taking a coordinated stand on issues pertaining to health in international forums and adoption of regional standards on drugs and pharmaceutical products. References in the social charter to inclusive growth, equity, social development, use of ICTs and improved public administration also have a bearing on the provision of health services and health outcomes. It is evident from these explicit and implicit references to health-related goals and outcomes that the member governments share common concerns in this sector and also see considerable scope for cooperation in various aspects of health care. Over the past decade or so, regional initiatives and developments at the level of governments as well as the private sector have created opportunities for regional cooperation in some segments of the health sector, such as cross-border investment in hospitals. Several leading Indian hospitals have entered other markets in the region, mostly through joint ventures with a local partner but also through other arrangements, such as wholly owned subsidiaries and management contracts. A few examples point to the regional potential for cross-border investment. Apollo Hospitals has several investments and management contracts with overseas hospitals, mainly to tap catchment areas from which it receives patients.51 These overseas facilities provide specialized and high-end treatments, such as cardiac surgery, joint replacements and transplants. In the South Asian region, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have been the markets of most interest. Apollo\u2019s first overseas investment was in Colombo where it set up a 350-bed super specialty hospital as a result of the large number of patients who were visiting its hospital in Chennai. Initially, Apollo tried to manage operations and facilitate investment, but as investments from other parties was not forthcoming, it decided to enter 51 Apollo is also considering markets in various countries of West Asia, Central Asia and the Caribbean as well as Fiji, Ghana, Mauritius, Nigeria, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Moreover, it is increasingly weighing the option of managing hospital assets without owning them versus investing and owning those assets. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 117 as the primary investor. Apollo held a 47 percent share in the project, while the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank held a small equity stake and local investors held a 35 percent stake. Apollo\u2019s Colombo facility attracted patients who had earlier sought treatment in Australia, India and Thailand. However, this project was abandoned following a takeover by a Sri Lankan businessman. Recently, the Apollo Group approached the Sri Lankan Government to re-enter that market and is contemplating a majority stake of 51 percent this time.52 Apollo has also taken on an operations management contract for a 330-bed tertiary care hospital in Dhaka in a joint venture with a Bangladeshi partner, STS Holdings, Dhaka. The objective of this project is to cater to the large number of patients who have been travelling to India and other neighbouring countries for treatment. According to newspaper reports, Indian hospitals are increasingly looking to enter Bangladesh through joint ventures and stand-alone entities as a result of that country\u2019s growing market, affluent population and economic stability and the large number of Bangladeshi patients seeking treatment in other countries, such as Thailand. Apollo owes its success in securing some of these overseas projects through competitive bids to the fact that it provides an integrated set of services, including human resource recruitment and management, medical equipment sourcing and reasonable consulting fees (Oberholzer-Gee, Khanna and Knoop, 2007). Likewise, the BM Birla Heart Research Centre based in Kolkata is interested in establishing a presence in Chittagong and Dhaka. It is setting up a hospital in Dhaka and taking over management of a hospital in Chittagong. Similarly, AMRI hospitals, Kolkata is considering setting up a branch in Bangladesh to serve patients who are currently visiting Kolkata and other cities in India for treatment. Cultural and linguistic similarities and geographic proximity make Bangladesh an attractive market for Indian hospitals located in the eastern part of the country. The BM Birla Group is also considering setting up a hospital in Bhutan in response to that country\u2019s dire need for state-of-the-art facilities in health care.

For instance, the Manipal Hospital in Bangalore, India, has a 700-bed hospital in Pokhara (Nepal). It also runs a hospital in Kathmandu University as part of a joint educational programme through which students from Nepal can complete part of their medical studies in India. Recently, the Bhutanese Government expressed interest in investments from Indian hospitals. According to media reports, the Hinduja Group in India is considering setting up a hospital in Sri Lanka, in response to a request from the Sri Lankan Government.53 Growing private equity financing and initial placement offers in health care have also created opportunities for regional investment in the sector. 52 See: www.livemint.com/2008/04/30154503/Apollo-to-invest-Rs-1K-cr-for.html (accessed on 14 September 2009). 53 See: www.thehinduusinessline.com/2005/06/19/stories/2005061900410500.htm (accessed on 14 September 2009). 118 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Another promising segment where private players see commercial opportunities is in medical tourism. Medical travel from other countries in the region that have underdeveloped facilities and lack specialized treatments \u2013 in particular, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and Pakistan \u2013 has been identified as one of the four strategic segments for the promotion of medical tourism by Indian hospitals.54 Such patients would find medical care in India attractive due to cost, quality, cultural and geographic proximity considerations. Manipal Hospital in Bangalore receives patients from over 30 countries, including Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, among the SAARC countries. Apollo Gleneagles hospital in Kolkata receives patients from Bangladesh and Nepal, and Apollo Chennai receives patients from Sri Lanka. Wockhardt Hospitals is a destination for patients from South Asia and other regions. Pakistan is seen as a potential source market for patients seeking high-end treatments at a reasonable cost. There have been several high profile cases of Pakistani children receiving specialized cardiac treatment at Indian hospitals. The Bhutanese Government sends patients to Kolkata and Delhi and pays for their treatment. In view of the encouraging prospects for medical tourism and the growing internal market in India, the Narayana Hurdayalaya hospital in Banglaore is investing 10 billion rupees (about US$222.4 million) over the next three years to set up facilities in Narayana Health City, including separate suites for international patients, to provide specialized care for women and children and for patients with cancer or eye problems. It is targeting patients from the South Asian and other regional markets. Some of these hospitals have already established referral arrangements with hospitals and agents in the source countries and tied up with travel operators to provide an integrated set of services to medical tourists. There is some evidence of telemedicine links between major hospitals in India and establishments in other countries in this region, mainly for teleconsultation and telediagnostic services. Some identified potential opportunities are the remote monitoring of patients in other SAARC countries and telepsychiatry. GE\u2019s subsidiary in Delhi provides telemedicine services to hospitals in Nepal. Wipro is considering setting up a telemedicine centre in Colombo, which would provide front-end services while the back-end reporting would be done by specialists based in India. But overall, telemedicine has still not taken off in the region; it requires more investment in high-end training and use of specialized equipment as well as acceptance of telemedicine as a form of health care delivery within the region. Several government initiatives have also been undertaken in the region to promote cooperation in health care. In view of the common disease profile and afflictions affecting the South Asian countries, regional centres have been identified by the member governments to undertake work on disease control and joint research. For instance, a 54 The other three segments are the Indian diaspora, who tend to return to their home country for medical treatment, countries with rationed health care, such as Canada and the United Kingdom where waiting periods can be long, and the uninsured in markets, such as the United States, who might prefer the low- cost, quality treatment available in India (Obherholze-Gee, Khanna and Knoop, 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8494f6a0-0478-4dee-9925-ce3faef2fc9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8494f6a0-0478-4dee-9925-ce3faef2fc9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa4a4c5187c8e73503a6862021d9fa7708029ebf04a15a310c01f84668d92351"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f8d51b3-e72f-4466-9283-7aed6ed147d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd10d6caae97210691e6b5221e02051e38e45d14605cca9c24c54dfde90bc21b"}}, "hash": "f0e9d4e0384b31d62c15114a2aa7df23c6a88123ce3f527d8b710995876c2bca", "text": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 119 SAARC Tuberculosis Centre was established in Kathmandu in 1992 for the prevention and control of TB in the region and for coordinating the efforts of the national TB control programmes of the member countries.

The SAARC member governments also participate in regional projects with various bilateral and multilateral development agencies, such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and UNAIDS, for capacity-building, research, analysis and technical cooperation. In addition, government discussions at the regional level have considered the need for regional cooperation on traditional systems of medicine to meet the basic health needs of the people. As the South Asian countries share many traditional health practices and have common resources needs, they recognize the utility of exploring complementarities in this area and possibly developing a regional health tourism package. There are some other segments in which opportunities have been identified and initiatives taken or are being considered. For instance, there are regional opportunities for the production, sale, distribution and testing of medical devices. The GE office in Bangalore, which produces medical products, also delivers services to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. According to the company, there is potential for cost-effective, affordable and quality health care solutions in South Asia. There is also some interest in medical education and exchange within the region. For instance, India\u2019s Manipal Group, in collaboration with the Government of Nepal, set up a college and hospital in 1994, where undergraduate training is provided and can be followed up with post-graduate training at Manipal\u2019s centre in India. Other areas that have been discussed at the regional level include cooperation in medical expertise and pharmaceuticals, harmonization of standards and certification procedures, affordable access to pharmaceuticals produced in the region, mental health research and the sharing of information and expertise through regional conferences, seminars, exchange of health professionals and academics and joint research programmes. 6 4 Challenges and constraints Although there is potential for expanding intraregional trade, investment and collaboration in health care, there are challenges at both the government and private sector levels. For example, major private sector players in South Asia, mainly Indian hospitals that have ventured into other SAARC markets or are catering to patients from the rest of the region, see more attractive opportunities in the large domestic health care market than in the regional market. The domestic market in India is growing at an average annual rate of 15\u201320 percent as a result of an increasingly affluent population seeking health care. Therefore, expanding hospital chains within India itself, even in second- and third-tier cities, or setting up integrated health centres, may be a more attractive proposition than catering to the regional market. In addition, there are uncertainties in the political and regulatory environment of other SAARC 120 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia countries that could discourage Indian investors from investing. As discussions with some leading corporate Indian hospitals reveal, the cost of promoting health tourism or setting up investments in other SAARC countries may be too high to warrant a regional focus. This may explain why, despite all the hype about the potential of medical tourism and forays by Indian players in other neighbouring countries, regionalization of health care remains quite limited. As noted by one respondent from a leading Indian hospital, if patients from other SAARC countries are interested in getting treated in India, this would be welcomed, but the hospital would not necessarily invest large amounts in attracting this segment, as there are ample growth opportunities within India. There are also specific challenges that affect the scope for medical tourism and investment initiatives in the health sector within SAARC, such as issues relating to movement of patients, visas, airline connectivity, transfers to hospitals and local support infrastructure. There are also issues of financing and obtaining approval for treatment overseas, which often lead to the use of informal channels for payment and constrain medical tourism. Despite some degree of cultural affinity among the countries, there are problems in catering to patients from other SAARC countries due to linguistic and some cultural differences. More recently, medico- legal cases have been rising with growing awareness in the region of patients\u2019 rights, raising jurisdictional issues over cases of malpractice and insurance coverage. At the government level, the main constraint on expanding medical tourism is the lack of government policy on regional cooperation in this segment. Despite recognition of commonalities among the countries, there has been no effort to develop joint medical tourism products at the regional level. Medical tourism has been seen as an extension of general tourism campaigns, like the Incredible India campaign, through which major hospitals have been linked with tourism, but medical tourism among SAARC countries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f537b580-14b4-49fb-9a6b-c028945a145b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f537b580-14b4-49fb-9a6b-c028945a145b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffacb3b10f281bacb8d92c149f4e5c01a6f29bdcf0ff433d5b27f154561b588a"}}, "hash": "ffacb3b10f281bacb8d92c149f4e5c01a6f29bdcf0ff433d5b27f154561b588a", "text": "is not specifically promoted. There are several challenges to regional investment in health care projects. These relate to managing partnerships with local stakeholders, issues of movement of health care professionals, investment regulations and domestic lobbies in the host country. The experience of the Apollo Group in Colombo illustrates some of these challenges. Its first entry into the Sri Lankan market was not successful. It had invested around 10 crore rupees in its Colombo hospital, but there was a mismatch of expectations between Apollo and its partner \u2013 a problem that is common to joint-venture arrangements (the form taken by most international ventures in hospitals). The Apollo Group had difficulty carrying out its operations with a minority stake and was finally forced to sell its shares to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (which had the largest stake in this venture), following differences with that company over who should own the larger share.55 Apollo\u2019s ventures in Dhaka and Colombo have encountered difficulties over staffing. Indian hospitals, which have been recognized for their quality of infrastructure and professionals, view the standards of local staff as a potential risk to the quality of health care delivery and to the reputation of the corporate brand name. However, staffing of regional establishments 55 Based on discussions with health care industry professionals. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 121 with home-country doctors has not been easy and has not always been well received by the host country. It has proved difficult to relocate doctors and health administrators from India to other markets in the region, with a problem compounded by the shortage of highly qualified health professionals within India. There has also been resistance by professionals in the host countries to the hiring and relocation of Indian doctors. There have been challenges due to ethnicity, such as in Sri Lanka, where patients and local staff may not be comfortable with Indian doctors due to their stand on ethnic issues. In addition, the usual concerns about the safety of investment in politically unstable markets, such as Nepal, repatriation issues, worker discipline and unionization have also hampered investments in health care within the region. For example, recently a Maoist trade union forced an indefinite closure of the Manipal Teaching Hospital, run by the Manipal College of Medical Sciences in Pokhara, Nepal. The All Nepal Health Workers\u2019 Association and Manipal Non-teaching Staff Union closed down all departments except emergency services at the hospital. Such problems had arisen earlier as well, when employees went on strike. Similar constraints also affect the scope for telemedicine within the region, although health academics and practitioners view this segment as promising, especially if linked with medical tourism. As with medical tourism, however, Indian companies, which could potentially set up telemedicine centres in other SAARC markets and provide local services, may not be interested in the region, owing to the large and growing domestic market in India and the low profit margins in the region. There is also opposition to such foreign establishments from domestic lobbies in the host markets, such as the local radiology fraternity and commercial industry bodies. Infrastructure constraints in terms of cost of bandwidth, quality of image delivery, lack of home devices and problems of data security and potential breach of patient confidentiality are also highlighted by practitioners, notwithstanding telecommunications reforms and investment in high-speed bandwidth and encryption by governments.56 Non- acceptance of telemedicine by patients in the region is another constraint. For instance, Apollo had to abort its plan to start a telemedicine link at its hospital in Dhaka because patients were not comfortable with long-distance teleconsultation. There is also a human resources constraint, owing to a shortage of trained specialists even for the domestic market, as mentioned earlier, which makes it difficult for telemedicine providers to focus on the regional market. Overall, telemedicine links within South Asia therefore remain limited. They are mainly confined to a few private enterprises and have not been taken up at the government level, even though there are e-health initiatives and government-subsidized programmes for ICT in health care in most countries in this region. There are other factors as well that constrain regional health care prospects. In particular, delivery of health care services through the movement of professionals depends on recognition of the medical professionals\u2019 qualifications. But so far there is no formal mechanism for such recognition among the SAARC countries, although all the countries have similar regulations to govern the practice of medicine and dentistry and also provide 56 It is still not practical to perform surgeries remotely.

Despite regional consultations and initiatives, discussed earlier, there remains a lack of a regional perspective and of strong intergovernmental efforts to promote regional trade in health care. Overall, while health services present promising regional opportunities, a variety of infrastructural, human resource, regulatory, perception- related, logistical and cultural barriers limit the realization of those opportunities. 6 5 Multilateral and other commitments in health services The health services sector is one of the least committed sectors under GATS. It is covered under two headings: professional services and health and social services. Professional health services pertain to medical and dental services, veterinary services and services provided by midwives, nurses and other health care personnel. Health and social services pertain to hospital services, other human health services and social services. Among the South Asian member countries of the WTO, only India, Nepal and Pakistan have undertaken commit-ments in some aspect of health services, whereas Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka have not scheduled either professional health services or health services infrastructure (see annex table A2.3). It is evident from the summary of schedules and offers that South Asian countries are not very willing to negotiate health services under GATS. Even where this sector has been scheduled, the coverage has been rather limited, mainly relating to hospital services. India has made the most commitments in this sector among the South Asian countries, and its revised offers are a significant improvement on its Uruguay Round (UR) commitments, in that they cover more subsectors and also remove or liberalize limitations initially included in the UR schedule. For instance, several subsectors that were not originally scheduled by India in the UR have been included in the initial or conditional offers, and limitations in the form of foreign equity ceilings have been relaxed in the offers. Pakistan too has improved on its UR commitments by including more subsectors in its offers. Nepal has made mostly full commitments (i.e. no restrictions entered) except in mode 3, where it has set limitations on foreign equity participation and on the form of commercial presence. An examination of these commitments suggests that the South Asian countries view health services as a sector in which market access has to be conditional on meeting certain social obligations, such as bringing in latest technology, ensuring quality services and accountability, and differentiating between health services for public, as opposed to commercial, purposes. Hospital services emerge as an important segment that the South Asian countries are willing to negotiate. All three countries have committed to opening up 57 The Indian Medical Council Act recognizes medical degrees from Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka under the reciprocal arrangement provision, which also means that these other countries recognize medical qualifications from notified Indian colleges and universities. But it is not clear whether there is similar reciprocal recognition of qualifications in dentistry and nursing among the countries. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 123 this segment to foreign participation, albeit to varying degrees. All have inscribed conditions to ensure appropriate, accountable and quality investment in the hospitals segment. There is a general tendency to allow institution-based delivery of services, such as between providers in two countries, rather than direct delivery of services by providers to consumers in the other country, reflecting concerns about consumer protection, accountability and investment. A comparison of these commitments at the multilateral level against the intraregional initiatives and opportunities in health services in South Asia shows that the countries may be more willing to negotiate issues such as investment in hospitals and collaboration among regional health establishments for research and charitable, training and academic exchange purposes at the regional level than at the multilateral level. Moreover, there are no restrictions imposed on medical tourism (consumption abroad of hospital services), which indicates that this is another segment in which there may be a willingness to negotiate on arrangements between medical establishments or common products, such as marketing the region as a medical tourism destination. Several of the bilateral and regional agreements signed by the South Asian countries with countries outside the region include health services.

However, as also mentioned, there are numerous challenges, which, together with the social and commercial objectives of this sector, warrant a regional strategy that adopts a gradual approach. Such an approach could include pilot initiatives and cooperation in selected segments, coupled with specific efforts to tackle some of the aforementioned constraints and to promote regional commercial opportunities and social objectives. There are broadly three segments that could be targeted regionally: commercial opportunities in medical tourism, cross-border investments, and capacity-building and regulatory cooperation. Regional discussions would need to focus on facilitating cross- border investments, particularly in hospitals and, potentially, telemedicine centres; facilitating regional mobility of patients; instituting mechanisms to make the region more attractive as a destination for medical tourism, both within the region and for tourists from other regions; and initiating joint efforts in research, training and capacity-building through tie-ups between selected centres and establishments. 124 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia In the context of medical tourism, it would be important to address insurance and cross- border payment arrangements. For instance, some kind of regional insurance scheme could offer an overseas package for treatment in other countries. Because international insurance premiums are high, an insurance policy could be designed to cover treatment only within the region as a possible mechanism to help promote medical tourism. One leading Indian health practitioner has suggested a regional Medicare system with a transparent schedule of standardized norms, eligibility and rates for different precedures and treatments for each country in the region. Medical tourism in the region would also get a boost if regional insurance companies recognized payments in each other\u2019s markets along with bank-to- bank guarantees. As a first step, Indian insurers could take the lead and only cover treatment in India, with a lower fee structure for medical tourists from the region than for those from outside the region.58 Pilot schemes could be introduced for specialized elective treatments and procedures, which may not be available in the home country of the patient. Some potential segments would be transplant surgery, infertility medicine, joint replacements and treatments for cardiac, eye, dental, urological and gastrointestinal problems. The experience of other regional blocs, such as the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) in Latin America, which has instituted regional payment arrangements to promote medical tourism, could be instructive. In addition to facilitating payments, other issues, such as visas, transport and logistical support in the destination country and follow-up services, would also need to be discussed to promote medical tourism. For instance, visa application procedures for medical tourists need to be streamlined. A 2001 study on Bangladeshi patients travelling to India for treatment found that, due to the more onerous documentation requirements associated with a medical visa, patients often go on a tourist visa and make use of informal channels of payment (Rahman, 2001). This results in an underestimation of the magnitude of medical tourism within the region, as the purpose of travel often is not revealed in the application for a visa. Streamlining documentation requirements and reducing the processing time for visas for medical travel would increase patient mobility. Another issue concerns related support services, such as accommodation, which is subject to high taxes and rents. The multiplicity of taxes and high tax rates can hinder tourism (as highlighted in the tourism chapter); to promote medical tourism, governments could perhaps consider reducing the burden of such levies. It will also be important to adopt an integrated approach to medical tourism, including instituting follow-up facilities in the home country of the patient in the form of stand-alone centres or tie-ups between establishments in the host and home countries for the purpose of pre- and post-treatment consultations, creating telemedicine facilities and relaxing restrictions on cross-border practise by physicians and specialists. Like tourism, tourism for health care could benefit from a coordinated marketing and promotion 58 However, there would be some inherent limitations, as there would be less scope for the insurance companies to increase-prices, and their insurance model would need to be more service delivery oriented, as opposed to revenue-led, given the lower-paying capacity of potential clients in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4414e5ef-d73d-4e9d-a61b-7ac44e64db92": {"__data__": {"id_": "4414e5ef-d73d-4e9d-a61b-7ac44e64db92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5717c6e1b433ff604857cd20c44a6e0c54c6657c6be661bd0a2a0cf2963f6990"}}, "hash": "5717c6e1b433ff604857cd20c44a6e0c54c6657c6be661bd0a2a0cf2963f6990", "text": "this region compared with other regions. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 125 campaign by the countries in South Asia, such as the marketing of specific health tourism products, wellness tourism and alternative treatments. Most of these efforts would have to be initiated by private enterprises with support from governments on matters such as visas, approvals and registration requirements. Governments and private sector players would need to adopt a regional perspective to enable a structured movement of regional patients to identified centres of excellence and better utilization of the specialists and high-end equipment available in the region. As noted earlier, to date such a regional perspective has been lacking, and regional players, particularly those in India, may not have sufficient incentive to focus specifically on the South Asian countries as a target market. Another area that should receive more attention is facilitation of cross-border investments in hospitals and telemedicine establishments. At present, these are constrained by a number of bottlenecks, as mentioned earlier. Investment regulations and approval processes concerning the setting up of hospitals within the region need to be streamlined. Associated restrictions on the movement of doctors from the source country of investment, special registration and approval requirements for foreign doctors and restrictions on their practice need to be relaxed because such conditions affect the ability of the investing hospital to ensure quality service and attract local patients. The mobility of professionals associated with cross-border investment ventures should also be liberalized. Again, private sector initiatives need to be supported by government measures relating to visas, licensing, registration, repatriation of income and profits, and provision of a stable, investor-friendly environment not only in health care but also in general. A more favourable business environment and policies that promote regional integration would be conducive to the creation of regional establishments in the health sector.59 Government-sponsored investments are also worth considering, whereby some of the SAARC member governments could invite investments from leading hospitals in the region and also work out arrangements with the source countries for staffing these establishments.60 Much could be accomplished through intergovernmental dialogue on capacity-building and regulations and the implementation of some already agreed proposals. There is scope for R&D, with multi-centre and multi-country studies focusing on common diseases that afflict the region, lifestyle diseases (such as heart disease and diabetes), new areas such as stem cell research and public health issues. Cross-country teams of researchers could work together, common protocols on research could be developed and data shared and validated. There is also scope for joint initiatives in public health for education, research, training and awareness-raising purposes. For such joint efforts to take place, country- specific evaluations would be needed to identify centres of excellence. Given the dearth 59 According to industry sources in India, there are around ten potential players like Apollo Hospitals that could establish themselves in the regional market. 60 For instance, the Government of Bhutan is interested in having specialists from India work in existing facilities in Bhutan. 126 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia of financial resources for health care in this region, it would be important to involve both public and private enterprises for such joint initiatives through public-private partnership arrangements. Another prerequisite for greater regional cooperation is increased interaction among the medical community and among training institutions and hospitals in the region. Interaction could take the form of conferences, workshops and the exchange of health professionals to enable sharing of knowledge, best practices, latest research, discussions on common problems and objectives in the health sector and dissemination of information regarding regional facilities and services. Such interaction would be critical for removing certain preconceived perceptions that hinder regional trade in health services and for creating common mechanisms for promoting health care within the region. Short-term exchange programmes for doctors and students from research centres and training institutions could facilitate capacity-building in specific domains and provide knowledge about treatments that are not yet available in some of the other countries. Educational and research institutions could also be linked through regional scholarships provided by governments and/or leading hospitals to promote medical studies in the region. Joint training could take place in areas such as nursing and paramedical services. Such initiatives could help overcome the shortage of skilled human resources and problems of quality. There is also need for regulatory cooperation among the SAARC countries on the issues of recognition of qualifications and standards and accreditation of medical establishments. Such efforts towards quality assurance would help in brand building and in marketing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4af5c97-0689-4c19-8385-ca1782238f46": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4af5c97-0689-4c19-8385-ca1782238f46", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2b0a97b88dd570545aac281ce987901ba27257e69e0942e695f8aaae97ae8c8"}}, "hash": "a2b0a97b88dd570545aac281ce987901ba27257e69e0942e695f8aaae97ae8c8", "text": "the region as a destination for medical travellers. It would also facilitate cross-border staffing of hospitals, exchange of students and professionals and regional insurance and payment arrangements for medical tourism. This would require cooperation among professional associations, private players and regulatory bodies. However, standardization of training within the region will not be easy; even within India, which is the dominant SAARC country for health care, there is lack of standardization in medical education. Governments in South Asia could increase cooperation in a number of other areas and enter into public-private partnership arrangements to improve the quality and reach of health care delivery. One such area is the promotion of ICT for health. The Indian Space Research Organization provides satellite connectivity within SAFTA, which could possibly be used by hospitals and training institutions within South Asia to enter into cooperative telemedicine arrangements with government support to provide cross-border health care. Such satellite connectivity would not be constrained by infrastructure and security concerns, unlike broadband delivery. Private telemedicine firms could join such a regional initiative. There is particularly good scope for telemedicine arrangements with some countries in the region, such as Maldives, which, as islands, focus on ICT for development. Another potential area is that of clinical trials. Given the racial diversity and the common diseases and afflictions in the region, the large population base in South Asia provides opportunities for carrying out Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 127 Phase III and IV clinical trials.61 Many of these cooperation efforts in health services would also have implications for trade in health products, such as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. In sum, there is considerable scope for private and government regional initiatives and consultations in the health sector, and the range of measures required is quite wide. These include measures pertaining to investments in physical infrastructure, human resource development, harmonization of standards, streamlining regulatory frameworks, information communication and dissemination, and developing an integrated approach to both social and commercial opportunities in health care. Many synergies can be derived from integration of the different segments, with investments driving medical tourism and vice versa, facilitating management tie-ups and joint ventures, telemedicine possibilities and movement of professionals. Synergies can also result from trade and investment in health sector products, such as medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. Furthermore, the region offers scope for economies of scale and resource pooling in many areas of health care. Although there are many opportunities and the measures required are also fairly evident, there are two major challenges to health services integration. The first is the lack of a regional vision for health care due to the dynamics of the regional market, whereby the main provider market, India, is more focused on the internal market as opposed to the regional market. The second challenge relates to the strained political relations, which are a deterrent to investment flows, to the mobility of patients and health professionals and even to development initiatives in ICT and infrastructure-sharing in the health sector. Regional cooperation in health services offers many potential human development benefits, including improved access to and quality of health care and much-needed investment in infrastructure, training of personnel and improvements in standards. Furthermore, joint initiatives in the form of public-private partnerships and intergovernmental arrangements in areas such as infectious diseases, vaccine and drug development, telemedicine and R&D could help countries in this region deal more effectively with common health concerns. 61 Phase III trials are randomized, controlled multi-centre trials on large patient groups (300\u20133,000 or more depending on the disease/medical condition studied). Phase IV trials, known as a post-marketing surveillance trials, involve safety surveillance (pharmaco-vigilance) and ongoing technical support after a drug receives permission to be sold. 128 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia The costs of non-cooperation in services in South Asia are evident from the analysis in this report. It highlights the potential mutual benefits from enhanced cooperation and increased trade and investment flows in services within the region. There are intraregional opportunities for all kinds of services: infrastructural services, as highlighted by the telecommunication and energy sectors; commercial services, as illustrated by the tourism sector; and social services, as in the health sector. Moreover, these opportunities span all four GATS modes of service delivery. Although only a few representative services have been discussed in this report, similar potential is likely to exist in other services as well, such as education, entertainment and information technology. The analysis also highlights the synergies and complementarities that exist across different modes and services,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7be31a4-2c5f-4076-a1a6-c63680051f30": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7be31a4-2c5f-4076-a1a6-c63680051f30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89c54206985fea37f3bdb05b5f7b019b1b4df13abb3287df65f10bb766f62ff2"}}, "hash": "89c54206985fea37f3bdb05b5f7b019b1b4df13abb3287df65f10bb766f62ff2", "text": "with positive implications for regional integration efforts in general, extending well beyond the services sector. The potential for gains from the integration of services in South Asia arises from a mix of asymmetries, complementarities and commonalities among the countries in this region. Asymmetries and complementarities in size, levels of development, technical and institutional capacity, private enterprise and financial and human resources create scope for resource flows between the countries to leverage these differences or to address existing gaps. At the same time, common objectives and interests stemming from similar infrastructural problems, income levels and regulatory conditions also create scope for cooperation as well as increased trade and investment ties in various services to address common goals of physical and social infrastructure development, employment creation, universal service provision, equity and poverty alleviation. Yet, as the analysis indicates, there has been virtually no progress in the regional integration of services. Very few programmes and projects have been undertaken, although there have been numerous dialogues, working groups and planned initiatives. Even where intergovernmental cooperation has progressed and resulted in successful outcomes, it has been limited to bilateral arrangements, which have been narrow in scope and piecemeal in nature and not part of any long-term integrated strategy for cooperation. Even subregional and plurilateral initiatives have not succeeded in the region, despite support from various development agencies such as the ADB, the World Bank and USAID. Private sector initiatives have made comparatively greater progress, especially in less-regulated sectors such as health care and tourism, which are not dominated by public sector entities. But even here, the engagement has been largely bilateral, limited in scope and not underpinned by any long-term strategy for regional cooperation in these services or by government efforts to create a climate that is conducive to regional investment and trade flows. Given the experience with services in South Asia so far, can SAFAS be expected to make a significant difference to regional integration in this sector? To answer this question, Chapter 7 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 129 attention should be focused on three issues. First, the main drivers of services integration in South Asia should be identified so as to arrive at a well-considered and structured strategy for promoting services trade in the region. Second, the obstacles to intraregional trade in services should be recognized and either overcome or worked around. Third, it is necessary to identify the problems with the approach taken through SAARC thus far, which have prevented the realization of concrete outcomes, so that a more workable and realistic strategy can be formulated for an effective regional integration of services. 7 1 Identifying the drivers of regional integration of services There are four mutually interdependent drivers of services integration in South Asia: infrastructure gaps in the region; the presence of a dynamic private sector; social, cultural and historical ties; and institutional and human resource requirements. Integration of services in South Asia is necessitated by the huge infrastructure gap that exists in service sectors such as telecoms, power, transport, logistics and health care, and the consequent need for financial, managerial and technical resources that are locally relevant and appropriate for local conditions to bridge this gap. In addition, common concerns facing these countries as well as differences in their levels of development, stages of liberalization, private sector maturity and regulatory capabilities create opportunities for regional cooperation in the development and management of infrastructure. The creation of physical and social infrastructure is not only a necessity in all the countries; it also provides an opportunity to align national objectives with regional objectives, such as through the establishment of a regional power grid, cross-border investments in health and educational infrastructure, creation of regional transport corridors and associated road networks and the subregional development of a tourism infrastructure. Integration of services also has the potential to create numerous externalities with regard to employment creation, socio- economic development, trade in goods and overall economic relations in the region. The presence of a dynamic private sector in several of the countries is another important driving force for regional services integration. The private sector, as discussed earlier, has become increasingly important, not only in the traditionally less-regulated services but also in sectors that have been liberalized in recent years. There are now greater opportunities for increased private sector investment in South Asia through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, management and technical tie-ups and even for public-private partnerships across countries. These can be supported by a consortium of private sector companies in particular services and through dialogue among industry associations.

A third driving force is the social, cultural and heritage bonds linking the countries, which can be leveraged to promote commercial and non-commercial relations in services. Sharing of a common history, languages, boundaries and recreational and cultural interests creates 130 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia commercial and non-commercial opportunities in a wide range of services, including tourism, sports, media, entertainment, health care, education, transport and finance. Again, the common national objectives of promoting cultural integration, social cohesion, services exports, investment, employment and diversification of the services sector can be supported through regional integration efforts. A fourth important driver of services integration is the need to address capacity gaps in human resources and institutions, which can best be achieved through regional cooperation. There is a need to develop soft skills and managerial, technical and professional expertise in many services. In addition, regulatory bodies should be established or their functioning improved, and regulatory frameworks need to be designed and adapted to changes in the economic and policy environment, while standards in many services need to be harmonized. There is scope for cross-country learning, transfer of knowledge and best practices, data and information gathering and sharing, and joint studies on services to address both human resource and institutional capacity gaps in the region. Here too, regional efforts can be aligned with national goals of institutional capacity-building and skills development in the services sector. 7 2 Key channels for integrating services In identifying these main drivers of regional integration of services, the key channels become evident. These are mobility of factors of production in the form of financial and human resource flows and mobility of factors of consumption in the form of consumer flows, which are likely to be interdependent. Mobility of both these factors can enable countries to realize economies of scale by harnessing regional endowments and the consumer base. For example, investment inflows coupled with increased consumer mobility in tourism services can enable the smaller countries in the region to develop their tourism infrastructure and cater to the larger domestic market, thus realizing economies of scale in the tourism industry. The prospects of a large regional consumer base can in turn help attract further investment into the sector. Both these channels can also enable countries in the region to specialize in different parts of the value chain in certain services, thus creating scope for intra-industry trade in services and a diversified services export basket. For example, in IT services, lower value-added tasks could be outsourced from the more advanced countries like India to other countries. Such differentiation would be made possible by investments from Indian companies in these other markets, which, in the process, could also expand regional exports of IT and IT-enabled services, thus helping to develop this sector. Investment is perhaps the most important means of fostering regional integration in services. This is evident from the preceding analyses of selected services, in which investment emerges as the main form of intraregional engagement and an important objective in most intergovernmental efforts. Investment has a bearing on all the aforementioned drivers. It is a means of addressing infrastructure gaps, promoting private sector participation, leveraging Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 131 linguistic and cultural affinities and enabling the development of institutional and human resource capacity. For example, increased intraregional investment is critical to realize goals such as the establishment of a regional power grid and exploitation of hydropower resources to promote energy security. Investment, whether public or private or partnership- based, is critical for the development of transport corridors and road networks to facilitate trade in goods. It is required for the establishment and management of health and educational institutions, to improve access to social infrastructure and for the establishment of telecom grids and cable networks within the region to improve connectivity and develop capabilities in related areas like IT. As is evident, the associated benefits are numerous, not only in services but also in other areas. Thus, investment is critical for promoting regional integration in services and also more generally in South Asia. Further, recent liberalization and regulatory reforms of services in the South Asian countries provide a good basis for expanding intraregional investment flows through cross-border participation of the private sector and public-private partnerships in services. Investment flows need to be complemented by intraregional mobility of persons,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3ccfe29-fa38-455c-adb6-db72ecb24cea": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3ccfe29-fa38-455c-adb6-db72ecb24cea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6065b444290a951602ea8924968cfae62ac7094883b86360d510334c7d58a88b"}}, "hash": "6065b444290a951602ea8924968cfae62ac7094883b86360d510334c7d58a88b", "text": "in particular technical and professional persons, and business visitors.62 Likewise, intraregional mobility of consumers is needed to integrate the regional market across a wide range of services, including tourism, education, health care, entertainment, recreation and culture. Such mobility is essential for leveraging the large consumer base that exists in South Asia, and it could help some of the smaller countries in realizing economies of scale that their fragmented domestic markets would not otherwise support. Thus mobility of persons for service delivery and consumption, particularly as linked to investment flows, would be an important element for the successful integration of services. 7 3 Possible approach to integration of services in South Asia It has been said time and again that regional integration has been a failure in South Asia, and there is no reason to expect any better outcome for the services sector. This failure has been blamed mainly on the complex political economy of the region, in particular, the strained relations between the two largest economies, India and Pakistan. But this failure is also due to the approach to integration. There has been a tendency to declare ambitious projects and targets without addressing the fundamental problems relating to the very channels outlined previously for affecting this integration. Action plans, documents and summit declarations have been made without heed to investment regulations, institutional and regulatory capacity or mobility of persons, all of which are essential for actual implementation of those action plans and declarations. 62 Although there is considerable movement of low- and semi-skilled labour, documented and undocumented, within the region (as noted in chapter II), liberalization of movement of this category of workers would not be realistic at the present juncture, given the associated employment, security, welfare and administrative issues involved. 132 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Thus, first and foremost the approach to services integration has to be realistic and phased, focusing more on tangible economic cooperation. There needs to be clear time tables for deliverables over the medium and long terms; without them, discussions on services will remain mere intentions, as in the past. The time table for integration would also need to vary, depending on the services and issues under consideration: some services involving fewer sensitivities or complex regulatory issues, and thus easier to negotiate, could possibly be negotiated first. It will be important to address the fundamental obstacles to services integration. As mentioned earlier, pooling of factor and consumption markets will be the main channel. Hence, regional discussions would need to focus on all the cross-cutting issues that have a bearing on factor and consumer mobility in the region. The most important among these cross-cutting issues are the streamlining of investment regulations, improving the business environment, enhancing institutional and regulatory capacity, ensuring regulatory cooperation and facilitating mobility of persons. Specific initiatives on each of these issues will need to be undertaken at the regional level, and they should be complemented by reforms and policy initiatives at the country level. In the context of investments in the region, one of the main constraints has been procedural and administrative delays, lack of transparency and uncertainties stemming from economic and political instability and policy changes. These should be overcome through regional discussions, specifically focusing on speedier clearance and approval procedures in general, fast-track procedures for regional investors with prior collaboration or expertise in the country or sector, fast-track clearances in identified services that are largely commercial in nature and where there are fewer sensitivities, provision of regular and updated information on the regulatory framework governing investments in different services through government websites and reports, and information on bidding processes and awarding of contracts to ensure transparency. It would also be useful to consider a regional investment treaty to remove existing barriers to investment in the region. Such a treaty would need to address issues of investment facilitation, investor protection, dispute settlement and contract enforcement so as to ensure greater ease, transparency and commitment in regional investments. A common investment framework would help countries to develop investment policies and associated regulations in a coordinated manner, enable harmonization of rules and procedures and mutual recognition of standards and technical specifications in services. In addition, it could address issues relating to tax administration within the region. Similarly, a regional tax treaty among the SAARC member countries, which goes beyond the current agreement on administrative matters, such as exchange of information and assistance in tax collection, is required.63 This agreement needs to be widened to include issues of withholding taxes and taxes on dividends deducted at source, royalties and other", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80e793bc-ab53-4d91-9396-a772f1802b5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "80e793bc-ab53-4d91-9396-a772f1802b5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f86cde23183d6d75f4b317f0f414ca29f038e33043bdc36ecbfcafd496d9b37"}}, "hash": "3f86cde23183d6d75f4b317f0f414ca29f038e33043bdc36ecbfcafd496d9b37", "text": "incomes, as this would greatly 63 Some countries in the region have already concluded double taxation treaties (DTTs). For example, : India has DTTs with Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka but does not have a comprehensive DTT with Pakistan. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 133 benefit companies operating in this region. Energy services, where there are many cross- border projects, would be major beneficiaries. The experience of other regional groups that have such treaties in place could be instructive in framing such an agreement within South Asia. A regional tax treaty, rather than many varying bilateral treaties, would not only be easier to interpret but would also help curb \u201ctreaty shopping\u201d within the region. Clearly, these efforts will need to be complemented by national activity and should be seen by the individual countries as part of an overall drive towards improving their business environment to attract not only regional investors but also investors from outside the region. According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business in South Asia 2007 report, the countries in this region perform poorly on a variety of business environment parameters, including key parameters like business registration, access to credit, investor protection, contract enforcement and licensing policies. With regard to the business environment, only India among the South Asian countries features among the top 10 reformers. Thus, regional efforts to increase transparency and improve the procedures for investment must be made part of national efforts to reform the business climate in each of the countries. Regional efforts will also need to focus on facilitating mobility of persons in the context of delivery and consumption of services. Efforts should be made to streamline visa procedures and requirements for selected categories of persons within the region. If investments are indeed critical to services integration, then mobility of persons associated with investment flows must be given priority in any discussion on labour mobility. In particular, visa procedures and approvals could be simplified and expedited for certain categories of persons, such as business visitors, intra-corporate transferees and professionals and academics with bona fide approved or prospective investment projects, institutional tie-ups and exchange arrangements. Likewise, streamlined processes and speedier approvals could be introduced for special categories of services consumers, such as medical tourists, students and leisure and transit tourists. No doubt, there are security concerns in relaxing visa regulations between some of the countries, but even in these cases, mobility restrictions could be relaxed for specific categories of persons, such as those associated with a commercial presence. Similarly, mobility restrictions could be relaxed for those services that have been identified as high-priority or fast-track sectors. Related issues such as transport connectivity will also need to be addressed, for example by identifying selected bilateral and subregional projects to develop road and rail transport links and joint investments in these projects, signing of \u201copen skies\u201d agreements between countries in the region and developing transit hubs. It is evident that neither investment facilitation nor facilitation of mobility of persons, even on a selective basis, can proceed without institutional and regulatory cooperation in specific services and more generally. As already noted in the context of a regional investment treaty, discussions are required on establishing standards and mutual recognition of those standards. The discussions should involve not only governments but also regulatory bodies, professional associations, industry associations, research institutions and civil society in the region, in order to share information, exchange best practices, collect data, conduct joint 134 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia feasibility and impact analysis studies, identify priority areas for a services agreement, develop soft skills and create regional templates for investment or immigration-related initiatives. Thus a multipronged approach is required, with regional efforts being complemented by national efforts, key issues of investment and mobility of persons being prioritized and related institutional efforts undertaken at various levels. Similarly, a phased and prioritized approach is required with regard to sector coverage, as also noted earlier. It would be useful to first liberalize the least contentious services, such as tourism or IT, in which there are greater chances of success and fewer regulatory complexities that could delay efforts. Pilot projects could be launched in these services, ideally on a plurilateral or subregional basis. For instance, there are initiatives that have already been agreed upon in the tourism sector, such as the Buddhist tourism circuit under the SASEC programme. Similar projects could be identified and implemented on a priority basis, and related issues of mobility, transport connectivity, tourism infrastructure development and investments could be worked", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "084d27e3-4ed6-4a4d-9c13-7f94b1cebac6": {"__data__": {"id_": "084d27e3-4ed6-4a4d-9c13-7f94b1cebac6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b812c3fa4aa76d168db0061d8672b3c31e0d050169150aaa933a15e2bd5cb3f"}}, "hash": "0b812c3fa4aa76d168db0061d8672b3c31e0d050169150aaa933a15e2bd5cb3f", "text": "out. A pilot-based approach in selected services that goes beyond bilateral arrangements could provide the much-needed confidence and practical experience necessary for subsequently engaging in larger and more complex regional projects, such as in energy or telecom services. Successful outcomes in some areas could also have a positive demonstration effect for other services and could provide the impetus for launching initiatives in other areas. A similar phased and prioritized approach could be taken with country participation in discussions on services. It may be useful to proceed on issues as well as sectors and subsectors where there is a minimum core group of three or more member countries that are interested in participating, as it may not be practical to wait for buy-in from all the countries in this region. This group could be expanded over time as the smaller group of countries begins to realize benefits through a process of learning by doing. Attempts could also be made to build on existing bilateral agreements and other plurilateral agreements already concluded among some of the countries in the region (such as BIMSTEC) as a basis for negotiations under SAFAS. 7 4 Possible architecture of a regional agreement and negotiating modalities For scheduling and regional commitments, the approach outlined and the key channels for affecting integration of services will need to be kept in mind. The GATS scheduling framework, with sectoral and horizontal schedules and a positive list approach, could be adopted. In line with the need for a phased approach to integration of services, scheduling should be progressive. While there should be substantial sectoral coverage under SAFAS, initial scheduling could be limited to a few agreed services identified as high priority for fast- track negotiations within the region. However, countries could always schedule additional services that extend beyond this agreed list even in the initial stages. Ideally, market access commitments should reflect existing policies, thus binding in the prevailing regulatory and policy environment and, where possible, going beyond by providing more favourable Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 135 conditions at the regional level. But at a minimum, they should be GATS-plus. Discriminatory measures should be removed as far as possible, unless there are clearly specified grounds for imposing such measures, such as national security, consumer protection or availability of government subsidies and other incentives for social and developmental reasons. Special and differential treatment should be provided for the least developed countries (LDCs) in the region, by allowing them longer implementation periods for their commitments or narrower coverage of sectors and subsectors in the scheduling process. It may not be useful to encourage special and differential treatment in terms of maintaining more restrictions against the commitments made, as this would negate many of the potential benefits of scheduling a sector, especially for the LDCs, which stand to gain from increased investment flows from other countries in the region. Investment, mobility of persons, government procurement, subsidies, taxes and other cross-cutting issues would also need to be addressed in the horizontal commitment schedules. To make progress on some of the more contentious issues, such as movement of persons, it may be worth considering a request-and-offer approach to liberalizing temporary movement for select categories of service providers or professionals in specific disciplines. This could also apply to horizontal market access commitments for investment and government procurement policies, where procedural issues could be simplified and inscribed for specified services, and streamlined institutional provisions could be incorporated into the schedules. Overall, the architecture of the regional agreement on services needs to be flexible and incremental but at the same time have mechanisms to ensure commitment to the regional liberalization process. In particular, the agreement must include provisions for transparency, safeguard measures and review mechanisms. Because lack of transparency and uncertainty about the policy environment have been identified as major obstacles to regional trade and investment in services, SAFAS should contain transparency provisions, which require the countries to provide information on current rules and regulations as well as prior information on proposed changes to these policies. There must also be built- in mechanisms to undertake periodic reviews of commitments and their implementation status to encourage compliance and progressive liberalization. Safeguard measures are also necessary to provide some cushion to countries in case of emergencies, which may necessitate temporary withdrawal of certain commitments. 7 5 Necessary steps for integration There are four critical steps that are prerequisites for successful regional integration in services in South Asia.

The first step is to improve information about services, not only in individual member countries but also with regard to bilateral trade and investment flows with other South 136 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Asian countries, to enable a more informed view about the services sector and the scope for regional integration. Only a proper understanding of the significance and nature of services in bilateral relations and the barriers to trade and investment flows in individual services and markets can enable meaningful negotiations and the framing of a suitable architecture for the proposed agreement. A second step would be to undertake more regional discussions on regulatory and institutional issues so as to facilitate cross-country learning in the development of regulatory frameworks and enable an eventual move towards greater harmonization of standards in the region. Such discussions would also be necessary for reaching agreements on such issues as visas and taxes. All of this would form the basis for greater labour and capital mobility within the region, which, as discussed earlier, would be the critical modes for services delivery across a range of services. A third step, which would need to underpin much of the regional efforts in services (and also in goods), would be the development of regional transport services infrastructure and trade facilitation measures in the region. Their importance is well recognized within SAARC in the context of trade in goods, but they also need to be underscored as necessary for promoting movement of consumers, service providers, investors and business visitors, which are all integral to trade and investment flows in services. Improved air and land connectivity within the region and transit agreements among groups of countries could greatly facilitate the regional integration of services, supported of course by regulatory cooperation on taxes, investment, standards, visas and the other cross-cutting issues discussed earlier. A final critical step would be to engage in capacity-building efforts regionally. This would take the form of joint R&D activities, joint projects in selected services such as health care, environment, education, renewable energy and tourism (as highlighted in several of the sector chapters), regional training and development of human resources, sharing and exchange of ideas and information and sharing of best practices. Such efforts may also enable the countries in this region to arrive at common positions with regard to energy, environment and health care services and to adopt a unified position in other negotiating forums. 7 6 Political economy challenges: Some concluding thoughts Various strategies and approaches to regional integration of services in South Asia have been outlined, but the single biggest challenge to such integration, and for that matter overall integration, is the complex political economy of this region. Whatever has been proposed as the way forward cannot be de-linked from the political economy realities. Political problems cut across all the areas that have been identified as critical prerequisites for successful integration of services under SATIS. For instance, the economic agenda of improving the mobility of service providers and people within the region or improving land connectivity and developing transport corridors or engaging in energy trade cannot be insulated from these political realities. Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia 137 There are two fundamental problems of political economy that would impede progress in services integration in South Asia. The first is internal to most of the SAARC member countries and concerns the political instability and fragility that characterizes many of them. Several governments in the region are or have been faced with internal conflicts on ethnic, religious and/or social grounds, which threaten their stability and their ability to implement institutional, structural and regulatory reforms as well as to make necessary investments in social and physical infrastructure with long-term objectives in mind. Yet these are prerequisites for regional integration. Weak governments and lack of internal social and political cohesion also make it difficult to invest in cooperation and relation-building efforts with other countries in the region. The second fundamental problem is the structural and geopolitical asymmetry of the countries of South Asia. Although the large differences in endowments, economic size, trade baskets and strategic importance of these countries create scope for complementarities in terms of trade and investment flows, they pose challenges with regard to the distribution of benefits from regional integration; they also give rise to differing strategic interests. As pointed out, India dominates in terms of the rate of growth of its services", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4c67697-b446-4123-8843-f21d6e9a9312": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4c67697-b446-4123-8843-f21d6e9a9312", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia: Trade, investment and development issues", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edc5d2a87728873d762f1cf78cb34a26703564b5b1b07707608544f5cc4bcba5"}, "3": {"node_id": "242e865f-48d6-4353-8bcf-996b063d5b5e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/prospects-services-agreement-south-asia-trade-investment-and-development-issues", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85c9cb4581e874a4c4f18738f44c0989cc8c0486aa1e0b0b3919e261aa116dcc"}}, "hash": "311acabebf9babcb2c227ff7681ef33a3ae02c2519d8f6f2dcbbfa5589a6f331", "text": "sector and its trade and investment flows, competitiveness trends and overall significance of services. Any services agreement is bound to reflect these asymmetries. Thus the architecture of any regional services agreement and the negotiating modalities would need to take into account these asymmetries by granting special and differential treatment to the less-developed countries of the region. Such treatment should allow them to trade off concessions against benefits in other sectors or through cooperation on issues of common interest and through a flexible, incremental negotiating approach to ensure an equitable distribution of benefits and adjustment costs. A regional services agreement should not lead to increased dependence of the smaller countries in South Asia on the larger countries as export markets and sources of investment; rather it should be designed to help them develop their capacity for delivering a wider range of services. Overall, South Asian integration is constrained by the strong divisions that exist within and among some of the members. Hence, intergovernmental efforts alone are unlikely to result in substantive outcomes; parallel efforts involving industry, civil society and academia through continual dialogue and institutional cooperation at various levels are essential to build confidence, remove distrust and develop the will to proceed with regional integration in the long run. Regional integration of services could bring significant developmental and poverty-alleviation benefits to the member countries. These range from improvements in physical infrastructure, accumulation of human capital, employment creation, increased foreign exchange earnings, diversification of services trade and output, better access to technology and improved accessibility and quality of services, among others. These benefits will need to be highlighted to counter any political opposition to the regional integration of services. 138 Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Prospects for a services agreement in South Asia Asian Development Bank, Bhutan, in ADB Development Outlook 2006: Economic Trends and Prospects in Developing Asia, Manila, 2006, available at: http://www.adb.org/documents/books ado/2006/bhu.aspS.

Foreword In May 2008, the United Nations Development Programme Regional Centre in Colombo (UNDP RCC) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) launched a Seven Point Agenda under their Campaign to end Hunger in the Asia Pacific region. One key agenda point is the rebuilding of international food policy architecture in order to achieve a fairer outcome for the world\u2019s poor and hungry. The world produces more than enough food to feed all its people. As far back as in 1980, the Brandt Commission noted that \u201cmankind has never before had such ample technical and financial resources for coping with hunger and poverty\u201d. The existence of so many hungry nearly three decades later, therefore, suggests a massive market failure and lack of a necessary collective will to address the immense task at hand. The UNDP RCC and FAO recognize that any new or improved global food architecture must take into account the differing interests and needs of all world regions. However, this pa- per is focused on the effects of international food policy on the Asia Pacific region, in rec- ognition of the fact that 61% of the world\u2019s hungry live in this region. This paper prepared by the UNDP RCC, forms one of a series of Hunger Briefing Papers, aimed at policy makers and other opinion formers, who may not have an academic re- search background in areas related to hunger. As such, it aims to synthesise and analyse thinking on the issue of international food policy architecture in an easily intelligible form, in order to facilitate the formulation of appropriate policy responses. The paper concludes that current international food policy architecture does not deliver for the world\u2019s poor, particularly small farmers in the Asia Pacific region. This is in large part due to distortions in patterns of trade in food products, due to the historical legacy, and re- sidual existence, of developed country subsidy, combined with the neglect of developing country agriculture by both developing countries themselves and international donors. Moreover, international food policy has been approached as primarily a trade issue, rather than considering the broader elements of food production, including climate change. The paper also concludes that food cannot be treated in the same manner as other traded com- modities because of the human right to food, and the human impact of adjustment shocks. Additionally, imperfections in agricultural markets make price transmission mechanisms ineffective, especially for small farmers. The paper calls for the rebuilding of international food policy architecture to provide a fairer deal for Asia\u2019s poor and hungry.

The paper, in particular, focuses on the impact of this architecture on hunger1 in the Asia Pacific region. It approaches the topic of food policy architecture first by exploring why patterns of agricultural production do not seem to match with likely comparative advantage of major producers. The paper then investigates how efficiently the market for food products work, particularly in the transmission of price signals and examines the structural issues which underpin global agricultural trade and its linkages with food insecurity and hunger. The paper then concludes with recommendations on how to address the biggest failings of the current international food architecture: market distortions and failures; underinvestment in agriculture in developing countries; and the failure to recognize the cross cutting nature of food production. It concludes that the existence of so many living in hunger is a human rights failure, which it is the international community\u2019s responsibility to resolve. 1 Unless otherwise stated, hunger is measured in terms of prevalence in the population of undernourished as defined by the Global Hunger Index designed by IFPRI (2007) and based on three equally weighted indicators: the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population; the prevalence of underweight in children under the age of five and the under-five mortality rate. (these are also official MDG indicators) 1 The liberalization of trade has been pursued by developing and developed countries alike as a route to faster rates of growth for over half a decade. Economic growth has indeed accelerated for many WTO members. Fuelled by exports of manufactured goods, and (in- creasingly) services, the Asia Pacific region has grown at a phenomenal rate. In 2008, it was the world\u2019s fastest growing regional economy, sustaining an average growth rate of 7.4% in East Asia and 5.9% in South Asia. Today, fewer people in the Region are living in absolute poverty: only DPRK has failed to reduce the number of people living on less than US$1 per day since the Millennium Development Goals were announced. Yet, trade liberalization has done little to ease the plight of some 500 million people in the Re- gion who continue to live in hunger2. Most of these people are the rural poor, small scale agricultural producers. The benefits accruing from growing markets for exported manufactured goods have been remarkably concentrated in coastal manu- facturing centres3. Although poor farmers should have benefited from increased con- sumption by richer urban workers, this trickle down effect has been limited. Many analysts have noted the linkages between increased trade liberalization in agriculture and poverty reduction (thereby leading to increased food security and reduced hunger) in rural areas. Following this line of reasoning, the incorpo- ration of trade in agricultural products into the world trading system in 1995 (see below) was hoped by many to provide rural workers in poorer countries with the chance to raise their incomes through capturing export mar- kets, and lift themselves out of poverty and hunger.

See FAO n.d. In reality, however, these hoped-for gains have not materialized, partly as a result of low national investment in agriculture and rural livelihoods, but also because of high levels of remaining domestic subsidies and other trade distorting measures. World pric- es in staples such as rice, wheat and corn have been low from around 1995 to 2002. On the import side, these factors together with the lowering of trade barriers and lack of WTO compatible protective mechanisms, seem to have contributed instead to the in- creased vulnerability of countries to disrup- tive import surges in agricultural products.4 Farmers in many developing countries have found it difficult to compete with cheap im- ports, and have seen their incomes fall as a result.

In In- donesia, for instance, following a combina- tion of factors, including adoption of trade liberalization measures and dismantling of domestic protection and subsidies in the rice sector post 1995, the livelihoods and food security of the small farmers was badly affected.5 Women tend to be particularly hard hit by failing agricultural sector and poor food security, for several reasons.6 Most women who are involved in agricul- ture, tend to be landless workers7. Studies show that even when women own farm land, these lands are generally in small frag- mented plots and are of poor quality. This denies them access to institutional credit and public support programmes. Farming in these lands is done primarily for self- consumption and a very small portion of their output is either sold in the market or exported. As a result, even if trade liberal- ization does indeed unlock export oppor- tunities, it is unlikely that these farmers will have the ability to take advantage of such opportunities. 3 On the other hand, trade liberalization and associated domestic reforms can multiply the problems of small farmers, especially women farmers. With the WTO setting limits on subsidy levels in developing countries and associated liberalization measures, the farm- ing communities in developing countries are facing the spectre of increasing prices of in- puts such as fertilizer, water and electricity. This is expected to push up the production costs for farmers. To make the situation more complex, removal of import restrictions is likely to open the gates to imports of a num- ber of commodities, making them vulnerable to global volatility. Small farmers, especially women farmers, tend to be excluded from the emerging globalized food economy. Histori- cal constraints work against women adopt- ing new technologies and their participation in marketing channels higher upstream. Pre- liminary trends show that smaller farmers in developing countries are selling off farms, leading to land concentration and commer- cialization of agriculture.8 Emergence of con- tract farming has in a limited sense opened up employment opportunities for women and children, primarily on account of their lower wage requirements but has been at the cost of exposing them to harsh working conditions.9 With the recent rise in global food and fuel prices, net food consumers among both ur- ban and rural poor have struggled to buy enough food to meet their basic needs. As per provisional FAO estimates, the number of undernourished people in 2007 increased by 75 million globally, out of which 41 million are in Asia Pacific. Much of this increase in hunger has been attributed to high food prices. The FAO report also notes that through the end 2007, the progress of reducing the proportion of hungry people in the developing world has been re- versed by 17%, to about the same level as a decade ago10. In theory, these price rises should be good news for food producers, heavily represented among the most poor and hungry in Asia, especially if the price rise of agriculture inputs does not increase proportionately. However, even if the production costs do not offset the benefits of food price rise, the increased profits from exports tend to exclude in most cases small scale farmers who are unlikely to produce significant mar- ketable surpluses and are not linked well with the markets. For the small farmers to benefit from increased prices a number of comple- mentary policies need to be put in place, namely, transmission of price signals to small farmers, overhauling agriculture extension and research services and enhancing access and utilization by small farmers, improving connectivity to markets and providing reli- able irrigation systems. Cash Crops, Price Volatility and Food Security in India Higher returns from some export oriented cash crops like tobacco and sunflower have lured even smaller farms to undertake cash crop cultiva- tion at the expense of traditional crops, including foodgrains. This is a risky move because these farmers are now totally dependent upon the revenue from the cash crops even for their domestic consumption. International prices for cash crops are volatile and they fluctuate wildly from year to year. Every now and then, low prices of these commodities lead to heavy losses for farmers. For farmers who do not maintain a cushion of self-pro- duced foodgrains to support them, such losses can create huge food se- curity problems. Also, these farmers get into severe debt traps because of this problem. In South India, there have been numerous cases of farmers\u2019 suicides because of this reason. Estimates indicate that since 1997, more than 25,000 farmers have committed suicide in India and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b363b2ca-a727-42c2-8ade-7d71449c3938": {"__data__": {"id_": "b363b2ca-a727-42c2-8ade-7d71449c3938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c944ac85eb8c5c120b8c00ea06b0ee1a2471e2da1bcd86a5702f6c079bd12a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d4e0145-8569-46c0-869e-8ac3249c52b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c93fc87e3523d53c78c9bf261aa44baa3ff25827035002b7cde1bf077c00956a"}}, "hash": "e0e10fc707523700f97f113412001b14da68c644a84217ae58bff7406ddb4849", "text": "a majority of these suicides are a result of crop failures and high indebtedness.

However, since bulk of the value addition occurs in agriculture firms, small farmers do not stand to benefit from the post farm gate price realizations which are significantly higher.11 Until such time as these flanking policies are institut- ed domestically and distortions in global agriculture markets corrected, any price rise will not translate into income increases for the small farmers. An FAO study12 based on data from devel- oping countries highlights the fact that the majority of poor households are net buy- ers of staple foods, implying that for most households consumption needs are great- er than the value of their produce for the same staples. The study brings out further that even in rural areas, \u2018where agricul- ture and staple food production are im- portant occupations for the majority of the poor, a vast share of the poor are net food buyers and stand to lose (or at least not gain) from an increase in the price of tradable staple food\u201913. In this light, food price stabilization emerges as a critical fac- tor for poverty reduction and ensuring food security ,leading to reduced hunger. Recent research suggests that while the impact of rising commodity prices varies across coun- tries and commodities, depending among other things on the extent to which global prices pass through to domestic consum- ers, more often than not \u2018poverty increases are considerably more frequent and larger than poverty reductions [when food prices increase]\u2019.14 The World Bank estimates that average impact of a 10% increase for sev- en key food items would raise the poverty headcount ratio by 0.4 percentage points.15 Another piece of research examining future impacts on account of food price increases estimates that a 20% increase in food prices in 2025 relative to the baseline would swell the ranks of the undernourished population by 440 million people.16 As this FAO report notes, challenges for urban poor may be particularly severe as they tend to consume more tradables and are unlikely to produce much for their own food needs or even for sale.17 Arguably, the challenges of increased liberalization in agriculture trade may out- weigh the opportunities therein for some developing countries, since in addition to the domestic constraints, the current inter- national food policy architecture does not seem adequately geared to ensuring food security and reduction of hunger for the poor. This paper aims to explore why internation- al food policy has to date delivered so little for the world\u2019s hungry. In so doing, it aims to unpack some of the issues which policy makers need to consider in developing new approaches to the international food policy architecture while responding to the emerging challenges and addressing the structural causes and limitations affecting agricultural trade. 11 Kwa 2001. 12 FAO 2008 13 Ibid 14 Ivanic and Martin.

It has expanded more rap- idly in recent decades than global agricul- tural GDP, though at lower rates than trade in goods and services. Over the years, global agriculture trade has seen a profound shift in structure, direction and composition which is often paradoxical in nature19. Agricultural trade accounted for around 70% of Asia Pa- cific\u2019s exports, and around 40% of its imports in 1961, but in 2003, accounted for less than 10% of each20. The Asia Pacific region as a whole has recently moved to a net import position: the share of agricultural exports and imports as a proportion of total exports and imports have both fallen, but the latter more slowly. Asia Pacific accounts for only around 3% of world trade in agricultural products21. A large and increasing proportion of Asia Pa- cific exports and imports are concentrated within the Region (48% and 41% of exports and imports respectively in 2003) 22.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d4e0145-8569-46c0-869e-8ac3249c52b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d4e0145-8569-46c0-869e-8ac3249c52b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c944ac85eb8c5c120b8c00ea06b0ee1a2471e2da1bcd86a5702f6c079bd12a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "b363b2ca-a727-42c2-8ade-7d71449c3938", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0e10fc707523700f97f113412001b14da68c644a84217ae58bff7406ddb4849"}}, "hash": "c93fc87e3523d53c78c9bf261aa44baa3ff25827035002b7cde1bf077c00956a", "text": "The theory of comparative advantage sug- gests that, ceteris paribus, as markets liber- alise, production of goods and services will tend to develop along comparative advan- tage lines.

Why have developing countries captured so little share of the international food exports markets? 6 expect dominance of large temperate de- veloping countries \u2013 notably the members of the Cairns group23. In the Asia Pacific pro- ducers with a likely comparative advantage in agriculture include Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia (rice) and India (rice and wheat). However, looking only at the abundance of factors conducive to agriculture can also be misleading. For example, Chen and Beghin (2000) assessed that China had a compara- tive disadvantage in staple grain produc- tion (because of limited arable land) and a comparative advantage in labour inten- sive crops (such as fruit and vegetables). They argue that China\u2019s policy of producing enough grain to meet domestic consump- tion needs is inefficient. And yet China has made significant progress in reducing hunger within its borders, largely through investment in a dynamic staple agricultural sector. However, despite the fact that many devel- oping Asian countries have the potential to be competitive producers and export- ers of staple grains, the past four decades have been characterized by the increasing dominance of agricultural exports from developed countries. The EU, for example, accounted for a little over 20% of global trade in the early 1960s to over 40% today.24 Conversely, developing countries have seen their share of world agricultural exports de- cline over the same period from nearly 40% to around 30% today25. It is worth noting that the model of growth through liberalization assumes functioning markets in order to achieve the benefits of comparative advantage-based production. As Bhagwati26 and others have noted, the existence of market failure at any level may result in sub-optimal systems of produc- tion. In other words, though a perfectly functioning free market economy may be the most efficient means of production, a relatively freer economy may or may not be more efficient or welfare-enhancing than its relatively less free predecessor. More- over, gains from liberalization in agriculture trade along the lines of comparative advan- tages cannot be assumed to be automatic and critically dependent on the presence of several complementary policies and in- stitutions at the national and international levels. 24 ibid. 25 ibid. 26 1971. 7 Agricultural trade has only relatively recently been subject to the disciplines of the mul- tilateral trade system following the setting up of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995 and adoption of the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA). During the period, when the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947 governed international trade in goods, before the birth of the WTO, the bulk of the general rules of trade in goods did not apply to agriculture, contrary to the original draft of the GATT text. The special treatment of agriculture under the GATT re- sulted chiefly from US concerns about stabi- lizing agricultural incomes and their desire to preserve national means of food production. This meant that, for most of the second half of the twentieth century, many GATT signa- tories were able to maintain, introduce or increase restrictions on agricultural imports, while subsidizing domestic production and export of agricultural products. The GATT, however, liberalized trade in non- agricultural products, fuelling a dramatic increase in the exports of goods and ser- vices. During this period, many developing countries, including in the Asia Pacific region, adopted a deliberate policy of rapid indus- trialization, reducing investment in, or even taxing, domestic agricultural production. Meanwhile, industrial workers were sustained by importing cheap food, often heavily sub- sidized, from developed countries, notably the US (and, later, the EU). In addition, the US, in particular, provided large quantities of wheat to developing economies in the form of food aid under its Food for Peace (PL-480) programme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82a369b5-7612-4c58-9955-ef2492e31ac1": {"__data__": {"id_": "82a369b5-7612-4c58-9955-ef2492e31ac1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a0be1f254f875db448e1a89369fdbb9845803bf8fc5f8400e227d8b0d9585b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d663fca-4143-4393-ba75-de90abcfeab3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd9a6446e3e96a19b2b06ea69d2585024b75e2001fb18d0c2755316c2ed19072"}}, "hash": "a4b2c7ab9f93108e4d5d3e0ffcb0c3d8669bb6889216b18b9ec3e049179b60a2", "text": "Food aid can have a particularly distorting effect on prices and production as it tends to be greatest when food prices are lowest, and world production greatest.

How- ever, it came at the cost of unsustainable fis- cal and current account deficits, and further impoverishment of the rural and landless poor. Some governments attempted to re- dress these problems through measures to support domestic agriculture or control im- ports. The result was increased volatility in global food prices. In addition, import substitution resulted in some unanticipated outcomes, the dis- tortionary effects of which are difficult to quantify. These include changes in the crops consumed, particularly the increase in wheat consumption, among developing countries, and displacement of local grains and root crops at the expense of a small number of staples. This, in turn, allowed the US and EU to consolidate their increasing dominance of international trade in staple food crops, al- lowing them to benefit from economies of scale and reduced risk for producers. The 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement on Ag- riculture, followed by the setting up of the WTO in 1995, established the first binding global framework for the trade of agricultural products. It aimed to rationalize the current system of protection, and gradually reduce trade-distorting protection of the agricul- tural sector. The AoA\u2019s main provisions are summarized in Annex 1. Although the Uruguay commitments placed lower obligations on developing than devel- 27 See annex 1 for definition of amber, blue and green box measures 28 FAO 2001. 29 FAO 2003. International agricultural trade policy architecture \u2013 An Overview 8 oped countries, and exempted LDCs from most provisions, in practice, they tended to benefit richer producers, especially in the area of subsidies. This was because devel- oped countries tended to have higher lev- els of existing subsidies, a significant part of which was accommodated within the framework of the AoA under the so called \u2018green box\u2019 and \u2018blue box\u2019 measures. In ad- dition, developing countries often lacked the resources to take advantage of green box and blue box provisions27, which were permitted under AoA rules. Moreover, many developing countries did not declare export subsidies, limiting their future abil- ity to make use of this provision while giv- ing up resort to quantitative restrictions on imports and reducing bound tariffs on agri- cultural products. Meanwhile, even though developing countries tended to have high- er bound tariffs following the introduction of the AoA, applied rates on average were often much lower than bound rates. A FAO study covering 14 countries showed that while the bound rate was 90%, the simple average of the applied rates for 12 coun- tries was 22%.28 While there existed Special Safeguard (SSG) provisions to protect sen- sitive sectors, or other sectors which faced supply shocks, in practice, these were often difficult to apply. It has been suggested that elements of the AoA worked towards re- ducing the policy space and flexibility avail- able to developing country governments to stimulate agricultural development by providing protection and/or support to the sector. 29 In addition, many of the developing coun- tries undertaking \u2018structural adjustment policies\u2019 were faced with pressures to liber- alize autonomously by the International Fi- nancial Institutions (IFIs), including through reduction of import tariffs and quantitative restrictions and a significant scaling down of agriculture expenditure, including sub- sidies30. As a result, over the last couple of decades, while subsidies in the OECD coun- tries have increased in nominal terms by 5-10%, agriculture expenditure in develop- ing countries has fallen31. Agricultural development tends to benefit from intensive investment in early phases of sector development, to help farmers to take risks associated with experimenta- tion and more intensive production, as well as giving access to credit. Successful agricultural growth then tends to result in greater consolidation and the achieve- ment of economies of scale, and a focus on value added agricultural production. At this point subsidies may no longer be necessary because producers have already gained comparative advantage through such efficiency gains. However, the current imbalances in the global agricultural trade policy architecture have effectively served to constrain the nurturing of the agricul- ture sector along lines of comparative ad- vantages in developing countries and while the developed countries have succeeded in maintaining significantly their protectionist stance, the developing countries continue to be nudged towards accepting signifi- cant reduction of import tariffs and dilution of protective safeguards in the Doha trade talks. 30 ibid. 31 ibid. 9 A well functioning market for agricultural products would efficiently transmit price signals without distortions and is essential for equilibrating the forces of supply and demand.

Although almost all countries in the Region rely on rice as a staple food, the impact of a rice price increase or decrease on poverty and hunger outcomes differs signifi- cantly, depending on whether a country is a net importer and exporter of rice (see be- low). 32 FAO 2004. How do agricultural markets react to pricing signals? 10 There will also be a differing impact of such an increase within a country, according to re- gion and sector. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, cheap rice imports benefited the net consumers of rice \u2013 notably the ur- ban poor. However, domestic producers of rice were unable to compete with cheap im- ports, reducing their income and thus their ability to feed themselves and their families. For example, between 1998 and 2002, an in- ability to compete with cheap food imports threatened the livelihoods of around 17 mil- lion small farmers in Indonesia and the Phil- ippines33. The main beneficiaries of the recent food price spike will be those farmers who ben- efit from the efficient transmission of pricing signals, and who have the means to increase production. The main losers will be net food consumers such as the urban poor, marginal farmers and the landless poor. In line with other traded products, the im- pact of a price movement in either direc- tion should be self-correcting, assuming a functioning market. In the case of the recent price increase, for example, the rising prices should signal to farmers to increase produc- tion, while there will be some reduction in food consumption (though demand for food has low income flexibility). Meanwhile, pro- ducers should benefit from rising incomes, which both allow them to consume increas- ing non-food products, and to invest more in the productivity of their land (through labour or other inputs). Conversely, if food prices fall, urban workers and other consumers should benefit from low food prices, allowing them to spend or invest more of their income on non-food items.

Cited by Oxfam. Farmers should be incentivised to reduce production, which will reduce supply and hence raise food prices to an equilibrium level. If low prices persist, they will be in- centivised to leave the food production sector for more productive sectors. However, food differs from other commodi- ties in several respects. First, the results of \u2018reduced consumption\u2019 for the poor can in- rease hunger or even starvation, meaning that the human cost of market adjustments can be immense. Moreover, in countries which have suffered from historical under- investment in agriculture, farmers may be incapable of increasing production to bene- fit from rising prices. High oil prices may ex- acerbate production limitations, by making fertilizers, a key input, less affordable. Even if they have the technology and inputs to produce more over the long term, they still have the time delay of growing and har- vesting the crops. Finally, a preponderance of subsistence farming can also mean that a significant share of output does not come to the market; hence, in such a scenario, production changes may not be correlated well with price changes. A 2005 FAO study34 found that for 150 episodes internationally, where data on both price and production changes are presented in the studies, in only 66% of cases was the response in the direction expected. Nor can farmers in countries with declining agricultural sectors easily shift into differ- ent occupations, for reasons of geography (most rural farmers are located far from ur- ban centres) and skills.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69b076da-fe1b-4254-874e-842d8714f050": {"__data__": {"id_": "69b076da-fe1b-4254-874e-842d8714f050", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1e9c759e0b30da8a0019ab53e87755934509b86210dc26ea593be3ecd6f19c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea639ed5-b0a0-4648-8213-0abaadf43ad3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "808d48d73de4f6fb654509510b3ad0565d166ed01d911fa21c1356ff3c0ba3a9"}}, "hash": "9ba89accc4c09bb2bea5ec12e7b55c9398f53257e6f4348ae04769efd15501e9", "text": "For example, Dhar has recorded that, while the contribution of agriculture to GDP has fallen from 46.1%% and 35.2% respectively in India and China in 1970, to 23.7% and 14.8% in 2000, the percentage of the population employed in agriculture in each has fallen much less rapidly over the same period, from 80.1% to 72.1% in India, and from 82.6% to 64.4% in China35.

The ability of the world market to regulate prices also depends on the efficient trans- mission of pricing signals. However, for de- veloping countries with poor infrastructure, or markets where the influence of powerful and rent-seeking middlemen is significant, farmers may not always receive an accurate indication of world price increases or de- creases. For this reason, the US in particu- lar, has faced criticism for the concentration of their remaining domestic subsidies on large producers (with the largest 10% of producers receiving 75% of subsidies ac- cording to some estimates36). Food prices are also increasingly affected by volatility from commodities traders, which can result in false pricing mechanisms being relayed to producers. While the urban poor go hungry as the result of high world prices, domestic agri- cultural products consumed locally may still bring a poor price for their hungry producers. However, what is clear is that, though food prices may swell the number of hungry people in the Asia Pacific region, the vast majority of those going hungry have been hungry for decades, even when food prices were low. This was largely due to poor productivity and high post harvest losses, low incomes and distribution issues, which meant that food did not always reach those who needed it most. 13 The AoA included in its provisions a commit- ment to further progressive liberalization of the agricultural system. A new round of ne- gotiations, \u2018the Doha Development Round\u2019 was launched in 2001. This Round is mandat- ed to accord particular priority to the needs of developing countries. Agriculture remains one of the main obsta- cles to concluding the Doha Round, mostly due to disagreements over how much sup- port to agriculture should be maintained by the US and EU and the nature and extent of effective protection available to developing countries to protect food security, livelihood security and rural development. The recent stalemate at the mini Ministerial held in Ge- neva in July 2008 over the agricultural mo- dalities in this regard are symptomatic of the lack of convergence between the developed countries led by US, EU and large blocks of developing countries led by India and China seeking to strike a balance between the im- peratives of liberalization and protection. In part, disagreement on the way forward on subsidies is a result of a lack of consensus about the amount of progress made so far in reducing subsidies. The two most commonly cited indicators of support to producers are the WTO\u2019s Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) and the OECD\u2019s Producer Support Es- timate (PSE). By the former measure, in 2003, EU farmers received a subsidy of $115 million in 2003; US farmers $54 million. Using AMS, the figures are only $51 million and 17 mil- lion respectively37. 37 FAO 2005a. The Doha Round: Prospects for further liberalization and current market distortions 14 Developed countries have criticized the use of the PSE in calculating levels of sub- sidy because it includes border protections such as tariffs. However, even when border measures are discounted, there is a signifi- cant difference between PSE and AMS cal- culations. The AMS has also been criticized because it excludes support to the actual domestic price (as opposed to the administered or guaranteed price) received by farmers from its calculation. Moreover, because of its re- liance on historical world reference prices as a base, countries can actually raise the level of domestic support when actual cur- rent world prices fall. Additionally, whereas PSE is calculated on the basis of all subsidies made to farmers, AMS looks at only \u2018amber box\u2019 provisions. Amber box measures have steadily de- clined since the introduction of the AoA. However, there has been a roughly com- mensurate increase in green and blue box measures. Two studies in 200438 found that while blue and green box policies were sig- nificantly less trade distorting than direct subsidies, they did provide some distortion. Anton calculated that such support was ap- proximately equal to 20% of the distortion caused by market price supports, while the OECD suggested that actual distortion could be even higher because such pay- ments served to reduce the risks of produc- tion, particularly for riskier commodities. In 2004, WTO members approved a Frame- work Agreement. This expresses members\u2019 intention to harmonize levels of subsidy, substantially reduce tariffs amongst mem- bers, while maintaining increased flexibility for sensitive sectors in developing coun- tries. However, clear differences still exist between members.

But the EU has rejected blanket cuts and has further tried to link concessions in agri- culture to progress in Non Agricultural Mar- ket Access (NAMA) and services in particu- lar. Moreover, their offers have fallen short of what has been called for both by the Cairns group of major producers, and most developing countries, who have pushed for much more extensive reductions in domes- tic support. The 2004 Framework Agreement also in- corporates an important decision to in- clude measures to protect an appropriate number of products as \u2018Special Products\u2019 (SPs) in developing countries which are be- lieved to be particularly important from a food security, livelihood security and rural development point of view. The decision constituted a much sought after middle ground between the objective of ensuring enhanced market access and operationalis- ing the principle of special and differential treatment. SP provisions are intended to protect the interests of small and vulnera- ble farmers. Under the provisions, SPs were to be afforded lower and more flexible re- duction commitments than other products. Additionally, a provision for developing countries to have recourse to invoke a Spe- cial Safeguard Mechanism (SSM) which will allow them to protect their markets from import surges and pricing shocks was also outlined. The inclusion of these elements in the Framework Agreement followed lobbying by the G33 and are supported by the G20 and other poor and net food importing. At first, vigorously opposed by major produc- ers such as the EU, US and Cairns Group, the principles of SP and SSM have now been recognized by all major players as key to any hopes of concluding the Round. Significant challenges still remain, not least of which is achieving agreement on which products should be covered by SP provisions, and how SP and SSM will operate. 38 Anton 2004, OECD 2004. 15 The designation of Special Products recog- nizes implicitly that total reliance on import- ed staples is a high-risk strategy for a devel- oping country, particularly in the context of staple food price volatility, and encourages the maintenance of some degree of national food production, at least where some pro- duction capacity already exists. Members of the G33 and other developing countries have argued that they should be given the right to designate the SPs for at least 20% of their agricultural tariff lines, guided by a set of indicators. These indicators include, inter alia, staple food or products which form a major part of the food basket in developing countries; products whose domestic con- sumption is largely met through domestic production; and products produced by a large number of resource poor and subsis- tence farmers39. However, reaching an agree- ment on scope, coverages and mechanisms for SP and SSM provisions has been challeng- ing. This is in part because the criteria and thresholds for determining which products are critical for livelihoods, food security and rural development will vary by each country. OECD producers have argued for a minimal- ist set of Special Products, to consist mostly of key staples. A 2005 ICTSD multi-country study suggested that the following products were particularly significant in terms of the three elements highlighted in the 2004 Framework Agree- ment (food security, livelihood security, ru- ral livelihoods): wheat, rice, maize, sugar, chicken and beef, milk and dairy products, tomatoes, onions and potatoes. As the au- thors note, these are the same sectors which currently suffer from the greatest degree of trade distortion (e.g. due to subsidies). This is particularly significant because granting of additional protection in these areas would recognize the fact that subsidy reduction alone would not level the playing field for developing country producers because of dynamic gains from previous subsidization. The intention behind the SSM is slightly dif- ferent from SP provisions, in that it aims to protect the rural producer (particularly the small farmer), whereas the SP provisions aim to protect both small producer and vulner- able consumer. In principle, therefore, SSM product coverage could be much broader than that of SP, and could even include non- food items (such as cotton), as long as these were significant for rural livelihoods. Once more, the G-33 have argued for, and the OECD producers against, a broad scope. A key concern for SSM is to ensure that it will be more effective than the current Special Safeguard Provision (SSG).

Moreover, by focusing on import prices, the SSM would avoid be- ing triggered when the import surge was a response to a dramatic shortfall in domestic production (e.g. caused by drought or flood- ing), in which case imports would form a vital part of any country level response. In order that SP and SSM provisions are best able to help the hungry of Asia Pacific, and small farmers which are so critical to achiev- ing food security in the region, we suggest that the following factors should be borne in mind: 1. SP and SSM provisions should be designed to counter act both current subsidies by developed country producers, and historical distortions from previous subsidies \u2013 this will im- pact on product selection, scale of tar- iffs (or non-tariff measures) applied and duration of measures; 39 Roy 2006 40 ICTSD 2005 16 2. Given the urgent need to address is- sues of hunger, scope of the measures should be clear, transparent, and pro- vide a straightforward and simple agen- da for negotiation. In the case of SSMs, there is a further need to ensure that the provisions are simple to activate. 3. The needs of developing countries (and particularly small holders) should be prioritized; 4. If possible, the measures should incen tivise investment in staple crops in pref- erence to export and cash crops, at least for the duration of this round (given sta ple price volatility and the low level of development in agriculture overall). Taken together, these factors might argue for the adoption of maximalist SP protection for staple crops,together with other products, subject to heavy market distortions, combined with the freedom for developing countries to implement SSMs in the face of downward price shocks for any product (subject perhaps to a maxi- mum number of products at any one time, to prevent abuse). The former should facili- tate the development of food security, at a national and regional levels, while the lat- ter should enable small farmers to mitigate against risk of shocks across the breadth of their activities. 17 Regional trade agreements are becoming an important part of the global trading landscape and are set to proliferate further, given the continued stalemate at the mul- tilateral level. As with most other regions of the world, there are a plethora of RTAs and PTAs within the Asia Pacific region, the most significant of which are based around the ASEAN, APEC and SAARC groupings. To date, none of these institutions have been very successful at incorporating agriculture into their remits, partly because of widely different domestic policies and levels of protection (a factor likely to reduce if the Doha Round concludes with reduced levels of protection for agriculture globally). Gen- erally speaking, given the existing thrust of RTAs on non-agricultural trade, it is difficult to predict their impact on food security. There is a dearth of literature in this regard and any welfare impact would be condition- al, largely on the specifics of the agreement and whether or not it leads to more trade creation and not trade diversion.41 Also, the ability of low income households to benefit from an increase in market access would continue to be constrained by supply side issues.42 Modelling by Bandara and Yu43 sug- gests that a pan-Asian RTA on agriculture is likely to deliver more welfare benefits to its members than smaller RTAs (e.g. for South and South East Asia). However, even under this scenario, net food importers such as the Philippines, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are likely to suffer some welfare losses. A South Asian FTA (Free Trade Agreement) would deliver significant benefits for India (though not as great as if it were included in an ASEAN plus RTA) and Pakistan, while an ASEAN RTA would be welfare enhancing for most members, but at very modest rates. 41 FAO 2003. 42 ibid. 43 2007. The role of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) and Preferential Trading Agreements (PTAs) 18 The traditional approach to international discussions on food production and distri- bution is to focus on trade. The non-trade elements of international food policy archi- tecture are subject to fewer formal control mechanisms than those relating to trade. There is a danger, therefore, that a holistic view of international food policy architec- ture is not achieved by policy makers who address the issue through specific \u2018lenses\u2019 without consideration of the broader im- plications of their decision making.

According to some estimates44, volumes of capital flows in the food commodities markets have risen from $13 billion in 2003 to $260 billion in 2008 (although these fig- ures remain relatively small compared with other non-food commodities such as oil). Speculators have shown increasing inter- est in food markets following the collapse of the financial derivatives and real estate markets. India recently took the unusual step of suspending trade in futures of four staple products (including rice). Placing international controls on agricultural com- modities futures may prove neither prac- ticable nor ultimately desirable. However, policy makers need to be aware that, for example, a major crash in this market could significantly damage any attempts at a fairer international food policy. At the least, there may be the need for national or inter- national legislation to prevent market ma- nipulation and excessive speculation. One of the most controversial issues at the FAO 6 June, 2008 Rome meeting on the food price crisis was the production of biofuels, which participants argued caused anything from 3% to 30% of the recent increase in food prices. The impact of biofuels on hun- ger levels in Asia Pacific has so far been neg- ligible: rice, the main regional staple, has not been diverted into biofuel production, nor has land in the main regional produc- ers of rice been diverted to production of biofuel crops. However, some market fore- casters claim that the region being a net importer of energy and being vulnerable to oil price vulnerability, is set to witness an increased use of bio-fuels in order to meet a part of its increasing domestic demand.45 Given increasing attention to biofuel pro- duction across countries and region and the government support to harnessing bio- fuels in several countries already in place, international policy makers will doubtless take an interest in future trends in biofuel production, in order to assess whether rules governing their production would be ap- propriate. International agreements on combating Climate Change are not usually considered alongside similar debates on agricultural trade policy. However, even small rises in world temperatures could have significant and devastating effects on agricultural pro- duction in the Asia Pacific region, through increased flooding and desertification46. 44 Master Capital Management LLC.

Non-trade elements of international food policy architecture 19 Moreover, attempts to increase produc- tion within the Region may place additional strain on existing water resources. Therefore, there is some logic in considering the issues of climate change and hunger to be closely linked. As Stern47 has noted, there are com- plex interlinkages between the issues of climate change and development. Richer countries are more able to afford adaptation mechanisms which may protect lives and livelihoods in the event of extreme climatic events. This may include measures to pre- serve and protect food production systems. However, the process of development itself may result in increased carbon emissions (which may increase the likelihood and se- verity of such events). Many small holders, who will suffer disproportionately from the effects of climate change, have already start- ed experimenting with new methods of cul- tivation and means of reducing risk48. How- ever, a significant challenge remains the lack of small holder voice at international meet- ings to discuss climate change. As in the case of trade talks, these tend to be dominated by arguments between developed and devel- oping major polluters, with both focusing on their aggregate economic growth (with, in the case of climate change talks, a heavy em- phasis on the non-agricultural sector). 47 2006. 48 See ActionAid 2007. 20 In mid-2008, it became clear that the world was heading for a major economic down- turn, on a scale unprecedented in recent years. As noted in this paper, international food policy is affected not just by trade policy but also by other developments on the international stage. We might, therefore, expect that the downturn would have a sig- nificant impact on hunger in the Asia Pacific region. Although, it is too soon to quantify these impacts, their vectors are likely to include: - Increased agricultural trade protec- tionism by major developed countries: already the food price spike had encour- aged French President Sarkozy to scupper a draft US-EU compromise on un- picking subsidies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b6c948c-a354-44b5-89d0-7a5801c5b84e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b6c948c-a354-44b5-89d0-7a5801c5b84e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9915e8e05777d7faab1d0fec428a68be07fac1a806eccef1f4c00fd8302db7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd7cbf12-8d88-4251-a232-9a0e0b6874df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "472a5642b6e2d4a45e55fec2b332ef818657f5c954df8a74fc528123e005af6d"}}, "hash": "9eb6f97182496fad8f9e40d23d902567aee6dd9a580ad01bd79704e3aba14c39", "text": "- Reduced consumption of income-elastic food and non-food agricultural products: declining consumption patterns, notably in the developed world, could lead to a reduction in demand for certain income- elastic agricultural products (these might include e.g. cut flowers, processed agri- cultural products and meat products).

However, the overall impact on Asia Pacific food security might be posi- tive over the medium to long term, if this process led to a shift back towards staple food production at the expense of agricul- tural exports, as well as encouraging lower meat consumption, a food pattern which is easier to sustain. Because of their low income-elasticity, most staple foods would not see major declines in demand (at least at a macro level). - With a declining trend in prices of oil and a potential reduction in overall energy de- mand, there may be a reduction in the pric- es of bio-fuels as well, which in turn would affect the profitability and consequent de- mand for bio-fuel related products such as corn and sugarcane. Fertilizer costs are also likely to fall in line with fuel prices. - However, at the level of the poorest con- sumers, those in countries affected by the economic downturn may be less likely (be- cause of e.g. rising unemployment) to pur- chase enough staple food for themselves and their families, directly increasing the number of hungry people in the Asia Pa- cific region. - As noted in the paper, the recent boom in commodities futures is a result of declining confidence in the housing and financial markets. A further economic downswing, and recession in major economies, is likely to drive investors further into new mar- kets considered to be resilient, including food commodities. This is likely to result in increased price volatility, which will not only impact poor consumers (in the form of price spikes) but also inhibit producers from receiving accurate pricing signals on which to base their supply decisions. - A recessionary environment in major do- nor economies will inevitably result in less money being available for aid donation, as well as reduced interest by voters in inter- national affairs. This is likely to inhibit prog- ress on achieving the Millennium Develop- ment Goals, notably MDG1 on eliminating poverty and hunger. Potential linkages of the 2008 Global Recessionary trends on hunger 21 In some ways, the food price crisis has shifted the reference points for the major players in Doha Round negotiations on agriculture,that have been preoccupied for many years with the problems of low food prices. However, this shift has not facilitated a meeting of minds on the best way to proceed to ensure that international food policy brings benefits to all. Proponents of increased liberalisation point to rapid rate of economic growth in develop- ing countries following the introduction of the AoA, notably in the Asia Pacific region. They also highlight to the fact that the least developed countries tend to have the high- est barriers to trade. An FAO49 analysis of the incidence of hunger (as defined by the num- ber of underweight) in countries with varying degrees of agricultural trade openness (as defined by ratio of agricultural trade to agri- cultural GDP) shows that more open societ- ies are likely to have a smaller number of un- dernourished people. However, this relation may not be causal, and the results are highly dispersed, suggesting that liberalization may not bring benefits for all, and/ or that exter- nal factors such as market effectiveness may be critical. Most credible economic models50 predict that further reductions in US and EU do- mestic and export subsidies, and greater stringency in interpreting green and blue box measures, are likely to shift production towards the world\u2019s most efficient produc- ers, mostly Cairns group countries that are primarily developed or richer developing countries51. In Asia Pacific, these include Ma- laysia and Indonesia, the latter a moderately hungry nation52. However, Panagariya has emphasized that the overall effect of such reductions may well be a rise in prices53, which will impact nega- tively on food importers, such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines and Sri Lanka. He also notes that such as liberalization might also hurt those who currently benefit from buy- ing subsidized food imports at low cost, while selling their exports at artificially high prices within the EU through the Everything But Arms Initiative. This effect may not be pro- nounced in Asia Pacific, where most hungry nations do not export significant quantities of food; and where bulk of the agriculture produce is sold locally. Moreover, given the fact that the subsidies would be phased out gradually over a period of time and increased prices may lead to increased production, this could lead to an increase in agricultural pro- duction in the long term.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f381edb-66c3-40e9-ac93-bea66f8bbefd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f381edb-66c3-40e9-ac93-bea66f8bbefd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1093b68cf18a521ec7fd4385c3617964e56e729705a5aef4c718b218feb6349d"}}, "hash": "1093b68cf18a521ec7fd4385c3617964e56e729705a5aef4c718b218feb6349d", "text": "An important question for policy makers therefore is which is their highest priority: low prices for consumers; living wages for producers; or efficient allocation of produc- tion.

Recent improvements in the methodology of such programmes have tended to revise downwards estimates of the potential benefits of trade. Additionally, models tend to look at aggregates rather than the effect on individual countries, nor on the effect on equality and hunger rather than pure growth. 51 Pangariya 2005. 52 i.e. 10-19.9 on the Global Hunger Index. 53 ibid. Diverse solutions for a fairer food policy architecture 22 developing countries is in lowering tariffs in developing countries themselves, opening the doors to greater inter-regional trade. This said, it is worth repeating that full trade liberalization is only likely to deliver the \u2018op- timal solution\u2019 in terms of global welfare if markets are functioning effectively54. As dis- cussed above, the global market in food does not currently function effectively. The risk is that further liberalization may result in losses for some developing countries, whether in terms of lost revenue to domestic farmers unable to compete with cheap imports, or increased price volatility. There are a range of measures, both national and international, which could be adopted to mitigate against these risks. These include, SP and SSM measures; increased reserve stocks of staple grains; controls on commod- ities futures markets; and promotion of im- port competing food products. These mea- sures could potentially be supplemented by further measures to offset historical market distortions (e.g. through implementation of Marrakesh Agreement promises to give developing countries the investment and technology they need to support their agri- cultural sectors). At the other end of the spectrum, advocates of food sovereignty have pushed for a freeze in further liberalization, or even a roll back of AoA provisions. They have instead empha- sized the importance of national production, and support of small farmers. They also cite the example of China, which arguably has a comparative disadvantage in grain produc- tion, but has yet invested heavily in produc- ing staple crops, achieving exceptional rates of growth but also a low hunger rate (less than 10 on the GHI compared with well over 20 in India, for example). On the other hand, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge pursued an aggressive policy of self-sufficiency which resulted in the starvation of over a million people. Moreover, it is debatable whether complete isolation of national agricultural production is even possible. Ultimately, the focus for developing countries should still be on food security rather than food sovereign- ty. However, a credible food security plan is likely to include provisions for some domes- tic production of food. 54 Bhagwati 1971. 23 On 15th July, regional and international experts in the field of international food policy55 met at a Roundtable in Colombo to discuss how international food policy architecture could be realigned better to meet the needs of Asia Pacific\u2019s poor and hungry. Participants agreed that there was an urgent need to address hunger in the Asia Pacific context: there was a danger that hunger was seen as an African issue. Africa faced severe problems regarding poverty and hunger, but the majority of the world\u2019s hungry lived in Asia, and their circumstances differed from the hungry of Africa. It was crucial that their interests were not overlooked. There was broad agreement that it would be crucial for Asian governments to reverse past policies which had \u2018overshot\u2019 in terms of moving investment out of agriculture and into industry or social services. The re- sult has been that, for many in the Region, agriculture has faced chronic underinvest- ment, leading to low productivity and competitiveness. Given the heavy con- centration of small farmers amongst Asia\u2019s poor and hungry, governments needed to invest in infrastructure and micro-credit schemes, as well as ensure that market pricing signals are more accurately trans- mitted to small farmers. Agriculture had to be mainstreamed into development and economic strategies.

However, while many of the key actions which could help combat hunger in the Region were the responsibility of national governments, participants emphasized the importance of creating an appropriate international policy space which would enable governments to rejuvenate their agricultural sectors. Historically, agricultural trade and other international food policies have tended to be set in reaction to short term triggers. For example, many of the Agreement on Agriculture provisions were set in a climate of low food prices, provoked by a fear that WTO members\u2019 markets would be flooded by cheap imports. Conversely, current discussion on future food policy has been dominated by discussions of how to miti- gate the spikes in staple food prices seen since late 2007. Yet, as this paper has dem- onstrated that the causes of hunger are not solely, or even primarily, determined by pricing issues. Policies need to be devel- oped which address the underlying causes of hunger, not just high prices. Central to this is stimulating the agricultural sectors of developing countries. As discussed above, for many years \u2018inter- national food policy architecture\u2019 has basi- cally been equated with agricultural trade policy. But recent developments have dem- onstrated that international food produc- tion mechanisms are vulnerable to threats which lie outside the sphere of trade. Chief among these is climate change, and, relat- ed to this, the sustainable use of water. Cli- mate change threatens to destabilize cur- rent locations for crop production, and to push overall patterns of production in Asia northwards. Already productive areas of India, Pakistan and China are placing huge demands on ground water supplies, and 55 Participants were: Lord Mark Malloch Brown, British Foreign Office Minister; Dr Saman Kelegama, Executive Director, Institute of Policy Studies, Sri Lanka; Dr Sandra Polaski, Carnegie Endowment; Dr Tim Lang, City University; Dr Biswajit Dhar, Professor and Head, WTO Centre, IIFT, India; Dr Safdar Sohail, Foreign Trade Institute of Pakistan, Islamabad; and Dr Supachai Panichpakdi, Secretary General UNCTAD and former DG WTO. Roundtable on international food architecture 24 any attempts to intensify production will need to be based on a more efficient use of water resources (which must also take into account cross border water security issues). New national approaches to agriculture will need to factor in increased risks aris- ing from climate related incidents, but even more crucial will be international efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change (and to encourage adaptation responses for vulnerable states). It is important that in- ternational policy makers understand that climate changes is as much a development issue as it is an environmental one. There is also scope for the international community to recognize the impact of factors such as di- ets rich in meats, dairy and refined sugars in the developed world on developing country producers, as well as demand for cash crops (including, but not limited to biofuels) and the impact this had on countries\u2019 abilities to produce food crops. The cross cutting nature of hunger needs to be better realized and reflected among the relevant international institutions. Some in- dividual institutions have already adopted a leadership role in this respect. For example, the WTO and UNCTAD have promoted for the Doha Round measures (such as SSMs and SPs) which protect rural livelihoods and enable the poor to feed themselves. How- ever, what is missing is a coherent interna- tional governance mechanism \u2013 a \u2018Consen- sus on Agriculture\u2019 or \u2018Security Council for Development\u2019. Until better co-ordination is achieved, there is still a danger that individ- ual actions taken by the international com- munity may conflict with measures taken in other fora. In particular, the international community should recognize explicitly the pivotal role played by small farmers in de- veloping country agricultural production, and ensure that their needs are adequately reflected in policy formulation. In the light of the heavy impact on many of Asia\u2019s poor of the recent food price crisis, par- ticularly for the urban poor and for net food importing countries, calls for greater protec- tionism were understandable.

But the Development Round has to be just that. The willingness of WTO members to al- low poorer countries apply Special Products and Special Safeguard Mechanisms in order to protect nascent agricultural development is critical. But significant challenges remain to ensuring these provisions are implement- ed in a way that helps the most needy. It will be important for the international commu- nity to orientate their discussion on these issues within the context of their vision for the realization of the Millennium Develop- ment Goals, rather than viewing simply as areas for concessions within a simple trade negotiation. The other key issue for discussion at Doha is the reduction of subsidies for developed countries. Again, it is important here that developed countries act in a manner which will allow agricultural production to devel- 56 Two weeks after the Roundtable, on 29th July 2008, Doha Trade talks in Geneva collapsed. 25 op along comparative advantage lines. As participants acknowledged, some de- veloped countries have a comparative advantage, and benefits from reductions in subsidies will not necessarily accrue pri- marily to the least developed countries. However, production along the lines of comparative advantage offers the best hope for stable levels of production and pricing. It was noted, however, that pat- terns of comparative advantage are likely to shift northwards over time due to cli- mate change. Some participants flagged the potential for more regional co-operation on food and agriculture, given that most staples consumed by Asians are produced with- in the Region. Such co-operation could take the form of a technical fund, a more effective seed bank which could provide a safety net in times of crisis, or regional trade agreements (however, on the lat- ter, thorough analysis would be needed on the likely costs and benefits of such an agreement). Participants agreed that there remained a critical role for donors in terms of in- vestment in agriculture in developing countries. International investment in agriculture has declined dramatically over the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, now accounting for only 6% of bilateral donor aid. Given the special role of agriculture in allowing the poor to meet their nutritional requirements, as well as to provide rural livelihoods, participants felt that this was a priority for donor aid strategies. An aggressive focus on agri- culture by the international community can help strengthen and support national rural strategies. Linked to this, there was an urgent need to increase investment in international bodies, such as IRRI, which could help increase productivity in Asian agriculture. Overall, participants were optimistic that a fairer deal for Asia\u2019s hungry could be achieved through a reconfiguration of the international food policy architecture, broadly defined to include aid and envi- ronmental issues as well as trade. But it would require active engagement, bet- ter co-ordination, and a willingness for all parties to adopt a visionary approach which focused on the long term need of \u2013 in particular \u2013 small farmers. 26 It is clear that the current state of food ar- chitecture is inadequate for protecting the economic and social rights of the world\u2019s hungry. The architects of the WTO and the Agreement on Agriculture wanted to cre- ate an international system which promot- ed equality and prosperity through trade liberalization and subsequent economic growth, based upon production along com- parative advantage lines. This vision has unfortunately not delivered \u2013 especially for the hundreds of millions of people living in poverty and hunger in Asia and other parts of the developing world. There are three main reasons for this, each of which has significant policy implica- tions for international and national policy makers. First, the theory of welfare gains along com- parative advantage lines assumes perfectly functioning markets. As discussed above, this is a flawed assumption. The persis- tence of trade-distorting subsidies and tar- iffs, combined with failures in market price transmission and the unique nature of food production in terms of supply side con- straints, income inelasticity of demand and the human cost of market distortions, com- bine to create massive market failures. The dominance of world agriculture by coun- tries which we would not expect to have a comparative advantage in agricultural pro- duction is a result of a combination of: 1. Remaining market distortions which benefit developed countries: It is in- disputable that most direct agricultural subsidies have been phased out by major OECD producers. However, considerable confusion exists over issues such as the trade distortion potential of green and blue box subsidies and of price baselines", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b12353e8-c268-4dd7-92c6-7631c255c371": {"__data__": {"id_": "b12353e8-c268-4dd7-92c6-7631c255c371", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e8c2a80b16959c94bb9f00e0e8f1c655c6cf9704b3c082e1c79064105534a7e"}}, "hash": "7e8c2a80b16959c94bb9f00e0e8f1c655c6cf9704b3c082e1c79064105534a7e", "text": "used to calculate acceptable levels of support. Moreover, the concentration of (even much reduced) subsidies in a small number of large and powerfulcompanies also prevents developing countries from competing successfully. It is, therefore, crucial that the developed world acts to dismantle remaining distortions. 2. The legacy of historical market distor- tions, which have made developed countries more competitive: Decades of subsidized agriculture in developed economies have increased productivity of developed country agriculture, both through better technology, but also through economies of scale. This lat- ter was also achieved through market distortions caused in the past by large scale food aid and sale of staples at very low prices. Even if all existing subsidies were removed, it is unlikely that develop- ing country producers would be able to capture significant market share without measures to rebalance the playing field. 3. The legacy of sub-optimal national agricultural policies in developing countries which has hindered the de- velopment of competitive agricultural sectors: It is telling to note that while, in their drive to develop, developing economies considered agriculture to be too low down the value chain to be of interest, developed countries continued to nurture and protect their agricultural production. The significant underinvest- ment in agriculture by both domestic governments and aid donors is one of the major causes of trade distortion and hunger in the Asia Pacific region. Conclusions 27 4. High rates of tariff protection in de- veloping countries which may have hampered the development of intra- regional trade: Given the high levels of distortion existing at a global level, and the special characteristics of the rice trade (see Annex 2) which means that most rice is consumed in Asia, and that the market is very thin, regional trade holds much po- tential both for generating a profitable ex- port sector, and enhancing regional food security. However, high tariffs (as well as a lack of policy maker attention compared to regional trade in non-agricultural goods and services) have inhibited the growth of this sector. What does this mean for policy makers? Bhagwati recognized that when markets fail, increasing liberalization does not nec- essarily lead to welfare gains. But given the likelihood that demand for staple foods will continue to increase (due to, inter-alia, popu- lation growth and changing diets) it would seem sensible to encourage production of agricultural staples in those countries with a comparative advantage in such production. As discussed above, many developed coun- tries have forged a comparative advantage in crop production despite high land and la- bour costs. Nor does it seem likely that fur- ther trade liberalization in itself will provide the least developed nations with significant new market access (though gains to some richer developing countries are likely). How- ever, the experience of OECD producers, and of China who have both invested to produce a vibrant agricultural sector and reduced hunger among their poor, argues for a sub- stantially increased investment in agriculture for those countries with the potential to be- come effective producers. Only then can true patterns of comparative advantage become apparent. This should be facilitated by the removal of distortions which unfairly benefit richer producers. In the light of, in particular, the recent food price crisis, voices advocating a strict food sovereignty approach have argued that countries should retreat from the global trading system and produce their own food rather than importing from others. While this strategy may work for large countries, covering a diverse range of climatic zones, and those with reasonably good natural en- dowments for agricultural production, it is not a strategy which will end hunger for the majority. Moreover, even in more success- ful cases, countries will be heavily exposed to the risk of crop failure or natural disaster. Arguably, the current spike in rice prices has been exacerbated by the very thin market in rice, combined with \u2018beggar thy neighbour\u2019 policies such as export restrictions adopted by some. In the final analysis, the most im- portant factor is that food should reach the hungry, rather than where that food comes from. However, developed nations should recognize that the current trade system is unfairly slanted in favour of their interests. It is specially important that the voice of the developing country small holder is not lost in international trade negotiations on agri- culture. A fairer deal would allow small hold- ers the potential to increase their income through potentially larger markets (whether domestically or possibly through exports, particularly regional). Moreover ,the use of SSM and SP measures would allow such pro- ducers to mitigate against the risks of poten- tially devastating import surges and subse- quent price", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df0ff417-fc12-45ba-a5d2-dd8cfc942b12": {"__data__": {"id_": "df0ff417-fc12-45ba-a5d2-dd8cfc942b12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b85c8151efa2654f46f3f2db9a52366b821f3bab27ec9da2eb0ff18e462ea4d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef0c9c8c-a674-4851-b752-0403c9927a28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df7dcd2181947cc09aafc74ae26b0e5977f20c53992dea198930cacda2ddcf45"}}, "hash": "bfc6a635cb052efb2ec3c9a403d995c348138b615bc46abbdefb8ace03d44610", "text": "crashes. Secondly, it needs to be recognized that hun- ger in the Asia Pacific region (and elsewhere in the developing world) is in large part a result of \u2018overshooting\u2019 of historical policies which promoted industrial over agricultur- al production as the route out of poverty. Correcting several decades of neglect and underinvestment will take concerted and determined national action, with a focus on improving infrastructure (to minimize post- harvest losses and connect farmers to mar- kets), providing access to micro-finance for small farmers and technology transfer. 28 57 See Stern 2006. Such changes will be challenging, and will require the creation of appropriate inter- national policy space. Key to this will be ensuring that WTO members allow devel- oping countries to adapt to, and hopefully eventually benefit from, increased liberal- ization. Agreement on a comprehensive system of SSM and SP mechanisms which fully meet the needs of the most vulnerable nations in terms of hunger are essential to protect nascent agricultural sectors from surges. The international community can also support national efforts by providing financial aid \u2013 either by increasing direct aid to agriculture, or by funding research institutes such as IRRI. Increased investment in agriculture would offer huge benefits to small farmers. Better technology and access to inputs (particu- larly fertilizers at a stable price) would allow them to increase yields, directly enhanc- ing their ability to feed themselves (and, through selling their excesses) and their communities. Access to microfinance and microinsurance is particularly important in order to allow small farmers to invest in improvements, as well as to hedge against risks posed by climatic disturbances. Also critical are improvements in infrastructure such as roads \u2013 to connect farmers to mar- kets \u2013 and storage facilities to minimize post-harvest losses. These improvements are not only the responsibility of develop- ing country governments, but also the do- nor community that has a responsibility to reverse trends away from investment in the agricultural sector. The third major reason for the failure of the current international food policy architec- ture to deliver for the world\u2019s hungry is that it has treated food as primarily a trade issue. Trade is central to global agricultural pro- duction systems. But food, and the related issue of rural livelihoods, is a much broader issue, which encompasses development, international commodities trading, and, increasingly, the environment. Already, water scarcity and natural disasters such as flooding and drought threaten crop yields in many parts of Asia. These trends are likely to increase due to climate change57. It is vital that the international community increases the coherence of its food and ag- ricultural policies, to ensure that progress in one sphere is not undermined in another. Only in this way can the needs of small pro- ducers and others living in hunger in the Asia Pacific be fully reflected in the inter- national food policy architecture. The cur- rent Balkanisation of food policy, and the exclusion of the voice of small farmers from meaningful policy making, means that their needs are ignored in the current system. The existence of so many people in the Asia Pacific countries living in hunger reflects a massive failing of the international com- munity to deliver basic human rights. It is the responsibility of that community to pri- oritise the needs of these people above na- tional interests in remodeling international food architecture. 29 References ActionAid (2007) \u2018We know what we need: South Asian women speak out on climate change adaptation\u2019, Institute of Development Studies, November 2007 Anton , J.

Reduction of Export Subsidies \u2013 Devel- oped countries were to reduce the vol- ume of subsidized exports by 21% and their value by 36% over five years (14% and 24% respectively for developing countries). Reductions were to be prod- uct-specific. Countries not using export subsidies during 1986-90 were prohibited from introducing them. 2. Reduction of Domestic Support \u2013 The AoA classified domestic support into three categories (see table below). Those in the \u2018Amber Box\u2019 were capped and sub- ject to reductions. These reductions ap- plied only to average rates of subsidy, so particular policies or products could be subject to much higher levels of support. Countries were also allowed to exclude support for a particular product under a de minimis exemption if the value of the support does not exceed 5% of the value of the total production of the commodity; or 5% of the value of total agricultural pro- duction for non-product specific support.

But the rice market is thin \u2013 only 6-7% of rice produced is traded, and this figure has remained consistent since the Agreement on Agriculture. This thinness means that new entrants into the import or export market can significantly affect the world price of rice. Rice in Asia is generally produced by small farmers with less than 1 hectare of land. Un- like other staple crops, rice is segmented into a large variety of types which are not easily interchangeable because of customer preferences. Farming is an inherently risky means of production, because effects such as climatic conditions can play a huge role in determining returns. However this type of small scale agriculture is particularly high in risk. Additionally, many of these farmers are relatively isolated from fluctuations in global rice markets because of poor infrastructure and/ or the influence of large agribusiness whose market dominance can be a bigger determinant of prices than changes in the market price. International trade in rice is characterized by high degrees of protection. The produc- tion is of rice is subsidized to some extent in most producing countries. The US, EU, Korea and Japan have the highest level of subsidy, though mostly in the form of WTO-permit- ted blue and green box measures. China provides significant direct payments to rice farmers. Tariffs and non-tariff barriers are high in most rice consuming countries \u2013 an average of 57% ad valorem bound rates, with higher rates for milled products. In practice, many countries in Asia Pacific are applying lower rates, especially since the price has risen. Only the EU subsidises rice exports, but many rice-producing Asia Pacific states have implemented export controls, especially since the food price crisis. Food aid from the US, EU and Japan accounts for around 5% of the world rice trade.There is also significant intervention in the market by state trading enterprises who procure grain to distribute domestically. According to the FAO1, models predict that full liberalization of the trade in rice would result in price increases of 10-14%, and an increase in the trade of rice by 29-47%. The results of partial liberalization, such as the removal of distorting measures in OECD pro- ducers, are less clear, with models predicting a price change range of -3% to 21%. Temperate parts of Asia are also significant producers of wheat, particularly South Asia, accounting for nearly 40% of world wheat ex- ports. The vast majority of diets in the region are grain-based, but 23% of protein needs in Asia are met from fish, whilst the increasing number of richer people in China and India has also driven increased consumption of animal protein. 58 2005a. Annex 2 RICE 34 In assessing comparative advantage in ag- riculture, we might begin by examining comparative yield rates. However, this is complicated by the fact that comparative advantage in agriculture is not static, but a result of previous approaches and policy on agriculture. These can include subsi- dies and other support (or alternatively, under-investment); as well as the applica- tion of new technologies (notably in cer- tain regions during the Green Revolution). In 2006, Asia as a whole showed slightly higher rice productivity than the world av- erage (4.181 t/ha compared with 4.11 t/ha). Within Asia, the most efficient producers of rice are China (6.27 t/ha), Japan (6.37 t/ ha), Korean Rep (6.60) Indonesia (4.77) and Vietnam (4.89). South Asia lags significantly from the rest of Asia, with the most efficient producer being Bangladesh (3.90). Even Japan and Korea lag significantly behind the world\u2019s most efficient producers such as Egypt (10.60), Greece (9,12) and the USA (7.69). However these figures only tell a par- tial story \u2013 as they ignore dynamic sources of comparative advantage. For instance, in 1961, China and Nepal had roughly compa- rable productivity (2.08 as opposed to 1.94 t/ha) but by 2006 China\u2019s productivity had nearly tripled to 6.27 t/ha whilst Nepal\u2019s had barely risen (to 2.72 t/ha). Moreover, even an examination of 1961 data (the earliest held by IRRI for most countries) tells only a partial story.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb13ba36-c8ec-48c3-8ac8-ea3921373202": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb13ba36-c8ec-48c3-8ac8-ea3921373202", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rebuilding International Food Policy Architecture", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9acd14e014b1bdbc3f0240cb0b88237e485ac20be2e075bdeaac69a47cf66ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "83fe0084-3afc-4dd2-a56d-abee49c15d1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rebuilding-international-food-policy-architecture", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ed9ffea71a3b36a2e75667cd391b71ae5ee16311adbba5fc089e7e9e6469637"}}, "hash": "40cef5fd8b956a3b09ef7d8d3356092141fe6753a8cf9c103eb8a5a3396a52b2", "text": "Relative- ly high productivity in developed countries such as the USA (3.82 t/ha) and Japan (4.88) were likely primarily a function of high in- put costs, including fertilizer use and skilled labour.

Introduction Since 2001 the world has experienced a dramatic surge in the prices of oil, metals and agricultural commodities. Prices of these commodities reached record highs in 2008. The prices of oil and metals, which increased steadily but incrementally during 2001-2003, started rising rapidly since 2003. The price of oil has increased by 400% over the last five years - from about $30 a barrel in early 2003 to around $145 in June 2008.1 Metals\u2019 prices have also soared five-fold over the past six years, a rise that is unprecedented. Though prices of some food and agricultural raw materials started increasing since 2004, prices of most agricultural items started rising only from 2005. Initially agricultural prices increased gradually. But these started to increase rapidly from the mid-2007. In the recent months, the prices for major food commodities such as food grains and vegetable oils have risen sharply to historic highs of about 60 % above levels of just 2 years ago. The increases in commodity prices have not been uniform. However, increases have been broad-based covering all major commodity groups in the last 3 years. The impact taken together is much higher than individual price developments. In recent months, there is debate over the factors that have contributed to the dramatic rise of commodity prices, as well as the relative importance of each of the various factors. A review of earlier studies on the subject suggests the following causes for the food price increase: \u2022 a combination of sustained higher economic growth, rapid urbanization and changes in the consumption pattern in developing regions in the last decade led to higher demand for commodities, particularly non-food commodities; \u2022 a combination of high fuel prices as well as subsides and legislative mandates to increase production of bio-fuels led to an increased demand for food grains and oilseeds in recent years; \u2217 This report was prepared by Thangavel Palanivel, Senior Advisor, UNDP/RCC with inputs from RCB (Nandita Mongia, and Balachandra Patil) on the issues related to oil prices, RCC (Kirs ty Hayes, Biplove Choudhary, Taimur Khilji, and Kazuyuki Uji) on food safety net systems, macro policy responses and HIV/AIDS, and David Abbott of Pacific Centre on issues related to the Pacific Islands. This report, which is precursor for a short policy note on the Soaring Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific, was prepared under overall guidance of Dr. Ajay Chhibber, UN Assistant Secretary General and UNDP/RBAP Director. It is part of a large effort in the UNDP Regional Centres in Asia and the Pacific to analyse policy relevant topics rigorously with the best available information to support policy advisory services to countries in the region. The work has been facilitated by Omar Noman, Marcia Kran, Martin Krause, Caitlin Wiesen, Deodat Maharaj and Tanni Mukhopadhyay.

Rising food and oil prices have a significant impact on the economy and households. The impact, however, varies across countries and population groups. At the macro level, the impact of higher food and oil prices on the countries are likely to be very diverse, depending upon whether countries are Net Food Importing (NFIM) and Net Food Exporting (NFEX) countries as well as the relative weight of food and oil imports and exports in total imports or total domestic consumption or total domestic production. Net food and fuel exporting countries can benefit from improved terms of trade. By contrast, net food and oil importing countries are likely to suffer (UNCTAD, 2008). Soaring international food and oil prices are expected to undermine current macroeconomic stability in net importing countries by affecting inflation, economic growth, and fiscal and trade balances. These impacts are transmitted through supply, demand and the terms of trade mechanisms. In the exporting countries, supply (economic growth) could be accelerated through higher exports and greater investment. In the net importing countries, supply could suffer as production and transportation costs rise in the wake of an oil price shock. Oil and food price shocks also cause domestic price level to rise. The extent of the rise in inflation will depend on the share of food and oil in the consumption basket, as well as on the \u2018second round\u2019 effects. Rising domestic inflation and resulting high interest rates might affect consumption and investment scenarios adversely. The squeeze on consumption and investment demand might also affect GDP adversely. The price shocks affect the fiscal situation in several ways. On the expenditure side, there are fiscal costs when food and oil-importing countries do not adjust domestic prices of food and petroleum products in line with border prices. Costs also rise when domestic prices adjust to world food and oil prices, and governments then raise social benefit payments or other transfers to moderate the impact on consumers. On the revenue side, there could be revenue loss due to lowering and exemption of VAT, import tariffs and other taxes to mitigate the impact of higher world and domestic prices for food and petroleum products. Increases in oil and food prices also affect exports, imports and trade balance in many ways. The trade balance is expected to improve in food and oil exporting countries through the terms of trade effect, and to worsen in commodity importing countries due loss of export competitiveness and an increasing import bill. In addition to the financial burden of higher food and energy import bills, potential constraints on imports of necessities like food and raw materials have also sparked energy and food security concerns among importing countries. 3 At the micro level, the impact of higher food and oil prices on the households are likely to be very diverse, depending upon the reasons for the price change and on the structure of the economy (Ivanic and Martin, 2008). The impact could also vary depending upon household incomes and expenditures patterns, products involved, and policy responses of governments (World Bank 2008). Households usually spend about 40-60 % of their incomes on food items and therefore rising food prices are expected to increase households\u2019 consumption expenditure significantly. On the other hand, the incomes of farm households may be increased by higher food prices. Overall the impact of price shocks depends on whether the gains to farming households outweigh the adverse impact on consuming households. The benefits of higher food prices to average farm households may be less due to the limited extent of their net sales of food items. Since the majority of households, including in rural areas, are net buyers of food, the increase in food prices generally affects household consumption adversely.2", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b15a733-6a1c-4104-bca9-5d772092525e": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b15a733-6a1c-4104-bca9-5d772092525e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "706556cf1a8811f55333b5f04b79e0f6bbf5a875382d50aeb01d78f3acb0d667"}}, "hash": "706556cf1a8811f55333b5f04b79e0f6bbf5a875382d50aeb01d78f3acb0d667", "text": "To maintain a basic diet, poor households, especially in urban areas, are forced to increase their food expenditures at the expense of non-food expenditures such as medical care and education. The increase in fuel price also affects households adversely through raising the cost of agricultural production. In addition, diverting food for bio-fuel production aggravates supply and demand imbalances. As poor households often spend about three fourths of their incomes on food, fuel and transport, soaring of food and oil prices jointly affect the poorest the most. This jeopardizes progress towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by risking gains made in reducing poverty and in increasing social cohesion. Hence, it is not surprising that increasing food and oil prices have triggered riots in many developing countries. In order to mitigate adverse impact on consumers, governments intervene in food and energy markets in a variety of ways. Some governments in the food and oil importing countries directly intervene to control the quantity of imports as well as their distribution and prices. Some other governments allow the private sector to import and distribute food and petroleum products freely, but set price ceilings and compensate private sector distributors to cover any losses. In exporting countries, governments often set domestic prices below world levels, imposing an opportunity cost on farmers. Governments can also use fiscal and trade policies actively to mitigate the adverse impact of rising global food and oil prices. When rising food and oil prices cause an increase in overall inflation, countries\u2019 Central banks may be prompted to react with monetary tightening. At the same time, governments and central banks also need to protect the interest of domestic producers. This complicates the policy making process, as policy makers have to tread a fine line between containing inflation and supporting the growth process. While many of these issues are global in nature, there may be significant interregional and country differences in the impact and policy responses. To assess the impact and policy options, it is necessary to understand the causes of the high prices. This study, therefore, first examines the causes of rising commodity prices and then assesses the consequences of higher food and oil prices, as well as available policy responses. This study complements, rather than draws upon, the considerable body of analysis of food prices that has been undertaken in recent months by the World Bank and others. Some of the anecdotal information provided may not stand up to close scrutiny. Nevertheless, the analysis does provide a flavour of some of the issues that countries and households are currently facing as a result of soaring global food and fuel prices. 2 This may not be so true in rural Pacific households where often two -thirds to three-quarters of food consumed by the rural poor is from own production. 4 Chart 1: Long-Term Trends in Commodity Price Indices 0 100 200 300 400 500 1960 1963 1966 1969 1972 1975 1978 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008 2000=100 Commodity Food Crude Oil Ag.Raw Metal This paper is thus organized as follows: To set the stage, recent trends in global food and oil prices as well as their long term trends are examined in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the causes of the recent surges in food and fuel prices by looking into global, regional (Asia- Pacific) and commodity specific factors. It also briefly looks into the future of food and oil markets in the context of the prospects of prices going forward or staying at higher level. Section 4 assesses the country and regional level macroeconomic impacts of rising food and oil prices on the economic growth, consumer price inflation, government revenue, public expenditure, fiscal balance, food and oil import bills, and current account balance in Asia- Pacific developing countries.3 This section also examines the extent to which increases in international food and oil prices have been transmitted to domestic prices in Asia and the Pacific countries. Section 5 assesses the household level impacts of the rise in food and oil prices, with a special focus on the incidence of poverty and inequality in Asia and the Pacific. Section 6 presents an overview of the policy responses adopted so far in Asia and the Pacific, with emphasis on fiscal, monetary and trade policies. Finally, section 7 provides some short- and long-term policy options at both national and regional levels to help mitigate the adverse impacts and take advantage of the emerging opportunities through investment aimed at improving productivity of agriculture and efficiency of energy consumption.

Trends in Commodity Prices 2.1. Long-Term Trends in commodity prices Let us examine the recent increase in commodity prices in a historical context based on the UNCTAD database. Chart 1 present the nominal price indices (2000=100) of major commodity groups - all commodity, food, crude oil, metals and agricultural raw materials from 1960 to 2008. Looking at historical price spikes, we notice the spikes in prices during the 1970s. It is clear from the chart that since 2001 there has been an upward trend in the nominal prices of major commodity groups. The current price spike like previous price shocks 1973-1974 and 1979-80 is broad-based covering all major commodity groups. The commodity price levels in recent years were generally higher than the previous peaks of the 1973-74, 1979-80 and mid-1990s. It is also clear that initially price indices started to rise gradually until 2005 and then climbing up rapidly. In 2008, price indices reached an all time high. 3 Due to data limitation, this assessment is done by a simple methodology of comparing pre and post price shock data instead of undertaking any comprehensive macroeconomic modelling exercise. 5 Chart 2 shows the nominal price for rice, wheat and maize4 over the period from 1960 to 2008. As seen, the recent price increases for rice, wheat and maize are quite dramatic and appear unparalleled over the past 50 years. Chart 2 also reveals that prices, particularly rice prices, have increased substantially during the early 1970s and early 1980s. The price indices in Chart 1 and 2 are in nominal terms, which may distort the picture. In order to get a more realistic impression of the burden commodity prices put on the economy and households, the price indices need to be adjusted for inflationary effects by an appropriate deflator.5 Since the US consumer price index captures better the changes in price of non-commodities and services, we use the US consumer price index as deflator. The deflated commodity price indices are given in Chart 3 and 4. Chart 3 shows that in real terms commodity prices were much higher in the past, especially during the years 1973-74 when OPEC countries imposed an oil embargo and during the years 1977-80- a period of very high inflation and negative political developments in Iran and Afghanistan. The 1973-74 event stands out. From 1972 to 1974 the price in real terms displayed a huge increase. The price remained at a high level for a few years, but eventually returned to its previous low levels in 1977. It is clear that since 1970s commodity prices (in comparison to the price of non-commodities and services) 4 Maize and corn are used interchangeably in this paper 5 The choice of deflator may be important in examining re al commodity price movements. Alternatives such as the CPI or GDP deflator or index of unit value of global exports will yield different estimates.

But crude oil, the current prices in real terms are higher than those of earlier occasions. The current price in real terms is some 35 % above the earlier record high of 1979 (IMF 2008). Commodity prices in real terms have been much higher in the past, but they were also significantly lower in the 1980s and 1990s compared to current levels.

Since 1973-74, food prices have declined reaching an all-time low around 2000. In real terms, the recent price spike is less pronounced for rice, wheat and maize compared to 1973-74. Chart 5 plots the annual change (i.e., percentage change over previous year) in the real commodity price indices for the period 1961 to 2008. As the Chart makes clear, recent increases in commodity prices are clearly not without precedent. Indeed, the 46 % rise that the commodity price index registered in 2008, the largest year-over- year increase in the current cycle, seems small compared to the 61 % spikes that occurred in 1973-1974. Similarly, the 36 % rise in the real food price index in 2008 is lower compared to the 68 % spikes in 1973-1974. This suggests that the year- over-year change in food prices in the recent years has not been as extreme as in 1973-1974. Chart 6 presents the annual change in the real prices of rice, wheat and maize for the period 1961 to 2008. The rate of increase in the rice price in 2008 is more or less matched with that of rice price spike in 1973-1974. However, the same is not the case for wheat and maize. For wheat, the 75 % rise in prices in 2008 is much higher compared to the 50 % spike in 1973-1974. The rate of increase in the price of maize in 2008 is also high compared to historical rises. It is also clear that the current price shock has two Chart 5: Annual Changes in the Real Prices of Commodities -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 1961 1963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 % Commodity Food AG.Raw Metal Chart 7: Annual Changes in the Price of Crude Oil -80 -40 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 280 1961 1963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 % 7 phases: a gradual increase in basic food prices from 2003 to 2006 and then a rapid acceleration in price after 2007. Chart 7 plots the annual change in the real prices of crude oil for the period 1961 to 2008. The figure shows that the price of oil jumped sharply twice in the 1970s. In 1973-74, oil prices increased by an incredible 222% in real terms and 257 % in nominal terms. In this sense, the present price level is not unique. The increase in oil prices during 2003-08 occurred relatively gradually, allowing countries more time to adjust. For example, the oil prices in real terms rose by 13 % in 2003, 27 % in 2004 and 37% in 2005. Then it was decelerated to 16 and 8 % in 2007, before rising by a dramatic 69% in 2008. Though the real commodity prices have declined over the last four decades until recently, Charts 5 to 7 also confirm that volatility has increased in the recent decade. Volatility as measured by the annual changes in the real commodity prices over the past few decades reveals that volatility in the last decade is higher than in the 1980s and 1990s. Long term trends reveals that since 2001 commodity markets have been booming and the prices of commodities have reached new record highs during 2008. The exact beginning of the boom differs for each commodity. The rise in oil and metals prices started from 2003. Similarly, though prices of some agricultural commodities started increasing from 2004, prices of most agricultural items started rising only 2005 onwards. But it is clear that the price indices of all major commodity groups - foods, crude oil, metals and agricultural raw materials - have been increasing together over the last 3 years. In this regard, one can say that the current commodity price boom has been broad as it includes oil, metals, major Chart 10: Price level in 2008 compared to 2006 level, and to 2003 level (%) -50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 2006-08 2003-08 Chart 9: Monthly Changes in the Prices of Food and Crude oil (YoY basis) -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 2001-Jan 2001-Jul 2002-Jan 2002-Jul 2003-Jan 2003-Jul 2004-Jan 2004-Jul 2005-Jan 2005-Jul 2006-Jan 2006-Jul 2007-Jan 2007-Jul 2008-Jan 2008-Jul Food Crude Oil Chart 8: Recent Trends in Prices of Food & Crude Oil 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 2001-Jan 2001-Jul 2002-Jan 2002-Jul 2003-Jan 2003-Jul 2004-Jan 2004-Jul 2005-Jan 2005-Jul 2006-Jan 2006-Jul 2007-Jan 2007-Jul", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a5647c-99ca-455f-a2f8-17cfa1d90303": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a5647c-99ca-455f-a2f8-17cfa1d90303", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c3b2462c66e5ea1d9cdd3ac46509976b6f402a74d852f8a74fe556d06283c05"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a10f4bc-c832-4f54-a183-365b79cc3a3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f7377a9fa689f18b734048481e7a30e2009ccd74476dd39cccba7116b755b32"}}, "hash": "1e82b271e7b5f3ae3c37bbc579cf85936c44d13cfc8cb9eed25de3ee8e1c4b2e", "text": "2008-Jan 2008-Jul Crude oil :US$ per Barrel 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 Food price Index: 2005=100 Crude-oil Food 8 Chart 11: Recent Trends in the Prices of Cereals 0 200 400 600 800 1000 2001-Jan 2001-Jul 2002-Jan 2002-Jul 2003-Jan 2003-Jul 2004-Jan 2004-Jul 2005-Jan 2005-Jul 2006-Jan 2006-Jul 2007-Jan 2007-Jul 2008-Jan 2008-Jul US$ per tonne Rice Wheat Maize food crops, and some beverages.

Recent Trends in Food and Fuel Prices Now let us examine the recent (since 2001) trends in commodity prices. Chart 8 shows the development in the monthly average world market price of food and crude oil in the period January 2001 \u2013 July 2008. Chart 9 presents monthly changes (YoY basis) in the prices of food and crude oil. There has been a significant increase in the food prices in the last two years \u2013 Following a steady increase in 2002-03, the IMF food price index rose by 14% in 2004. In 2005 it has remained more or less constant. In 2006, it increased rapidly by 10%. This increasing tendency further accelerated in 2007 and 2008 due to continued demand for bio fuels and drought in major food producing countries. This means that the food price index increased 15 % in 2007 and 42 % in 2008. Food price index increased by 57% over the 12 months period -between March 2007 and March 2008. The index value in 2008 had increased by 55% compared to the level just two years ago. Over the last five years, it has risen by 92% (chart 10). The price of oil has risen significantly \u2013From a relative \u201clow\u201d price of US$ 20 per barrel in December 2001, monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude Oil rose to $30 a barrel in early 2003. The price of crude oil reached US$ 53 in October 2004 and US$74 per barrel in July 2006. It remained around US$70 in mid-2007, but it started rising rapidly to reach more than US$ 140 per barrel in mid-2008. It is clear that oil prices began their ascent in 2003, about the same time as other commodity prices. Over the last 5 years, the oil price has quadrupled. The oil price level in 2008 has increased by 75% compared to the level just 2 years before. Extreme volatility of oil prices \u2013 Unlike previous decades, the world has experienced a high volatility in oil price movements in the recent years. After surging to a then record US$77 per barrel in July 2006, the price of Chart 12: Monthly Changes in the Prices of Cereals (YoY basis) -50 0 50 100 150 200 250 2001-Jan 2001-Jul 2002-Jan 2002-Jul 2003-Jan 2003-Jul 2004-Jan 2004-Jul 2005-Jan 2005-Jul 2006-Jan 2006-Jul 2007-Jan 2007-Jul 2008-Jan 2008-Jul % Rice Wheat Maize 9 crude fell sharply reaching close to US$50 per barrel in January 2007, only to take off again in the next eighteen months and enter uncharted territory beyond US$145 per barrel in July 2008. Though the expectations were that prices would cross US$150 a barrel, the reverse happened. With the world economies reeling under the fear of recession, the resulting decline in price is also equally sharp and has gone down below US$ 70 in October 2008. Experience in recent years implies that any reasonable predictions on future oil prices can not be made. The price of cereals rose sharply -Cereals are the basic food commodities and on average they comprise about 46 % of the daily human calorie consumption in the world (FAO, 2003). Furthermore, cereals are a mainstay of animal feed from where meat and dairy products are derived. Even prices of other crops such as oilseeds are related to cereals prices through the competition for agricultural land.

Prices on dairy products also rose sharply on the recent years \u2013 96% during 2006-08 and 158% during 2003-08. Meat product prices also rose, but not to the same extent. For example, beef and pork prices rose only by less than 5 % in the last two years. Among the food items, only the price of sugar has declined (by 16 %) in the last two years. However, sugar price rose dramatically during 2003-06 and as a result it increased by 79% since 2003. It is clear that prices on cereals, dairy products and oils and fats had the highest growth rates, whereas meat prices have yet to show similar trends. To sum up, the above analysis shows that from the mid-1970s until recently, commodity prices have tended to decline relative to the price of other outputs, although with considerable volatility. This declining trend in real prices has been reversed since 2001. Since then, the prices of oil and agricultural commodities have risen substantially. Although the real price of commodities has nearly doubled since the recent trough in 2001, the index of real prices is still lower than it was in 1973-74. In other words, nominal commodity prices have risen less than the prices of most other goods and services over the past three decades. The year-on-year rise in commodity prices is not unprecedented. However, the rise in the food prices indices has been much more dramatic in the last one year. Following a steady increase of 25% between 2003 and 2006, the FAO food price index rose by 57% between March 2007 and March 2008. Developments in the markets for the three staple commodities maize, wheat and rice have been particularly dramatic with world market prices in April 2008 reaching respectively 164%, 187% and 437% of their levels 12 months before. Despite rapid increases, food prices are still, in real terms, on average lower than they were for example in the 1970s. The current food price shocks have two phases: a gradual increase in food prices during 2003-07 and a rapid acceleration in price increases after the mid 2007. The current commodity price shocks are unusual in several ways.

Nonetheless, the current boom, like its predecessors, will be reversed eventually as supply responses gain momentum, particularly in agricultural commodities, where long-term supply elasticity is relatively higher compared to crude oil. The price shock has also been accompanied by much higher price volatility than in the past, especially in the cereals and oilseeds sectors, highlighting the prevalence of greater uncertainty in the food markets. The oil prices have started moving down in the last 2 or 3 months. With the world economies reeling under the fear of recession, the resulting decline in price is also equally sharp and has gone down below US$ 70 in October 2008. Though the recent decline in prices has turned out be some kind of a solace for the countries of the region, the sharp increase US$ exchange rates with local currencies has negated some of these gains. Any suggested policy measures need to be robust enough to perform beneficially in the events of both oil price rise and decline.

Underlying causes of food and oil price rises 3.1 Underlying causes of food price rises It is clear from section 2 that prices of food items have experienced a rapid increase over the last two years. Obviously the next question that needs to be examined is why food prices have gone up so dramatically? Recently, a number of studies attempted to analyze the underlying factors behind the soaring food prices. A review of earlier studies on the subject points to a complex set of supply and demand factors along with some trade and exchange rate factors. Most of the past studies recognize that the factors that were listed in the first page of the paper have contributed, either directly or indirectly, to soaring global food prices. But there are different opinions largely based on differing ideologies, as regards to the relative importance of these factors. An objective analysis is the only way to defuse these ideological claims. This section therefore attempts to provide such an objective assessment based on empirical evidence of the major driving forces of the rising international food prices. First let us analyze the factors that have affected the demand for food commodities. Changing consumption pattern \u2013 One of the demand factors that has been widely cited is the higher income and rapid urbanization in developing countries. Along with an absolute increase in the size of population, these changes in developing countries have all lead to growing food demand and dietary transition from cereals toward more animal protein. As per capita income rises and rapid urbanization takes place, people in developing countries are expected to increase per capita consumption of food grains by diversifying their diets towards meat and milk products. Although the household consumption of cereals tends to decline with rising incomes and the urbanization process, the use of grains as feed in livestock production increases, generating a net expansion in cereal demand. This is because it takes about 6-7 kilograms of grain to produce a single kilogram of meat (such as beef and pork). Thus the dietary shift from high dependency on grains towards meat and dairy products would be expected to increase overall demand for food grains. In the context, many studies argued that emerging and developing economies have been the main source of the growing demand for food commodities and for soaring global food prices.

This would have changed the consumer preferences towards meat and milk products. \u2022 The world\u2019s population growth rate has been trending down in the last two decades; this declining trend applies to nearly all regions of the world. In the recent decades, the population of Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean has grown at almost the same pace, but at half the rate of Africa region (Chart 17). However, the number of people in developing regions is still rising by about 70-75 million per year. This rising population adds to the global demand for food and other products. \u2022 The growth rate of global production and consumption of meat products has been decelerated since 1996 (a period associated with higher GDP growth in the developing regions) compared to the period 1981-95 due to the slow down in global population growth. However, global meat consumption has still risen much more rapidly than consumption of food grains. During 1996 and 2008, consumption of meat products in the world increased by 2.5 % per year compared to 1.7 % observed for food grains. Since this was well above the world\u2019s population growth, per capita consumption of meat products must have increased. Available data do confirm that growth in meat production and Chart 17: Population Growth in the Regions & World 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 % World EAP LAC SA SSA Chart 18: Growth Rate of Production & Consumption of Meat Products -3 0 3 6 9 12 EA SA SEA AP LAC SSA MENA USSR DC NA EU Oceania World % Pro 81-95 Pro 96-08 Con 81-95 Con 96-08 Chart 19: Growth Rate of Production & Consumption of Dairy Products -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 EA SA AP LAC DC NA EU Oceania World % Pro 81-95 Pro 96-08 Con 81-95 Con 96-08 13 consumption has accelerated in most of developing and developed regions. The growth of meat production and consumption, however, has decelerated for developing regions as a whole mainly due to a strong deceleration experienced in East Asia. This (deceleration in meat consumption growth in East Asia) may be due to rapid slow down in population growth in China. \u2022 Growth rate of global consumption of dairy products has accelerated since 1996 in both developing countries as well as the world. The acceleration is more visible in East Asia. Available data also confirm that the growth rate in dairy production has also accelerated in developing regions and in the world. \u2022 Livestock feed account for around 65 % of total demand for maize, compared to 17 % of wheat and just 2 % of rice demand. This suggests that the higher growth in consumption of meat is likely to have the largest direct effect on consumption of maize rather than that of wheat and rice. Globally maize consumption indeed has increased at a faster rate (3.2%) during 1996-208 compared to the rate (1.8%) observed for1981-95. Available data, however, does not seem to support the argument that these changes have led to higher growth in the demand for maize in developing regions during the recent period. For example, in Asia and the Pacific as well as in Latin America and Caribbean, the annual growth in the corn (maize) consumption has decelerated from 3.3 % during 1981-95 to 2.8 % during 1996-08. Sub-Saharan Africa has also experienced a similar deceleration in corn consumption growth \u2013 from 2.9 % to 2.4% for the same period. This shows that although demand for animal products has increased recently, a corresponding increase has not taken place for animal feed in developing countries. The fact that there was no surge in use of corn for feeding in developing regions in the recent years implies that most livestock in developing countries are still feed mainly on crop by- products, household waste, and open grazing areas (Chart 20). The rate of growth in production and consumption of food grains has accelerated in the world since 1996 compared to 1981-1995 period. However, for developing countries as a whole, the rate of growth in foodgrains consumption has accelerated, Chart 20: Growth Rate of Production & Consumption of Corn -2 0 2 4 6 EA SA SEA AP LAC SSA MENA DC NA EU Oceania World % Pro 81-95 Pro 96-08 Con 81-95 Con 96-08 Chart 21: Growth rate of production & consumption of food grains -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 EA SA SEA", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cfbcd38-8865-4622-8338-8bc6b7770f1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cfbcd38-8865-4622-8338-8bc6b7770f1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8a2d2f06f7938a66f46c356f1729b2b62c59185b217dcef6e22669f245f66a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d36f5f6-f4a9-42f0-af35-7265045eb031", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9737694ccc7c8187d230e04a2695608bedc2f9a8d719a409c9519544dd45f8b3"}}, "hash": "4b0c194c945b44f6b2e7f9e72bfc8ec02a06bb41fc97532e93a6ae55701b2300", "text": "AP LAC SSAMENAUSSR DC NA EUOceaniaWorld % Pro 81-95 Pro 96-08 Con 81-95 Con 96-08 14 despite deceleration in the growth rate of foodgrains production for the same period. Asia and the Pacific experienced strong deceleration in both food grains production and consumption. Latin America and Caribbean experienced strong deceleration in food grains consumption, but witnessed strong acceleration in the rate of growth of production. Sub- Saharan Africa witnessed acceleration in the growth of foodgrains production and consumption. The annual growth in the overall food grains consumption has decelerated in the Asia-Pacific - from 2.3 % during 1981-95 to 1.3 % during 1996-08. The situation for edible oil demand is also somewhat different since 1996\u2013 particularly in South Asia. There has been a significant deceleration in growth rate of edible oil production, while growth rate of consumption of edible oil products (oilseed, meals and oils) has accelerated dramatically resulting in huge imports of edible oil (Chart 22). As there has been a deceleration in consumption growth of maize and food grains (even after adjusting for animal feed) in many developing regions including Asia-Pacific, changes in per capita incomes and urbanization in developing regions arguably have not contributed for recent soaring of global food prices. Many experts and political leaders have suggested that growing prosperity in China and India as one of the reasons for rising food prices. But our analysis shows that the impact of these factors on food prices may be minimal and indirect. This is because (i) the demand for food items in China and India is in fact increasing at a much lower rate than the rest of the world, and (ii) they meet their slowly rising consumption demand through domestic production rather than imports (see Box 1).

Even some reputed economists seem to have fallen for this simplistic assertion in suggesting that China and India are contributing to rising food prices around the world.

Yet, available information indicates that the quantity of grains consumed has been declining rapidly with a rise in real per capita income in both China and India. The per capita annual consumption of cereals declined from 131 kg to 76 kg in urban China, and from 262 to 206 kg in rural China between 1990 and 2006. Similarly, the per capita annual consumption of cereals declined from 145 kg to 124 kg in urban India, and from 189 kg to 156 kg in rural India between 1988 and 2002. Some years ago experts have pointed out this paradox (i.e., higher incomes correlating with lower consumption of food grains). For example, Prof C.H. Hanumantha Rao 6 has found that the rural Indian poor were able to hold on to their former consumption levels, if they wanted to do so, but preferred to alter their consumption baskets in favour of other consumption items. The absolute drop in the per capita consumption of cereals in quantity terms was particularly pronounced as people moved from the lower to the middle levels of per capita consumption expenditure. Second, higher incomes in China and India mean higher consumption of meat products, which implies higher consumption of food grain\u2014as it takes about 6-7 kg of grain to produce 1 kg of meat. It is true higher incomes have made millions of people rich enough to afford meat and other foods. In 1990 the average rural Chinese ate 11 kg of meat a year; now he eats more than 17kg. In urban area, Chinese meat consumption has increased from 22 to 24 KG over the last 15 years. In this regard, China does play a dominant role in the world meat consumption. In India, per capita consumption of meats and fish rose from 20 kg to 24 kg in urban areas, and from 9 kg to 15 kg in rural households (Table 1). The rising incomes in these countries have not only led to more meat products, but more importantly led more consumption of milk, fruits, vegetables, and edible oils. The consumption of these items (dairy, fruits, vegetables and edible oil) has risen steadily as Chinese and Indian consumers improved their incomes. When it comes to meat consumption, India is different compared to China. India has a large vegetarian population, which limits rise in meat consumption. In India, beef and pork are not widely accepted partially due to religious preferences. But beef, pork and mutton are also expensive compared to poultry. In this regard, price also remains an important factor. Consequently, in India, consumption of poultry meat is growing faster than consumption of any other animal products (pork, beef, and mutton) in the last two decades. The share of dairy products in consumption has also increased in both rural and urban regions over this period: from 18.6% to 21.3% in urban households and from 14.3% to 17.4% in rural areas. This led to doubling of aggregate milk demand in India during the last two decades. Indian milk consumption amounted to 13% of the world's total and one third of milk consumption in all developing countries. As demand for milk products grows, livestock producers are likely to increase their use of cereal feeds. But as of now, only less than 10 million tons of cereals (less than 5 % of total cereal production) in India are fed to livestock each year\u2014most livestock still feed primarily on crop by-products, household waste, and open grazing areas. Moreover, China and India has been a net exporter of cereals in the last decade. China has been a net 6 in a paper `Declining demand for food grains in rural India: Causes and Explanations' 17 importer of food grains only one season - 2004-05. Similarly, India has been a net importer of cereals only once, in the 2006-07 season. In this context, the impact of China and India on world cereal prices may be minimal and indirect. However, as the consumption of meat, soybeans, edible oils and mineral products such as crude oil, steel, cement, aluminium and copper has increased rapidly in China a nd India, this could have contributed indirectly to increased food prices (The Economist, March 2008). Though both China and India witnessed a significant increase in their imports of oilseed, meals and edible oils in the last decade, there is no evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the imports from this source to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d9c6119-2c50-4c2c-8097-dc5d9d2b2d64": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d9c6119-2c50-4c2c-8097-dc5d9d2b2d64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2f8ed88e54c05615f1f392ff2439ab50a0d90332ed4b166740daff13a8b8e7c"}}, "hash": "b2f8ed88e54c05615f1f392ff2439ab50a0d90332ed4b166740daff13a8b8e7c", "text": "indicate that they have contributed to the recent price hike for oilseeds, meals or oils (FAO 2008). Since the change in diet in China and India has been slow and incremental, it cann ot explain the dramatic global food price movements of the past year. Increased bio fuels production has increased the demand for food commodities. Food and fuel prices have been increasingly inter-wined. High fuel prices have made agricultural production more expensive by raising the cost of food production and transportation. However, the main link between food and fuel prices is the competition between grain and oil seed for human food and animal feed, and their use for bio fuels. When crude oil prices started to increase from 2003, countries began to raise their bio fuel production. Brazil, a long-term player, accounts for a significant portion of the world\u2019s ethanol production and its production based on sugar cane. The U. S, which also accounts for the majority of world\u2019s ethanol production, mainly uses corn as a feedstock. The EU, the largest bio diesel producer, uses rapeseed oil is feedstock. China produces ethanol initially by using corn and wheat, but is now attempting to use cassava and sweet potatoes (Rosen and Shapouri, 2008). The issue is not limited to which crops and how much of them are used for bio fuels instead of food and feed, but how much planting area is diverted from producing other crops to those used as feedstock for production of bio fuels. For example, high maize prices since mid-2006 encouraged farmers in the US to plant more maize in 2007. Maize plantings increased by nearly 18 % in 2007 by reducing land allocated to soybeans and wheat.7 The decreasing level of production of wheat and soybeans was one reason for their sharp price increases in 2007. The surge in wheat prices is reflected in rice prices because wheat and rice are substitutes for each other. 7 Maize and rice are not in direct competition for land as they have different climatic requirements. Moreover, as rice is not used for bio fuel production and rice land is not easily switched to biofuel crops, the impact of biofuel use on rice market is less when compared to maize or oilseeds markets. 18 Historically, the amount of grain used to produce bio energy has been a small percentage of the global grain consumption. In the 1990s, the annual increase in grain used to produce bio fuel was relatively low. But in recent years this trend has been accelerated dramatically. The use of maize for ethanol grew especially rapidly from 2004 to 2007. The utilization of cereals globally for ethanol production has more than doubled in the last four years \u2013 from 43 million in 2004-05 to 95 million in 2007-08. In 2008-09, it is projected to increase to 124 million. It increased by 32% in 2007-08 and an estimated 31% in 2008-09 (Table 2). Between 2004 and 2007, use of maize for animal feed, which accounts for 65 % of global maize use, grew by only 1.5 % per year while maize use for ethanol grew by 36 % per year. This suggests that the emerging bio fuels market is a new and significant source of demand for maize, oil seeds and other agricultural commodities. The increase in demand for these commodities has been one of the leading factors behind the increase in their prices in world markets which, in turn, has led to higher food prices. A few studies attempted to apportion the share of the price increases that can be attributed to bio fuels. For example, The IMF estimated that the increased demand for bio fuels accounted for 70% of the increase in maize prices and 40% of the increase in soybean prices (Lipsky, 2008). Collins (2008) estimated that the increased demand for bio fuels accounted for 60% of the increase in maize prices for the period 2006-08. Rosegrant et al. (2008) calculated the increase demand bio fuel accounted for 30 % of the increase in real cereals prices, 39% of the increase in real maize prices, 22 of the increase in real wheat prices and 21% of the real rice prices for the period 2000-07. These increases in nominal prices of these commodities are much higher. The USDA also attributed much of the increase in farm prices of maize and soybeans to bio fuel production (Glauber, 2008). Estimates differ widely due to differences in time periods, prices, and food items considered. Despite all the differences, these studies unambiguously reveal that increased demand for bio fuel production is indeed a major driver of soaring", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45b68b52-ef78-4a50-870c-74ba934e1a3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "45b68b52-ef78-4a50-870c-74ba934e1a3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37161f62ef82d482100ab53ab8893d14fcbacf1d37f3677f30696ee8174bd6bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "342986a3-1129-4cbf-a501-849c5bc4a260", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbc73cfdcdc0bcf4ce6332cd3b63e51fd07f25f8b6a045b12860e53620ec36ba"}}, "hash": "dd1964d37a25637c009ac7fb3f1c30f513c05084cac05441993530d448b25e6b", "text": "global food prices. A recent World Bank paper (Mitchell 2008) has concluded that the most important factor for soaring global food prices was the large increase in bio fuel production from grains and oilseeds in the U.S. and EU. Without these increases, the paper added that \u201cglobal wheat and maize stocks would not have declined appreciably and price increases due to other demand and supply factors would have been moderate. Land use changes in wheat exporting countries in response to increased cultivation of oilseeds for bio diesel production limited expansion of wheat production that could have otherwise prevented the large declines in global wheat stocks and the resulting rise in wheat prices. The rapid rise in oilseed prices was caused mostly by demand for bio diesel production in response to incentives provided by policy Table 2: Utilization of Cereals for Ethanol production (2004/05 - 2008/09) 2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/081) 2008/092) change in 2007/08 over 2006/07 change in 2008/09 over 2007/08 in Million Tons % % USA - All crops 34.1 41.3 54.5 76.8 101.7 40.9 32.4 USA \u2013 Corn 33.6 40.7 53.8 76.2 100.4 41.6 31.8 EU-27 1.1 3.2 3.4 2.9 5.2 -14.7 79.3 Canada 0.5 0.7 1.5 1.8 2.5 20.0 38.9 China 6.5 9.5 11.0 11.5 12.0 4.5 4.3 Other countries 0.8 1.1 1.4 1.9 2.4 35.7 26.3 Total 43.0 55.8 71.8 94.9 123.8 32.2 30.5 1) estimate, 2) projection Source: International Grain Council, June 2008 and Joachim von Braun (2008), Bio fuels, International Food Prices, and the Poor, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Washington D.C, 19 changes in the EU beginning in 2001 and in the U.S. beginning in 2004. The large increase in rice prices was largely a response to the increase in wheat prices rather than to changes in rice production or stocks, and was thus indirectly related to the increase in bio fuels. Recent export bans on grains and speculative activity would probably not have occurred without the large price increases due to bio fuels production because they were largely responses to rising prices\u201d. The paper also showed that Brazilian ethanol production from sugar cane has not contributed appreciably to the recent increase in food commodities prices, because Brazilian sugar cane production has increased rapidly and sugar exports have nearly tripled since 2000. Brazil\u2019s share of global sugar exports increased from 20 % in 2000 to 40 % in 2007, and that was sufficient to keep sugar price increases small (Mitchell 2008). Even with record high fuel prices, grain-based bio fuel production would be significantly smaller if it was not driven by subsidies and mandates. Ethanol subsidies range from about US$0.30 to US$1.00 per litre, while the range of bio diesel subsidies is somewhat wider (FAO, 2008). Imposing mandatory blending targets (e.g. mandating that gasoline contains a minimum of 5 % bio ethanol) also encourage bio fuels production. Supply side factors It is clear from the above that demand for agricultural commodities has increased sharply in the last decade - mainly due to bio fuels production. Now let us analyse the supply side factors. At the macro level agricultural output expanded globally by an average of 2.0 % a year over the last 25 years, more than the population growth of 1.6 % a year. Developing countries achieved much faster agricultural growth (2.6 % a year) than developed countries (0.9 % a year) for the same period. The Asian economies accounted for two-thirds of the developing world\u2019s agricultural growth. This growth is mainly driven by increasing productivity rather than increasing land area (WDR 2008). Since 1996, however, agricultural growth, particularly food grains output growth has been decelerated substantially in Asia and the Pacific - from 2.7% per year in 1981-95 to 1.4 % per year in 1996-2008. Though deceleration in food grains growth has been broad based covering all sub-regions in Asia and the Pacific, the extent of deceleration was relatively high in East Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "342986a3-1129-4cbf-a501-849c5bc4a260": {"__data__": {"id_": "342986a3-1129-4cbf-a501-849c5bc4a260", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37161f62ef82d482100ab53ab8893d14fcbacf1d37f3677f30696ee8174bd6bd"}, "2": {"node_id": "45b68b52-ef78-4a50-870c-74ba934e1a3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd1964d37a25637c009ac7fb3f1c30f513c05084cac05441993530d448b25e6b"}}, "hash": "fbc73cfdcdc0bcf4ce6332cd3b63e51fd07f25f8b6a045b12860e53620ec36ba", "text": "Fortunately as seen earlier food grains consumption growth also decelerated substantially in the last decade in Asia and the Pacific\u2013 from 2.3 % per annum in 1981-1995 to 1.3 % per annum in 1996-2008. This is contrast to agricultural performance in other developing regions in the world. For example, the growth in good grains production has accelerated in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and Caribbean regions. Consequently food grains growth for developing regions as a whole has accelerated since 1996 compared to the period 1981-95. The deceleration in the growth rate in food grains production in the recent years in Asia and the Pacific has been caused by declining or only small expansion in cultivated areas as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a560c248-c191-4d3e-9cd1-9fed2613be7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a560c248-c191-4d3e-9cd1-9fed2613be7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "545cbac13868cdc69d0efefcc96514259b402ab5aa520eadcd086d5cabb30e1a"}, "3": {"node_id": "89c41164-2983-4f47-80d3-77135f90d253", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2abd4f75e75457bb8e9b769df105e47730a8f558683095344ad792ec9c374a0"}}, "hash": "7fc8a088b46b93aa402941a0f4b9f39b9813cd7d03ceef30c6fb1ff121960df6", "text": "well Chart 23: Productivity of Food Grains 0 1 2 3 4 5 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 Yield (MT/HA) EA SA SEA SSA World 20 as relatively slow growth in agricultural productivity (yields per hectare). In Asia and the Pacific, growth in productivity has contributed much more to the growth in food grains production in the 1970s and 1980s. But during the last decade, the rate of productivity growth slowed down in almost all the regions, particularly in East Asia. Asia and the Pacific aggregate yield growth averaged 2.0 % per year in the 1970s and 1980s, but declined to 1.1 % from 1996 onwards (Chart 23). This suggests that the deceleration in the growth in productivity of food grains production is an important supply side factor that has had a significant impact on markets recently.

(2006) Public Spending in Developing Countries: Trends, Determination and Impact (mimeo). Table 3 shows that Asia and the Pacific\u2019s accounts about 85 % of spending on agriculture by developing regions. However, as a share of Agricultural GDP, agricultural spending is lower in Asia and the Pacific compared to Latin America and Caribbean region. However, Asia- Pacific share is considerably higher than that of Africa. Moreover, Asia and the Pacific is the only region where spending on agriculture increased relative to Agricultural GDP over the period. However, agriculture\u2019s share of total government spending declined in Asia and the Pacific - from 14.8 % in 1980 to 8.6 % in 2002. Other developing regions have also experienced similar decline in the agriculture\u2019s share of total government expenditures. The decline in agriculture\u2019s share of expenditure is in stark contrast to the strong growth in health and education spending in all regions. This is largely driven by the prioritisation of social sector spending within poverty reduction strategies (Fan and Saurkar, 2006). Donors\u2019 aid to agriculture has also declined in the recent years. Many of RBAP country case studies and regional thematic studies on the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction (e.g., Pasha and Palanivel, 2004) suggest that the deceleration in agricultural output and productivity in the last decade has been mainly due to the reductions in public investment in agriculture. These studies pointed out that during the 1990s the share of government spending on agriculture has declined sharply in many Asian countries. For example, it has fallen in Indonesia from over 16 % in the mid-1980\u2019s to only 4 % in recent years, from 11 % to 4 % in Sri Lanka, from 19 % to 11 % in Nepal, and so on (Chart 24). In Pakistan, share of development expenditure (which includes agriculture) in the total public expenditure has declined from 8.6 % in 1981 to 6.4 % in 1990 to 2.5 % in the recent years. India also witnessed a similar decline.

The greatest impact on agricultural productivity comes from investment in rural roads, irrigation, village electrification, and from outlays on agricultural research and development and extension. The decline in agricultural productivity may also be an outcome of the long-term decline in real prices of foodgrains.

Together, Australia, EU and USA produced 57 million tons less wheat and coarse grains in 2006 compared to 2005. Flooding in parts of South Asia reduced rice production in 2007. Consequently global food grains production declined by 1.3% in 2006, but there was a significant increase (4.7%) in 2007. Droughts reduced Australian grain exports by an average of 9-10 million tons per year in 2006 and 2007 compared to 2005, and poor crops production level in the EU and Ukraine reduced their exports by an additional 10 million tons in 2007. However, these declines were more than offset by higher growth in Argentina, Kazakhstan, Russia and the U.S. Total grain exports from these countries increased by about 22 million tons in 2007 compared to 2006. The quick supply response for cereals in 2007 came at the expense of reducing land allocated to oilseeds in some countries. The 2006 weather problems aggravated an existing situation of low stocks in many food commodities even further and helped to trigger the rapid rise in food prices. The gradual reduction in the level of food grains stocks since 2000 is another supply side factor that has had a significant impact on markets recently. Countries such as India reduced foodgrains stocks to reduce fiscal cost. International agencies particularly IFIs also encouraged such a move because of the perceived opportunity cost of holding big foodgrains stocks. This combination (trends of decelerating demand expansion with ever higher deceleration in production expansion) contributed to declining global demand for stocks of grains and oilseeds since 2000. The levels of food grains stock both at the globally and regionally have declined (Chart 25). Weather induced supply shocks in 2006 at recent low stock levels helped set the stage for rapid price hikes. Crude oil and its products are important inputs in agricultural production. Fossil fuels are not only used in powering farm machinery, but are also important inputs in the production of Chart 25: Food Grains Stocks as % of Consumption in the World 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 1981 1984 1987 1990 1993 1996 1999 2002 2005 2008 % Rice Wheat Corn Food grains 22 fertilizers and transportation of food grains. Available data show that fertilizer prices have risen enormously in recent years. Over the years, energy intensity of the agricultural sector has increased the cost of critical inputs like fertilizer, fuel, and power. In this context, rising energy prices and energy intensity of the agricultural production and thus increased production cost are additional supply side factor that could have also pushed food prices higher. The energy share of total crop production costs varies from country to country and from crop to crop, but available evidence indicates that it goes as high as 43 % (OECD 2006). Some studies conclude that oil prices and rising production and transportation costs have helped drive current food price increases. But many of these impacts occur with a significant lag. Higher crude oil prices have definitely pushed up the cost of agricultural production, but the long-term impact of these increases has yet to be felt. Short-term policy actions and exchange rate swings The explosive developments in the price of rice witnessed during the first four months of 2008 cannot be explained by market fundamentals alone (i.e. changes in demand and supply). The situation is mainly explained by a sense of panic spreading among the major rice exporting and importing countries (Slayton and Timmer, 2008). Short-term policy actions by some countries to isolate their domestic markets and protect their own consumers through export restraints also made the situation worse, as these measures (export bans and increased export taxes) exacerbated the short-run volatility of international food prices as well as increased uncertainty in the international food market. For example, faced with rising domestic prices and stimulated by events in other cereal markets, mainly wheat, rice exporting countries such as Cambodia, China, India, Pakistan and Viet Nam imposed export restrictions during September 2007 to April 2008. These export bans and price controls reduced supplies in the world rice markets and increased uncertainty about future rice supplies, contributing significantly to the surge in rice price especially since October 2007.8 Wheat exporting countries such as Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan also imposed such bans. However, some of these restrictions have been withdrawn recently. Nonetheless, this contributed to wheat price volatility and uncertainty in the international wheat market. Exchange Rate movements Most commodities, including food grains and crude oil, are priced in U.S. dollars, but are purchased in the local currency.

As the dollar lost value relative to the currency of an importing country, it reduced that country\u2019s cost of importing.

In a move to secure its own food supply, India banned rice exports in February 2008, leading to both rice shortages in Nepal and increased inflationary pressure on rice prices.

Diversifying diet patterns were not really the main cause of the sudden spike that began in 2006. Rather diverting food for bio-fuel production (due to rising crude oil price) is the primary reason for the sudden increase in the demand for food grains as well as the rapid increase in food prices. Restrictions on exports announced by major foodgrains-exporting nations such as Argentina, Kazakhstan and Russia for wheat and Cambodia, Egypt, India, Pakistan and Vietnam for rice continue, imposing pressures on the global food price inflation. Weather related production losses, surging oil prices and the weaker dollar have also fuelled speculative demand for agricultural products. The FAO has placed its latest forecast for world cereal production in 2008 at a record 2180 million tons, 2.8 % up from last year\u2019s record level as producers in all regions have responded to high market prices by increasing cereal cultivation. The bulk of the increase is expected in wheat which is forecast at 658 million tons, representing an increase of 8.3 % over the level in 2007. Global paddy production in 2008 may rise by 1.4 % to 666 million tons. The FAO\u2019s forecast for global coarse grains output in 2008 at 1078 million tons is virtually unchanged from last year\u2019s record high. The expected good harvest in the current year along with reduced fuel cost of inputs and reduced demand for bio-fuel production due to decline of oil prices may exert a dampening effect on food inflation. 3.2 Underlying causes of oil price rises9 Both structural factors and speculations have contributed to steep increases in crude oil prices. Important structural factors are growing demand, supply pressures and constraints, depleting reserves and turbulent geo-political situations. However, more recently speculative investments have played a key role in the oil futures market. More than causing the price rise, speculations have contributed to the volatility of prices, further complicating the problems of policy makers. Growth in world oil demand The rise in crude prices in recent years has been driven partly by the rapid growth in demand. The analysis of the last 10 years data on oil consumption (BP, 2008) shows this trend (Chart 26: World Crude Oil, consumption and production, 1990- 2007). The annual growth rate of oil consumption has accelerated from 1.1% during the first half (1997-2002) of last decade to 1.8 % during the second-half (2002-2008). Much of this growth in demand came from the United States and emerging economies such as Brazil, China and India. The countries of the Asia and the Pacific accounted for nearly half (47%) of the increase in oil consumption. This prompted increased production, thereby absorbing much of OPEC\u2019s surplus capacity and a looming fear of capacity constraints, making the oil market more vulnerable to supply-demand fluctuations. Chart 1 shows oil consumption to be consistently higher than that of oil supply. Before 2003, the gaps were due 9 This sub-section draws heavily on UNDP report \u201cOvercoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific\u201d, UNDP Regional Centre, Bangkok, 2007,with data updates where available 24 not to a real supply shortfall but mainly to the OPEC cartel\u2019s control of production. But in recent years, growth in demand is straining physical supply boundaries, as the supply gap is more real and market-determined.

A closer look at the data suggests that China\u2019s demand for oil might have played a very significant role in contributing to the price rise starting in 2003 -2004. The annual growth in Chinese oil consumption has accelerated sharply from 3.1% during 1997-2001 to 8.5% in 2002, 9.7% in 2003 and 16.7% in 2004. Though the annual growth in China\u2019s oil consumption has sharply decelerated since 2004 but it is still high at about 5% providing enough cues for upward movement of prices (Chart 27: Annual growth rates in oil consumption and oil price). Consequently China accounted for about 36% of the increase in global oil consumption between 2001 and 2004. During the same period, the US consumption too increased by 3.5% (highest since the last 15 years). The rapid rise in oil demand in China and the US accompanied by similar record rise in oil demand from other economies caused the markets to move upward. Shrinking buffers In the past, fluctuations in oil supply and demand have been dampened by three main buffers: surplus production capacity among OPEC members, large oil inventories, and surplus refining capacity in consuming countries. All three buffers have, however, been shrinking. As a result, the world oil market has become more vulnerable to even slight change in supply and demand situations. The average surplus production capacity of 3.9 million barrels per day during 1996-2002 has now decreased to 1.9 million barrels per day in 2003 and then reaching a low level of 1.0 million barrels per day in 2005 (chart 28: World surplus crude oil production capacity). Subsequently it rose, reaching 2.2 million barrels per day in 2007, but is still relatively small (EIA, 2008). It is estimated to further reduce to 1.7 1.9 1.3 1.0 1.5 2.2 1.7 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 (est.) Million Barrels per Day 1996-2002 Historic Average (3.9 million bbl/d) 25 million barrels per day in 2008. Moreover, this surplus comes from just a few countries, notably Saudi Arabia and Iraq, so any problems with their exports will have major repercussions for the world oil market. A further cause of tightening oil markets is shrinking oil stocks (Chart 29: Difference in OECD oil inventories from 1996-2002 average stock levels). To cut costs, oil companies have been holding lower stocks of crude oil and gasoline. Compared with the average stock levels of 1996-2002, OECD stocks were at record lows in 2003. Though the situation improved since 2006, again during the first part of 2008, the inventory levels have fallen below the historical average. Refineries too are working with less slack. Despite rising demand, the oil companies have not been building many new refineries, preferring instead to reduce their surplus refining capacity. The combination of tighter supplies, and changing demand \u2013 or speculation about such changes \u2013 has made prices much more volatile when compared to earlier years of 2000 to 2004. Security and political issues Oil prices also have been affected by security and political issues, linked primarily to unstable situations in the Middle East. In May 2004, for example, oil facilities in Saudi Arabia suffered two terror attacks. These attacks did not reduce Saudi production significantly, but they did have a psychological impact, raising doubts about sustained oil supply causing price hikes. The situation in Iraq too contributed to the uncertainty. During the Iraq War, oil production fluctuated wildly before returning in March 2004 to pre-war level of 2.4 million barrels per day. Since then, deteriorating internal safety and terror attacks by insurgents on oil facilities have again undermined production. Such skirmishes have resulted in disruptions in oil supply. For example, on June 2006, a fire damaged the Khor al-Amaya oil export terminal in Iraq, forcing it to close.

As of April 2007, an estimated 587,000 barrels per day of crude production is shut-in (EIA, 2007). The situation has been further aggravated by the nationalization of oil and gas industries (e.g., Bolivia and Venezuela) or increased control of oil markets by governments (e.g., Russia). Furthermore, in some parts, notably Mexico and OECD Europe, production prospects are deteriorating because of low levels of investment in exploration. All these factors have been adversely affected overall oil supply. Buyers who fear the prospect of damage to oil facilities in the Middle East are prepared to pay more to secure supplies (OECD/IEA 2004) in other part of the world. This is said to be contributing to between 20 and 25% of the current oil price rise. Underinvestment in exploration and refining Over time, prices tend move upwards for extractive industries because resources need to be extracted from greater depths or less accessible fields. This is compounded by historic underinvestment in most extractive industries (because of initial high returns for low 26 investment). In the case of oil, key players in the global energy industry - OPEC national companies and the large multinational companies - failed to anticipate the growth in demand and did not sufficiently expand their output. Moreover additional capacity in the oil industry tends to come on stream only after a lag depending on the geological structures of the oil reserves. This made it difficult for suppliers to respond quickly to increasing demand. Indeed, at the end of the 20th Century, following the collapse of the oil price, they had often reduced or even stopped investment and then did not subsequently step up production as prices rose. Some argue that the recent price rises have actually served a useful purpose in stimulating investment across the oil supply chain. However, underinvestment in the oil sector may not simply be a case of inadequate response to rising demand, but rather a reflection of a general situation of uncertainty and price volatility, leading to a vicious circle whereby the lack of investment could once again propel prices upwards. As well as underinvestment in exploration, there has also been inadequate investment in refining capacity, particularly for the lighter products that have to be processed out of heavy/sour crude: mainly gasoline, diesel and ATF. Speculation in the world oil market Oil supply-demand imbalances and uncertainties have been exacerbated by a massive influx of speculative money into the market for crude oil futures. Speculators, reacting to vulnerabilities in supply and external shocks, have expanded their trading, often basing their judgments on media reports. In so doing, they have heightened the price volatility in the short-run. Speculative activity can push oil prices higher, since this unstable situation adds a larger \u2018risk premium.\u2019 Over the short term, futures prices thus may be subject to excessive hikes that bear no direct relation to current supply or demand fundamentals. However, these prices can themselves trigger further changes in supply or demand situation, leading to another round of wild fluctuations. Oil price hikes also incorporate an element of \u2018geopolitical risk premium.\u2019 Some experts hold the speculative trading solely responsible for the price rise and according to them, if purely based on supply and demand fundamentals, the current crude-oil prices should not be above US$ 60 per barrel. Large multinational energy trading firms have been mentioned for such a situation. For example, in June 2006, oil traded in futures markets at about US$ 60 a barrel and at that time, the US Senate investigation estimated that some US$ 25 of that was due to pure financial speculation (Engdahl, 2008). Similarly, an analyst estimated in August 2005 that US oil inventory levels suggested WTI crude prices should be around $25 a barrel, and not US$ 60 prevailing at that time. Extending the logic, that would be equal to a present day share of US$ 50 to US$ 60 or more of today\u2019s US $115 a barrel price is due to pure hedge fund and speculation by financial institutions. Given the unchanged equilibrium in global oil supply and demand amid the explosive rise in oil futures prices traded on NYMEX and ICE exchanges in New York and London in the first half of 2008, it is likely that as much as 60% of the oil price is pure speculation (Engdahl, 2008). There are contradictory views too, which claim that speculating/hedging activity accounts for a mere 3 to 4 % of the total price (Hutter, 2008). According to Hutter (2008), the extraction cost accounts for 34% of the oil price and the major factors contributing to the steep price rise are windfall", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32d06521-d3ef-4d8e-9eab-e7642529e183": {"__data__": {"id_": "32d06521-d3ef-4d8e-9eab-e7642529e183", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82b5fb45af623ad8064afccda6a5eac52ca1d9b4ab46ca8a5bd8c33b118f852d"}, "3": {"node_id": "116c4e04-b9bc-4d1e-b1ed-5b44ef9a4721", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a2c903632be59dd22d51b3e5b19da238ae3572df022219a9d1f29bfe0974a17"}}, "hash": "61fb97276a562d8263f82a616b9dde52346c91d8afa7199933db3ae91540f79a", "text": "profiting from the perceived geopolitical/weather/depletion related shortages accounting for 13%, currency (US$) debasement for 26% and lack of surplus capacity for 23%.

A combination of short term impacts of rising demand have been made worse by speculation, dollar debasement and hedge fund movements. 27 4. Impact of Soaring Food and Oil Prices at the Macro level The aim of this section is to contribute to improving understanding of what soaring food and oil prices at the global level mean for economics in Asia and the Pacific. Such an understanding serves as a basis both for strengthening UNDP\u2019s capacity to engage in an informed international policy dialogue, and for identifying actions that it can take, in collaboration with its member governments, at national and regional levels. 4.1 Net Importing and Net Exporting Countries At the macro level, the impacts of higher food and oil prices on countries are likely to be diverse depending upon whether countries are net importing or net exporting countries as well as the relative share of net food and oil exports (exports-imports) in total imports or total domestic consumption or total domestic production. In this context, it is necessary to identify which countries are net food exporters or net food importers. A recent World Bank study classifies 196 countries according to net food trade status (NG & Aksoy, 2008). It shows that two thirds of the countries (131 out of 196) in the world are net food importers. It also shows that as many as 42 out of 58 low-income countries and 69 out of 105 middle-income countries are net food importers. Even among the high-income countries, 20 out of 33 are net food importers (Table 4). In terms of percentages, 61 % of high income countries, 66 % of middle-income countries, and 72 % of low-income countries are net food importers. Table 4: Country Classifications by Raw Food Trade (2004/05) No. of Countries Net Exports as % of All Goods Imports Country Group Net food Exporter Net food Importer Total 1980/81 1990/91 2000/01 2004/05 High income 13 20 33 0.8 0.3 0.3 0.1 Middle-income, all 36 69 105 -3.4 -0.6 -0.1 0.1 Oil Exporters 3 17 20 -4.4 -4.5 -3.6 -2.8 Small Islanders 5 25 30 -2.9 -1.6 -1.5 -1.8 Low-income, all 16 42 58 -2.0 -0.6 0.0 -0.2 Oil Exporters 2 5 7 -3.4 -2.8 -4.8 -4.6 World, Total 65 131 196 Source: Francis NG & M. Ataman Aksoy, \u201cWho Are the Net Food Importing Countries\u201d, Policy Research Working Paper 4457, The World Bank, Jan 2008. Available data also show that the group of middle-income countries has switched from being a large net importer in 1980/81 to a marginal net exporter in 2004/05 (Table 4). The group average disguises large net imports by oil exporters and small island economies. The group of low-income countries has also witnessed an improvement in their food trade deficits from 2.0 % of its imports in 1980/81 to 0.2 % in 2004/05. Low-income countries, which are not oil- exporting and not in conflict, turned out to be net food exporters (NG & Aksoy, 2008). Countries that have net food imports of more than 5 % of their total imports will be considered as potentially vulnerable to soaring food prices. This is because a 50 % increase in food prices, as actually happened recently, with net food imports of more than 5 % (but less than 10 %) imports will have an impact equivalent to about 3-5 % of the imports bill. Countries that have net food imports of more than 10 % of total imports will be viewed as highly vulnerable because a 50 % increase in food prices with net food imports of more than 28 10 % imports will have an impact equivalent to more than 5 % of their imports bill. There are 20 low-income countries whose food trade deficits are more than 5 % of their total imports.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "116c4e04-b9bc-4d1e-b1ed-5b44ef9a4721": {"__data__": {"id_": "116c4e04-b9bc-4d1e-b1ed-5b44ef9a4721", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82b5fb45af623ad8064afccda6a5eac52ca1d9b4ab46ca8a5bd8c33b118f852d"}, "2": {"node_id": "32d06521-d3ef-4d8e-9eab-e7642529e183", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61fb97276a562d8263f82a616b9dde52346c91d8afa7199933db3ae91540f79a"}}, "hash": "7a2c903632be59dd22d51b3e5b19da238ae3572df022219a9d1f29bfe0974a17", "text": "When the cut-off point is increased to 10 %, only 6 low-income countries show up.

Ataman Akoy, \u201cWho Are the Net Food Importing Countries\u201d, Policy Research Working Paper 4457, The World Bank, Jan 2008. In Asia and the Pacific, 26 out of 35 countries are net food importers. Out of these, three are from East Asia, seven from South-West Asia, five from South East Asia and 11 are from the Pacific. Out of 26 net food importing countries, nine countries namely Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Mongolia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tonga, and Lao PDR have trade surplus in agricultural products. The negative effects of soaring food prices could be balanced out with positive effects of rising prices of agricultural raw materials.10 In Asia and the Pacific, only nine out of 26 net food importing countries can be considered vulnerable as their net food imports are more than 5 % of their total imports. These nine countries are Kiribati, North Korea, Micronesia, Cook Islands, Samoa, Bangladesh, Papua 10 Prices of agricultural raw materials have not increased as high as fo od items.

Out of these, one country - Papua New Guinea - has huge trade surplus on agricultural trade. Fortunately, none of the countries in Asia and the Pacific can be considered to be high vulnerable countries category, as no country has net food imports more than 10 % of their total imports. Most of the food net importing countries are small island states or countries in conflict (Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka) or mojor non-food commodity exporting countries (Indonesia, Iran, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia) or industrial countries (South Korea and Singapore). If we exclude these countries, only a few countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, and North Korea turn out to be vulnerable from food price shocks. Available data also show that nine countries in Asia and the Pacific are net food exporters. These include Myanmar, Tuvalu, Thailand, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, China, Vanuatu and Philippines. Out of these only few countries namely Myanmar, Tuvalu and Thailand have reasonably high net food exports in terms of their total import bill. Half of the countries that have food trade surplus in food trade turn out to be net importers of agricultural products. These include Tuvalu, Pakistan, China and Philippines. This implies that only four countries in Asia and the Pacific have trade surplus both in food and all agricultural products. These are Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and India. From macro perspective, only these four countries are expected to benefits from high prices of food grains and agricultural raw materials.

This implies that only six countries namely Thailand, India, China, Pakistan, Vietnam and Cambodia have been net food grains exporters in the region in the recent years.

With regards to trade in wheat, seven countries were net rice exporters in the last five years, only India turned out to be a net exporter. In fact India also imports wheat frequently. Five countries are net corn exporters. 31 In Asia and the Pacific, most of the countries are net oil and gas importers. Only six out of 35 countries are net exporters of oil and gas in the region. They include Iran (world share is 4 %, and contribution to GDP 20%), Indonesia (world share is 2.4 %, and contribution to GDP 6.3%), Malaysia (world share is 1.2 %, and contribution to GDP 7.4%), Brunei Darussalam (0.6, 80.0), Vietnam (0.6 9.8), and Papua New Guinea (0.1 ,13.0). 4.2 Import Dependency and Exports Orientation For net food importing countries, questions such as how much of the available domestic food supply has been imported and how much comes from the country's own production need to be analysed to assess their vulnerability due to changes in global food prices. The Import Dependency Ratio (IDR) answers these questions. It is defined as net imports (exports \u2013 imports) as % of domestic consumption. If this figure is close to zero, then most of the domestic food consumption has been supplied from domestic produced rather than imports. On the other hand, if it is close to 100, then the most domestic consumption comes from imports. The IDR can be calculated for individual commodities and groups of commodities.

For PNG the ADB (2008) estimates show that price increases for its exports has added almost 45 to GNI since 2006. This compares with a negative impact averaging between 5 and 6% and of GNI for other Pacific economies. 4.3 Terms of trade and income distribution between countries At the international level, the soaring global food and fuel prices is expected to affect income distribution among countries. The inter-country income distribution effects are largely determined by the changes in the terms of trade, which is the ratio between the prices of exports and the prices of imports. The changes in the terms of trade themselves vary depending upon countries trade structure and relative weights in the total trade. An improvement in the terms-of-trade for a country or group of countries indicates a relative increase in real income, where as deterioration in the terms-of-trade indicates a relative loss of real income. Available data (UNCTD 2008) show that trends in the terms-of-trade have changed significantly in the last decade because of sharp increase in the prices of commodities compared to manufactures. At the regional level, Middle East and North Africa, which includes several major petroleum exporters, is the region that experienced the most impressive improvement in terms of trade. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region also benefited from the rise in the prices of oil and mining products as well as prices of agricultural products. However, the gains for the region were not evenly distributed. The situation of 24 sub-Saharan countries that do not export fuels or mining products has actually deteriorated, as the prices of their agricultural raw material exports have been outpaced by those of their imports (fuels, food and capital good items). Latin America and the Caribbean region also witnessed improvement in terms of trade, although more moderate than those of SSA and MENA. Gains have been bigger in South America, while most Central American and several 34 Caribbean countries (most of which depend heavily on the import of fuel) have suffered losses from their terms of trade. Finally, Eastern, South-Eastern and Southern Asian countries show a significant deterioration in their terms of trade, owing to their dependence on the imports of energy and industrial raw materials and their specialization in labour-intensive manufactures exports. The UNCTAD report also indicates that developing manufactures exporters suffered losses from changes in their terms of trade equivalent to 1.2 % of GDP per year during 2004 -06. On the other hand, oil exporters and exporters of mining products obtained windfall revenues from improving terms of trade, exceeding 7 and 5 % of GDP per year, respectively. The terms of trade of transition economies comprised of former USSR and allies such as Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Mongolia have improved due to exports of oil, gas, and other mineral or mining products. Most of the Asia-Pacific countries experienced adverse terms-of-trade arising from high commodity prices. Only countries such as Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, PNG, Timor Leste, and Viet Nam who are net exporters of commodities would have faced neutral effects or some gains from the terms of trade movements. The deterioration of the terms of trade has already begun to affect exchange rates in some countries such as India, Pakistan and Nepal. The terms of trade losses have also impacted the external positions (current account balance) of economies that are net commodity importers. However, as exports remained resilient in many Asia and the Pacific countries despite a slowing US economy and capitals are still flowing into the region, current account position has not moved into dangerous levels. The FAO has identified 82 \u201clow-income food importers\u201d that are vulnerable to food price hikes. For 48 of these countries, which do not export oil or minerals and mining products, food price increases have led to deterioration in the terms of trade by 20 % since 2001. In the remaining 34 countries, the terms of trade effect was offset by substantial increases in the prices of the oil or minerals and mining exports (UNCTAD, 2008). The adverse terms-of-trade effects of higher food prices have also been mitigated, to some extent, by rising non-food commodity prices in countries. When all primary commodity price changes are considered, the terms-of-trade impacts become large and positive for resource rich countries as exports of oil (Iran) and other commodities (Malaysia, Mongolia and PNG) more than compensate for higher food prices. Consequently balance of payments has not been adversely affected. 4.4 Transmission of world food and fuel prices on domestic consumer prices", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f495783d-6c2f-47d8-9859-1a8b09353d43": {"__data__": {"id_": "f495783d-6c2f-47d8-9859-1a8b09353d43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54344a3228147b658cd8a3d618b20f15ba07e3024145f8695b64f0dfc58df922"}, "3": {"node_id": "07bcc184-f022-4c33-b2b2-9850c46f5a0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "037cfb58175402d55ada681efc88d881c7d71f226df6a5e074c30251d259fbde"}}, "hash": "7361be34db47b578e99eca5024eb1a19a5c27841d8d22e498eb282ba217d99fd", "text": "The impact of higher international food and fuel prices on domestic economies will depend on the extent to which changes in world prices have been transmitted to domestic economies in recent years. In an open economy, movement in domestic prices of food and fuels depends on the behaviour of world prices. The pass through, however, is often incomplete and may be influenced by administrative and fiscal interventions. The depreciation of the US dollar against many Asian currencies also tends to reduce transmission of world market prices to domestic markets. An indicator of the extent to which soaring food and fuel prices are being transmitted into domestic retails markets is the \u2018pass-through coefficient\u2019. This is the ratio of the cumulative 35 annual rates of change in domestic retail prices over a given period to the cumulative annual rates of change in corresponding international prices during the same period. The pass- through coefficient usually ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0 to 100 in percentage terms) implying that international price movements would not transmit fully to domestic prices in a short run. A pass-through value of 1 indicates that international price movements are transmitted fully to domestic prices, while the value of zero indicates that international price movements have not been transmitted to domestic prices. In some cases, changes in domestic prices are not related to events on international markets. In these cases, pass-through value of more than 1 may happen, implying that a higher rate of change in domestic prices than international prices. It may be noted that pass-through of global prices to higher domestic prices, though not necessarily immediate, is ultimately unavoidable. Efficiency considerations require full pass-through, as this encourages appropriate responses by consumers and producers and mitigates macro impact. But at the same time full pass- through decreases the real incomes of many households with adverse poverty impacts that require mitigating measures. Regulation of pass-through is typically done through providing subsidies to producers and traders; reducing in import tariffs and sales (VAT) tax rate; implementing price control; adjusting exchange rate, etc. It is clear that less than full pass- through involves huge fiscal subsidies which could crowd-out other critical public expenditures such as basic education and primary health. Reducing taxes results in forgone revenues and price controls result in escalating subsidies. Moreover, studies indicate that benefits of universal subsidies, tax reduction and price control are likely go mainly to higher income groups reflecting unequal distribution of consumption. For pass through analysis, assessment must be done at country level, because different countries have experienced different exchange rate movements and adopted different policy responses.

For most of countries, the pass-through coefficient for food is less than 50 %. A comparison of changes in international food price indices in US dollar terms and changes in domestic consumer food price indices shows that only about half of the increase in real US dollar prices has been passed through to domestic markets. Highest pass-through ratios are observed for Mongolia, Sri Lanka, China, Maldives and Indonesia. In these countries, the pass-through ratios range between 97% in Mongolia to 56% in Indonesia. These countries have been content to allow most of the changes in world prices to pass through to domestic markets. On the other hand, lowest pass-through ratios of food are observed for South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and India. In these countries, the pass-through ratios of food range from 15% in Korea to 30% in India. Data on food prices for 2008 are not yet available for several countries. However, if available information for 2006 and 2007 is taken into consideration, then food inflation in Myanmar, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Afghanistan are also very high in recent years. The pass- through ratios are also high (more than 60%) in these countries. Available data also show that the rates of increase of consumer food prices are generally low for the Pacific Island countries. Consequently the pass-through ratios are low in almost all the Pacific Islands. This shows that consumers in the Pacific countries have not been affected much from the global food prices. China and India present contrasting cases. Both countries have shifted from net food importing countries into net food exporting countries in recent years, though their food exports as s share of total merchandise exports or imports or food production is negligible. Chinese currency has appreciated against the US dollar while Indian currency has depreciated. Consequently, world food price equivalents in domestic currency terms have increased at higher rate (72%) in India than China (50%) during 2006-08. Yet, domestic consumer food prices in India increased only by 22%, while retail food prices in China rose by 34% for the same period. It indicates that while India has been more restrained in allowing passing through of food price rises to the consumers, China has been content to allow of the changes in world market prices to pass through to domestic markets. 37 Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also present contrasting cases. The results indicate that Sri Lankan consumers have shouldered more of the increase in world food prices than Bangladesh\u2019s. Similarly, if one compares Mongolia and Korea - both are net food importers - the results show that Korean consumers have been more shielded from the price rise than Mongolian consumers.

These countries have been more restraint in allowing the changes in world crude oil prices to pass through to domestic markets. The results also show that the pass-through is generally higher in the case of diesel compared to gasoline. The results also show that pass-through coefficients have increased dramatically in the last two years compared to that of last six tears (2002-2008). As fiscal costs becoming too much bear, governments are forced to pass through relatively higher proportion of the steep rise in crude oil prices to domestic consumers in the last 2 or 3 years. In countries such as India, Korea, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, and Fiji, pass-through coefficients, an average, have more than doubled in the last two years compared to last six years. Countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Korea and Malaysia have also witnessed the pass-through coefficients of greater than one in the last two years indicating that countries that are more restraint in passing through global oil prices to domestic consumers initially (during 2003-06) are forced to pass-through fully to consumers in recent years.

Many governments of the countries of Asian region have also shielded consumers from the adverse effects of food and fuel price rises through a series of pricing measures that have regulated the \u2018pass-through\u2019. As noted earlier, the passing on the full price increases to consumers would encourage producers to increase supply and consumers to reduce demand. Our pass-through estimates are consistent with similar pass-through estimates of food and fuel prices in recent years.

The reasoning is that if countries depend upon food and fuels imports for their domestic consumption in a significant manner, then domestic food prices are affected by international prices and if countries are not significant importers, then impact of international prices should be limited. It may be true in fairly closed and controlled economies. But in a globalised system with relatively low tariffs or other barriers, and better infrastructure, domestic food and fuel prices are strongly influenced by international prices \u2013 whether they are net importing or net exporting countries in the medium term. In many countries, food and fuel price inflation is higher than aggregate inflation and contributing to underlying inflationary pressures. The inflation impact of food price increases is of particular concern, especially for emerging and developing economies, because food expenditure accounts much larger share than those of oil-related spending in the consumer price index. Higher food prices have already led to substantial increases in overall inflation in many Asian countries (Chart 30). The rises in the price of food have contributed about 2-3 percentage points to headline inflation. In addition, in some countries domestic demand pressures have pushed up inflation. 40 Chart 30: Overall, Food, and Fuel Inflation in Asian Countries in Recent Years 0 10 20 30 40 Jan 07 Jan 08 Jun 08 Dec 06 Dec 07 Jul 08 Apr 07 Jan 08 Jun 08 Jul 07 Jan 08 Jul 08 2006 2007 Jun 08 Jul 07 Jan 08 Jul 08 Aug 06 Jul 07 Jul 08 Jun 07 Jan 08 Jun 08 Jan 07 Jan 08 Jul 08 Mar 07 Aug 07 Mar 08 Jan 07 Jan 08 Aug 08 BNG CHA IND IDO IRA MAS NEP PAK PHI SRL THA % ALL Food Fuel The increase in the prices of petroleum products also could have stoked inflation. At the regional level, though it did not happen in the immediate aftermath of crude oil price rise, i.e., till 2006, continuous sharp rises in oil price coupled with soaring food prices has been a contributing factor affecting the inflation rates (Chart 30). While the impact of rising international food prices on overall domestic inflation tended to be somewhat muted until mid 2007 due to the relatively small size of international price movements and the appreciation of many local currencies against the dollar, the large scale of international food price inflation since mid-2007 is likely having a bigger impact. Inflation in the region expected to rise sharply in 2008 compared to 2007. Inflation in East Asia is expected to increase from 3.9% in 2007 to 6.1% in 2008. In South Asia, it is likely to rise to 11.8 % from 5.5 % for the same period. Inflation in South East Asia also expected to rise by more than double \u2013 from 4.0% in 2007 to 9.4% in 2008. Inflation in Asia and the Pacific as a whole is forecasted to rise substantially from 4.8 % in 2007 to 8.2 % in 2008 \u2013 by about 70 % increase. Inflation is likely to be in double digits in 2008 in 14 out of 36 countries in our region. In fact six countries namely Afghanistan, Cambodia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam are likely to witness inflation rate of over 20% in 2008.

Many countries reported multi-year highs in inflation, driven mainly by soaring food and fuel prices. Overall inflation is already at or is rapidly heading to double-digit levels in most of Asia-Pacific countries. In many countries, overall inflation increased by 2 - 6 percentage points since January 2008. With food and oil accounting for a large share of consumer price indexes in Asia and the Pacific, and with a majority of countries being net food and oil importers, the consequent rise in domestic prices is not surprising. Inflation expectations have also risen markedly. There are growing concerns across countries that rising food and energy prices are triggering a more generalised inflation spiral through second-round effects.

The rise may also hint that inflation expectations have begun to drift. Higher inflation has also led to wage increases in some economies. Although the surge in global oil and food prices remains the main driver of the inflationary surge, rapid liquidity growth in the region over the past few years has been an important underlying factor. This indicates that a much more broad-based second-round effect may be underway. However, in recent months, inflation decelerated in many countries. While high inflation is now a region wide phenomenon, country responses have differed widely depending on perceptions of the nature of the shock, how long it will last and the stage of the inflation cycle in terms of the onset of the second-order impact. In some countries like China, the policy response to inflation has been proscribed by relatively overarching concerns for economic growth. Consequently China reduced interest rates in the recent months while many countries increased interest rate to fight inflation. Prices of food has fallen a bit in the last few weeks. But the outlook even for the next couple of years is uncertain and depends on policies put in place now to encourage increased production. Nevertheless, the pressure on food prices from the underlying structural influences will likely remain and keep prices at higher levels than in the past. Oil prices are likely to remain high and volatile, as oil production is expected to remain broadly stagnant. Though the rising bio fuels production should continue to exert pressure on food prices, food prices should ease more substantially, as farmers are expected to respond strongly for higher food prices. It is clear that global commodity price increases translate to higher prices globally, particularly since food carries a large weight in the CPI of many of the region\u2019s economies. Rising fuel and food prices have soaked headline inflation both in developed and developing countries. In developed countries, headline inflation has become uncomfortably high at a time when economic activity is slowing down. While measures of core inflation so far have remained quite well anchored, there are some signs that expectations are edging higher. The inflation concerns are even more serious in Asia-Pacific countries. Inflation pressures have risen sharply in recent years, as the effects of the rising prices of oil and other commodities have come on top of pressures from domestic overheating and rapid credit growth. Risks are that the impact higher fuel and food prices could feed into inflation expectations, which may lead to second-round effects on inflation. 42 4.6 Impact of world food and fuel price changes on countries GDP growth One of the greatest worries about a steep rise in the commodity prices is that they may stifle economic growth by raising cost of production directly and contributing to soaring headline inflation thereby indirectly affecting aggregate demand and investment climate adversely. The policy responses of countries to contain inflation through tight monetary policy could also stifle economic growth. As Chart 32 indicates, commodity price rise does not appear to have affected growth significantly either at the regional level or within the Asian developing countries. The GDP impact of the recent increase in oil prices seems to be less severe than in the past because the shock has been gradual spreading into number of years which allowed countries to adjust. Currency appreciation vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar has also mitigated the impact of higher oil prices in local currency terms for a number of other countries. Most of the increase in oil prices due to increased demand rather than supply reduction (as in the 1970s). Oil intensity has fallen significantly in the past two decades in most countries. Economic growth in Asia and the Pacific during the first half of 2008 was decelerated compared to 2007 levels. Supported by stronger investment and resilient exports, GDP growth was stronger-than-expected in the first quarter of 2008. However, economic growth in the second quarter of 2008 decelerated at much higher level as slower growth in the US and other western economies began to impact the region. High growth economies such as China, India and Vietnam witnessed stronger moderation. In China, GDP growth has decelerated from 11.9% in 2007 to 10.4% in the first half of 2008. Similarly in Vietnam GDP growth has slowed down from 8.5% in 2007 to 6.5 % during the first half of 2008. In India, growth decelerated from 9.2 % in the first quarter of last fiscal year (April-June 2007) to 7.9% in the corresponding period of 2008.

Overall, the growth in Asia and the Pacific as a whole is expected to slow down by 1 \u2013 2 percentage points in 2008 and 2009 compared to 2007 (Table 14). In recent months, there is also serious concern about the US economic slowdown due to tightening of financing conditions and erosion of consumer and business sentiment. The slowdown of growth has already spread from the US to several other economies. Although the IMF has revised its forecast of global growth for 2008 up by 0.4 percentage points in July over its April projection, the consensus now appears to be that the slowdown of growth is deepening and broader in its span than initially expected with more significant slowing likely in the period ahead. In Asia, so far the impact of the slowdown in developed economies has been limited by the strength of domestic demand. However, the dangers of further worsening of the financial crisis and potential contagion have increased. In Asia and the Pacific, these effects are already in evidence in the currency and equity markets. Accordingly, heightened vigilance needed to deal with these developments. The potential financial contagion effect along with the slowing down of external demand have increased downside risk to the growth outlook for Asian economies. In this context, the regional economic outlook is highly unclear. 4.7 Impact of world food and fuel price changes on domestic exports, imports and current account balance The macroeconomic impact of rapid and unpredictable commodity price movements extends well beyond inflation and growth. On the external side, the recent oil price surge is expected to lead to balance of payments difficulties in some fuel- and food-importing low-income countries that have not benefited from offsets from other commodity exports. At the macroeconomic level the most pressing issue of rising global food and oil prices for low- income countries is the impact on the current account. Two factors determine the sign and magnitude of the change in the current account: (i) the size of net exports or imports, and (ii) the exchange rate vis-\u00e0-vis the US dollar. Soaring food and fuel prices are likely to increase countries\u2019 import bills which might lead to substantial widening of the current account deficit. This in turn could impact other macroeconomic variables such as the exchange rate, forex reserve and indebtedness. In recent months, the growth of both exports and non-food and oil imports has moderated in many countries. Food and fuel imports, however, have expanded substantially on account of higher global food and crude oil prices. For many developing countries, the steady rise in world prices of food and fuel has pushed up the food and fuel import bill. The terms of trade losses have also impacted the external positions of some emerging economies that are net commodity importers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a931511-9210-4cda-9b95-133764880b7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a931511-9210-4cda-9b95-133764880b7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5a6fe6903afbf3b9a65de1aea7561338dab6bf38a54496b4da6479e07f0e0b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "53dbaa04-9606-4258-93a4-112a3ec6be29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d98c696432820c189176a3d0339eef27e40ecf511ec5f2686e20dcfed0328b81"}}, "hash": "d7d4d3e85c5356df6987bfc5c27e7bf5be2a613ef86ab6c31f2abad29d8019fb", "text": "Chart 33a: Growth Rate of Food Imports during 2005 to 2008 -15 10 35 60 85 110 Bangladesh Indonesia Malaysia Nepal Pakistan Philippines Thailand % 2005 2006 2007 2008 44 Available data as September 2008 indicates that growth rate of food imports has increased dramatically in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan and Philippines compared to previous years (Chart 33a).

This is an increase of 26 %. The combination of rapidly rising prices and higher freight costs is behind the higher global bills for imported foodstuffs. Among economic groups, the most economically vulnerable countries are set to bear the highest burden in the cost of importing food, with total expenditures by LDCs and Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs) is likely to climb by 37-40 % in 2008, after rising 30 and 37 %, respectively, in 2007. In our region, food imports bill is forecasted to rise in 2008 compared to 2007 level by about 60 % in Pakistan, about 40 % each in Sri Lanka, Philippines and Bangladesh, and 35 % in Indonesia. The sharp increases in food and fuel prices have led to higher import bills and strained the balance of payments position of many countries. Asia and the Pacific region as a net importer of fuel and food is likely to witness an increased import bill - by over 2 -3 % of GDP in 2008 and 2008 compared to previous years. Depending upon the import dependence for domestic consumption, the import bill as % of GDP could increase 1-2 % in 2008 compared to previous years. This would imply a widening of the current account deficit as a share of GDP by more than 1-2 percentage points. In this regard, the vulnerable countries from a macroeconomic perspective are those countries that imports significant portion of their domestic food and fuels consumption and already have high current account deficits. In Asia and the Pacific, one third of countries that include Cambodia, Lao PDR, Maldives, the Pacific Islands (except PNG), Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam are already have large trade deficits (>4 % of GDP). With significant increase in the growth of their food and fuel import bill as a result of higher food and fuel prices, some of these countries could experience severe balance of payments problems. The combined price shocks are expected to deteriorate in the region\u2019s trade balance in 2008 and 2009.

Available data indicates that in the first six months of 2008, import bills of food and fuels has increased significantly and consequently growth in imports has accelerated sharply. Consequently trade deficits widened in many of South Asian countries, while trade surplus narrowed down in some East Asian countries. However, as exports remained resilient in many Asia and the Pacific countries despite a slowing US economy and capitals are still flowing into the region, current account position has not moved into dangerous levels. Higher food and fuel prices have the potential of generating serious balance of payments problems. But, until recently, the effects remained relatively limited. In particular, the large increase in world oil prices since 2003 has had a relatively small macroeconomic impact on developing countries. This is because increase in world oil prices was more gradual than during earlier episodes, giving countries time to adjust. A rise in oil prices is expected to have a larger balance of payments effect than a similar food price increase. Because oil imports are 2-3 times larger than food imports for developing countries. The oil price increase would severely weaken the external position of many poor countries, while the food price increase would have a severe negative effect only for small number of countries. In US dollar terms, many Asian countries experienced significant increases in the food and fuel import bill. However, in recent years many Asian countries have had an appreciation of domestic currencies vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar. If the appreciation continues in 2008 and 2009, the increase in the value of the import requirement, measured in local currencies, will be somewhat lower. Furthermore, for many countries the net imports of grains and fuels, constitute less than 50% of total imports. Hence, the impact on the current accounts is expected to be manageable for most countries. 4.8 Impact of world food and fuel price changes on government revenue, expenditure, fiscal balance and monetary indicators With regards to government budgets, all of the domestic measures to cushion the burden of rising prices", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "421e1b16-b62f-480f-848f-0cb040695591": {"__data__": {"id_": "421e1b16-b62f-480f-848f-0cb040695591", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1730f0e1e6ccc393677c7225507d1c964a4a9a6de27a3678c2f7aef2099dbe78"}, "3": {"node_id": "66a83d47-5787-4df5-a9ee-9dace2392f3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e57225362c37f7613a4f12ebd810a3eca847538d09f2dcd662bcc139f017dd39"}}, "hash": "a0e68aea151c9ca1df239a58e4f6b5c9e485d9aacac841ab5a29c5a0b2f25d1a", "text": "have a fiscal cost\u2014either lower revenues from reduced taxes and tariffs, or higher expenditures on subsidies and social safety nets or support measures for small farmers.

As pass-through coefficients are less than 50% for many Asian countries, the associated fiscal cost is expected to be high which could tighten their fiscal space and deteriorate their overall fiscal performance. The problem would be more severe in countries with large fiscal deficits like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Thus, governments have yet another challenge to confront in allocating scarce resources. Available data show that many countries increased fuel and food subsidies. Many countries also reduced fuel and food taxes. A recent IMF study (IMF, 2008) show that food subsidies are relatively high in the Maldives and Timor Leste (more than 1% of GDP), it is modestly high in Indonesia, India, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan ( more than 0.5 % of GDP), Bangladesh and Malaysia (0.2 to 0.5% of GDP). Similarly, Fuel subsidies as % of GDP are relatively high (more than 2 %) in Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India it is about 1.5 %. In other Asian countries, either subsidies are low or data are not available (IMF, 2008). Targeted transfers (safety nets and agricultural subsidies) as % of GDP are relatively high in the Philippines (over 4 %), Bangladesh, Singapore and India (2 %), modest in Sri Lanka and China (1%), and low in Pakistan and Indonesia (0.5%). Total fiscal cost of policy responses of food and fuel prices is high (2 \u2013 3% of GDP) in Indonesia, Maldives, Bangladesh and Timor Leste. It is modest level in Malaysia, India and Cambodia (more than 1%); It is low in Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, south Korea and Philippines (about 0.5 to 0.1%), and Singapore, Laos and Nepal (about 0.3 to 0.5%). Available data shows that fiscal developments in 2008 indicate stress on the financial position of the many countries. Available data show that the fiscal deficit indicators have generally worsened in 2008 from their levels a year ago. Government tax and non-tax revenues have remained buoyant. Aggregate on social and other services has risen significantly due to rise in food and fuel subsidies. Higher salaries that is likely to occur following rise in inflation rate also a source of concern from the point of view Chart 35: Government Revenues (% of GDP) by sub-regions 15 20 25 30 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 % 30 40 50 60 Pacific EA-4 SWA-9 SA-8 SEA-9 Asia-Pacific-36 Pacific-14 Chart 36:Government Expenditure(% of GDP) by Sub-Regions 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 % EA-4 SWA-9 SA-8 SEA-9 Pacific-14 Asia-Pacific-36 47 of fiscal management. As fiscal situations becoming tight, any new social safety net measures will require effective targeting of assistance; otherwise, these may add to further fiscal pressure. There are some signs of moderation in key monetary indicators in response to monetary measures which have withdrawn liquidity from the system and tightened interest rates. The growth rates of money supply and deposit growth have started to dip in recent months. Financial markets have generally experienced some tightening of liquidity conditions and hardening of interest rates, particularly in recent months as monetary measures took effect.

Equity markets in many Asian economies are expected to weaken in 2008 partly due to financial crisis in the US sub prime markets and partly due to lower growth expectations. In recent months, stock markets continued to trend downward from their record highs of October 2007 as global market turmoil worsened and equity markets in industrialized countries fell sharply. Food and energy security The imperative for food and energy security is paramount for global stability and development. The priority of this challenge for the Asian region is all the more important, as most of the countries of the region are net food and oil importers. Countries like Korea, Nepal, Philippines, and Sri Lanka which depend on imported oil for almost 100% of their consumption and at the next level, India and Thailand, which have to import about 70% of their oil requirements. In high imports intensity countries, high international food and oil prices pose challenges in achieving energy and food security. From macro perspective, in the short-term, the food and oil security of most of the developing countries of Asia appears not too threatened. This is evident from the improved positions of these countries in terms of ratio of foreign exchange reserves to imports (Chart 39). When we compare the average ratio of forex reserves for the two time periods (2000-03 and 2004-07), most of the countries are in a stronger position to face external shocks. A reversal has happened only in the case of Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand. Chart 39: Change in the average ratio of foreign echange reserves to imports during two-time periods (Months) 49 5. Impact of Soaring Food and Oil prices at the household level The aim of this section is to contribute to improving understanding of the impact of soaring global food prices on the households, particularly poor households across the developing Asia. Consumers make their food purchase decisions based on a budget that also must cover expenses for clothing, housing, and other goods and services. The overall budget available for food depends on the amount of total household budget spent on other goods and services. Therefore, in-depth study on the impact of soaring food and fuel prices requires an understanding of the complete consumption patterns of households. Consumption patterns of 114 countries were examined by USDA study (Seale, Regmi, Bernstein, 2003) by dividing them into low-, middle-, and high income countries. The simple average budget shares for the nine aggregate consumption categories for each of the three country groups are presented in Table 15. As expected, the budget shares for food tend to decrease as income rises. Households in low-income countries spent about 53 % of their consumption budget on food, while households in high-income countries spent only about 17 of their consumption budget on food. Although the households\u2019 consumption shares for clothing and footwear are not hugely different between low-and high-come countries as in the case of food, the simple average budget shares are also higher for low income countries compared with the other two groups. The budget shares for fuel and lighting is higher for high income countries compared with the middle-income and low-income countries implying that the budget shares for fuel and power; transport and communication generally increase as income levels increase.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "012a8966-e028-46a4-96cb-00614d52e4cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "012a8966-e028-46a4-96cb-00614d52e4cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7d3e53785b109d6e5e53246fe576de53a007551a06acc3cd3db0a8e750f2c47"}, "2": {"node_id": "a70b6a30-07d7-4ee6-9ba2-3b38eb3e3eb8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5e9aa28982b46e670df3f8c63b74dce578510e59b9aafe3f33bd4d2ccd6a28e"}}, "hash": "49eb52b952af584051cc2adcc4e888177df944a1ba7d7a0849e58920da7507e0", "text": "Table15 \u2014Average budget shares for aggregate consumption categories, 114 countries in 1996 (% of total expenditures) Food, beverag es and tobacco Clothin g and footwe ar Gross rent, fuels and power House operati ons Medic al care Educ ation Transport & communic ation Recreati on Other Low-income 52.6 7.7 9.7 5.0 3.8 5.4 7.9 1.7 6.3 Middle- income 34.7 7.0 14.6 6.7 7.4 6.9 10.7 3.9 8.2 High-income 17.0 5.7 17.4 6.6 10.2 7.7 12.4 7.8", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51097f6b-42c3-4e60-9987-48ac2308815c": {"__data__": {"id_": "51097f6b-42c3-4e60-9987-48ac2308815c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc9880c37169d7be3425733c27f73742106e1c310e121d801be63557a9af0308"}}, "hash": "cc9880c37169d7be3425733c27f73742106e1c310e121d801be63557a9af0308", "text": "15.3 Source: (Seale, Regmi, Bernstein, 2003). Available data show that there has been a downward movement in the budget share of cereals and an upward movement in those of the principal non-cereal items implying that a shift in food preferences away from the Cereal items towards meat, fish and eggs and fruits/vegetables. The decline in the expenditure shares is particularly large in case of the coarse grains such as barley and maize. Another feature of this table is the sharp rural/urban difference in food habits, with the rural household spending a much greater share of its food expenditure outlay on cereals than the urban household. For households in low income countries, who spend up to 60-70% of their incomes on food, higher prices can have devastating effects. However, 75% of the world\u2019s poor live in rural areas, and the vast majority of these are engaged in agriculture. In this regard, one would expect poor will benefits from food prices rise, as they are producers of food. In fact, a common criticism of OECD farm policies is that these policies lower international food prices and contribute to world poverty by undermining the profitability of smallholder agriculture in developing countries. If this claim is correct, it seems that the recent price rise would alleviate poverty. When farm policies lower international prices they are denounced as increasing world poverty; and when food prices rise on international markets they are also blamed as contributing to a rise in world poverty. Clearly, there is a need to identify the 50 gainers and the losers in the current situation of rising international food prices. The division is likely to be quite different across a range of countries. A detailed mapping of who is gaining and who is loosing is important for designing any social safety nets. Impacts from the price changes depend on access to land, educational levels, gender, ethnicity, and access to rural non- farm employment opportunities. Because the problem is not yet reflected in household poverty and human development statistics, its impact is hard to analyse or quantify. The effect on the poor will depend on whether they are net buyers of food or net sellers. Before analysing the households\u2019 impact of soaring food and fuel prices, it will be useful to examine who is the poor and who is the non-poor, where they live and the recent poverty trends in Asia and the Pacific. Recently the World Bank has released a new set of poverty estimates based on improved methodology (PPP in 2005 prices compared to 1993 prices). A simple comparison of old and new poverty estimates shows that the old estimates based on 1993 PPPs led to a severe underestimation of the true level of global poverty. In other words, old 1993 PPPs translated poverty line was underestimated the number of poor in the world by 50 % compared to the new 2005 IPC-translated poverty line. The use of the latest poverty estimates may be appropriate for our analysis. As per the World Bank estimates 879 million people in 2005 lived on $1 a day -the old benchmark of absolute poverty. As per the new benchmark of absolute poverty, about 1.4 billion people lived on $1.15 a day. Between 2.6 and 3.1 billion lived on $2.0 to $2.5 a day. Available information also reveals that Asia and the Pacific region has made significant progress in poverty reduction over the last two decades.

This shows that, despite continued growth of population, Asia and the Pacific region lifted about 170 million people out of poverty (1$ a day) in the 1980s and 533 million people out of the poverty during 1990-2005.

The progress in poverty reduction has varied widely among sub-regions in Asia and the Pacific. The poverty incidence dropped dramatically in East Asia and the Pacific from 78.8 % in 1981 to 56.0 % in 1990 to 17.9 % in 2005. It is the region that achieved the highest and unprecedented rate of decline in the incidence of poverty during the last two and half decades. The absolute number of poor in East Asia has also declined significantly \u2013 from 1088 million in 1981 to 893 million in 1990 to 337 million in 2005. This shows that East Asia has lifted more than 750 million people out of extreme poverty within a generation. Despite this achievement, East Asia and the Pacific, still accounts for 24 % of the world poor. South Asia also achieved substantial reduction in the incidence of poverty over the last two and half decades \u2013 from 59.4 % in 1981 to 51.1 % in 1990 to 40.3 % in 2005.

The sub-region added additional 47 million people into global poor over the last two and half decades. Consequently, South Asia still accounts for a staggering 43 % of the world poor, though the region accounts only for 22 % of the world population. Available information reveals that both the absolute number of poor as well as the poverty incidence is higher in rural areas compared to urban areas in almost all Asia-Pacific countries except in Iran and Mongolia. Most of the poor are located in rural areas and the bulk of them depend on agriculture (including crops and horticulture, livestock, fisheries and forestry) for their livelihood. Landless agricultural labourers, small and marginal farmers, and casual workers engaged in non-agricultural activities constitute the bulk of the rural poor. Among households dependent on land-based activities for their livelihoods, small land holdings and their low productivity are the cause of poverty. The size of land possessed has important bearing on the levels of living in rural areas. Though the share of the rural poor in the total poor is declining with the rapid urbanization process and transfer of rural poor to urban areas in recent years, still about three fourths of the poor live in rural areas in Asia and the Pacific countries. Increased poverty The World Bank estimates that food inflation could push at least 100 million people into poverty. In percentage terms, this is in the range of 3 - 5 percentage points in global poverty rates. This could mean \u201cseven lost years\u201d in the fight against worldwide poverty. As per recent growth elasticity of poverty, the poverty rate in East Asia and the Pacific is expected to decline from 17.9% in 2005 to 11.7 % in 2009 if growth is sustained at similar rate of last few years. However, available data shows that growth will decelerate about 1 -2 percentage points in 2008 and 2008. This deceleration is likely to slow down progress in poverty reduction. A simple back of envelope calculation shows that poverty incidence will at least one percentage point be higher than anticipated earlier by 2009.

This suggests that economic slow down due to soaring of global commodity prices and financial crisis could push at least 57 million people into poverty in Asia and the Pacific during 2006-09. Increased malnutrition Malnutrition is not new consequence of high food prices in the free market. With rising food prices comes increased evidence of malnutrition. Across Asian households are reducing their daily food intakes. In some countries, households are reducing their non-staple foods (meat, oil etc); in some other countries, households are devoting a greater proportion of resources to food and cutting back on non-food consumption; and in some countries, households cope by cutting down the quantity and quality of food, or number of meals. The impact is already being seen in increased levels of malnutrition and under-nutrition in 2007/08. According to the World Bank, the number of malnourished people globally will grow by 44 million due to food price crisis. Provisional FAO estimates show that the number of undernourished people in 2007 increased by 75 million, over and above FAO\u2019s estimate of 848 million undernourished in 2003-05. FAO says that much of this increase in malnutrition is due to high food prices. At regional level, the largest increases in the number of undernourished people as a result of rising food prices have taken place in Asia. FAO estimates that rising prices have plunged an additional 41 million people in Asia and 24 million in sub-Saharan Africa below the hunger threshold.

This indicates the percentage change in the incidence of poverty associated with a one percent increase in per capita income. Estimates of this elasticity for the sample countries in different decades are given in Chart -- which demonstrates a wide variation in the elasticity estimates two conclusions can be drawn from Chart. First, the elasticity is both positive and negative. Positive elasticities are generally observed in cases where the growth of per capita income is low and poverty has increased (e.g., Philippines). Second, the elasticity tends to be more negative in the case of countries, which experience faster growth. This is case in most of Asian countries. Growth Elasticity of Poverty in Recent Period -1.60 -1.40 -1.20 -1.00 -0.80 -0.60 -0.40 -0.20 0.00 0.20 Bangladesh Cambodia China India Indonesia Lao PDR Malaysia Mongolia Nepal Pakistan Philippines Sri Lanka Vietnam Asia Impact on the poor and rich households By dividing households as net sellers and net buyers Rising food prices can either reduce or increase poverty, depending on how poor households earn their income and how they spend it. For example, households that produce and sell food crops will benefit from an increase in prices, unless they buy more food than they sell. In addition to direct selling and buying of food, the poverty impact will also depend on how price changes are transmitted through labour markets. For example, if rising prices lead farmers to expand production and hire more farm labour, landless farm workers may benefit. Because about three-fourths of the world\u2019s poor live in rural areas where agriculture is the main economic activity, one might assume that rising food prices would tend to reduce poverty levels. However, because most of the poor households were net food buyers rather than net food sellers, lower food prices would tend to reduce poverty (Sandra Polaski, 2008). 55 There were relatively few studies that used actual data on sources of household incomes as well as household food expenditures to explore this question. A recent World Bank paper (Aksoy and Isik-Dikmelik, 2008) using detailed household data has examined this issue in detail. The paper shows that on average only 6 % of urban households, 32 % of rural households and 23 % of all households were net food sellers (Table 16). In Cambodia, these figures are 15, 44 and 40 respectively. In Bangladesh, the corresponding figures are 4, 23, and 19. In Vietnam, these figures are 7, 48, and 38 respectively. Though Bangladesh is a rural economy, it has a low share of households that are net food sellers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f181486-2528-4c15-8e4e-59ea0818c019": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f181486-2528-4c15-8e4e-59ea0818c019", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce9bd670e3c8b2efb4808fc6cf319aea8f60314388a3a0dc70d7d08b982b5fb6"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b328525-e117-45b2-9b1e-edac415a186b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e1ba09808b962a2fc6edbe25f4e39f3657d7586a0d274913b23bba667aa290f"}}, "hash": "227d299bed82031d0d501dc7d30faeb5d6539fc7ddb7f0978c95e2813da0d0ff", "text": "The lowest shares of net buyers are observed in Cambodia and Vietnam. Given the much smaller share of households who are net sellers, a related question is whether net seller households are predominant among the rich or poor households. The general presumption has been that net food sellers are relatively well to do households with larger farms, while the net buyers are assumed to be poor labourers or small farmers. At the national level, on average, about 27 % of poor households versus about 13 % of rich households are net food sellers (Aksoy and Isik-Dikmelik, 2008). Poor households that are net sellers of food benefit from higher prices. But these households comprises only one fourth of the rural households and one sixth of the rich households. Households that are net buyers lose. As three fourths of poor households are net food buyers, rising food prices would affect them adversely.

In most of the countries a greater proportion of the poor households are net food sellers compared to the proportion of net food sellers among rich households. This implies that rising food prices would tend to transfer income from richer to poorer households, while lower prices do the opposite In the majority of countries, farming households sell and buy food items at different times of year. Typically, they sell immediately after harvest, to meet their immediate cash requirements, and buy food in the months prior to the following harvest. The differences in the rise of farm-gate prices and retail prices also determine the impact on farming households. The impacts vary between farmers, who need to buy at certain times of the year, and landless people, who buy food throughout the year. In most countries, prices paid to food producers have increased over the past year. The extent to which they have increased varies 56 considerably country by country and crop by crop. Reflecting the different levels of price increase to producers, there is considerable variation in food prices to the consumer. In many countries, rising input costs without commensurate increases in producer prices are pushing farmers \u2013 and particularly the poorer farmers \u2013 to shift away from market-oriented production, and produce food crops for home use under lower-input, lower output production systems. A common perception is that the world rural poor are small farmers, and that small farmers gain from rising prices for the commodities they produce and sell. In reality, however, the smallholder population is quite diverse. Whether a particular smallholder household will gain or lose from higher food prices depends on its net position on food markets \u2013 as seller or buyer \u2013 the net effect between rising value of sales and rising input costs (especially of petroleum products and derivatives), changes in rural wages, and rising cost of purchased consumer goods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b328525-e117-45b2-9b1e-edac415a186b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b328525-e117-45b2-9b1e-edac415a186b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce9bd670e3c8b2efb4808fc6cf319aea8f60314388a3a0dc70d7d08b982b5fb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f181486-2528-4c15-8e4e-59ea0818c019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "227d299bed82031d0d501dc7d30faeb5d6539fc7ddb7f0978c95e2813da0d0ff"}}, "hash": "8e1ba09808b962a2fc6edbe25f4e39f3657d7586a0d274913b23bba667aa290f", "text": "Urban households have benefited disproportionately from the region\u2019s rapid economic progress.

Furthermore, sustained gains over the long term also depend on farm households\u2019 abilities to finance agricultural commercialization (access to credit is likely to be facilitated by the higher value of land), in order to increase productivity levels. However, even in the region\u2019s wealthier countries, structural barriers to rural development (e.g. inadequate access to land, credit, and markets; inadequate physical infrastructure) may keep these gains from being widely shared among rural communities. Better rural infrastructure may likewise be needed to ensure that the rents accruing from the higher prices are reinvested in rural areas, to boost agricultural productivity and real incomes. More developed transport, irrigation, and financial infrastructure in rural areas would increase yields and farm incomes generally, help small farmers get their produce to market, and increase the demand for (and wages of) agricultural labour. In the long term, reducing poverty and increasing food security will require many developing countries to expand agricultural production and improve domestic agricultural markets. 57 By dividing households as poor and rich - Scenario Analysis The people hit hardest by soaring food and fuel prices are those living on the razor\u2019s edge of poverty. As expected, the budget shares for food tend to decrease as income rises. Poorer households spend a greater portion of their budget on necessities, such as food, while richer households spend a greater proportion of their income on non-food. Poor households on an average spend about two thirds of their budget on food. On the other hand, rich households spend only about one third of their income on food so they can afford to pay more (Table 17). Relatively larger shares of the consumption budget in the rich households are spent on non- food such as rent and fuel, medical care, transport and communication, and recreation. Low- value staples, such as cereals, account for a larger share of the food budget in poorer households, while higher-valued food items, such as dairy and meat, are a larger share of the food budget in richer households. Poor households are also more responsive to changes in income and food prices and, therefore, make larger adjustments to their food consumption pattern when incomes and prices change. In order to analyse the impact of rising food prices on households, the households are divided by expenditure quintiles - into poorest, poor, poor, middle, high-income and richest.

To sum up, farmers are the obvious winners, as are poor countries that rely extensively on agricultural exports. But consumers have to pay more, and the urban poor in many developing states will be hardest hit, as they often spend more than a third of their income on food. This implies that rise in food prices will have complex implications. Some economists view the rising of food prices as an opportunity because the benefits of rising prices if pass through to the farmers, then production will increase.

The impact of rising of crude oil price of households depends on the extent of usage of kerosene, gas and electricity for their cooking, lighting and transportation. Available data shows that households spent about 3-8 % of their budget on fuels and lighting items and 5-8 of their budget on transportation (Table 20). Table 21 presents the distribution of households by their primary cooking and lighting fuel in India. Fuel consumption patterns also display a clear rural-urban divide. Table suggests that only 8% of rural households and 66% of urban households in India use some form of oil products (kerosene or LPG) as their primary fuel for cooking. On other hand, an overwhelming 86% of rural households and 25 % urban households use some form of biomass (firewood or dung cake) as their primary fuel for cooking. This suggests three things. First, rising of crude oil would not affect much consumption expenditure of rural households on cooking fuel.

The poor with limited income are expected to be expenditure sensitive and are impacted both directly and indirectly due to the oil price rise. The direct impact would be increased expenditure on fuels for household needs, and travel to work, school, market, etc. The indirect impacts would be in the form of higher cost of living due to rise in the prices of essential commodities because of high inflation and transport costs. Box- HIV, poverty, and food security in Asia: an examination of existing evidence HIV strikes people in the most productive age. AIDS is currently the leading cause of death among people between 15 and 44 years old in Asia 12. While the macroeconomic impact of HIV is negligible in Asia and the Pacific, it can exert devastating effects on households. The Commission on AIDS in Asia estimates 13 that every AIDS death could result in an income loss of $5,000 on average. The Commission also projects that an additional 6 million households in Asia will have been pushed below the poverty line by 2015 given the cu rrent level of HIV the problem and response. This could jeopardise the achievement of the MDGs. Recent food and fuel price inflation in Asia warrants a careful analysis of its impact on households affected by HIV. Given the impoverishing effects of HIV s uch as lost income and higher medical expenditures among HIV - affected households, 14,15,16,17 the recent food and fuel price inflation could cause a greater number of vulnerable HIV-affected households to fall below the poverty line. Although the link between f ood security risks and HIV infection has been well established in Africa 18, only recently some studies have been conducted in Asia. Recently UNDP RCC 19 attempted to examine the potential economic impact of HIV on HIV -affected households with particular focus on food security by using some relevant studies/surveys. Three of the studies, from China (A total of 2,043 households were surveyed) 20, India (8,292 households) 21 and Thailand (600 households)22, include matched samples from HIV -affected and non-HIV- affected households. The Cambodian study (684 households) 23 examined two types of HIV-affected households (including people living with HIV [PLHIV] and with orphans (due to AIDS) and vulnerable children [OVC]) and compares households who were beneficiaries of an integrated food support and home -based care program with those of similar income and composition who were not. Finally, the Vietnam study 24 investigated expenditure patterns of 125 households that included a PLHIV in four cities. The analysis indicates that rises in food prices will likely impact the quality as well as the quantity of diets for 12 Commission of on AIDS in Asia (2008): Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an effective res ponse.

This implies that poorer households were divert ing money that they would otherwise spend on food to use for medical expenses. The findings on coping strategies among HIV-affected households are similar to those found in other studies. One thirds of households tend to borrow to meet increased medical expenses. Nearly the same proportion said that they had used their savings for medical expenses. One-fourth of households said that they liquidated assets. HIV households were found to have much higher amounts of dissavings and borrowing than non -HIV households, reflecting these strategies. In Cambodia, the findings clearly show the impact of the food support program as the intervention households spent a much lower percentage of household income on food. Interestingly, they also paid a lower percentage on medical costs; since no additional medical services are provided as part of the program, this can be presumed to be a result of better health status due to improved food security. Comparing the control and intervention households, it is seen that the inter vention households (receiving the food support) generally spent the money they had saved on food and medical expenses on children\u2019s education and \u201cother\u201d expenses. The HIV -affected households show similar differences in expenditure patterns between the con trol and intervention samples, although the difference in food expenditures is less sharp. Intervention households spent less on grains, as rice was provided to the households as part of the food support program. They also spent more money on protein - rich foods, indicating that the food support program had enhanced both the quality and quantity of food for these households. Additionally, the program enabled HIV -affected households to invest in children\u2019s education. The Vietnam study focused on HIV -affected households only. When asked the major sources of payment for health expenses, only the poorest households reported that they had sold assets to pay for healthcare costs. The use of savings increases with household income while the use of borrowing decrease s. The study found that HIV - affected households reduced consumption expenditures that they would otherwise make by between 37% (for the poorest households) and 42% (for the wealthiest households). With regard to poverty, they found that all households below the wealthiest quintile (i.e. 80% of households) would fall below the poverty line as a result of the income and expenditure effects of HIV/AIDS. Food insecurity and subsequent malnutrition bring detrimental health outcomes to people living with HIV. A study in Singapore unveiled a strong significant association between survival rates and malnutrition at the start of HIV treatment. 25 Malnutrition is also associated with a greater risk of opportunistic infections and mother -to- child HIV transmission, and c hildren living with HIV are more susceptible to severe malnutrition. 26 On the other hand, adequate food intake could help improve adherence to HIV drug intake by mitigating adverse drug side effects, which could intensify on an empty stomach. 27 Potentially far-reaching negative impacts of food insecurity on poverty reduction, HIV prevention, treatment and care & support in light of the recent food and fuel price increases and limited evidence in Asia and the Pacific require urgent attention, further examinati ons, and timely action. Discussion based on spot surveys -the impact of fuel prices The discussions presented in the following pages are based on the households survey results for the period 2004-05 in China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR conducted by the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok for its report on \u201cOvercoming Vulnerability to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific\u201d. While the sample size was very small (only 500 households), the purpose of the sample survey was to conduct a spot check of vulnerable sections of the population and confirm the point that macro level analysis can and often does miss out the specific pockets of impacts when aggregated across large sample sets. A similar survey for Mongolia in 2008 indicated the same trends of micro analysis averaging over pockets of increased impoverishment while tracking direct and indirect impacts of oil price rise on weaker sections of the population.

Vol 369, March 31, 2007: 1056. 63 world markets continued to surge, the mostly oil-importing countries of the region have struggled to sustain this policy. Within the group of countries studied and the chosen survey sample set, the direct impact of oil price rise on the poor has been very steep. Between 2002 and 2005, the average poor household paid: \u2022 171% more for cooking fuels; \u2022 120% more for transportation; \u2022 67% more for electricity; \u2022 55% more for lighting fuels; \u2022 33% more for petroleum-based fertilizers and other agricultural inputs; and \u2022 74% more for energy as a whole. China: Since 1998, China has linked petroleum prices to average crude oil prices in the international market. It also adjusts retail product prices, generally when there is a difference of more than 8% between domestic prices and the weighted average of prices in New York, Singapore and Rotterdam. Oil product prices in the country have been rising steadily according to this formula since 2002. In March 2006, the government imposed a special oil income levy on revenues earned by state-owned oil enterprises from the sale of locally produced crude oil. As a result, ex-refinery retail prices of gasoline and diesel increased further, by 10 to 15%. To counter the increases, the government provides targeted subsidies for certain groups: fishers, farmers, state-owned forestry enterprises and urban public transportation firms. Early in 2006, for a limited period, some provinces also offered cash compensation to poor residents to offset rising LPG prices. \u2022 Against the national average increase of 100% in the price of coal and 56.5% in the price of LPG, rural households reported an increase of about 215% in their expenditure on cooking fuels. The increase was steeper among urban households, at around 290%. \u2022 Diesel and petrol prices increased across the country by 174% and 129% respectively. Transport expenditure among households in the communities surveyed rose faster, by about 218% in the two villages and by 305% in the two urban areas surveyed. \u2022 Public transport tariffs paid by households were, however, kept low resulting in an increase of between 25 to 35% as a result of government subsidies to the transport companies. India: Until 2003, India had an administered pricing mechanism for petroleum products. This has now been dismantled. However, while the price of indigenously produced crude oil is linked to international crude prices, the oil marketing companies are not free to set the prices of petroleum products and have to absorb losses arising from government control. In spite of the subsidies, India has South Asia\u2019s highest retail prices for both petrol and diesel. This is due to high levels of taxes and duties. To protect the most vulnerable consumers, the government subsidizes the prices for household consumption of LPG and kerosene, on which it has removed customs and excise duties since 2004. As part of the 2006 primary sample survey, the following was noted: \u2022 Households in the communities surveyed reported an increase of about 20% in kerosene prices, half the increase in the national average. This reflects the government\u2019s measure to remove customs and excise duties on domestic cooking fuels. \u2022 Household expenditure on transport rose at a rate of 63% in rural communities surveyed and 60% in urban communities. This was somewhat lower than the average increases of 64 88.5% in the price of diesel and 61% in the price of petrol, mainly because of reduced consumption of these fuels. \u2022 Overall energy expenditures in rural households rose faster than in urban households. However, urban households were worst affected by the price rise in cooking fuels since most often the rural households rely on traditional fuels. Indonesia: Since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Indonesian government has provided large subsidies for domestic retail fuels, equivalent to 5.5% of GDP in 2000 (IMF 2003). In 2002, it introduced an automatic price adjustment system under which Pertamina, the state- owned oil company, resets prices of domestic oil products each month (except for kerosene), at 75% of international prices. In September 2005, the government announced another sharp rollback of subsidies, which more than doubled the retail prices of gasoline and diesel. To protect the poor from the effect of these increases, the government uses some of the savings from the reduction in subsidies to introduce a programme of cash transfers. These are aimed at financing poverty reduction, rural development, education and health programmes. The government still maintains subsidies on kerosene", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe126f15-f831-441d-933b-e3b6e4c6d66d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe126f15-f831-441d-933b-e3b6e4c6d66d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28a40256e0caffaec780653f5be2333c353b0504a83cfa08eede5c7f2c15b793"}, "3": {"node_id": "e64ba871-b9a3-4865-8181-d31b485e4060", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2dcedec558c04702b4ff02f25958de3fd1ba8f3c12241589019d80544170ea0"}}, "hash": "23ba7a4bb9c61e26a9f6331c84fab0286ab43f10eb6359208fb327d070bd26b4", "text": "prices, although there have been moves toward more targeted subsidies. \u2022 Both rural and urban households experienced a 210% increase in their expenditure on kerosene at unofficial (black market) prices, which were nearly double those of official prices. In fact, the unofficial price prevailed across the country. \u2022 Petrol prices rose by 140%, which affected households with motorcycles, though these were not necessarily the poor. \u2022 Expenditure on public transport rose faster among rural households, at 50%, compared to 30% among urban households, because of longer distances covered by the former. \u2022 Urban households, however, experienced significantly higher energy expenditure due to their greater reliance on petroleum products and their lack of recourse to biomass fuels for cooking \u2013 a 70% increase compared to the 30 % rise among rural households. Lao PDR: Retail prices of petroleum products in Lao PDR generally reflect changes in import prices. But some price control exists through tax and duty structure, along with other charges. Between 2003 and 2006, retail prices of gasoline and diesel almost doubled, though the government has intermittently introduced duty exemptions to slow the pass-through. In order to reduce the costs of transportation and production, the government has kept diesel prices around 15% below gasoline prices. \u2022 Kerosene prices increased by 90.5%, while LPG prices grew at a much lower rate of 20%. Since only urban households, mainly the non-poor, use LPG, the rural poor have suffered more through the steep rise in prices for kerosene, which is essential for home lighting. \u2022 The average increase in diesel and petrol prices has been 85.5% across the country. However, expenditure on public transport among rural households rose by 118%, suggesting a scarcity premium imposed by transport service providers. \u2022 The rise in transportation expenditure among urban households was 63% in one district and 178% in another district of Vientiane. The higher expenditure was incurred by households owning motorcycles, and the rate of the increase, compared to the official price, suggests the existence of a black market for petrol. \u2022 Overall expenditures on energy increased by 90% among rural households, somewhat higher than the 85% increase experienced by urban households. 65 Results of 2008 Mongolia HH survey conducted by UNDP Mongolia in collaboration with CSD (UNDP, 2008): On an average, for the urban households, retail petrol prices have gone up by 58.8 % and diesel prices by 56.9% due to the oil price rise. In comparison, for the rural households, retail petrol prices have gone up by 92.3% and diesel prices by 74.9%. \u2022 Transport expenditure has gone up by 90% in the urban and 104% in rural areas. \u2022 Public transport related expenditure went up by 60% in urban and 120% in rural \u2022 In the post-oil price rise scenario, for the urban households, the share of transport expenditure in income has risen to 15.9% and it is 24.1% in expenditure. Whereas these percentages are 8.9% and 18.2% for rural households. \u2022 In the cases of both urban and rural households, the share of expenditure on food and water in total expenditure has reduced from pre- to post-oil price rise times. However, this share has increased by about 8% in the case of transport related expenditure. Other Countries \u2022 When oil prices exceeded US$ 130 per barrel, the Malaysian government decided to increase the pump prices of gasoline and diesel by 41% and 63% respectively (Malaysia Economic Report, 2008). \u2022 To reduce the burden, Malaysian government introduced on 14 June 2008, to cover the period April 2008 to March 2009, cash payouts of RM 625 per vehicle, for owners of four-wheelers and RM 150 for two-wheeler owners. In the interiors, these payouts are RM 200 and RM 50 respectively (Malaysia Economic Report, 2008). \u2022 Malaysian government continues to subsidise diesel at RM 1.43 litre for fishermen and transport operators. For petrol powered taxi operators, they can continue buying petrol at subsidized price of RM 1.92 per litre subject to a maximum of 720 litres per month. \u2022 In Pakistan, though the prices of petroleum products in the international market have increased in the range of 91% to 104% during the period May 2004 to April 2007, the domestic sale prices have increased only in the range of 45% to 55% in the same period (Afia, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e64ba871-b9a3-4865-8181-d31b485e4060": {"__data__": {"id_": "e64ba871-b9a3-4865-8181-d31b485e4060", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28a40256e0caffaec780653f5be2333c353b0504a83cfa08eede5c7f2c15b793"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe126f15-f831-441d-933b-e3b6e4c6d66d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23ba7a4bb9c61e26a9f6331c84fab0286ab43f10eb6359208fb327d070bd26b4"}}, "hash": "e2dcedec558c04702b4ff02f25958de3fd1ba8f3c12241589019d80544170ea0", "text": "Till 2003-04 inflation in Pakistan was below 3.9%, which climbed to 9.3% in 2004-05 and remained high at 8 and 7.9% during 2005-06 and 2006-07 respectively.

For those at the bottom rungs of the ladder, the poor, it means moving up from a labour-intensive way of life that consumes a disproportionate amount of their time to an energy-intensive way of life that unleashes their human potential for betterment. Increases in the prices of oil products have reversed this process for many poor households, forcing them to either consume less of these products or to fall back upon inferior sources of energy. For certain critical uses, these households have had little option but to pay ever-increasing prices for fuels and other oil products, which has encroached upon their other needs. The sample HHs surveyed indicated the following: \u2022 Some 36% of kerosene-using households in India and 80% in the rural communities of Indonesia have reduced their consumption of kerosene for cooking. Instead, they have reverted to biomass and dung cakes wholly or partly. Urban households in Indonesia that do not have these options continue to pay higher prices for kerosene, but at the cost of other household expenditures. \u2022 In China, 89% of the rural households using LPG and coal for cooking have switched partly or entirely to fuel wood and crop residue. Some 29% of the urban households have 66 reached the limits of their ability to absorb higher LPG prices and plan to shift to coal if LPG prices climb further. \u2022 Higher public transport costs have curtailed the poor\u2019s access to essential services, especially those in rural communities. Several villagers in Lao PDR have gone back to travelling by foot or horseback to the nearest district centre, where the health care services and markets are located. \u2022 Urban migrant workers in India now travel less frequently to their home villages. Motorcycle users in China, Indonesia and Lao PDR, unable to restrict their essential travels have borne higher petrol prices, with adverse implications for their other expenditure. \u2022 Lacking other options, most poor households have continued to incur higher expenditures on kerosene for home lighting. Some very poor households in India, unable to pay the price, stay in darkness during long hours of power outages. On the whole, rising oil prices have left the poor with few choices other than to cut back on their consumption of oil products or, for uses that cannot be avoided, to bear the higher prices and look elsewhere in their household budgets to find the additional money. Since the urban poor rely more on oil products like kerosene and LPG, they are worse off than their rural counterparts who are either biomass users or have the biomass option to fall back upon. On the other hand, the rural poor are at a greater disadvantage when it comes to transport fuel costs, because inability to pay for these means forgoing essential services not available in the villages. Pacific Islands are particularly impacted by increases in transport costs as in many countries the only rural transport is by outboard-engined skiffs and livelihoods rely on fishing in these vessels. On the other hand few rural Pacific households have access to modern energy sources and rely primarily on bio-mass fuel for cooking, although kerosene is often used for lighting. Impact on lifestyles and livelihoods Across all countries, wherever families have switched to biomass fuels, the worst-affected have been women and children, who not only suffer from increased pollution at home but also have to spend more time and effort gathering fuels. This has been a particularly critical phenomenon in China and India, where such a switch has occurred in large numbers. As a result of rising transport costs, 64% of the surveyed rural households in Lao PDR reported scaling down their expenditures on children\u2019s education and 35% said they are able to spend less on items other than the most essential like food, clothing and health care. In India, rising transport costs have compelled a few households, in both rural and urban, to move their children to schools closer to their homes from better ones farther away. Rising household expenditures due in part to higher energy costs have obliged women to take on extra work. Among urban households surveyed in India, many women have started working, mostly as domestic help in other houses, in order to supplement family incomes. The majority of families interviewed are contemplating loans from moneylenders, self-help groups, banks and family members to cope. To overcome the burden of high fuel prices, about 66% of the urban and 76% of the rural households in Mongolia have stated that they have partially reduced consumption of relatively expensive food items like meat and moved to cheaper forms of bread", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1f2f8e9-42b5-4864-a488-1d70a40c04a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1f2f8e9-42b5-4864-a488-1d70a40c04a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6690d79b5ecedd04973b88f60c08fdfd68d80910cbd7e8e10fbec252fbce8f6"}}, "hash": "a6690d79b5ecedd04973b88f60c08fdfd68d80910cbd7e8e10fbec252fbce8f6", "text": "and 51% of the urban and 25% of the rural households have said that they have switched to less expensive alternatives, both food and fuel types. As a strategy to overcome the crisis due to oil price rise, majority of the households in Mongolia have modified their food consumption patterns preferring cheaper options, resorted to partial reduction in fuel 67 consumption and opted for loans from friends and relatives as well as commercial banks as a short term solution expecting a turnaround in the economic situation. Implications for the MDGs The survey data revealed that the higher public transport costs have curtailed the poor\u2019s access to essential services like hospitals and markets. In the case of Mongolia, travel to work, hospital and shopping are the most important transport needs of the urban households whereas travel to hospital and shopping are the most important transport needs of rural households. Increase in cost has forced the sample group of households to make compromises on accessing these services with serious negative implications for poverty removal and universal health care goals. Higher retail prices of fuels and petroleum products like fertilizers have economy-wide inflationary and/or recessionary impacts, leading to higher unemployment. Forced climb down the energy ladder reported in the survey has implications for maternal and child health care. Such climb down results in usage of traditional fuels for cooking causing indoor pollution. In households forced to switch back to traditional biomass fuels, demands upon the time of women and children for fuel collection and cooking has increased. This will eat into the time they will have for other, more productive activities. This has implications for gender equality and women empowerment. 6. Policy responses to the Food and Fuel price Inflation Policy responses adopted by governments to address fuel and food price increases have been varied. Some of the measures implemented are more cost-effective and less distortionary than others. A number of countries may have moved to implement universal rather than targeted measures because they allow a quicker response. First let us analyse macro policy responses: 6.1 Macro policy responses Monetary responses to the Food and Fuel price Inflation Monetary policy stance in many countries in Asia and the Pacific has moved towards more tightening given sharply rising inflation, but at the same time policy stance also become more cautious given the worsening global economic outlook and the increased volatility of the financial markets. Central banks in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan (China), Vietnam have raised policy rates and/or cash reserve requirement ratios. Central Bank of China has raised the bank reserve requirement ratio several times in the recent years to absorb the excess cash from its BOP surplus. However, it has not raised policy interest rates. In fact, in mid-September 2008 it has cut interest rates and reserve requirement ratios to maintain stable economic growth. The Central banks in Malaysia and Korea have maintained their key rate, pointing out that inflation is generally supply-driven and that increasing the rate may dampen demand and weaken overall economic growth. Some Central banks indicated, however, that they may change their policy should inflation risks persist. Singapore tightened policy through a stronger currency, while Sri Lanka tightened its monetary policy stance by issuing its own securities to mop up the excess liquidity and contain reserve money growth. Bangladesh: To curb inflation expectations, the spread between short term and long term rates of government securities has been reduced through adjustments in yields on short term bills and long term government bonds. In the foreign exchange market, Bangladesh Bank (the central bank) undertook measures to arrest undue volatility in the exchange rate to reduce the impact of world inflation on the domestic price level; keeping due attention to impact on 68 exports and inflow of remittances. Bangladesh has been able to, by and large, keep inflation under check. The targeted inflation rate for 2009 FY is 9 %. The policy stance also targets a GDP growth rate of 6.5 %. The Bangladesh Bank (BB, hence forth) is also thinking of rationalization/reduction of duties, appropriate phasing and timing of import of food grains and essential food items, strengthening internal procurement of food grains, increasing the efficiency of food grain trading and marketing, installing effective market monitoring and surveillance system, efficient programming of targeted distribution and open market sale operations, and other measures to reduce any undue strain on market operations. The monetary policy stance of FY08 also aimed at supporting the government\u2019s growth stimulating and poverty reduction programs through using the monetary instruments at the disposal of BB.

China: after five years of running a tight monetary policy, it has cut interest rates (Sept 15, 2008) and eased bank lending restrictions indicating a cooling of the economy. The People's Bank of China cut its one-year lending rate by 27 basis points (bps), lowering the cost of one- year bank loans to 7.2%. However, for now, the benchmark deposit rates remain unchanged with the one-year rate at 4.14%. The Chinese central bank will also lower the reserve ratio for all except the country's five biggest banks and the Postal Savings Bank by 1%. The central bank aim in terms of monetary policy is to maintain fast, stable and equitable economic growth. The interest rate cut marks a partial reversal of a steady stream of increases in reserves, which the People's Bank of China raised on 18 occasions between July 2006 and June 2008 to absorb the excess cash from its balance of payment surplus. India: Keeping in view the liquidity conditions and inflationary pressures in the economy, the cash reserve ratio was raised by 75 basis points to 8.25 % during April-May 2008 in three stages of 25 basis points each effective from April 26, May 10, and May 24, 2008. On May 30, 2008, special market operations were announced to alleviate the binding financing constraints faced by public sector oil companies in importing POL as also to minimise the potential adverse consequences for financial markets in which these oil companies are important participants. On a review of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions and with a view to containing inflation expectations, the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) was raised by 25 basis points to 8.0 % with effect from June 12, 2008. To check inflationary pressures the repo rate was increased under the LAF by 50 basis points to 8.50 % on June 25, 2008 and the CRR by 50 basis points to 8.75 % in two stages of 25 basis points each with effect from July 5, 2008 and July 19, 2008. However, as recently as September 6th, India's most widely watched price measure, rose 12.14 % in the 12 months to Sept. 6, marginally above the previous week's 12.10 % and exceeding a Reuters forecast for 12.09 %. Further tightening of monetary policy is expected to keep inflation in check; however it is likely to slow down over all growth, as indicated by a revision in the forecasted growth rates. Philippines: Against the background of a continuous surge in energy and food prices, average headline inflation rose to 9.7 % from 5.6 % in the previous quarter (Q2). The strong price dynamics of food and oil have also started to feed into other prices, as evident in the uptrend in core inflation. Core inflation, which measures the underlying trend in inflation by excluding specific food and energy items, accelerated to 6.2 % during the review quarter from 4.1 % in the previous quarter (Q2). Consequently, in June, the Monetary Board raised 69 the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 (BSP) key policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 5.25 % for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7.25 % for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. Then again in July, both these rates were driven further upwards: RRP by 50 basis points to 5.75% and RP also by 50 basis points to 7.75%. The Monetary Board believed that a more decisive monetary action was necessary as price pressures have increased and second-round effects have already set in. Thailand: as consistent with measures most other countries have taken in the region in light of the upward price pressure due to the oil and food inflation, Thailand also opted to also raise the main interest rate. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on July 16 decided the raise the policy interest rate from 3.25 % to 3.50 % per annum. Indonesia: The Board of Governors' Meeting at Bank Indonesia (BI) on August 5, 2008 decided to raise the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 9.00%. This decision was taken to bolster the stability of the Indonesian economy and financial system and specifically to support the medium-term outlook for the inflation target. To reinforce monetary policy effectiveness, the decision to raise the BI rate was taken in tandem with optimisation of other monetary policy instruments for control exchange rate volatility and absorption of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b4b008d-8d99-4410-95b8-0568ac7d599f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b4b008d-8d99-4410-95b8-0568ac7d599f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51fdca4ad0af54aee50101eaedf80fb979e70f5c3787163c422aac9ba649e362"}}, "hash": "51fdca4ad0af54aee50101eaedf80fb979e70f5c3787163c422aac9ba649e362", "text": "excess liquidity in Open Market Operations (OMO). Under this integrated policy, the targeted inflation of 6.5%-7.5% in 2009 is regarded as achievable. Pakistan: In FY08, oil and food imports requirements constituted around 40 % of total import payments. With non- oil non- food imports registering a strong growth momentum (24.2 %), aggregate growth in imports was 31.2 % that is much higher than the last five years average of 24 %. Therefore, as a net food importer, not only is Pakistan\u2019s Balance of Payments affected, it carries a heavy financial burden in light of the hike in market prices of oil and food commodities. There has been significant domestic borrowing and they continued unabated with additional borrowing of Rs149.8 billion during May 25 to June 30, 2008. Budget for fiscal year FY09 estimates put the fiscal deficit at 7 % of GDP, while financing data available to SBP for the full FY08 shows that this could be as high as 8.3 % of GDP. The burden of subsidies and rising consumption demand have widened macroeconomic imbalances in addition to pressures felt by the exchange rate. With regard to the interest rate, it has only been increasing. As far back as July 2007, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) policy rate was raised by 50 bps to 10 % simply to allow for sterilization of excessive foreign inflows, which came in the last two weeks of FY07, and stem anticipated inflationary pressures. Then in January 2008, viewing the developments in H1- FY08 and outlook for future, SBP advocated the need for strengthening demand management and raised policy rate by another 50 bps to 10.5 %. Then again in May 2008 the SBP increased the policy discount by 150 basis points to 12.0 %. Sri Lanka: inflation has been rampant, primarily driven by the global rise in food and oil prices. It reached a value of 28.2 % in June and since then has come down to around the 25 % mark. Given this scenario the Central Bank has decided to tighten its monetary policy stance by restraining the expansion in reserve money. Accordingly, the Bank further revised downwards its reserve money targets for the third quarter of the year over and above the already tightened reserve money targets announced in April 2008. With this revision, the targeted rate of expansion in the annual average of reserve money has been lowered from 12.50 % to 11.75 %. Credit to the private sector, which was as high as 26 % in April 2007, had decelerated to 12.7 % by end June 2008. In terms of the Central Bank\u2019s policy of restraining from investing in new Treasury bills, the Bank had exhausted its stock of Treasury 70 bills available for open market operations. Hence, the Bank has moved to issuing its own securities to mop up the excess liquidity and contain reserve money growth. However, in the past month (August 2008) there has been a decline in food prices globally and also a containment in demand pressures due to an active contractionary monetary policy. The inflation, in addition to high fuel and food prices can also be attributed to the expenditure of approximately $1.5 billion (2008) towards the war effort. Pacific Islands: More than half of the Pacific Island countries are constrained in their use of monetary policy as a tool of macroeconomic management due to their use of third-country currencies as their medium of exchange. In most of those that are able to use monetary instruments their capital markets are relatively undeveloped and interest rates are not regarded as an effective tool for influencing economic behaviour. Exchange rate policy is likewise also constrained and few countries have been able to adjust exchange rates to provide compensatory movements to mitigate the inflationary impacts of the rising prices. In Fiji, one of the most developed in the region, the Reserve bank recently relaxed some of the tight monetary restraints that had been in place since the military coup of December 2006. The need to stimulate investment and employment would appear to be paramount at the present time. It is clear that countries generally accommodated the first-round effects of higher food and fuel prices on inflation. However, in the recent months, many countries are tightening their monetary policies to prevent the first-round effects of higher food and fuel prices on inflation from spilling over to higher prices of other goods and services. This is because the second- round effects may trigger a wage-price spiral. This is particularly important for countries where inflation has already been rising because of overly expansionary macroeconomic policies.

As the course of monetary tightening often incurs undesirable costs of slowing growth, it is critical to closely monitor the situations and ensure essential fiscal support to cushion the weaker segments of society. Countries have adopted various fiscal measures in response to high oil and food prices. One notices, in the 2008 or 2009 budget, an increased emphasis on planning towards mitigating future food and fuel crisis through expansionary fiscal spending on agriculture. Even in the short run a number of countries have to bear the brunt of the increased subsidy bill towards food and fuel. In the medium-term this is leading to a mounting and unsustainable deficit. Consequently, some countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka are trying to phase out food and fuel subsidies. In 2008, Indonesia reduced fuel subsidies and raised fuel prices by 30%. However, the reduction was only partial as remaining subsidies remain high. Moreover, the direct cash assistance programme to protect the poor from the fuel price also increase fiscal burden. Malaysia also reduced fuel subsidies and raised fuel prices by 40% in 2008, as it introduced subsidies programme to boost agricultural production. Korea and the Philippines have reduced or exempted import tariffs on agricultural and fuel products. Thailand reinstated fuel subsidies in March 2008 for 6 months to limit the impact on domestic prices. In Bangladesh the subsidies and transfers bill accounts for about 35% of government expenditure during the period July 2007 to April 2008. This is a 15% increase since 2005. To increase future agriculture production, the government has given Taka 1100 crore as 71 agriculture subsidy for FY 2005-06. Due to price hike of fertilizer in international market and recent increase of fuel price, the agricultural subsidy for FY 2006-07 has been estimated at Taka 2000 crore, of which Taka. 1100 crore will be needed for fertiliser subsidy. In addition to the subsidy, the government is also providing incentives for agricultural development such as 30 % cash incentive for agricultural exports and 20 % rebate on utility bills of agro-based industries. Bangladesh has also reduced interest rates of agriculture credit from 8 % to 2 % to boost agricultural production. With regard to the \u2018food account\u2019 section in the latest budget 2008-2009, the subsidy allocated for food (which is different for subsidy for agriculture) is Taka 1316 crore. This figure is likely to be revised. In any case, it is substantially more (almost double) than the Taka 733 crore subsidy for food in 2007-2008. Indonesia continues to subsidize fuel and electricity consumption by maintaining a sizeable gap between domestic and international oil prices. Subsidies are expected to make up about 20% of central government expenditure during 2008, with those on fuel taking up the lion\u2019s share of the total. In an attempt to limit the negative impact of high oil prices on the state budget, the government was forced in May 2008 to increase subsidised fuel prices by an average of 29%, in order to reduce the budget cost of the subsidies. Moreover, given recent trends showing a decline in oil prices, the Indonesian government has proposed to cut fuel subsidy by 44% in 2009. To cope in general with the food and fuel price inflation, the Indonesian government has come up with a targeted response. The salient elements of this comprehensive plan include \u2022 subsidized rice distribution (to be raised in 2008 to 15 kg per household per month for 9 months (Rp 1,600/kg)); \u2022 import duty on rice to be lowered to Rp 450 per kg; \u2022 higher rice production in 2008/2009 through accelerated provision of high quality seeds; \u2022 retention of progressive export taxes on palm oil and derivative products with adjustments; \u2022 retention of zero-rated (government paid) VAT for domestic sales of bulk cooking oil and with expanded coverage to include packaged cooking oil; \u2022 subsidized sales of unbranded cooking oil to low income earners and MSEs for 6 months (average subsidy Rp 2,500 per litre); \u2022 elimination of import duties on soybeans, reduction in tax on imported soybeans from 2.5% to 0.5%, subsidized sales of soybean for small-scale fermented soy bean cake/tofu production for 6 months (average subsidy Rp 1,000 per kg), continuation of existing program for promoting domestic soybean production with expansion for development of soybean estates; \u2022 elimination of import duty on flour, introduction of zero-rated VAT policy for wheat, revision with deferment of compulsory Indonesian National Standard for wheat imports, MSMEs encouraged to participate in kerosene", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f61d7043-3b4e-4005-8735-c7732fe265bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f61d7043-3b4e-4005-8735-c7732fe265bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f265874f0b88f0befaf2be7dee4ea4db7ffd057b232322fa6c788788bc12e81f"}, "3": {"node_id": "8cbea4c8-5b8e-44b9-94f0-43c417d73c10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d18302474febde4ff095b128baaff47617a35760bf77716b6913bf69f2cad261"}}, "hash": "49e106f71b8cf64bb40d241bb1fc5078ab070452f05af3eadf7bda566cc3a312", "text": "to gas conversion through distribution of gas storage tanks and burners.

Many of these numbers are all time records. Nonetheless, the public distribution system, the largest food distribution system in the world runs a food subsidy of about 25,000 crore Rupees per annum. This has increased more than four fold since a decade ago. Together with other food welfare programmes Rupees 32,667 crore will be provided next year for food subsidy. The government is trying to make the PDS a more effective and efficient system in light of the enormous fiscal burden it currently poses. In addition and towards this end, the thirteenth Finance Commission to be requested to revisit the roadmap for fiscal adjustment and suggest a suitably revised roadmap, after the obligations on account of the Sixth Central Pay Commission becomes clear. With regard to the next year\u2019s budget, some pertinent highlights in terms of spending are; Under agriculture and cooperation, the government has allocated 1100 crore rupees for the national food security mission; 500 crore rupees for Micro Irrigation, 644 crore rupees for the National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS); 299 crore rupees for a Technology Mission on Horticulture in NE Region, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttrakhand; 320 crore rupees for Integrated Oilseeds, Oil Palm, Pulses & Maize Development Scheme. Under Animal Husbandary, dairying and fisheries 130 crore rupees has been allocated for a Livestock Census; 160 crore rupees for a special package for farming population in 31 suicide prone districts in the country; and 75 crore rupees for a National Fisheries Development Board. Under agricultural research and education the government intends to spend 315 crore rupees for research issues in Crop Sciences; 350 crore rupees for agricultural education to improve the quality of human resource, upgrade infrastructure and educational reforms; 281 crore rupees for agricultural extension programmes to disseminate frontline technologies; 257 crore rupees for National Agricultural Innovation Project and 45 crore rupees for Fisheries research and quality fish seed. Thailand: Internal price stability is facing higher risks from increasing inflationary pressure. Headline inflation in July increased to 9.2 % (y-o-y), from 8.9 % (y-o-y) in June, due to continued rising oil price and food-related prices. However, it is expected that the inflationary pressure will be subsided in the near future as result of the six economic assistance programs, and the declining trend of oil price. Unemployment rate in June 2008 remained low at1.2 % of the total labour force. Public debt to GDP as of June was at 35.8 %, remained well below the 50 % public debt ceiling under the Fiscal Sustainability Framework. In terms of fiscal expenditure during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2008 (October 2007 - June 2008), the spending amounted to 1,359 billion Baht, expanding at 4.4 % (y-o-y). This is 76.4 % of the Fiscal Year 2008 budget expenditure. The fiscal expenditure is expected to meet the target disbursement rate of 94.0 % of the Fiscal Year 2008. Vietnam is on balance a food exporting country which has not borne the brunt of the food price hike. Also, the government has cut fuel subsidies, which will lead to a reduction in its overall expenditure. Although the government may cut back some spending programmes in an effort to cool the economy, expenditure will remain high, as the government is still committed to programmes to improve social welfare provisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cbea4c8-5b8e-44b9-94f0-43c417d73c10": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cbea4c8-5b8e-44b9-94f0-43c417d73c10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f265874f0b88f0befaf2be7dee4ea4db7ffd057b232322fa6c788788bc12e81f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f61d7043-3b4e-4005-8735-c7732fe265bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49e106f71b8cf64bb40d241bb1fc5078ab070452f05af3eadf7bda566cc3a312"}}, "hash": "d18302474febde4ff095b128baaff47617a35760bf77716b6913bf69f2cad261", "text": "The new income tax structure will broaden the tax base by making benefits as well as salaries taxable, and will apply the same tax rates to Vietnamese and foreign workers (the tax threshold for foreign workers will fall to match that for local workers. it is currently twice as high as that for local workers).

The current subsidy bill, as revealed by the budget stands at a whopping 407 billion rupees; out of which petroleum accounts for 175 billion rupees; electricity 133 billion rupees; and wheat 40 billion rupees. This has led to large fiscal deficit through significant domestic and foreign borrowing. The projected estimate of current account deficit for 2007-08 has crossed 8 % of GDP, soaking up foreign savings and resulting in depletion of foreign exchange reserves and increase in foreign debt. The government thus does not have much space for fiscal manoeuvring and must pass on the burden of prices to the consumer. As such it will increase the support price of wheat from Rs 510 to Rs 625 per 40 kg. Also, it envisions a programme of phasing out subsidies on energy and food over time (time horizon has not been specified). However, there are some exceptions to this general rule, as the government proposed to more than double the subsidy on fertilizers from rupees 470 to rupees 1000 per bag. The total subsidy is increased from rupees 25 billion to rupees 32 billion. The government does however wish to scrap duty on imports related to food and agriculture. For example, exemption from 10% custom duty on import of rice seeds and also a waiver is proposed for the 5% excise duty on premium of crop insurance policy. Also, equipment and machinery for proper storage of food items is to be imported free of duty. In terms of improving tax collection, the government has proposed a broad based plan, which includes, (i)widening the tax base, (ii) reducing exemptions, (iii) providing incentives and concessions wherever required, (iv) reducing multiplicity of tax rates, (v) lowering tax rates, (vi) shifting the incidence of tax burden from production to consumption, (vii) moving away from the excessive reliance on manufacturing and taxing all value additions including services, (viii) enhancing the neutrality between present and future consumption, (ix) enhancing the neutrality of the tax system to forms of business organizations and sources of finance, (x) re- engineering the business process of the tax system to overcome the culture of tax avoidance and evasion, (xi) effecting business process changes in tax administration to establish an effective and efficient tax system. These are the guiding principles of the tax policy which the Government should focus on and employ. In Malaysia the cut in the fuel price subsidy announced in June, 2008 will help to keep the fiscal position stable. Revenue collection is likely to be boosted by high international oil prices, and also by the government\u2019s recently announced move to impose windfall taxes on palm oil producers and independent power-generating companies. The fiscal deficit will average 3.2% of GDP in 2008-09. The savings made as a result of the latest cut in the fuel price subsidy are unlikely to lead to a dramatic reduction in the budget deficit, as the subsidy on fuel was treated as an off-budget item. That said, the savings made as a result of the reduction in the fuel subsidy will be used to offset the cost of subsidies on food and other items that are expected to be introduced soon as part of a restructured subsidy scheme; these subsidies are included in the budget. Food security has become a high priority for the government, which has already set aside M$1.5bn (US$470m) in 2008 to subsidise rice farmers and to import rice to expand the national stockpile. The government\u2019s recent decision to postpone some large infrastructure projects will also lighten the fiscal burden this year. Pacific Islands: Almost all pacific Islands are heavily dependent on imported food particularly to supply the growing number of urban households. They are also almost totally dependent on imported fuel products. For the urban poor rice, cereal products and cooking oil are major components of household food expenditure.

In Marshall Islands the government was so concerned at the impact of fuel prices on its power generator that a \u201cState of Emergency\u201d was declared to enable the government to gain control of the situation. Those Pacific island states that rely on revenues generated from trust funds or sovereign wealth funds, notably Kiribati and Tuvalu, to support their budgets are also being severely impacted by the sharp falls in global asset values that have occurred in recent months. A global recession will hurt Pacific states even further if fishing license fees should decline and the opportunities for overseas employment and the generation of remittances is adversely impacted. The scope for a fiscal response from Pacific governments to mitigating rising prices and the impact on the poor is therefore very limited. Only in Fiji has the government attempted to reduce tariffs on \u201cessential\u201d food items, including rice and cereal products, to mitigate the price increases. In other countries the primary response has been to exhort the public to return to consuming traditional crops, and thus to supporting local agriculture. It is clear that governments use actively fiscal policy response and pass-through effects. However, governments need to assess the overall fiscal cost of subsidies, transfers, safety net programmes, etc. Even the most efficient and effective policy responses to higher fuel and food prices can result in fiscal costs The available options to deal with the fiscal costs of policy responses depend in turn on individual countries\u2019 macroeconomic situation and their capacity to create fiscal space. For example, countries without binding debt sustainability, financing, or macro-stability constraints have scope to loosen their fiscal positions to accommodate the costs of measures taken in response to higher fuel and food prices. In countries with fiscal constraints, governments should create fiscal space to offset these fiscal costs without jeopardizing the sustainability of their financial position or the stability of the economy. Fiscal space can be created in a variety of ways, including by increasing revenue, reducing non-productive spending, raising borrowing in a non inflationary and sustainable way, and securing higher external grants or concessional loans provided by donors. Countries that find it difficult to create fiscal space would need to limit the size and duration of the fiscal response and pass-through the increase in international prices to domestic consumers more rapidly. To the extent possible, this should be accompanied by strengthening and expansion of cost-effective social safety nets. Trade related responses to the Food and Fuel price Inflation As food prices soared, a key component of the national policy response has been to stabilize food prices domestically thought the use of tariff and other trade related measures in the Asia Pacific region. Consolidated detailed information/data on national trade policy responses for the Asia Pacific region are not available and current applied tariff rates structures being maintained by countries are not available yet in the public domain. The analysis based on a secondary literature review and country level desk top research however does bring out a broad pattern of responses across countries in the region providing a snapshot of the trade related aspects of the food crises. Reduction/Elimination of Import Tariffs 75 When food price rise, governments have the option of either reducing or eliminating applied tariffs on import of food commodities (and vice versa of raising it up to the bound levels if prices fall to protect the agricultural sector from cheap commercially displacing imports). Although country by country current applied tariff levels are not readily available, it is fairly well known that applied MFN tariffs on basic food commodities in majority of developing countries are quite low already being in the range of 8-14% for the five basic food items (wheat, rice, maize, soya oil, palm oil).28 Given the sharp food price increase (when prices rose between 88 to 160% in early 200829), reduction or even elimination of import tariffs would have a limited impact on stabilizing domestic prices. For the select countries surveyed in Asia, the tariff instrument has been indeed been utilized as a mechanism to cushion the impact of high prices. Export Prohibitions, Restrictions and Export Taxation A typical response in some of the food exporting countries has been to put in place export prohibition measures including through restraining or banning exports for certain periods of time subject to review. Export taxes and fixing of minimum prices and quantitative restrictions have also been used as a response.

Thus countries like India, Indonesia, Pakistan, China, Cambodia, Vietnam have taken resort to these types of measures to varying degrees for basic commodities like wheat, rice, pulses, maize and edible oils. It may be useful to highlight a few specific instances of countries resorting to export prohibitions and other domestic policy measures of different types. In Indonesia, the government imposed controls over medium grade rice exports, since international rice prices were double that of the local prices. The State agency Bulog can now sell medium grade rice overseas only when national stocks are above 3 MT. Domestic prices also have to be set below a set government target price. Cambodia, except for border areas in Vietnam, placed a temporary ban on paddy export while removing the ban on pork imports. Domestically around 300 MT of rice was released to the market at lower than market price. Soft loans (US 10 m) were provided to state owned Green Trade Company and private rice millers for increasing paddy rice stock. In June, the government has lifted the export curbs on rice exports except for shipments in excess of 1 MT. The government is also considering a no tax policy on agricultural inputs and reduction of taxes on food imports. An additional focus is to increase agricultural productivity and taking steps to augment yields while increasing irrigated land and land available for cultivation. In the long run, the government would try to create grain storage facilities at the provincial and national levels, examine the feasibility of having a second rice crop, assessing the short term and medium term requirement for agricultural inputs including fertilizers and high yielding seed varieties, reduction of post harvest losses, promote aquaculture, improve information databases and examine policy options of tariffs, taxes and minimum support prices. Vietnam, after curtailing exports in March and April, extended a ban on signing of new rice export contracts and capped rice exports to 3.5 MT. It also banned speculators from its domestic market. In June, the government has lifted the export bans on news of an increase in rice production subject to the minimum price of USD 800 per Ton on an f.o.b. basis. In South Asia, the Indian government prohibited exports of non-basmati rice since February 2008 barring honouring of previous export contracts. In addition, minimum price fixation and export tax were also imposed on export of basmati rice. Restrictions also apply 28 Ramesh Sharma and Panos Konandreas, WTO Provisions in the context of responding to soaring food prices, FAO Commodity and Trade Policy Research Working Paper No. 25, FAO, August 2008 29 Ibid 76 on export of other varieties of rice. Other commodities which have been banned until April 2009 include wheat, edible oils, maize. Earlier, in 2007, the ban on export of pulses was freed of quantitative restrictions. Pakistan banned exports of wheat flour and export of pulses. While Thailand desisted from export ban measures, in May 2008, announced that the government would seek to create a cartel of rice producing countries in partnership with Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. The move if successful would then sustain the current phase of high prices and worsen the impact to poor consumers across Asia. Thailand is the largest exporter of rice in the world (10 MT annually) followed by Vietnam. Two important questions arise in this context: one relating to the broad implications of these prohibitions on agriculture production and trade including on food insecurity for food importing countries and whether or not these types of measures are permissible under the WTO. Trade policy prohibitions and restrictions can have several adverse perhaps unintended consequences: \u2022 Trade related restrictions especially when implemented in an ad hoc and uncoordinated manner30 contribute directly to price instability in international markets by limited global supplies. This tends to worsen the food security situation in other countries especially when international trade in these commodities is thin. Thus for instance, global rice trade is thin with only about 7 % of rice production being traded internationally. Given the limited number of supplier countries any government intervention in the export or import market has the potential to affect the prices in a significant way. Thus for instance, net food importing countries like Bangladesh and Philippines took a big hit due to restrictions placed on global rice supplies. \u2022 Discourage domestic production since the due the wedge in domestic and international market price, producers stand to lose out on profits thereby influencing future investment and production decisions \u2022 they may lead", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54f4bf58-ba3b-4b89-a564-664bd3542a45": {"__data__": {"id_": "54f4bf58-ba3b-4b89-a564-664bd3542a45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e8fca656706c5c802ee2bdff7e8cec57aa794afcb0d0c1b54caa715230f672f"}}, "hash": "3e8fca656706c5c802ee2bdff7e8cec57aa794afcb0d0c1b54caa715230f672f", "text": "to a dent in the reputation of the country as a reliable exporter by importing countries and loss of future trading opportunities especially when more than one supplier country is available which may potentially affect future export earnings; \u2022 lead importing countries to reassess their reliance on international trade as an assured way of meeting food security objectives and initiate national self sufficiency plans in food for the medium and long term; Are trade related prohibitions WTO Compatible? In general, the WTO provisions do not prohibit Member countries from undertaking steps to address national food shortages. Under the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), export prohibitions and restrictions can be enforced by Member countries to relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting contracting party. (Article 12, reference to para 2(a) of the GATT Agreement)31 The only limiting factor is that for the net food exporting developing countries of the specific foodstuff concerned will have to give due consideration to the effects of such prohibitions or restriction on the food security of the 30 Soaring Food Prices: Facts, Perspectives, Impacts and Actions Required, FAO Background Paper for the High Level Conference on World Food Security: The Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy, June 2008 31 Ramesh Sharma and Panos Konandreas, WTO Provisions in the context of responding to soaring food prices, FAO Commodity and Trade Policy Research Working Paper No. 25, FAO, August 2008 77 importing member and to the extent practicable must be done with advance notice in writing and in consultation with the importing Member concerned. It is obvious that global food markets need to be kept open to avoid any distortion in the economy. Restrictive trade policies, such as export bans or export taxes imposed by net food exporters tend to have unintended negative consequences at the domestic level, and at the global level. They push up world prices even further and hurt net importers. From a global perspective, maintaining free trade in commodities while fostering incentives for production and using efficient policies to protect the urban poor (e.g., targeted cash transfers) is a priority. An ambitious Doha Round conclusion, including on agriculture, can help broaden and stabilize international food trade. While an ambitious Doha Round conclusion may not lead to lower food prices in the short term, it will foster efficient agricultural production in the medium and long term and boost global growth. As noted earlier, reduced tariffs on imported food can alleviate food prices pressures and improve efficiency. However, many poor countries have narrow tax bases and rely on tariffs and other trade taxes for a large part of government revenue. In such countries, it is important to ensure that the revenue loss from tariff or trade tax reductions can be accommodated without destabilizing countries\u2019 macroeconomic policies. To sum up, given the various constraints on monetary and fiscal policy, authorities have frequently resorted to administrative controls to reduce inflationary pressures. Such administrate measures include price controls, and increasing domestic supply by limiting exports or reducing import restrictions/duties. Countries such as China, Mongolia and Sri Lanka resorted to domestic price regulation. Similarly, many countries such as Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam have tried to improve domestic supply reducing import duties or limiting exports. Similarly countries such as Bangladesh, Malaysia and Philippines have trying to boost agricultural production by offering various incentives. Countries attempt to strike a balance between helping the poor to cope with the significant price increases, ensuring macroeconomic stability, and encourage increased agricultural production. Countries need to smooth adjustment to higher food and fuel prices by adopting short-term fiscal measures such as fiscal subsidies, tax exemptions, etc. As of now, the fiscal policy stance (in terms of the overall deficit) in most of the countries is in an acceptable level. However, a further increase in food and oil prices could require some fiscal tightening to counter inflation expectations. To that end, on helping the vulnerable groups in the short-term, there is a need to develop well-targeted social safety programmes such as food stamp systems or school feeding programmes. This is because many countries lacked any well-developed social safety net programmes. On the macroeconomic stability, countries need to monitor actively the fiscal situations and balance of payments implications of the food and fuel price developments. In the medium- term, macroeconomic stability requires full pass-through of food and fuel price increases to consumers. As of now, pass-through of food and fuel adjustment is low in many countries due to subsidies and tax cuts. But this aggregate fiscal burdens. Therefore, governments make an effort to full pass through food and fuel", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bc58c34-2ced-4abd-a6d8-a1c418a58f27": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bc58c34-2ced-4abd-a6d8-a1c418a58f27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a828e96384ad61d23bf3df67f2dde9dbf421cccc50627edfd915d404ff1c298"}}, "hash": "8a828e96384ad61d23bf3df67f2dde9dbf421cccc50627edfd915d404ff1c298", "text": "price increases to rich consumers in order to safeguard the government budget. In this regard, there is need to close the gap between pump 78 prices and prices mandated by the price adjustment mechanism. Similarly, a full pass-through adjustment for food products in the medium-term will help to foster a positive agricultural supply response. On promoting increased supply in the medium-term, countries should avoid any distortionary price controls in view of their adverse effect on incentives for domestic production. In the medium-run, countries should also avoid any export restriction because it hinders expansion of agricultural production and encourages smuggling. In the longer term, countries should raise agricultural productivity through improving rural infrastructure and offering HYV seeds, fertilizer subsidies, etc. In the long-run, countries should also strengthen their social safety nets programme. It is clear that regional and international cooperation to facilitate the elimination of barriers to agricultural trade has become an urgent imperative in the wake of the food crisis. Measures such as the establishment of regional and sub regional commodity exchanges, and clearinghouses need to be considered. The government revenue losses from reduction or exemptions of temporary taxes and customs for petroleum products and some food products need to be monitored carefully. Similarly fiscal costs due to fiscal subsidies also need to be monitored carefully. Some countries eliminated or reduced custom tariffs for fuels and food imports and announced indicative prices for these products to monitor and support through a strengthened dialogue with wholesalers and retailers. It is also clear that international community should work with governments to urgently develop implement able safety net measures and improved targeted tax cuts, subsidies, and pro-poor spending to mitigate the adverse impact of food and petroleum price increases on the poor, design supply side measures to increase agricultural production, and strengthen monetary and exchange rate policies. The analysis here has made several key points. First, the recent surge in world cereal prices has been accompanied by a real depreciation of the US dollar. For many countries (but not all), this depreciation has neutralized a substantial proportion of the increase in world prices. Second, domestic commodity specific policies in several of these Asian countries have further stabilized domestic prices relative to the change in world prices. On average, the increase in domestic food prices was about half of the increase in real US dollar world market food prices. Although this might seem somewhat small, this should not be taken to imply that events on world markets have no consequences for food security: even relatively small price increases of 10 to 20% for staple foods have serious implications for the household food security of the poor. Third, the policy challenge is to ensure that economic efficiency and stability are maintained while at the same time protecting vulnerable population groups. The best option in the medium term is to develop a well-targeted social safety net that can protect vulnerable households in the face of rising prices. However, the design and implementation of such a programme is itself a challenge. 79 6.2 Responses to oil price shock32 Fuel Subsidies Governments often subsidize petroleum products, commonly household fuels such as kerosene and LPG but also in some cases transportation fuels. But they can find this very costly. Thailand, for example, in January 2004 introduced price ceilings for petroleum products, most of which continued until October 2004, and ceilings for diesel until February 2005 \u2013 resulting in a subsidy bill for that period of around US$ 2.2 billion (ESMAP 2006). Indonesia had a similar programme, which in 2005 produced a subsidy bill of about US$ 9.9 billion. That increased to about US$ 9.3 billion in 2007. An IMF study concluded that for a range of countries subsidy expenditures could be higher than health and education expenditures combined (IMF 2006). Governments will want therefore to ensure that subsidy programmes are well- managed and accurately targeted for the poor. Malaysia, for example, in 2006 launched a smart-card scheme targeted at public transport operators and fishermen, giving them access to subsidies through a monthly quota based on vehicle category or boat size. When subsidies were further reduced in 2008, targeted cash transfers were made to private owners of small vehicles. In India, under-recoveries due to subsidization of Kerosene and LPG prices had reached US$ 12.32 billion in 2006-07 (Mahurkar, 2007). In Pacific island countries subsidies are generally only available to specific industries, including state- owned power generators and commercial fishing enterprises, some countries also provide a concessionary duty rate on out-board engine fuel in recognition of the importance of this transport system and the role of inshore fisheries in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fca1e61-9066-4668-b2cb-7f91791da00f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fca1e61-9066-4668-b2cb-7f91791da00f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c54844a897845bff4ca9c575e0a876f14f7fcbd39f2f524403c4c0a7b9e4705"}}, "hash": "0c54844a897845bff4ca9c575e0a876f14f7fcbd39f2f524403c4c0a7b9e4705", "text": "food security. Tax adjustment Because many retail petroleum products, especially transportation fuels, can be quite heavily taxed, governments can smooth the prices for consumers by adjusting the rates of taxation. This has been the main form of adjustment in Bangladesh and Lao PDR. Following the recent oil price rise, more governments have resorted to tax adjustments rather than subsidies. In India, the taxes on gasoline and diesel were reduced by 3% and 4% respectively in November 2006 as compared to 2005 rates. Compensation schemes Compensating the poor to offset the impact of price rise is another method adopted by the governments. Indonesia, for example, after reducing subsidies on petroleum products in 2005 redirected some of the savings to a cash transfer programme for the poor of about US$ 30 per household every three months, as well as to poverty reduction programmes in education, rural development and health. China too has in some provinces briefly introduced cash transfer schemes to help tide consumers over rising oil prices. Governments also may consider that other safety net programmes offer good opportunities for targeting. Sri Lanka, for example, has a food stamps programme that is substantially better targeted than those for kerosene subsidies (IMF 2006). A number of countries in the region have applied one or more of these pricing-related measures. Stabilization funds: These can be used by both oil exporters and importers. Based on pre- determined rules, exporters will pay into the fund when prices are high and can withdraw from them when prices are lower. Importers do the opposite. Thailand established an oil price stabilization fund in 2004 to finance oil price subsidies. While the initial large demand upon the fund has subsided because of the subsequent removal of diesel and gasoline subsidies, the 32 This sub-section relies heavily on UNDP report \u201cOvercoming Vulnerabili ty to Rising Oil Prices: Options for Asia and the Pacific\u201d, UNDP Regional Centre, Bangkok, 2007 80 fund remains an important source of financing for LPG subsidies of about US$ 12.6 million a month (ADB 2005). India and the Philippines have had such funds, but these have now been suspended. Long-term contracts: Countries also may shield themselves from short-term fluctuations in oil prices by engaging in long-term contracts based on prices that are fixed, or adjustable within agreed ceilings. Most of the trade in natural gas uses such contracts, but they are less common in the oil sector where, even in long-term contracts, the prices are linked to market prices. At present, however, there seems to be a move away from long-term contracts even for natural gas and crude oil, so this does not seem like a useful immediate option. However, there are countries which prefer long-term contracts; for example, Republic of Korea in 2007 had opted for 70% of the oil imports under long-term contract (KITA, 2008). Enhancing oil supply Although the supply of oil is finite, governments in the region can take a number of measures to enhance supplies. These include: Strengthening oil exploration and extraction - Higher prices can spur the search for new sources or encourage the exploitation of those hitherto unattractive. In Viet Nam, for example, exploration activities have been yielding results: In October 2004, a joint venture comprising American Technologies, Petronas, Singapore Petroleum, and PetroVietnam announced a 100-million-barrel oil discovery off the country\u2019s northeast coast. The Philippines too, though having only small reserves, in its Energy Plan 2005 stressed intensive promotion of oil and gas exploration. Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest oil and gas producer, is set to start oil exploration in the country and said it hopes it would produce encouraging results by the middle of 2009 (Chinaview, 2008). And the government of Sri Lanka is increasingly pinning its hopes on oil and gas discovery: In October 2005, it formed a new Ministry for Petroleum Resources Development to invite bids for oil and gas exploration (Bacon & Kojima, 2006). Continuation of its efforts, Sri Lanka has given one of eight blocks to explore for oil in Mannar to India and another to China (Tamil Net, 2007). A number of oil-producing countries also have been simplifying their procedures and dismantling national monopolies in order to encourage greater private investment, including foreign investment. Indonesia, for example, has been limiting the control over oil sector development that was previously the preserve of Pertamina, the state- owned oil company. Pakistan has executed production sharing agreements with exploration companies based in Austria France, and Malaysia. Increasing refining capacity -Another important way of enhancing supplies of petroleum products is to increase the capacity of refineries, as has been happening in China, India, Malaysia and Singapore.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae7d37e1-6225-4886-b0c1-d37a2b521d2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae7d37e1-6225-4886-b0c1-d37a2b521d2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d99982bc3bfc217b45d3c54eadf9dcc77094d64d0628c9da25831aa36af8af9"}}, "hash": "2d99982bc3bfc217b45d3c54eadf9dcc77094d64d0628c9da25831aa36af8af9", "text": "But it also is important to ensure that new refineries can process heavy sour crude, which are cheaper and more readily available, while meeting the demand for lighter products such as transportation fuels, and accommodating environmental requirements.

Amongst Pacific Island countries these options are however only available to PNG (and Timor Leste) being the only countries with substantial proven oil reserves. Diversifying sources of oil - Some economies in the regions that have sufficient demand can widen their range of supply sources, in two main ways: 81 Invest in foreign oil fields: India and China, mostly through state-owned companies, already have been investing in oil extraction in other countries. The China National Petroleum Corporation, for example, has invested in a number of countries, including Kazakhstan and Myanmar (World Bank 2006). India has invested through ONGC Videsh Ltd. an additional US$ 400 million in an existing facility in Venezuela to increase the capacity from 20,000 barrels/day to 60,000 barrels/day (Conapri, 2008). Diversify import sources: One way of reducing vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is to diversify sources of imports. For crude supplies, most Asian countries will continue to depend largely on the Middle East, which is geographically the closest, but they also could diversify to some extent to Russia, Central Asia and Africa. This would reduce risks and also increase competition (APERC 2003). For example China\u2019s sources of oil imports have gradually extended to regions other than the Middle East, such as Africa, Central Asia, Russia and Latin America. According to customs statistics, in the first half of 2006 China imported 73.33 million tonnes of crude oil, up 15.6% from a year ago, while its imports from Africa grew 22% to reach 23.4 million tonnes (Asia Times, 2007). Maintaining oil price stability also will depend on regional and international cooperation among consuming countries as well as on continuing dialogues between producers and consumers. Some importing countries have, for example, started negotiating price discounts or concessionary financing terms with oil producers. Thus, Bangladesh in March 2006 made an agreement with Kuwait and UAE to buy oil on concessionary terms. India has mooted the idea of limiting price volatility through an agreement between producers and consumers on a price band mechanism. Restraining oil demand Restraining in this context does not mean cutting demand at the cost of economic or social activity, but rather, minimizing wastage and concentrating the use of oil on purposes for which cheaper alternatives are not available. This has the further merit of reducing costs for businesses and households while slowing the depletion of conventional oil resources and reducing the impact on the climate. Asia-Pacific countries have been putting efforts in improving energy efficiency. China has been leading the way: Between 1990 and 2003, energy use per USD PPP GDP declined from 0.49 to 0.22 kilogrammes of oil equivalent (kgoe) (World Bank 2006). India too has achieved a reduction over the same period, from 0.25 to 0.18, and Sri Lanka from 0.14 to 0.11 kgoe. Their changes may be smaller than China\u2019s but are still impressive since these countries started from higher levels of efficiency. Many other countries in the region have begun stressing energy efficiency and energy conservation. Indonesia, for example, has developed a Blueprint for Energy Management, while the Philippines has adopted an Energy Plan to curtail the intensity of fossil fuel consumption and help achieve energy independence. China and India also have enacted laws to conserve energy and have established accompanying implementation mechanisms. Studies in Marshall Islands and other small Pacific states have suggested that substantial savings can be made through energy efficiency measures both in generation and consumption. The evidences from the region show that countries have adopted various measures across different sectors to restrain the demand for oil. The government of Philippines, for example, has halted the purchase of new vehicles, optimized office air conditioning, and reduced official trips. Some of the efficiency improvement measures require major and potentially disruptive technological adaptations. To cushion the immediate impact on economic activity, 82 these could be introduced in a phased manner. China, for example, is implementing fuel efficiency norms for passenger cars in two phases: Phase I was implemented in 2005/ 06, while Phase II will be implemented in 2008/09. Many countries have been diversifying away from industries that are energy-intensive. When it comes to energy-intensive products,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "900e914e-f98b-4975-b9db-970ee2ece9c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "900e914e-f98b-4975-b9db-970ee2ece9c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dfa694be1abc3a400022209f7ce8fc63e887f85c7d1dce6b1ca17380d867267"}, "3": {"node_id": "da083247-9bf1-4354-9c94-4d61a24f1e71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0070417431a3d46e881d14b1574d7e9f165f426631ded05d60d69a287ec6a19e"}}, "hash": "9877ccbba92607d0bfa27c16102e68f3c759881ca736ca9fae94ba9f6a5b6fa8", "text": "they have been aiming to use a higher proportion of recycled materials. They also have been taking measures to improve energy efficiency elsewhere while shifting from oil to other energy sources, particularly those like Lao PDR and Bhutan, which have considerable hydroelectric potential. Some countries also have been trying to change consumption patterns, for example, through education campaigns that aim to reduce peak electricity demand. In Viet Nam in 2005 and 2006, government agencies were asked to reduce fuel purchase expenditures by 10 % (ESMAP 2006). Few are providing tax incentives and publicity campaigns to promote the purchase of energy-efficient appliances or imposing a ban on the import and marketing of inefficient appliances (Bacon & Kojima, 2006). Even within agriculture sector, there are attempts to discontinue the old inefficient practices. In the 1980s, Bangladesh imported from China many cheap but inefficient diesel irrigation pump sets, but following rural electrification has encouraged farmers to switch to electric pump sets. With respect to households, many countries of the region have implemented programmes to improve energy efficiency in the households through efficient lighting systems, solar water heating systems, etc. China and India are at the forefront in building millions of biogas plants with an objective of providing access to modern energy for cooking. Diversifying fuels Given that energy demands will continue to rise, particularly in developing countries, restraining demand for oil will have to be accompanied by efforts to switch from oil to alternative sources, including hydro, coal, natural gas and renewable energy. Natural gas and coal: One of the most readily available options is natural gas. Between 2002 and 2030, the natural gas consumption in developing Asia is expected to more than triple, from about 208 to 672 billion cubic metres (IEA 2004). Asian countries are adopting natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power generation systems. These have low levels of pollutant emissions and high efficiencies: advanced NGCCs incorporating air or steam-cooled gas turbine blades and compressor inter-cooling are able to provide efficiencies beyond 55%. Another area in which natural gas will find wide application is the combined generation of heat and power, or \u2018cogeneration\u2019 in countries like Malaysia and Thailand. For power generation many countries are also making greater use of coal. Compared with other fossil fuels, however, coal presents significant environmental challenges. Technologies that are being explored include supercritical pulverized fuel technology, atmospheric fluidized bed combustion, pressurised fluidized bed combustion, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and hybrid combined cycle systems. The Indian government has recently approved captive mining for production of gas through coal gasification and liquefaction. The underground coal gasification programme is aimed at the extraction of energy from coal seams that cannot otherwise be mined through conventional methods. Renewable sources of energy: Renewable energy technologies currently supply 13% of the world\u2019s primary energy supply but up to 32% for Asia. Thanks to the increased use of renewables such as hydropower, wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, the share of 83 renewables in developing Asia should rise if their generation costs become competitive with conventional fossil fuel resources. The rapid pace of technological change also is creating opportunities for a broader range of small-scale and low-cost energy supply options that are affordable for the poorest, both for off-grid and utility-connected applications. The challenge lies, however, in using these resources for productive and income-generating activities, so that the poor can pay for these modern energy services that are essential for improving their quality of life. The recent nuclear pact between US and India is another example of diversification away from crude oil. The following sections highlight the types of fuel diversification activities initiated in the region. Transport: As one of the largest consumers of petroleum products, this sector is unlikely to move away from oil very quickly, but has the most potential to conserve oil usage and there have been a number of developments in this field. Proposal to develop electricity-driven mass transit systems and plans to switch to alternative-fuel automobiles, using LPG or CNG, ethanol or biodiesel blending, hybrid-electric, and hydrogen fuel from wind power. The focus of India\u2019s biofuel programme, for example, is diesel produced from oil-bearing seeds of several non-edible plants, including Jatropha curcas, and blended with high-speed diesel. Several other countries in the region, including Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, have adopted targets \u2013 some mandatory \u2013 to increase the contribution of biofuels to their transport fuel supplies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da083247-9bf1-4354-9c94-4d61a24f1e71": {"__data__": {"id_": "da083247-9bf1-4354-9c94-4d61a24f1e71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dfa694be1abc3a400022209f7ce8fc63e887f85c7d1dce6b1ca17380d867267"}, "2": {"node_id": "900e914e-f98b-4975-b9db-970ee2ece9c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9877ccbba92607d0bfa27c16102e68f3c759881ca736ca9fae94ba9f6a5b6fa8"}}, "hash": "0070417431a3d46e881d14b1574d7e9f165f426631ded05d60d69a287ec6a19e", "text": "Many Pacific Island Countries also see biofuels as an opportunity to revive and expand copra production for coconut oil as a fuel supplement, giving increased income to copra producers.

India has fixed a target of achieving 20% blending of biofuels with petroleum products for transport by 2017. Similarly, China has fixed a target of biofuel share of 15% of transport energy by 2020. Industry: Fuel substitution options in the industrial sector include the replacement of petroleum chemical feedstock by biomaterials and the promotion of alternative fuels. An example of the former is the shift away from oil in the fertilizer sector, as in India, where as feedstock there is a clear move away from naphtha to natural gas. In China, a similar shift is taking place, substituting oil with coal. Other options include promoting the conversion of existing oil-fired plants to other fuels or multi-fuel firing, and exploring alternatives like biomass gasification or biogas power generation for decentralized power supply. For example, following the oil price hikes during 2005-06, several industries in Thailand switched from oil to coal, biomass or agro-industrial residues. The change is, however, likely to be gradual because of the need, for most applications, to invest in new capital equipment. Agriculture: Farmers who use petroleum products in agricultural machinery for irrigation and in threshing can in some cases switch to electricity made available through accelerated rural electrification programmes. Other options for fuel substitution included biomass liquid fuel for tractors and diesel pumps along with the use of hybrid systems such as solar photovoltaic- powered water pumps, with diesel as a backup. Households: With growing rural electrification, it is important to reduce the use of petroleum products in power generation. One option, for both grid and off-grid systems is to switch to renewable sources. China and India, which have large coal reserves, also would benefit from making more use of clean-coal technologies. Several countries are also considering expanding their nuclear power capacity, as witnessed by the recent US-India agreement and signs of ASEAN reconsidering its decades-old stance as a nuclear-free zone. 84 A good solution for some rural areas in less developed countries is the development of renewable energy through community initiatives. Examples include rural electrification projects based on usage of solar energy in China, biomass gasification in Cambodia, and micro-hydropower in India, Nepal, China and now Indonesia. The community-based development of rural energy systems in Nepal has been an effective model, operating within the government\u2019s decentralized structure through village and district development committees ensuring energy access for both consumption and productive uses. Many remote Pacific communities have experimented with PV systems. Attention is now also moving towards micro-hydro schemes, particularly in some parts of Melanesia. The pacific Plan, a blue-print for regional cooperation has renewable energy development as a high priority for all Pacific Island states. Preparing for emergencies Each country also needs to prepare for abrupt disruptions in oil supplies. This should involve measures to build strategic reserves as well as plans to make rapid and drastic cuts in oil consumption through rationing systems. Building strategic reserves Both governments and private companies are keeping stockpiles of crude oil and oil products separate from operational ones, though at high cost. For India, the cost of building storage to stock 15 million tonnes of crude oil was estimated in 2004 at USD 950 million (UNCTAD 2006). Several Asia-Pacific countries have begun to develop strategic oil reserves. Japan has 171 days of consumption reserve, which would correspond to nearly 980 million barrels. India has begun to develop a strategic crude oil reserve expected to be pegged at 40 million barrels. The Republic of Korea has a reported reserve of 43 million barrels. Among ASEAN countries, Thailand recently increased the size of its strategic reserve from 60 to 70 days of consumption. Singapore has an estimated storage capacity of 32 million barrels of crude oil and 65 million barrels of oil products. By 2008, China plans to have an 800- million-barrel strategic reserve stored at four facilities (Sakhuja, 2005). In 2007 China announced an expansion of their crude reserves into a two part system; consisting of a government- controlled strategic reserve of 101.9 million barrels complemented by mandated commercial reserves of 209.44 million barrels. An example of a multi-country strategic reserve within the framework of regional cooperation is the 1986 ASEAN Petroleum Security Agreement (APSA). This established an ASEAN Emergency Petroleum Sharing Scheme. In cases of critical shortage, where total supply falls below 80% of normal domestic consumption the oil-exporting members of ASEAN would provide emergency oil supplies. In times of broader crises affecting more than one ASEAN member state, the agreement calls for the distribution to be allocated initially in proportion to their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19306546-b6ab-408c-ac8a-cb7b92ce9d96": {"__data__": {"id_": "19306546-b6ab-408c-ac8a-cb7b92ce9d96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9ad1252234422f95450ec842e5271e144c6caafd750a4e4882a756e1f70cc62"}}, "hash": "f9ad1252234422f95450ec842e5271e144c6caafd750a4e4882a756e1f70cc62", "text": "respective normal domestic consumption and to exports for the 12-month period prior to the crisis. APSA has never actually been executed, although it nearly was in the early 1990s during the Gulf War (Giragosian 2004). Rationing to ensure essential supplies Other methods adopted to restrain demand under emergencies are rationing and fixing quotas. Following the oil price shocks in the 1970s and 1980s, a number of countries like Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam introduced such measures as fuel rationing, fuel stamps and lifeline tariffs. Indeed, in India some of these measures like kerosene rationing and quotas at subsidized prices are still in place. For example, the Bantuan Langsung Tunai program was Indonesia\u2019s first cash transfer program and it reached about a third of 85 households, giving a flat rate benefit of about 15 % of the poverty line, more than enough to compensate the poor for higher fuel prices. In India, kerosene supply is rationed and distributed through public distribution system. The quota per family and prices vary across states. For example, in the state of Kerala, two litres of kerosene per month for electrified houses and five litres per month for non-electrified houses for lighting purposes are provided. Apart from this, for cooking kerosene is provided at the rate of six litres per month per household. The present consumer price of Kerosene is Rs. 9.50 per litre. 7. Findings, Recommendations and UNDP role Trends in Commodity Prices The recent commodity price crisis has been notable for both its broad nature (covering not just grain and oil, but metals, and most other food products) and its long duration. However although recent commodity price rises are higher in nominal terms than previous price spikes, in real terms they are mostly much smaller than, for example, price rises in the 1970s, and indeed prices remain low in real terms compared with the 1980s and 1990s. In terms of staple food grains, real prices have been on a downward trajectory since the 1970s, reaching a low in 2000. The recent rise in their prices has been dramatic, but in real terms food is still cheap compared with the 1970s. By contrast crude oil prices in 2008 sky rocketed in mid- 2008 \u2013 by 222% in real and 257% in nominal terms from the seventies to a record high of $145 in June 2008. However the recent return of crude oil to around $70 per barrel in late 2008 demonstrates\u2026 Whilst the recent price rise is of concern, particularly for poor consumers in the Asia Pacific region, an even more disturbing trend is the level of volatility in commodity prices, which has dramatically increased since the 1990s. This volatility presents specific additional challenges to the region\u2019s poor, as it makes it difficult for farmers to interpret demand signals through price transmission. Underlying causes of the food and fuel price rises Although rapid urbanization and changes in dietary preferences towards greater meat consumption in major developing economies in Asia (notably China and India) has been cited [ref] as a major cause of food price rises, this is not supported by the evidence. Over Asia as a whole, increase in meat consumption is slowing, as is growth in consumption of maize (the staple crop most diverted into animal feed use). In fact, staple grain use for meat consumption remains low, with most livestock being fed on crop by-products, household waste and open grazing. Asia\u2019s growth in cereal consumption for food is also decelerating. Overall, our analysis finds that China and India\u2019s consumption patterns are not a major driver of the food price increase because (1) their demand for food is increasing at a much slower rate than the rest of the world; and (2) they meet their slowly rising consumption demand primarily through domestic production rather than imports. However our research indicates that biofuels, another widely cited driver for food grain price increases, are indeed responsible for a considerable proportion of price increases. Global wheat and maize stocks would not have declined significantly were it not for a big increase in biofuel production from grains and oilseed in the US and EU. This was seen in the diversion of maize production directly to biofuel use; limited expansion of wheat production due to land use for biofuel related oil seed production; and price transmission from wheat to rice 86 prices due to panic-driven domestic policies and speculation. The impact of biofuels was particularly severe due to rapid expansion of the sector in response to government subsidies. Increased demand driven by biofuel production and speculative activities took place in against a backdrop of stagnating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81721e4f-52e6-4423-8a0b-e808e0a29e43": {"__data__": {"id_": "81721e4f-52e6-4423-8a0b-e808e0a29e43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af1dca9446b78c45ffe5140819d06d48bf17057f27bbf5221e692242a7f15f00"}}, "hash": "af1dca9446b78c45ffe5140819d06d48bf17057f27bbf5221e692242a7f15f00", "text": "productivity increases at a global level. Asian economies accounted for two-thirds of the developing world\u2019s agricultural growth over the past 25 years. However this growth has decelerated rapidly \u2013 from 2.7% pa during 1981-1995 to 1.3% pa 1996-2008. This is due to the fact that very little new land is available for agricultural land, and that investment in agriculture has declined dramatically, limiting the potential for increased yields. Agricultural spending as a percentage of total government spending in the Asia Pacific region decreased from 14.8% in 1980 to 8.6% in 2002. This was largely driven by the prioritization of social sector spending within poverty reduction strategies; promotion of industrial and service sectors at the expense of agriculture; and persistent low prices for agricultural products at the end of the twentieth century. These deep rooted supply-side issues were exacerbated by weather related production shocks in major exporting countries such as Australia and Canada. Declining acceleration in the rise in demand (before the biofuel boom) and production, combined in some instances with deliberate policies to minimize opportunity loss, led to a gradual reduction in food grain stocks since 2000, which made it harder for countries and regions to adjust to shocks, setting the stage for the rapid price hikes seen in 2007 and 2008. Beyond market fundamentals, the food price rise was also driven, especially in the case of rice, by the spread of panic in major rice exporting and importing countries. This led to short term policy actions in some countries, such as export bans or taxes, which aimed to protect domestic consumers. However these measures made the situation worse, by further tightening an already thin international rice market, which caused further price volatility. Additionally, most commodities, including food grains and crude oil, are priced in US dollars. Therefore, when the dollar falls, as it has over the past six years, it translates into rising world commodity prices. The FAO forecasts that world cereal production in 2008 will reach a record 2180 million tons, 2.8% up from last year, as producers respond to the price rise. This should have a dampening effect on food price inflation. However food prices are likely to remain relatively high compared with the 1980s and 1990s, due to continuing high input costs and demand for biofuels (though the recent decline in the oil price will dampen these effects to some extent) and due to countries scambling to replenish stocks to safer levels. In the case of oil, both structural factors and speculation have played a role in driving up the oil price so dramatically. Rapidly increasing demand, particularly from the US and major Asian economies such as China, is the main structural driver, but there are supply side constraints too. Surplus production and refining capacity are shrinking, and decades of under-investment have meant that oil extraction is becoming increasingly difficult and costly. Moreover geo-political turbulence in the Middle East, Bolivia and Venezuela has also contributed to the price rise. However, oil supply-demand imbalances and uncertainties have been exacerbated by a massive influx of speculative money into the market for crude oil futures. Estimates on the effect of speculative activity on the oil price range from 20% to over 60% (ref). 87 Impact of soaring food and oil prices at the macro level The impact of rising commodity prices clearly depends on whether countries are net exporters of importers of affected commodities, as well as the relative share of net food and oil exports in total imports, total domestic consumption and total domestic production. In Asia and the Pacific, 26 out of 35 countries are net food importers. Of these, 9 (PNG, Sri Lanka, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Mongolia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tonga and Lao PDR) have an overall trade surplus in agricultural products. The negative effects of soaring food prices could therefore be balanced out by the sales of agricultural raw materials. Prices of these vary by product, but some, e.g. rubber, are particularly buoyant. Other food importers are major non-food commodity exporters (Indonesia, Iran, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia), or industrial countries (South Korea, Singapore) who will also derive some degree of insulation from food price increases.

Exceptions are Bangladesh, Bhutan, and North Korea, all of whom are likely to suffer from the price rise. Nine countries in the region (Myanmar, Tuvalu, Thailand, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, China, Vanuatu, Philippines) are net food exporters, who might therefore be expected to benefit from rising prices, However only Myanmar, Tuvalu and Thailand have high net food exports in terms of their total import bill. For the others, benefits are likely to be small, and therefore overall the price rise may be damaging (because of the impact on poor consumers). Moreover only Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and India have a trade surplus in both food and total agricultural products. Overall, the oil price increase is expected to have an average negative impact of 5-6% on the GNI of Asia Pacific countries (ADB 2008). But the effects again vary by country. Iran, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei Darussalam, Thailand, PNG and Timor Leste all produce oil, but only a few of these are net oil exporters. Timor Leste and PNG in particular are likely to see big benefits from the increase in the oil price: ADB (2008) predicts that price increases for PNG exports will add 45 % to GNI above 2006 levels. Mongolia and PNG will also benefit from rising gold and copper prices. Terms of trade and income distribution Dramatic changes in commodity prices will affect income distribution between countries. At a regional level, according to available data, Eastern, South Eastern and Southern Asian countries will experience a significant deterioration in their terms of trade, owing to their dependence on the import of energy and industrial raw materials, and their specialization in labour-intensive manufactures exports. Within the region, exporters of manufactures suffered losses from changes in their terms of trade equivalent to 1.2% of GDP 2004-6. However exporters of oil and minerals improved their terms of trade by between 5 and 7% of GDP annually. 88 The deterioration in the terms of trade for many Asian countries has already begun to affect exchange rates in India, Pakistan and Nepal. There has also been some impact on the current account balance of net commodity importers. However, despite a slowing US economy, overall Asian and Pacific exports have remained resilient and capital is still flowing into the region, so external positions have not moved into dangerous levels. Pass through of world food and fuel prices to domestic consumer prices Rising global food prices are contributing to high inflation in many Asia Pacific countries. However, the impact varies according to the extent to which global prices have been transmitted to domestic prices. Overall, only about half of the increase in real US dollar prices have been passed through to domestic prices in the region. This is partly because of exchange rate movement of Asian currencies against the US dollar, which has cushioned domestic consumers to some extent. Countries have also varied in their willingness to pass through price increases to consumers, and their ability to control pass through (i.e. reliance on imported food, and budgetary headspace to subsidise food prices). The highest pass-through ratios are observed for Mongolia, Sri Lanka, China, Maldives and Indonesia, with Mongolia having a pass through of 97%. Although 2008 data on Mayanmar, Vietnam, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Afghanistan are not yet available, pass-through rates and food price inflation is also likely to be high in these countries. By contrast, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and India have experienced low pass-through rates \u2013 just 15% in South Korea, for example. Pass through rates, and food price inflation, have also been low in most Pacific countries. In terms of oil, pass through rates have been higher for diesel than for gasoline, with rates for the former ranging from 85% in Malaysia, to 30% in India. The effects of domestic fuel price inflation have been particularly marked in Afghanistan (216%), Indonesia (180%) and Malaysia (177%). Pass through rates for oil prices have been increasing in most countries over the past two years as the cost of protecting customers from oil price increases has become unsustainable. Impact on domestic inflation In many countries, food and fuel price inflation is higher than aggregate inflation and is contributing to underlying inflationary pressures. Higher food prices are particularly significant for developing countries as food expenditure accounts for a significant share of their consumer price index. Many Asia Pacific economies now suffer double-digit inflation rates. The rises in food prices have contributed about 2-3% to headline inflation. However, in some countries, domestic demand pressures have pushed up inflation further.

Overall, higher food and oil prices are likely to continue to drive up inflation over 2008, which will mean that inflation will emerge as one of the beiggest risks to the regional outlook. Inflation expectations have also risen markedly, and there is a danger that recent commodity price rises could trigger and inflationary spiral based on second round effects such as wage increases. Rapid liquidity growth in the region over the past few years is also an important underlying driver of inflation. Governments need to act now to combat inflationary pressures, notably by increasing agricultural production. Impact on GDP growth One of the greatest concerns about the commodity price spike is that it may stifle economic growth by raising the cost of production; and by contributing to inflation and hence reducing 89 the incentive to consume and invest. Attempts by countries to contain inflation through tight monetary policies could also stifle economic growth. However, so far the effect on growth has been limited, partly due to the cushioning effect of local currency appreciation against the dollar. Economic growth across the region did slow down in 2008 against 2007 levels. High growth economies such as China, India and Vietnam witnessed stronger moderation. The ADB (2008) forecasts that growth in East Asia will decelerate from 9.6% in 2007 to 7.7% in 2008, from 8.6% in 2007 to 7.1% in South Asia over the same period, and from 6.5% to 5.4% in South East Asia. However growth in the Pacific is forecast to double in 2008, mainly due to growth in its largest economy, PNG (mostly on the back of rising commodity prices). However recent slowdowns in the US economy could mean that growth rates fall further. Impact on domestic exports, imports and current account balance The sharp increases in food and fuel prices have led to higher import bills and strained the balance of payments position of many countries. Asia and the Pacific region as a net importer of fuel and food is likely to face an increase in its imports bill (which could be by as much as 1-2% of GDP). Meanwhile, the growth of other exports (and indeed imports) is slowing, particularly in the light of the global economic slowdown. The increase in the total imports bill could widen the regional current account deficit as a share of GDP by more than 1-2%. Countries have existing high current account deficits will be particularly vulnerable. Cambodia, Lao PDR, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and the Pacific Islands (except PNG) all have large trade deficits (above 4% of GDP) and those which import significant quantities of food and fuels could experience severe balance of payment problems. Impact on government revenue, expenditure, fiscal balance and monetary indicators With regards to government budgets, all of the domestic measures to cushion the burden of rising prices have a fiscal cost \u2013 either lower revenues from reduced taxes and tariffs, or higher expenditure on subsidies and social safety nets or support measure for small farmers. Countries which have resisted full pass through of international prices to domestic consumers are likely to experience significant fiscal costs which could reduce fiscal space and hence fiscal performance. The total fiscal cost of policy responses to food and fuel prices has been high (more than 2% of GDP) in Indonesia, Maldives, Bangladesh and Timor Leste, and more than 1% of GDP in Malaysia, India and Cambodia. Countries with existing high fiscal deficits \u2013 notably Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh \u2013 will face particular challenges in allocating scarce resources. Available data from 2008 suggests that fiscal deficit indicators have generally worsened from 2007. Aggregate spending on social and other services has risen because of the cost of the fiscal response to the price increases, and second round inflationary effects such as higher prices are likely to create further fiscal pressure. It is therefore important that any new social safety net measures introduced by governments in the region are effectively targeted, to avoid creating further fiscal pressure. Equity, currency and financial markets As discussed above, the impact of rising world food prices on domestic economies is dependent partially on the exchange rate between local currencies and the dollarReal exchange rate appreciation against the US dollar, to the extent that it occurs, will neutralize some of the impact of increased world prices in dollar terms. .

But the Chinese reminbi, Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollar stabilized or strengthened. Equity markets in many Asian economies are expected to weaken in 2008 partly due to the financial crisis in the US sub-prime markets, and partly due to lower growth expectations. In late 2008, regional stock markets continued to trend downward from their record highs of October 2007, as the global market turmoil worsened and equity markets in industrialized countries fell sharply. Food and fuel security The recent food and fuel price crisis has placed renewed attention on the issue of food and fuel security. Attainment of such security is a priority of the Asia Pacific region, due to the fact that most countries in the region are net importers of food and oil. Some countries, such as Korea, Nepal, Philippines and Sri Lanka, which depend on imported oil for nearly 100% of their consumption, need to be especially concerned about future price fluctuations. However, from a macro perspective, food and fuel security at a regional level does not appear to have been excessively threatened. This is evident from the improved positions of most Asia Pacific countries in terms of the ratio of foreign exchange reserves to imports. When we compare the average ratio of forex reserves for 2004-7, against 2000-3, most countries \u2013 with the exception of Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand are in a stronger position to face external shocks. Instead, the greater cause for concern is the impact of the price rises at a household level. Increased poverty The World Bank (2008) estimates that food inflation could push at least 100 million people into poverty. In percentage terms, this is in the range of 3-5% of global poverty rates. This could mean \u2018seven lost years\u2019 in the fight against worldwide poverty. In East Asia and the Pacific, poverty was expected to decline from 17.9% in 2005 to 11.7% in 2009 if the growth rate of the last few years is maintained. In South Asia, poverty was expected to reduce from 40.3% to 37.2% over the same period. However, data suggests that growth will decelerate buy about 1-2% in 2008 and 2009. This would suggest that poverty rates will be at least 1% higher across the region than previous projections. Increased malnutrition Malnutrition and hunger is not a new consequence of high good prices \u2013 over 500 million people in the region lived in hunger even before prices began to rise. But, unsurprisingly, the price rise is adding to the number of hungry people. Across Asia, households are reducing their food consumption, or reducing the consumption of other essential items (such as education or health care) to enable them to continue their previous levels of food spending. According to the World Bank (2008) the number of malnourished people globally will increase by 44 million due the crisis FAO estimates are even higher. The largest increases in the number of undernourished people as a result of the food price crisis live in Asia. FAO predict that 41 million people in Asia and 24 million in sub-Saharan Africa will fall below the hunger threshold due to the crisis. Impact of soaring food and oil prices at the household level For households in low income countries, who spend up to 60-70% of their incomes on food, higher prices can have devastating effects. Nevertheless, 75% of the world\u2019s poor live in rural areas, and the vast majority of these are engaged in agriculture. In this regard, one might expect rising food prices to benefit much of Asia\u2019s poor \u2013 specifically, small farmers. 91 In reality, however, the smallholder population is quite diverse. Whether a particular smallholder household will gain or lose from higher food prices depends on its net position on food markets \u2013 as a seller or buyer \u2013 the net effect between rising value of sales and rising input costs (especially of petroleum products and derivatives, such as fertilizer) , changes in rural wages, the cost of purchased consumer goods. Impacts depend on access to land, educational levels, gender, ethnicity, and access to rural non-farm employment opportunities. Even at a country level, detailed mapping of who is gaining or losing is important for designing any social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. Because the effects of the crisis has not yet been reflected in household poverty and human development statistics, its impact is hard to analyse or quantify, but the effect on the poor will clearly depend primarily on whether they are net buyers or sellers of food.

But the distribution of net food buyers and sellers clearly differs from country to country. Within Asia Pacific, the highest shares of net sellers are observed in Cambodia and Vietnam, suggesting that farmers in these countries are better placed to benefit from an increase in food prices. Given that only a small share of most countries\u2019 households are net sellers, a related question is whether net seller households are predominantly rich or poor. The general presumption has been that net food sellers tend to be relatively wealthy households with larger farms. In fact, on average, at a national level, about 27% of poor householders and 13% of rich households are net food sellers. Therefore, in most countries, a higher proportion of poor households are net food sellers compared to the proportion of richer households. Higher food prices should therefore result in some income transfer from richer to poorer households, whilst low prices should do the opposite. However, the majority of poor householders are net food sellers and will therefore suffer from the effects of rising prices. Additionally, small scale farmers (over-represented amongst the poor) are less likely to be able to gain full benefits from higher prices than larger and medium sized farmers, particularly in middle income countries. This is partly because of price transmission mechanisms \u2013 since most small holders sell food locally, and many Asian governments have limited the pass through of the price increase to domestic markets \u2013 they may not see significantly higher prices for their produce. Moreover, they may be unable to respond to pricing signals by producing more food, because of lack of access to land or to credit to buy fertilizers and other inputs (often bought at high prices from state monopolies). Even within wealthier economies, structural barriers to rural development may keep these gains from being widely shared among rural communities. Better rural infrastructure is therefore needed to ensure that the rents accruing from higher prices are reinvested in rural areas, to boost agricultural productivity and real incomes. More developed transport, irrigation and financial infrastructure in rural areas would increase yields and farm incomes, help small farmers get their produce to market, and increase the demand for agricultural labour. Urban households have benefited disproportionately from the region\u2019s rapid economic progress. However, soaring food prices are expected to hit urban households (and especially the urban poor) harder than the rural population. Unlike the rural poor, virtually all poor urban householders are net food purchasers. 92 In the case of fuel, the impact of rising oil prices at a household level depends on the extent of kerosene, gas and electricity use. Available data show that households in the region spend only 3-8% of their budget on household fuel use, and 5-8% on transport. Fuel consumption patterns also display a clear rural-urban divide in developing countries. For instance, in India, only 8% of rural households, compared to 66% of urban households, use some form of oil product as their primary cooking fuel, preferring instead biomass. This suggests that (i) oil price rises would not significantly affect consumption expenditure of rural households on cooking fuel; (ii) subsidies on oil products are inherently biased toward urban households; and (iii) the existence of such subsidies for many years has failed to shift rural fuel consumption patterns away from biomass. Nevertheless, rising fuel prices will impact on the rural poor through rising prices for kerosene, which is widely used for lighting. Moreover higher prices will set back attempts to improve the livelihood of the poor through increased consumption of fuels and electricity, which could make issues such as food storage safer and more practicable, and enable working after darkness falls. Finally, the poor are likely to be impacted in terms of increasing public transport costs, and indirectly through general inflation. Scenario analysis Section 5 of the paper investigated the effects of the food and fuel price crisis through a simple scenario analysis which used the variables which determine a household\u2019s vulnerability. First, a baseline scenario was assumed, with given levels of: 1. household income; 2. household expenditure; 3. spend on food as a share of total expenditure 4. spend on cereal as a share of total food expenditure. These four variables allow for the estimation of the ratio of total consumption to income; total food expenditure; ratio of food expenditure to total income; and total expenditure on cereal and non-cereal foods across the different expenditure quintiles.

The resulting analysis showed that the international food price rise raised Asia Pacific households\u2019 food spend significantly \u2013 by an average of 43% across the region for poor households, and only 18% for rich households. Increases were particularly high for the poor of Mongolia, Philippines and Sri Lanka; and lowest in Singapore, India, Bangladesh and Cambodia. The price rise can therefore be said to have decreased poor households\u2019 purchasing power substantially \u2013 by about 24% in Asia Pacific as a whole, though only 4% for rich households. For the poor of Mongolia, purchasing power reduced by 51%. Policy responses to food and fuel price inflation Policy responses adopted by governments to address fuel and food price increases have been varied. Some of the measures implemented are more cost-effective and less distortionary than others. A number of countries may have moved to implement universal rather than targeted measures because they allow a quicker response. Monetary responses to food and fuel price inflation 93 The monetary policy stance in many countries in Asia and the Pacific has moved towards more tightening given sharply rising inflation, but at the same time it has become more cautious given the worsening global economic outlook and the increased volatility of financial markets. Available information shows that countries generally accommodated the first-round effects of higher food and fuel prices on inflation. However, in recent months, many countries have tightened their monetary policies to prevent the first-round effects of higher food and fuel prices on inflation from spilling over to higher prices of other goods and services, triggering a wage-price spiral. This is particularly important for countries where inflation has already been rising because of overly expansionary macroeconomic policies. Central banks in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan (China), Vietnam have raised policy rates and/or cash reserve requirement ratios. Central Bank of China has raised the bank reserve requirement ratio, but not interest rates. Singapore has tightened policy through a stronger currency, whilst Sri Lanka has issued its own securities to contain excess liquidity. Others in the region have so far maintained their key rates, but may yet adopt monetary tightening if inflation worsens. More than half of the Pacific Island countries are constrained in their use of monetary policy as a tool of macroeconomic management due to their use of third-country currencies as their medium of exchange. In most of those that are able to use monetary instruments, their capital markets are relatively undeveloped and interest rates are not regarded as an effective tool for influencing economic behaviour. Exchange rate policy is likewise constrained. Fiscal responses to the Food and Fuel price Inflation Available information shows that many governments in Asia and the Pacific have used actively tried to minimise pass-through effects of the international price rise. The monetary tightening described above often incurs the undesirable cost of slowing growth, which can worsen the pain to consumers of higher prices, which has further encouraged countries to adopt various fiscal measures with the aim of protecting the vulnerable. These include subsidies, transfers, safety net programmes, etc. However, governments need to assess the overall fiscal cost of such programmes: even the most efficient and effective policy responses in substantial fiscal costs. Some countries are already beginning to phase out unaffordable fuel and food subsidies. The options over the medium term depend on individual countries\u2019 macroeconomic situation and their capacity to create fiscal space. Fiscal space can be created in a variety of ways, including by increasing revenue, reducing non-productive spending, raising borrowing in a non inflationary and sustainable way, and securing higher external grants or concessional loans provided by donors. One notices, in many 2008 or 2009 budgets, a very welcome increased emphasis on trying to prevent future food and fuel crises through expansionary fiscal spending on agriculture. However, other countries will find it difficult to create fiscal space and therefore need to limit the size and duration of the fiscal response and pass-through the increase in international prices to domestic consumers more rapidly. To the extent possible, this should be accompanied by strengthening and expansion of cost-effective social safety nets. Almost all Pacific Islands are heavily dependent on imported food and fuels. Taxes on imports are also a major source of government revenue, thus reductions in tariff rates to ease the burden of price rises on the poor has the impact of increasing the pressure on, often 94 already stretched, government finances.

However global food markets need to be kept open to avoid any distortion to the economy. Restrictive trade policies, have unintended negative consequences at the domestic the global level. They push up world prices even further and hurt net importers in particular. From a global perspective, maintaining free trade in commodities while fostering incentives for production and using efficient policies to protect the urban poor (e.g. targeted cash transfers) is a priority. An ambitious Doha Round conclusion, including on agriculture, can help broaden and stabilize international food trade. While this may not mean lower food prices in the short term, it will foster efficient agricultural production in the medium and long term and boost global growth. As noted earlier, reduced tariffs on imported food can alleviate food prices pressures and improve efficiency. However, many poor countries have narrow tax bases and rely on tariffs and other trade taxes for a large part of government revenue. In such countries, it is important to ensure that the revenue loss from tariff or trade tax reductions can be accommodated without destabilizing countries\u2019 macroeconomic policies. Responses to oil price shock To enhance oil supplies, a number of oil-producing countries in the region have been simplifying their procedures and dismantling national monopolies in order to encourage greater private investment, including foreign direct investment. Indonesia, for example, has been limiting the control over oil sector development that was previously the preserve of Pertamina, the state-owned oil company. Pakistan has executed production sharing agreements with exploration companies based in Austria, France, and Malaysia. Another important way of enhancing supplies of petroleum products is to increase the capacity of refineries, as has been happening in China, India, Malaysia and Singapore. The focus is on new refineries which can process heavy sour crude, which is cheaper and more readily available. There have been efforts in improving energy efficiency. For example, in the case of China between 1990 and 2003, energy use per PPP $ GDP declined from 0.49 to 0.22 kgoe. India too has achieved a reduction over the same period, from 0.25 to 0.18, and Sri Lanka from 0.14 to 0.11 kgoe. Diversifying into other fuels types like natural gas, hydro, renewable energy sources and nuclear energy can also protect economies from rising oil prices. India has fixed a target of achieving 20% blending of bio fuels with petroleum products for transport by 2017. Similarly, China has fixed a target of biofuel share of 15% of transport energy by 2020. However increased dependence on biofuel may cause further upwards pressure on food prices. The nuclear pact between US and India is another example of diversification away from crude oil. 95 Both governments and private companies are keeping stockpiles of crude oil and oil products separate from operational ones, though at high cost. India has begun to develop a strategic crude oil reserve sized at 37.4 million barrels, enough for two weeks of consumption. The Republic of Korea has a reported reserve of 43 million barrels. Thailand recently increased the size of its strategic reserve from 60 to 70 days of consumption. By 2008, In 2007 China announced an expansion of their crude reserves into a two part system; consisting of a government-controlled strategic reserve of 101.9 million barrels complemented by mandated commercial reserves of 209.44 million barrels. Key recommendations Countries need to strike a balance between helping the poor to cope with the significant increases of food and fuel prices, ensuring macroeconomic stability, and encouraging increased agricultural production. National policy interventions can be divided into three broad classes:; (ii) interventions to lower domestic food and oil prices through short-run trade policy measures or administrative action, and (iii) interventions to enhance longer-term food and oil supply. (i) interventions to ensure household food and energy security by strengthening targeted safety nets: A number of countries may have moved to implement universal rather than targeted measures because they allow a quicker response. These countries should assess the efficiency of the measures as soon as possible and replace untargeted programs with more cost-effective measures. Targeted transfer programs, preferably as part of an integrated social safety net, can reach the poor efficiently and effectively, but implementation can be challenging (see", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a98f0f8-b9cc-4f67-9639-5afcd37b91f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a98f0f8-b9cc-4f67-9639-5afcd37b91f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12be79ec15b438f17435b8f62f62a21ef3c257e716e0bd2dc4e2e1d36d296ea0"}}, "hash": "12be79ec15b438f17435b8f62f62a21ef3c257e716e0bd2dc4e2e1d36d296ea0", "text": "Annex ?). A growing number of countries are implementing conditional cash transfer programs\u2014but this can take time and requires planning, targeting, and delivery capacity. Expanding the coverage of other targeted measures, such as targeted food distribution or school lunch programs, can also be effective in reaching vulnerable households. Agricultural subsidy programs can help if they are carefully designed and focus on increasing the productivity of small farmers. (ii) interventions to lower domestic food and oil prices through short-run trade policy measures or administrative action. These can include: \u2022 In the short-run regulate pricing policies such that while the interests of the poor are protected \u2022 Use targeted subsidies on household basic items \u2013food (rice, wheat) and fuels (LPG, kerosene) to shield poor consumers from the full impact of the price rise \u2022 Ration subsidized food and fuels through a monthly quota (e.g. smart card scheme) \u2022 Promote the use of the Food and Oil Stabilization Fund However, most of these measures have significant fiscal implications, which need to be taken into account. (iii) interventions to enhance longer-term food and oil supply. These can include: \u2022 Invest more in rural infrastructure and agricultural R& D to improve agricultural productivity \u2022 Provide targeted agricultural input subsidies (e.g., HYV seeds, fertilizers) \u2022 Changing biofuels policy to prevent excessive diversion of staple grains or productive land to non-food uses. 96 \u2022 Promotion of staple food production rather than production of cash crops. \u2022 Include in the mandate of large oil companies investment in alternates sources of decentralised energy ,besides dedicated targets for oil exploration tied to supply targets and not only global prices \u2026for example, a part of their profits must be expended on exploration activities and provide fiscal incentives like tax rebates to oil companies to strengthen exploration activities in the long term development strategies. \u2022 Encourage the establishment of refining capacity for sour crude by introducing capital subsidies for sour crude refining facilities and duty exemptions for imported technology. \u2022 Diversify import sources as well as invest into foreign oil fields prudently. \u2022 Engage in barter as well as mutually beneficial cross-border trade in energy Measures to reduce demand for oil (e.g. diversification of energy sources, increased energy efficiency) can also help protect economies from fluctuations in the oil price. In addition to national approaches, governments need to consider regional responses to the food and fuel price crisis. In the short term, this should include moves to eliminate agricultural export bans and release public grain stocks, which will help contain prices across the region. In the medium term, SAARC and ASEAN discussions on the setting up of a regional Food Bank should be continued to help countries respond to future crises. As far as oil is concerned, consideration should be given to establishing an Asia-Pacific Compensatory Oil Finance Facility (AP-COIL) Facility to assist regional LDCs and LICs. This Facility could provide to qualifying LDCs assistance primarily in the form of grants and for LICs a blend of grants and highly confessional loans. This would have two purposes. First, it would enhance a country\u2019s liquidity to help it overcome a balance of payments or fiscal deficit. Second, it would help the country finance essential structural changes to reduce its dependence on oil. A similar facility could be created to assist regional food importing LDCs and LICs. Net food importing countries and other countries faced with domestic shortages need to have financing windows to take care of their short term needs and liquidity constraints to finance food imports in the short run. Many countries have argued for a dedicated food financing facility in addition to the IMF\u2019s Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) and Exogenous Shocks Facility and emergency facilities of the IMF and World Bank at the WTO in 2001. The international community can support governments in the Asia Pacific region, through: \u2022 Donor support to agricultural sectors, and to food safety net programmes \u2022 Rethinking biofuel policy \u2022 Pushing for a completion of the Doha Round, with an outcome designed to enhance food security, including through dismantling trade-distorting subsidies \u2022 Preventing speculation by price controls and monitoring food grains trade \u2022 Supporting research to improve energy efficient and alternative fuel technology; as well as enhanced agricultural production. Role of the UNDP - How can the UNDP assist countries on food and fuel price shocks? On-going UNDP support The UNDP is working actively with national and international partners in responding to the many challenges posed by the food and fuel price shocks. Addressing the food and fuel crisis requires a cooperative approach involving the countries affected, donors, and international 97 organizations.

In Asia and the Pacific, at the country level, UNDP\u2019s responses on food and fuel crisis are focused around three programme areas: \u00a7 Coordination \u2013 In its role as Coordinator of UN development activities at the country level, UNDP is working with governments, other UN and international agencies to collectively offer coherent and effective support to governments on food and fuel price volatilities in the region and help develop copying strategies. \u00a7 Policy advisory services - The UNDP is engaged in policy advisory services with many countries to help them address the impacts of global food and fuel price changes on the national development strategies. Examples include Indonesia, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Nepal, China, Thailand to quote a few. The pacific countries receive policy advisory support from UN Coordination team on energy access enhancement linked to their MDG targets. \u00a7 Technical assistance - UNDP provides technical support to governments in undertaking technical analysis of macro, micro or sector specific programmatic responses. Examples include Mongolia and Pakistan, China, Philippines Possible UNDP support in future At a global level, UNDP should continue to support international efforts to alleviate the impact of the food and fuel price volatilities on the poor, and to address its root causes. At the regional level, extensive analytical work is needed on various dimensions of the recent price increases, with a view to adequately diagnosing the underlying causes of the price increases as well as their impact and come up with policy responses that are relevant in the country context as well as identify roles of regional bodies At present, many countries in the Asia Pacific region are interested in understanding the underlying causes and socio-economic implications of rising food and fuel prices as well as policy options to cope with emerging challenges. In other words, the greatest demand for UNDP engagement is to help countries evaluate the socio-economic implications of rising food and fuel prices, as well as the available policy responses. Since many governments are faced with controlling inflation as well as sustaining growth in the face of global slowdown, the UNDP can provide technical and analytical inputs to highlight the trade-offs involved and help countries forge an effective response. For instance UNDP has already helped nine countries in Asia and twelve PICs to undertake in-depth analysis of challenges and way forward faced in establishing linkages between energy access and poverty reduction. UNDP can continue to help development targets building on these identified challenges policy and program design in NDS and feed into emerging strategies for both climate mitigation and adaptation. Given the UNDP past record as neutral and trustworthy partner, the UNDP is well positioned to help countries in this regard particularly identifying and promoting the appropriate short and long-term policies. There is strong demand for the UN and IFI advice on the design and expansion of safety net programs and food market interventions to help protect vulnerable groups. Given the profound humanitarian consequences of rising food and fuel prices, there is a strong case for strengthening social safety net programmes, in particular for LICs. In this regard, improving the quality of and access to safety nets will be a priority for protecting vulnerable households. The policy challenge in many countries is to replace poorly targeted and expensive policy 98 responses with more cost-effective targeted programmes. The same approach needs to be encouraged for increased energy access at the level of poor households with no access to cheap and clean fuel. It is not often understood or even prioritised that meeting the MDG targets need energy as a primary input across most of the sectors. In countries that do not have effective safety nets, new safety net programmes (e.g. school feeding programs, cash transfers to the most vulnerable populations, reduction in education and health fees, and public transport subsidies) should be designed and implemented. In countries that do have some forms of safety net, the UNDP can help make these stronger and more flexible to cope with shocks, with clear targeting and programmatic frameworks that can be quickly scaled up to protect vulnerable households. In addition, expanding programmes to ensure basic nutrition, particularly for infants, and improved access to health and education systems will also help minimize the likelihood that income shocks reduce demand and damage human capital accumulation. There has also been demand for advice on market interventions to smooth supply and lower food prices. With regards to improving food supply, the focus should be to (i) improve producer incentives (including the removal of subsidies which benefit", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee76df45-c2bb-4e56-b318-059e9bf0c291": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee76df45-c2bb-4e56-b318-059e9bf0c291", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "491de0a1a85e842ea594b1e44e102885fd1fcd9c41e4c8822a50677d82853693"}, "3": {"node_id": "5350fe2f-5476-4569-a824-cd3f770f967c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f3355d972a2d24585291d1b8830dedf08125bf0f39a5534d28bee1e4ff171e9"}}, "hash": "44b47f3f8036d57c7dbbeb3ea1a76b439082b14ebeb9fb733da9d9fd2ee8fd31", "text": "richer farmers more); (ii) provide quality core public goods \u2013 science, infrastructure and human capital; and (iii) stronger institutions to support an attractive rural investment climate for men and women, including more access to rural financial institutions and risk management instruments, improved property rights, and greater opportunities for collective action by farmers; and (iv) ensure sustainable use of natural resources. In fact, the recent WDR on Agriculture identified these four key elements for a comprehensive approach to agricultural growth. Technical assistance \u2013 UNDP helps and needs to continue it\u2019s support to countries in assessing the micro and macroeconomic impact of recent shocks. Based on country-specific diagnoses, UNDP could offer policy advice on issues related to strengthening social safety net programmes as well as fiscal space, monetary and exchange rates, and trade policies. In introducing policy responses such as social safety net programmes, tax and tariff changes or transfer programmes, issues related to their appropriate design and implementation are often an important consideration. The UNDP should assist countries address these challenges in its areas of expertise. Analytical work to understand better the economic, poverty and social implications of rising food and fuel prices is also critical. This can contribute to the design of flexible, country specific strategies. This implies expanding UNDP diagnostics and support in critical areas such as distributional analysis of food and fuel price increases and safety net programmes and identifying agricultural constraints and promoting inclusive growth. The UNDP should work with countries and donors on global and regional debate on bio-fuels through analysis, monitoring and balancing of competing needs for energy and food security. UNDP could also initiate area-based development programming\u2014including microfinance \u2013 that can help poor rural areas take advantage of the opportunities presented buy higher food prices. The later will directly support the new and emerging area of donor interest of meeting the Climate challenges using integrated territorial approach to both mitigation and adaptation strategies at local levels. Coordination and advocacy - UNDP could also help governments to analyse the causes and implications of rising food and fuel prices for their national development strategy and investment programmes. In doing so, the UNDP needs to work closely with other donors to build a shared dialogue and coordinated response. In this regard, policy dialogue can help countries to align policy and media discourse to gain political support for reforms. For 99 example, a policy dialogue on food stocks (which addresses optimal stock amounts, fiscal trade-offs, and implementation challenges) will be useful for food import countries. Similar policy dialogue on effective, appropriate and optimal levels of the fuel and food subsidy programmes will also be useful. This is because subsidies or price controls can create distortions. Attempts to maintain domestic food prices below world levels through untargeted subsidies, price controls, or export restrictions create incentives for evasion of the controls or smuggling of food. Similarly, a policy forum on biofuel policies would be useful. Less ambitious targets and low biofuels subsidies would lower pressure on food prices by reducing the competition with food for agricultural land and resources. Moreover, the impacts of the recent surge in food prices are creating different challenges including social, economic and environmental challenges. Because it is capable of weaving together these multi-disciplinary perspectives, the UNDP is well-placed to catalyze global and regional action and influence the international agenda. For example, UNDP can work with countries and other donors to minimize the adoption of policies with negative spillover effects for others. Examples include export ban, high levels of tariffs and subsidies, short term adaptation measures to Climate Change without fully working out the long term implications of the measures etc. It is clear that key components of the UNDP\u2019s support area include coordination, technical assistance and policy advice. 100 References ADB (Asian Development Bank). 2005. \u201cThe Challenges of Higher Oil Prices.

The term \u2018food stamps\u2019 is often used to describe a range of food linked income transfer schemes. These include tokens or discount cards which can be exchanged for food, or for the right to buy discounted food. Alternatively electronic transfer cards, which are credited each month with an allowance to be spent on food, may be used. Food linked income transfer schemes vary widely in individual and commodit y coverage, as well as scale. The objective of the scheme is usually nutritional (to increase the quantity or quality of food consumed) or livelihood related (to enable poor farmers to meet their overall basic needs). Stamps may also be targeted at vulnerable groups such as women and children. Another objective may be to provide a bigger market for domestic suppliers. Food stamps involve lower costs than food distribution systems, and have a greater likelihood of resulting in increased food consumption t han straight cash transfers (see below). However, food stamps are difficult to implement without a strong supporting government and private sector architecture (see below) and so have not been widely employed. Historically, they have been more prevalent i n the Americas, whereas Asian governments have tended to prefer distribution schemes. Although food stamps are associated with developing countries, arguably the most well known and successful food stamps programme is in the USA. In general, food stamps have been adopted as a temporary measure to help poor consumers adapt to short term shocks such as the removal of more generalized subsidies, or after currency devaluation. However, many such programmes have lasted much longer than expected, largely becaus e they are popular with recipients and therefore difficult to unpick. Country experiences Sri Lanka Sri Lanka introduced food stamps in 1979 as an attempt to wean the population off unaffordable general food subsidies (which then accounted for 15% of government spending).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5383cfff-c78b-41f3-b9c2-d656631c3a7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5383cfff-c78b-41f3-b9c2-d656631c3a7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f0eb4bbbaceab3a1a9bd8a1a41475a8f91eed821b7dd022be3eef5770188d2f"}}, "hash": "0f0eb4bbbaceab3a1a9bd8a1a41475a8f91eed821b7dd022be3eef5770188d2f", "text": "The stamps were intended to focus benefits on the most needy sections of society. However, by 1989, around 50% of the population were receiving food stamps, before the scheme was phased out in the 1990s. The stamps could be used to purchase rice (which accounted for 75% of food stamp purchases), flour, bread, sugar and milk products. The main problem affecting the success of Sri Lanka\u2019s food stamp programme was inflation. Failure to adjust the scheme in line with inflation meant tha t the real value of the stamps declined by around 50% over its first two years. The Government was reluctant to adjust the value of the stamps in line with inflation for fear of increasing the cost of the scheme. Moreover, the stamps did not reach the intended recipients: around 30% of the poorest quintile did not participate, whilst large numbers of richer families did. This was due to miscalculations of income, and the fact that income calculations were not recalculated over time. In addition, because coupons were not targeted at vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children, most extra food was consumed by men. Edirisinghe (1987) estimated that amongst the poorest calorific intake actually declined after the introduction of stamp scheme. The scheme was much cheaper than general food subsidies, however, accounting for only 3% of government spending. Since abandoning the scheme, Sri Lanka has looked to other means of subsidizing consumption, such as \u2018fair price\u2019 co -operative shops for the poor. Source: Casta\u00f1eda 2000, Edirisinghe 1986 Philippines In 1983, a one-year pilot food subsidy project was introduced in the Philippines by its National Nutrition Council and Ministry of Agriculture. Eligibility for the scheme was based on geography \u2013 i.e. villages with high levels of malnutrition were selected, rather than through any assessment of need 105 at the household level. Selected families were issued with a discount card, which allowed them to purchase cooking oil and for some families, rice in accr edited local stores. These products were selected because they are staple foods of the target population, are income elastic for the poor, and in the case of oil, high in calorific vale. Local markets in rice and oil were considered effective i.e. able to respond to increased demand. The cards gave a 32% discount on rice and 50% for oil. Participants could purchase 5kg of rice a month, about half of an average family\u2019s monthly consumption. However they could use the cards to purchase and up to 2.5 cups of oil (an extra marginal amount, with the intention of increasing consumption of this product). Storekeepers were given a 3% incentive reward when they redeemed the subsidized cost of accepting the cards. Transactions were recorded on the cards which were replaced monthly and transactions studied to check for fraud. Robust monitoring and support mechanisms were established. When analysed, the scheme was found to have increased the poorest participants\u2019 average income by a rather modest 9.1%, and account ed for approximately 8% of beneficiaries\u2019 daily calorie intake. The cost of implementing the scheme was low - around US$0.79 per beneficiary per month. 83.4% of this was food costs, 7.2% retailer incentives, and only 9.4% administration. The scheme experienced some leakages: geographic needs testing meant that some richer households were included in the scheme (although some of these were observed to have shared their entitlements with poorer families); eligible households invited extended family members from non-eligible villages to move in, increasing their entitlements which were based on family size; and there was significant resale or use for business purposes of the cooking oil by poor families (but not the rice). Other problems identified with the s cheme were that it caused delays and queues in participating retailers, problems with accessing stores for geographically dispersed families, and difficulties in use of the cards for illiterates. Source: Garcia 1988 India India has historically relied more heavily on food distribution (through its public distribution system or PDS) than food stamps as a means of achieving food security. In 1993 Purcell and Gulati argued for the replacement of the PDS with a food stamp system, on the grounds that this would be more targeted on the poorest, that it would remove the need for the Government to operate extensive food distributions systems, and would help free Indian\u2019s markets in staple foods, by allowing producers to benefit from market prices and thereby stimulating the agricultural system. However Swaminathan (2000, 2004) has argued that by targeting only the poorest, food stamps will exclude many who are going hungry. Moreover, the replacement of the PDS with vouchers or stamps would be unpopular,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "979cd5c1-49e6-477c-b7ee-8cab3abf464c": {"__data__": {"id_": "979cd5c1-49e6-477c-b7ee-8cab3abf464c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22cebdb3c27900572825fc06f547e3310711da1f27522632191ef263a0fb4259"}}, "hash": "22cebdb3c27900572825fc06f547e3310711da1f27522632191ef263a0fb4259", "text": "and, at a time of rising hunger and prices, could even spark unrest.

The State Government believed that this system reduced corruption by saving about 20,000 tonnes of rice and 7,100 kilo litres of kerosene every month over the previous pure rationing system (sources: Jenkin and Goetz, 2002, India\u2019s tenth 5 year plan). Pakistan A World Food Programme activity in Pakistan, Creating Assets for Rural Women (CARW) originally involved the distribution of imported wheat to recipients. However, in the Sindh province, the WFP has experimented with substituting food stamps for the wheat, through a state owned philanthropic organization. This pilot has saved significant resources previously used in distributing, transporting and storing grain, and the WFP is considering its extension to further regions. The programme is aimed, because of limited resources, at the very poorest communities, and the most nutritionally vulnerable members of these (women and children). The stamps, currently valued at half a daily wage, will be adjusted for inflation over time. Source: World Food Programme 2003 Pros and Cons Food stamps are more popular with the general public than cash transfers, as most people believ e food stamps are also more efficient than cash transfers in addressing hunger, as they can only be spent on food items. Although economic theory (see e.g. Southwell 1945) would suggest that inframarginal 106 levels of food stamps can result in equivalent levels of subsidy diversion to other purchases (i.e. because although the stamps are spent on food, this frees up some income to be spent on non-food items), evidence from the States and elsewhere suggests that in practice food stamps use results in a greater increase in food consumption than cash transfer (see e.g. Fraker 1990). In a multi -country study, Casta\u00f1eda (2000) found that food stamp programmes generally improved families\u2019 disposable income by 20-25%, but that food consumption improved even more greatly than would be expected for a transfer of this scale. Rogers and Coates (2002) argue that this is because food stamps are more likely to be controlled by women, whereas cash is more likely to be controlled by men, and that this may result in more of the extra resource being devoted to food for the family\u2019s children. Another factor which may in practice limit diversion is the use of small denominations of food vouchers, where the transaction cost of \u2018converting\u2019 these into cash by resale or other means is high The biggest advantage that food stamps offer over food distribution programmes is one of affordability. Food stamps are much cheaper to administer because they absolve the government of responsibility for purchasing, transporting and distributing grain. Because they rely on strict a priori identification of recipients, they also allow greater targeting than distributions systems. In a tight budgetary situation (as many governments are experiencing, due to broader effects of the crisis), the targeting of benefits to the most deserving ensures that the majority of government funding is channelled where it is needed most. Enhanced targeting brings its own challenges. As mentioned above, Swaminathan (2000, 2004) has argued that targeting is undesirable in a country such as India which has large populations of which many are hungry and poor. What is needed, he argues, are broad programmes which bring food to the deserving many. It is worth noting, however, that there is no inherent reason why a food stamp scheme of broad scope could not be introduced. Another challenge in targeting the poorest groups through food stamps is that the most impoverished individuals may be illiterate and/ or lack a permanent address, both of which will hinder their attempts to register in a food stamp scheme. By removing direct government intervention in the food markets, food stamps also enable the freer operation of market price mechanisms. This can be an advantage or a disadvantage for the poor. Where supply if of eligible food is able to respond to increased demand, and in particular where such food is locally produced, food stamps can create a virtuous cycle where production increases to meet demand, increasing farmers\u2019 incomes and rural livelihoods. However, where there are supply constraints, increased demand arising from food stamp use is likely to result in inflation (Rogers and Coates). Not only does this increase prices for non-recipients of the stamps, it will also make", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ca0ad82-f76a-4b7e-bd4c-a8b7092d5249": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ca0ad82-f76a-4b7e-bd4c-a8b7092d5249", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36f84246d9a6dba34df5b03b5a05d1c9d4fb81543c255a18585328bf6c125424"}}, "hash": "36f84246d9a6dba34df5b03b5a05d1c9d4fb81543c255a18585328bf6c125424", "text": "the stamps less valuable for recipients, unless they are adjusted for inflation. Even where food stamps do not in themselves contribute to inflation, they remain vulnerable to its effects, unless mechanisms are in place to ensure that the value of the stamps tracks inflation. Otherwise, the benefits from the scheme will decline over time whilst administrative costs remain constant (see Sri Lanka\u2019s experience above). For this reason, governments should be cautious about introducing widespread food stamp schemes at a time of strong infl ation (especially food price inflation). If properly implemented, food stamps may be less vulnerable to corruption and other leakage than either cash or food distribution. However, this relies on the coupons having inbuilt security features, and the existence of a robust monitoring and evaluation system to prevent misuse. Depending on coverage, food stamps also offer more choice to consumer than food distribution systems, which may result in purchase of higher-quality/ calorie foods such as meat or milk (Gentilini 2007) Food stamps may not, however, be attractive to retailers or traders (Gentilini 2007), both because they impose on retailers (as well as customers) the burden of handling and redeeming vouchers, and because retailers may not believe that the coupons are fully liquid Eligibility for becoming a food stamp retailer may also determine who has access to government subsidized grain. Geography is also an issue: it may be impractical to distribute or monitor the use of stamps in a population whic h is 107 widely dispersed. Equally, such a population may find it difficult to access an eligible store. Another risk associated with the use of food stamps is that vouchers will be resold on the black market. Finally, there is a question over how long a food stamp programme should last: although food stamps can become part of a permanent government strategy to address hunger, poverty and/ or malnutrition, it could act as a disincentive for individuals to seek work, especially if eligibility is determined by income. In summary, food stamps are most likely be a sound policy response where some or all of the following characteristics are present: \u00a7 The government has the required infrastructure and administrative structures to implement and monitor the intervention effectively; \u00a7 A well developed commercial retail and banking sector exists; \u00a7 The government\u2019s credibility in economic matters is good \u2013 i.e. that there is faith that the government will honour the food stamps; \u00a7 Existing inflationary pressures are low, OR the scheme will be too limited in scope to affect overall pricing levels; \u00a7 The main limitation on hungry households is related to purchasing power as opposed to food availability; \u00a7 The scheme is intended as a temporary solution to a short term problem (as it does nothing to improve underlying structural causes of hunger); \u00a7 There is a clear difference in needs between those inside and outside the food stamp scheme which justifies targeting of resources; \u00a7 Social factors such as poverty-linked alcohol abuse argues against cash transfer, and in favour of more control of household resources by women \u00a7 Even where some of these factors are absent, where food distribution schemes are unaffordable. How to design and implement a successful food stamp programme Many of the elements relevant to designing and implementing a successful food stamp or food coupon programme are common to food distribution systems. For example, it is critical to have clarity about what the scheme is intended to achieve, and who the targeted benefi ciaries are. Rogers and Coates (2002) claim that food stamps may encourage a degree of self -deselection as non-poor individuals may not wished to be stigmatized by receiving the stamps. However the experience of Sri Lanka suggests that governments in developing countries would be wise not to rely on this. Targeting by geographical area, as in the Philippines example, is cheap and easy to administer, but may result in abuse and/ or leakage. By comparison, means-testing households may be more accurate but is expensive, can exclude the illiterate or homeless, and, as the Sri Lankan example shows, can be counter-productive unless assessments are accurate. It is also critical to ensure that needs are reassessed on a regular basis, as households move in and out of poverty. Since food stamps tend to be more targeted than food distribution mechanisms, a premium must be placed on identifying the most deserving recipients. There needs to be robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in place to ensure benefits are being realized and leakages minimized. This is not an appropriate area for economizing, as the potential for wastage is high.

In terms of issues specific to the use of food stamps, care needs to be taken in determining the design of the stamps or coupons, to minimize the potential for fraud, though the benefits of sophisticated security measures may need to be balanced against their costs. Recirculation of vouchers as unofficial currency and the creation of a black market can be countered by producing vouchers in small denominations and with expiry dates. 108 Retailers need to be paid promptly (and consideration given to i ncentive payments for accepting vouchers). They should be accessible, and willing to serve beneficiaries and have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities. The coverage of commodities is important. Free choice may be desired by beneficiaries. But a focus on locally produced staples may help local farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Limitation to \u2018low status\u2019 but nutritious foods can help self-deselection by richer families. Families can also be steered towards new dietary patterns, including the consumption of higher calorie or nutrient food. However, as the Philippines example shows, dietary preference changes slowly and in the meantime leakage (through the resale of food) may result. Another key issue is the need for systems to be in place to a djust the value of the stamps in line with inflation, otherwise the benefits from the system will decline over time, while the administrative overhead will remain constant. Alternatively, stamps or vouchers can be denominated by quantity of foodstuff, rather than price. This may create problems in verifying retailers\u2019 claims for compensation, however, particularly in the case of rapidly fluctuating food prices. In terms of scale and cost, most food stamp programmes have tended to aim at covering 20 -25% of beneficiaries\u2019 food costs. (Casta\u00f1eda, 2000). Although larger transfers have been tried (such as for certain US states) this is unlikely to prove affordable for most developing countries. Below the 20% mark, the administrative overhead required for operation of the scheme is unlikely to be justified by any health benefits. Again, it is vital that governments ensure that the stamps are inflation-linked, otherwise the intended benefits will not be realized. Casta\u00f1eda (2000) has noted that the benefits from food stamp schemes can be maximized if they can be linked to other social safety net programmes (e.g. by making them dependent on mothers\u2019 attendance at pre- or post-natal clinics, or children\u2019s immunization programmes). This does assume, however, capacity to deliver supplementary programmes. Another approach, which has been tried in Jamaica and Honduras, is to provide food stamps only to specific individuals e.g. pregnant and lactating women. Additionally, as in the Philippines example above, a food stamp programme can be enhanced by educational programmes which teach communities about nutritional and food safety issues. 109 References Casta\u00f1eda, Tarsicio \u2018The Design, Implementation and Impact of Food Stamp Programs in Developing Countries\u2019 April 2000, Human Development Network, The World Bank Edirisinghe, N. 1986. \u2018The food stamp scheme in Sri Lanka: costs, benefits, and options for modifications.\u2019 Research Rep. no 58, IFPRI, Wash., D.C.

The objective of the scheme is usually livelihood related (to provide participants with work); nutritional aims (i.e. providing food rather than cash to ensure that the wage for this work is consumed as food) may be complementary or secondary. Some schemes have been specifically aimed at women workers, to help address issues of gender inequality, both in terms of right-to-work, and nutritional disparities (women, particularly in South Asia, tend to suffer higher rates of malnutrition and hunger than men). Often food-for-work has been established in post-conflict or disaster situations, where the state is weak, and there is a need for a self-targeting programme. Like food distribution systems, there is a high administrative overhead associated with work for food, as the government has to adopt a major role in buying, storing, transporting and distributing grain. However, they offer additional benefits compared with distribution systems where there is a high instance of unemployment or underemployment, in providing work for those affected, and for providing benefits to communities in terms of the output of participants. Food for work schemes have proved popular in South Asia as well as other parts of the developing world (notably sub-Saharan Africa), in part because of the willingness of international NGOs to provide food for such programmes. However there have been few formal eva luations of the effectiveness of Asian programmes, especially from a food security point of view. Country experiences India The National Food for Work Programme (NFFWP) was established by the Government of India in 2004. The NFFWP targeted the 150 most economically disadvantaged areas of the country (mostly tribal areas). The programme was intended as a pilot. Food for the programme was provided by the GoI, but State Governments were responsible for the handling and transportation of the food, and for food tax. The scheme was intended to be self-limiting, i.e. anyone wanting to participate could do so. The work offered was manual and semi-skilled in nature, and focused on water management, drought proofing and land management. Participants were paid at least 25% of their wages in cash, but with the remainder being of staple grains (normally up to 5kg per man day). Total wages were not to be less than the mandated minimum wage, and were to be paid weekly. The Programme has now been subsumed into the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which guarantees 100 days work for any rural worker willing to undertake unskilled work for minimum wage, and is one of the most ambitious social safety net programmes in the developing world. This incorporation sugges ts that the NFFWP\u2019s aims and outcomes were viewed primarily in terms of rural livelihoods rather than nutrition per se. Source: Government of India Bangladesh Bangladesh has operated a food for work programme since the aftermath of its 1974 famine. The main objectives of the programme are to provide rural employment, particularly during the dry season, and to provide labour to develop and maintain rural infrastructure. Programmes are regionally targeted on the poorest communities, and seem to have largely reached their target audience \u2013 the poorest quintile of the population being five times more likely to participate than the richest quintile. Moreover the programme has been particularly successful in times of particular food shortage \u2013 and is credited with avoiding a famine in 1988.

Source: World Food Programme 2005b and 2008 Food for work in Post-tsunami Asia The World Food Programme planned food for work interventions as part of its post-tsunami response in Sri Lanka and Indonesia (and to a lesser extent, Myanmar), along with food distribution and cash for work. The latter two programmes intended to be phased in aft er initial disaster relief with the aim of helping the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure as well as providing a food related social safety net. Challenges occurred because of lack of local experience with food for work programmes, and the continuation of government-run food distribution systems for longer than expected along side food for work (which disincentivised working, particularly for non-cash wages). Nor was it easy to find locally hired staff capable of adequately supervising food for work schemes. Moreover in Aceh it was found that, as local food markets were working effectively, cash for work was preferable to food for work, allowing more choice (including for non-food items) and reducing overheads. Nevertheless, food for work projects formed a significant component of the WFP\u2019s longer term tsunami recovery work in Sri Lanka, and in that country food transfers (through distribution or food for work) were found to be more effective in addressing malnutrition than cash transfers. Source: WFP 2005a Pros and Cons Food for work programme provides the ultra-poor with the dual benefits of work and food. Where food markets are working effectively, i.e. there is sufficient local capacity to respond to increased demand, and the problem is simply one of employment/ income, a cash-based public employment scheme may be equally effective as a food for work programme. This would also free the government of the expense of handling large quantities of food. However, cash is more likely to be spent on no n- food items (which may be desirable if it is spent on essentials such as health, education or shelter; but much less so if spent on e.g. alcohol). Moreover food for food for work schemes have often been provided by donors, making it attractive for governments (Lorge Rogers and Coates, 2002). Food for work programmes are more likely to be self-targeting for the very poor than pure distribution systems as cash wages are generally more desirable for those who can attain them (see e.g. Ravallion 1991). This means that the government can target needy households with relatively little administrative overhead. Moreover some of the problems associated with other safety net programmes which require enrollment (hence a permanent address and, sometimes, literacy) a re reduced or eliminated. Many of the other problems associated with distribution systems will apply for food for work, including leakage through corruption and wastage from poor storage. These can be limited to some extent through robust monitoring and other controls. But food for work programmes can be even more 112 expensive than distribution systems. Coady (2004) estimates that non-transferred costs, foregone non-scheme earnings by participants, and leakage to non-poor participants mean that it can cost as much as 146 rupees in a typical programme to transfer 60 rupees to a target beneficiary. Food for work programmes may be less likely to lead to a culture of dependency, as food is directly linked to employment. Participants may acquire new skills which may enhance their future employability. This might be particularly significant in post-conflict situations where food for work programmes might incentivise combatants to adopt new, peaceful, roles. However, in rural communities, participants who previously produced some food for their families may no longer be able to spare time to harvest and grow crops for personal consumption. Another risk, if the programmes are small in scale, is that other households may migrate to participating areas in search of work. This may necessitate restrictions on eligibility. Barrett (2006) has criticized work for food programmes for often having too many disparate aims (providing a safety net, building assets, ensuring food security) which means that their benefits are likely to become dispersed. It is notable that in the examples described above, nutritional objectives were often secondary to livelihood objectives or the desire to improve infrastructure. Participation in a work for food scheme entails having a house hold member who is fit enough to work (often in physically demanding tasks). Therefore such schemes may neglect the needs of some of the most vulnerable e.g. the infirm, elderly, disabled, pregnant or young.

How to design and implement a successful food stamp programme Unlike most food safety net programmes, the self-deselecting nature of food-for-work means that detailed targeting of recipients is not necessary (though some identification of poor neighbourhoods can help, especially in small scale projects). Some schemes have specifically targeted women, both because women tend to suffer higher rates of malnutrition and because the literature (e.g. Lorge Rogers and Coates 2002) suggests that food is more likely to reach vulnerable members of the family if it controlled by women. However both for women-only and for schemes targeted at both men and women, aspects such as physical strength and the need to provide child care may affect women\u2019s ability to participate or earn equal wages. Providing cr\u00e8ches and selecting appropriate work and wage structures can help offset these problems. A particular challenge for Food for Work programmes lies in setting the amount of food payable, both in respect of the nutritional needs of participants (especially if the work involves heavy physical labour) and equivalence with cash-paid labour, particularly if a minimum wage applies in that country (Rogers and Coates 2002). The balance here is between ethical and legal considerations which might 113 argue for a higher provision which might allow participants to progress out of poverty; and a more affordable scheme which will benefit a greater number of recipients. Lower wages will also enhance self-deselection of non-target populations. Wages can either be set by day (which will help ensure equal wages for weaker and more vulnerable participants) or by piece or progress (which will reward the more efficient worker and incentivise progress). The overall objectives of the individual project and the relative priority given to nutritional aims will be the deciding factor. Commodity selection is also important. High value non-perishable items (e.g. canned goods, oils) may be preferred by participants, but may also be resold (especially if food wage levels are set too high, i.e. more than participants would normally consume). Staple grains, perhaps fortified to add other nutrients, are the usual basis for food for work, but are expensive to store and transport. Small regular payments are less subject to resale leakage, but are more expensive to administer. Selecting \u2018low status\u2019 (but high-nutrition) foods can help self-deselection. In order to reduce leakages, control mechanisms such as that for public distribution systems are critical to prevent pilferage and other fraud as well as wastage through post -harvest loss. However, measures should also be taken to minimize leakage through for -gone earnings. For this reason, seasonal programmes such as that envisaged in Afghanistan may be appropriate. These would allow poor farmers to participate, but also to harvest and sell th eir own crops. Rogers and Coates (2002) suggest that a key factor in designing food for work programmes is that the public work element should be as meaningful as possible to local society. This can provide benefits for the wider community in terms of building community assets \u2013 as in the drought proofing work in the India example above. This can in turn form part of a longer-term strategy against hunger. Consideration should also be given to the location of projects, which should ideally be commutable for participants. Where nutritional aims are prioritized, it is important that those who cannot participate in the scheme because of health or other physical limitations should not be forgotten, and there is a strong argument for supplementing food-for-work with another safety net for these individuals (as in the Afghan example above). Finally, as with all social safety net programmes, it is essential that the programme is evaluated and monitored to ensure that it is meetings its intended objectives.

They should however be distinguished from emergency food distribution or relief aid (short term food assistance targeted at crisis-hit populations) and supplementary feeding programmes (such as school feeding programmes, which are aimed at meeting nutritional shortfalls in targeted vulnerable sections of society). Food distribution systems are directly aimed at combating hunger and malnutrition amongst the poor, whether this is caused by poor access or availability of food. The primary aim is therefore usually nutritional. However secondary objectives may be livelihood related (as families can improve their standard of living since they no longer have to spend such a large portion of their income on food, yet are still free to find paid employment). Other objectives may be supporting producers and keeping food prices stable. Given the scale of the food distribution systems in India and China, this type of intervention has been one of the most widely applied food safety net in the Asia Pacific region, and moreover has been well studied. Country experiences India The Public Distribution System (PDS) was introduced in the 1960s, born out of a previous food rationing scheme which was set up in the 1940s. It aimed to provide staple food grains to the poor at affordable prices. It also aimed to support farmers by purchasing their produce at a fair price, and to maintain national food security by holding stockpiles for times of crisis. The scale of the PDS is huge \u2013 160 million families are reached each year. The PDS was originally untargeted (or self -targeted), but since 1997 has been refocused to meet the needs of the below poverty line (BPL) population, on the reasoning that rapid economic growth had improved the incomes of many. Since 1997, the above poverty line (APL) population pays approximately 90% cost for food purchased in participating retailers. BPL families can buy around 10kg (more in years where stocks are high) at half cost or even less.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cf100b8-8723-4bf2-91b7-1ca4241548e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cf100b8-8723-4bf2-91b7-1ca4241548e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bed41e8f98617cae38a4cb29f568ab7827924b6b0d9d2e71fe210f15b475bbc"}, "2": {"node_id": "39b7a49b-0699-43b9-82cb-ee3a3d9580e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7341bb08d8c06ab95af43be39e955e941ca263541ef7d93c8f88f62fd445bcfc"}}, "hash": "fabac5450d4d3a971e18166a41191927b32912eb80fdf05fbe6def65e00a136c", "text": "The scheme focuses on food grains, but also covers sugar and cooking oil, which are sold through 489,000 fair price shops, 75% of them in rural areas.

Participants are supposed to produce a ration card to reduce fraud, but this in itself creates the opportunity for bribe-seeking from those distributing the cards. Moreover the Programme Evaluation Organisation\u2019s 2005 Study established that there were large scale exclusion and inclusion rates in most States, due to errors in establishing people\u2019s poverty levels, and the fact that many above the official poverty line are still living in hunger and need. Leakages mean that average PDS purchases were less than 1 kilo per month (against average need of 11 kg) in some states, although in others (such as Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala) the scheme met nearly 50% of monthly needs for the average participant. Nevertheless, the PDS is a landmark scheme which has brought food to millions of needy families. Swaminathan (2000) amongst others has called for the maintenance of a broad based sch eme for targeting the many, rather than the few, in order to address hunger as a rights issue. The scheme is also very popular nationally, with recipients and suppliers. The PDS is supplemented by a number of other national food interventions which target especially vulnerable groups such as the elderly, and school children. India\u2019s eleventh five year plan suggests a number of design features to improve the PDS, namely computerization of PDS operations and improving security features of ration cares; an a dvocacy programme to publicise the benefits of the PDS; and a village grain bank scheme for food -insecure areas. Sources: as cited and Zhou and Wang (2006) and GoI 11 th Five year plan. China In the 1950s, the Government of China introduced the \u2018unified gr ain procurement and sale system\u2019 which meant that the Government became the only buyer of domestic grain. Buyers of grain (basically urban workers, rural non-agricultural workers, and restaurants and bakeries) were given coupons with which to buy food through government shops. Unlike the Indian system, the Chinese distribution system was targeted heavily at urban workers (who paid lower prices than rural recipients), irrespective of income and need. The system was viewed by the government as essential to providing social stability through ensuring adequate food security. However, the cost to the government began to rise rapidly, as procurement prices rose whilst selling prices remained static. In addition, Zhou and Wang (2006) argue that operational inefficiency also drove up the cost of the scheme. The scale of the programme was immense \u2013 at its peak the system handled 100 million tons of grain in one year (compared with around 20 million tons in the case of India\u2019s PDS). By 1990, the cost of the programme had risen to 27 billion yuan (1.44% of GDP), leading to calls for it to be abandoned, and for the market to determine grain prices. In 1993, as incomes rose and the scheme became less valued by urban consumers, the grain market was opened to market f orces. But, after just a couple of years of price volatility, responsibility for subsidizing grain or providing rations was delegated to regions. By the late 1990s, given increased production and low prices, rationing was discontinued in favour of cash transfers, although the government continues to subsidise grain prices and maintain stores in case of local shocks.

Out of a total of 1820 KG of rice supposed to have been distributed as per daily sales registers, only 110 KG was received by the people. 94% was siphoned off. 117 Additionally, Rogers and Coates (2002) argue that food transfers are more likely to be controlled by women and that this may result in more of the extra resource being devoted to food for th e family\u2019s children. However food distribution systems are very expensive \u2013 usually at least twice as expensive as cash transfers (Oxfam, as cited by Gentilini 2007). This is because of the enormous costs involved in procuring, storing, transporting and distributing bulk grain; combined with the massive potential for leakage which occurs because food is harder to account for than cash. Governments in a weak fiscal position should be very cautious about starting a public distribution system, particular ly as costs have tended to sky-rocket, and they have proved difficult to dismantle. Large scale public distribution systems are likely to result in the government controlling prices in staple foods, which can help producers and non-targeted consumers by providing stability, and in the case of suppliers, a guaranteed market. However this may also mean that demand signals are not relayed to producers. Distribution systems are less likely to provoke inflation than cash -based systems (because they focus on increasing supply of rather than demand for food). However, they may trigger an unsustainable fiscal deficit because of spiralling costs. In summary, food distribution systems are most likely be a sound policy response where some or all of the following characteristics are present: \u00a7 There is a large number of deserving target recipients; \u00a7 The government can afford to finance a resource-intensive scheme; \u00a7 There are problems in identifying individual or household levels of poverty (due to weak bureaucracies or high illiteracy rates); \u00a7 The government has access to large quantities of affordable grain, either nationally produced or internationally donated; \u00a7 The government (or implementing agency) has the capacity to transport, store and distribute large quantities of food; \u00a7 At a regional/ local level there are problems around food availability as well as access; \u00a7 Market control of prices and/ or creation of purchase price certainty and fairness for domestic suppliers is considered desirable; \u00a7 Localised flooding or drought makes the acquisition of banked food stores desirable; \u00a7 The scheme is intended as a temporary solution to a short term problem (as it does nothing to improve underlying structural causes of hunger); \u00a7 Social factors such as poverty-linked alcohol abuse argues against cash transfer, and in favour of more control of household resources by women How to design and implement a successful food distribution system Asia\u2019s major food distribution systems have mostly emerged organically, evolving out of post -war rationing schemes which were focused on provision of scarce food. However, in an ideal world a public distribution system should only be introduced with a very clear idea of aims, objectives and target population. This is especially important because distribution systems have proved expensive, with escalating costs, and difficult to unpick except (as in China) where underlying problems of poverty and hunger are addressed. As discussed above, large scale distribution systems are most valuable where problems of hunger and poverty are widespread, and where there is limited need for targeting by income or vulnerability. However leakage to non-poor families should be minimized by careful commodity selection, to enhance self-deselection. For example, \u2018inferior\u2019 or lower status food (albeit with good nutritional value) is unlikely to be attractive to better off consumers. By contrast, higher status food, particularly if non-perishable and resaleable, will attract non target consumers (for instance, the inclusion of sugar and kerosene in India\u2019s PDS is thought to have attracted better -off families). Where more precise targeting is considered desirable, it is important that the homeless and illiterate are not excluded, and the balance between low cost, low accura cy methods (such as geographical 118 targeting) and high cost, high accuracy methods (household survey data) needs to be considered. Overall, targeting is more likely to be justified where resources are limited, and/ or where there is a high differentiation in terms of need between target and non-target populations. However if this is the case, alternative interventions such as food stamps may be more appropriate. Secondly, careful attention needs to be paid to storage and distribution networks for the food. If a distribution system is to meet its objectives, it needs to provide a regular supply or acceptable quality food.

Moreover mechanisms must be in place at every stage of the distribution process to prevent leakage, both from spoilage, and, especially, corruption. Corruption is a major problem in many distribution schemes because of the challenges inherent in auditing bulk produce, as opposed to cash or vouchers. Moreover those handling food supplies at every point in the value chain are likely to be relatively poor and may be tempted therefore to take food. Attempts have been made to tackle fraud by participants through the use of ration cards. However, this causes problems of its own in that participants may need to pay a bribe to get a card; the illiterate or homeless may be unable to acquire one; and, crucially, much of the corruption-based loss occurs earlier in the supply chain. This argues for a greater investment in the policing of warehouses and supply networks, and for greater salaries for and oversight of those responsible for handling grains. Consideration needs to be given to how surplus stocks should be managed. The accumulation of stocks can be advantageous, particularly in countries which suffer from regionalized food production shocks such as drought or flooding. Moreover, recent price rises have emphasize d the importance of buffer stocks, both nationally and regionally. That said, accumulation of excessive buffer stocks represents an opportunity cost (food could be used to feed the hungry) and may result in participants being given old and poorer-quality food (ref). In both India and China, distribution systems have played an important role in supporting farmers by providing a reliable market for grain at a stable price. However, the relationship between the government and farmers must be handled carefully. First, it is important that the government, whilst taking into account genuine livelihood concerns from farmers, must protect the interests of the scheme\u2019s recipients as a primary concern. This means setting a purchase price which will be fair for consumers as well as producers, and which is fiscally sustainable. It is also important that market signals on increasing or decreasing demand are transmitted to farmers, again through government -set prices. Efforts by governments to control domestic prices are likely to reap limited rewards unless like China the government assumes a monopoly position in purchasing \u2013 this is likely to be unaffordable for most. However even limited market intervention may help stabilize prices. Finally, as the China example shows, the best way to end an expensive food distribution system is to work through parallel strategies such as job creation to improve incomes sufficiently that demand for the programme is drastically reduced.

In 1982, the programme was extended to include pre -school children, and the school mid-day meal programmes is now deeply entrenched in the state\u2019s educational system, and regarded as an entitlement by its population. Meals given are cooked, nutritious, varied and tasty. Other elements have been incorporated into the programme, such as growth monitoring, worming, and the provision of supplements. 8% of the state\u2019s population is no w covered by the scheme. The scheme has had a dramatic impact on nutrition outcomes. Since 1983, severe malnutrition amongst 0-36 month age children has declined from 12% to negligible levels. The percentage of normal children has increased over the same period from 20% to 60%. The daily cost of operating the scheme has been estimated at USD 0.083 per recipient. Although the scheme faces some difficulties in the form of leakages, as well as second generation issues such as remote location access, continued staff motivation and limited community participation in scheme design, it has had a significant impact. The scheme is now being scaled up to national level, and the right to a mid-day meal for certain vulnerable population is now established under law (Supreme Court Orders of Nov 28, 2001). Initial results from other states have been mixed to date, emphasising the importance of good programme design (see below). For example, in Chhattisgarh poor management and infrastructure meant that cooking took place in soot-covered class-rooms, disrupting teaching, whilst in Rajasthan under-funding meant that the same meal was served each day and rejected by some castes. Nevertheless, the Tamil Nadu example does demonstrate that a sustainable school feeding programme is a possibility. Source: Rajivan, 2008 Bangladesh Since 2002, the World Food Programme has been running a school feeding programme in partnership with the Government of Bangladesh. The programme aimed to provide approximately 15% of participating children\u2019s calorific needs in the form of a biscuit which also contained essential vitamins and minerals. 128 schools were included from poor rural areas and rural slums. As well as nutritional aims, the programme was intended to increase enrolment, decrease drop-out and repetition rates, improve behaviour and performance; and to encourage the construction of safe wells and girls\u2019 toilet facilities. When reviewed in 2004 against non-nutritional aims only, Rogers et al found that the scheme was well implemented and reaching target children. Enrolment improved, though drop-out and repetition rates did not. Behaviour improved significantly according to teachers, and there was a 121 small but non-significant improvement in test scores. There was no impact on well and sanitary facilities. Although no assessment was made of the impact on nutritional outcomes, children and teachers interviewed claimed there was surprisingly little diversion in the form of leakage of the biscuits to non-target family members, nor in terms of substitution for food which would have been provided from home. Source: Rogers et al 2004 Pros and Cons The main advantage of (well run) supplementary feeding programmes is that they channel food to the most vulnerable groups, not just within a society but within a household. This is particularly important in countries where women have low status, and commensurate access to food resources. Malnutrition in women is not only of concern in itself, but is also important in terms of the nutritiona l profile of whole communities: underweight and malnourished women give birth to low birth weight babies, who fail to develop to their physical or mental potential. This in turn can affect their ability to earn a living, and hence buy food for themselves and their families. Women in this generation are also likely to be malnourished and to have low-birth weight babies, thus perpetuating the cycle. Therefore, unlike many food safety net schemes, supplementary feeding programmes can help break cycles of malnutrition and hunger, and therefore can be viewed as appropriate strategies for tackling some of the root socio/cultural/economic causes of hunger (rather than, for example, simply helping poor families through crises and price shocks). In terms of disadvantages, supplementary feeding programmes are expensive to administer. In itself, this may not be a problem, particularly as such programmes are likely, if well designed, to deliver significant positive externalities, such as greater school attendance (es pecially for girls), better birth outcomes and better health, which may actually save the state money (though there has yet to be a full economic analysis of the costs and benefits of such a scheme). Mothers of school age children may also be freed from some food", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72f734fe-e2b9-491a-804d-f720604191b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "72f734fe-e2b9-491a-804d-f720604191b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rising Food and Fuel Prices in Asia and the Pacific: Causes, Impacts and Policy Responses", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/rising-food-and-fuel-prices-asia-and-pacific-causes-impacts-and-policy-responses", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99bde7870b2d15ccc2ce3e91b9f3da69d19dec16f4a324c383d2890087e1ddd1"}}, "hash": "99bde7870b2d15ccc2ce3e91b9f3da69d19dec16f4a324c383d2890087e1ddd1", "text": "preparation responsibilities and hence be more able to contribute to the household through paid or unpaid labour. The key however lies in effective programme design and delivery (see below). A poorly thought - through and executed programme may not meet even basic nutritional objectives, and may (as in the Chhatisgarh example above) distract resource from other services such as education provision. Without appropriate checks and balances, moreover, supplementary feeding programmes may be associated with excessive leakages \u2013 through corruption (those administering the programmes are likely to be poorly paid themselves), diversion (in the case of dry rations, children may bring the food back home to share with others) or substitution (parents may pro vide less food in the knowledge that the children are fed at school). Some donors may be more willing to contribute to supplementary feeding programmes \u2013 particularly school feeding programmes \u2013 than to other food safety nets as they may be more focused on secondary aims such as education. However in these cases it is important that other deserving groups (e.g. pre-school children) are not excluded. In summary, food distribution systems are most likely be a sound policy response where some or all of the following characteristics are present: \u00a7 Societal, economic or cultural factors (such as lack of gender equality) make some groups especially vulnerable to malnutrition; \u00a7 Where there is a cycle of malnutrition, passing from malnourished mother, to low-birth weight baby, through stunted child; \u00a7 Where infrastructure exists to provide a successful scheme; \u00a7 Where there exist other important objectives (such as low female participation in education) which could be met through e.g. a school feeding programme; \u00a7 Where resources are so limited as to justify tight targeting on the most needy; OR to supplement a general distribution system where certain groups are especially vulnerable; 122 \u00a7 Additionally, supplementary feeding programmes are an important part of any response to a crisis which threatens hunger and/ or starvation. How to design and implement a successful supplementary feeding system A key first step in designing any successful supplementary feeding system is to identify who the target recipients should be. The Lancet (2008) has recently argued that such efforts should be focused only on maternal and infant feeding schemes, because these have the greatest direct impact on nutritional outcomes. However, Radhakrisnan (2004) noted that nutritional outcomes need to be judged over longer time periods \u2013 for example, she and fellow researchers found that women in Guatemala who had received supplementary feeding programmes as children had higher birth weight babies \u2013 even when they did not receive extra food when pregnant. School feeding may also achieve significant non-nutritional outcomes in terms of educational attainment and, especially, girls\u2019 participation in schooling. These may have longer term impacts on hunger (higher earning potential for all; and educated girls are less likely to marry young and have large families). But there have been few studies to quantify these benefits. Either way, feeding some combination of mothers, children and babies is likely to provide the greatest benefits because it breaks the cycle of hunger. Nevertheless, it may be beneficial to include the elderly, sick and infirm on simple humanitarian grounds, particularly as they are unable to participate in some alternative schemes such as food for work. This may also free up women carers to participate in other activities. Once the target group has been decided on, there is the challenge of identifying target recipients. For school feeding programmes this is relatively straightforward. It is more difficult to identify and reach pregnant and nursing mothers, babies and pre-schoolers, especially in areas where literacy and access to maternal health services are low. Pre-schoolers are notoriously hard to reach \u2013 and some donors will not support programmes which target this (very vulnerable) group (Rajivan 2008). Moreover, targeting supplementary programmes only at the malnourished can in itself be damaging (Rogers and Coates 2002) as it means that malnutrition is treated, rather than prevented, and families can even be incentivised to under-feed children if this results in the provision of free food (ibid). Instead, a programme like Tamil Nadu\u2019s is available to all children, which helps break down cast and class barriers (though does little to keep the costs of the programme down) (Raji van, 2008). In designing the programme, there is a balance to be struck between the costs and benefits of providing cooked versus dry rations. Dry rations are much more likely to be stolen, or to be brought home for consumption by other family members (or even livestock). For this reason cooked food is usually preferred.

Moreover Bangladesh\u2019s experience shows that even dry rations can provide some positive benefits. Where possible, however, the ideal is a well staffed and resourced cooked meal, with enough variety to be enticing to children. Rajiva n (2008) has documented that in Rajasthan higher caste children declined to eat the gruel provided through the mid-day meal scheme, with the result that caste and economic inequities were highlighted. Rajivan (ibid) also notes that, whilst school feeding may be effective in meeting educational objectives, it cannot substitute for the quality of teaching. It is therefore important that the primary objective of the programme is recognized to be nutritional; if educational objectives are to be met as well, the school feeding must form part of a coherent educational strategy. Benefits from supplementary feeding programmes can be maximized if they can be combined (through fortification or complementary provision) with the provision of supplements and medicine s, and if they are accompanied with a campaign to educate people about good nutrition. This latter can help prevent parents from giving the children less food (because they know they will be fed at school). 123 Finally, it is important that participants in the scheme are regularly monitored in order to ascertain whether expected benefits are being realized. Supplementary feeding programmes are expensive, and often designed to be longer-lived than other food safety net schemes. It is important therefore that they are effectively evaluated.

IntRoduCtIon Bangladesh is a country vulnerable to natural hazards and the impact of climate change. Every year, the country is struck by several disasters that can include cy- clones, floods, droughts and tidal surges, resulting in the loss of assets, livelihoods and lives. After the catastrophic flood of 1988 and the devastating cyclone of 1991, Bangla- desh transformed its approach from \u201creactive humanitarian relief\u201d after a disaster to \u201cproactive risk management\u201d before the disaster. Today, Bangladesh is one of the best examples in the world of significant achievements and innovation in the field of disaster management. UNDP\u2019s support and partnership with the Government of Bangladesh in disaster preparedness spans four decades. In 2004, the Government and UNDP launched the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP). The first five years of the programme laid the policy and institutional foundation for integrating long- term disaster management with climate change adaptation (through several pilot tests and demonstrations), while the last five years focused on translating those policies into practice at the national as well as community level.

Working closely with the Government and host Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, the programme was able to institutionalise the adoption of risk re- duction approaches more widely across several key ministries and their line agen- cies to ensure it is part of planning and budgeting processes. Over the span of its life, the programme supported well over 2,000 village-, 200 sub-district- and 40 district-level Disaster Management Committees to incorporate disaster risk issues into the planning process. The project also expanded livelihood climate change adaptation activities in hundreds of villages across the 40 most vulnerable districts of the country and trained over 62,000 urban volunteers on search and rescue and first aid. It also implemented urban risk reduction interventions across 45 slums in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet. evIdenCe of Results aChIeved at sCale and tRansfoRMatIonal ChanGe The Standing Orders on Disaster, issued by the Government in 1997 and revised in 2010 with UNDP support, have become synonymous with disaster management in Bangladesh. They assign disaster management roles and responsibilities of rel- evant offices and sectors during normal, emergency and post emergency periods. This led to a comprehensive and government-wide approach that integrates di- saster risk reduction into the work of 15 government institutions. Such milestones are now considered fundamental to the transformation that followed. They gave strength to disaster management committees so they could more effectively plan and coordinate risk reduction and emergency response. There has been a dramatic reduction in lives and livelihoods destroyed from natural disasters as a result of improved preparedness for disasters.

Today, this new phase of the CDMP is the main means for institutional reform, capacity building and reducing disaster and cli- mate risks in vulnerable communities in Bangladesh. It works across 12 ministries, 40 districts, nine city corporations and multiple sectoral partners, including 16 uni- versities and eight training institutes. Its work includes support to legislative reform and innovate pilot efforts to address climate variability. Policies in Bangladesh now look beyond disasters to future cli- mate risks and this is reflected in the 6th Five Year Plan, which stipulates that di- sasters and climate change are to be determinants of development. Disaster man- agement is also now an important component of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. The early years of the CDMP created the policies, partnerships, and targeted pilot efforts that formed a foundation for action. The programme helped define and then align itself with the changing national thinking around disaster management, thus making the scaling up process a joint effort. `two-storey village\u2019 is the phrase that locals from the surrounding villages use to describe this disaster resilient habitat built with the support of undp, and designed with inputs from traditional knowledge. photo: undp Bangladesh / akash The programme was able to institutionalise the adoption of risk reduction approaches more widely across several key ministries and their line agencies to ensure it is part of planning and budgeting processes.

In the aftermath of Ban- gladesh\u2019s biggest industrial disaster in May which left more than 1,100 garment industry factory workers dead, there is an urgency and an opportunity to scale up urban risk reduction efforts through CDMP. Sustained efforts and Partnerships\u2014Over the past decade there has been a rec- ognition within Bangladesh\u2019s policy circles of the deep link between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and the need for an integrated approach in policy, programme and implementation. Current mainstreaming efforts through 15 ministries aim to establish a solid foundation for advancing such an integrated approach. Continued engagement of stakeholders, including donors, will be criti- cal to taking these efforts forward. Institutionalisation\u2014There have been major changes to the government\u2019s insti- tutional architecture in the wake of the Disaster Management Act 2012, which has created a dedicated ministry and a full-fledged Department of Disaster Manage- ment. A concerted vision and effort will now be needed from the government, in collaboration with development partners, to implement the new act. sustaInaBIlIty / exIt stRateGy Promoting and supporting national disaster volunteerism \u2013 The new phase will train over 62,000 urban volunteers.

Sustained Engagement: Transformational change requires long-term com- mitment to partnerships and in disaster risk reduction; there is no \u201cquick fix\u201d available. Engagement is most effective when spread across a range of stakeholders, including all levels of government, NGOs, think tanks and civil society organisations. 2. Partnership Frameworks: Leverage UNDP\u2019s impartial, knowledge-broker status to build a partnership network in the disaster sector. This network can include line ministries, local government bodies, NGOs and community based organisations who work together to turn disaster risk reduction con- cepts into policies, plans and programmes. 3. Institutional Capacity Building is a prerequisite to harness scale-up po- tential and is at the heart of real transformational change. Establishing a strong institutional framework for disaster risk reduction means that core government policies, plans and programmes require disaster risk reduction principles to be incorporated from the earliest conceptualisation stages. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f92924ce-5406-4ab3-a7ac-ea45fe3577c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f92924ce-5406-4ab3-a7ac-ea45fe3577c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scaling-disaster-preparedness-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Scaling-Up Disaster Preparedness in Bangladesh", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scaling-disaster-preparedness-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7138b4a079296df9538e0460fbe364dcfc234b45a33b247b03a785a3cfe2f9f"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d455711-65e4-4a37-ba94-6aafcf256887", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/scaling-disaster-preparedness-bangladesh", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fae4c452c03fa9630af23db6575c7a0a2539b4909de092058aef6091964908cb"}}, "hash": "f7b62763d2213ff99205aba733dd040739e103d2ae2f58c45337bd673d10c86d", "text": "4.

These deals violated the two fundamental principles of the WTO: most favoured nation (MFN),1 and limits on the imposition of quantitative restrictions.2 Now that the T&C sector has become part of the regular WTO discipline like other goods; no derogation shall be allowed to this sector. Quota limits, when they existed, directly restrained the exports of large developing countries. Many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) that had been able to expand production and obtain access to major markets under the MFA now face the prospect of major structural and socio- economic dislocation.

In order to assess the human development impact of quota elimination, the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo (UNDP RCC) launched a Textiles and Clothing Trade Flows Tracking System in 12 selected Asian countries (hereafter, the \u2018Asian 12\u2019) in May 2005. The Asian 12 consists of: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. These countries can be grouped into four categories: (1) countries with large production capability in both textile and apparel production (China, India); (2) countries that have limited production capability in both textiles and apparel (Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Viet Nam); (3) middle- income countries that mainly have apparel production capability (Philippines, Sri Lanka); and (4) LDCs (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Nepal). In cooperation with national consultants in a number of countries, UNDP RCC established the tracking system with the objectives of monitoring trade flows as well as key variables including shifts in employment patterns and international price trends. Two Reports analysing the data and highlighting major trends were published in September and December 2005, shared with experts in the region at several dissemination workshops, and distributed to 1 Article I of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 2 Article XI of GATT. a range of stakeholders. This initiative complements a sub-project at UNDP RCC that aims at identifying national and regional policy options to address possible negative economic and social impacts of the phasing out of quotas in the region. This Report, which further updates the last two Reports, includes analysis of several policy questions on the basis of the most recent data and information. The Report is based on import data from two major markets \u2013 namely, the United States (US) and European Union (EU) \u2013 for one year after the phase-out of quotas, as well as on countries\u2019 available trade data. Analysis based on the countries\u2019 export data is ideal; however, disaggregated export data of many countries in the region are not available in a timely manner and the period of coverage based on the calendar/fiscal year and timing of releasing data differ country by country. For a purpose of comparison among a number of countries, the Report use the US and EU data as a primary source. In addition to tracking of trade flow data of the Asian 12, this Report includes country- specific analysis of three additional countries that were severely hit by the expiry of the ATC; Fiji, Maldives and Mongolia. Other relevant data, such as employment and wages, are hard to obtain at the disaggregated level at the moment. Nonetheless, the Report attempts to highlight implications of the phase-out of quotas on workers where aggregate data and literature are available. RCC has recently started the initiatives of firm-based surveys in select Asian LDCs, which will not only help to generate recent data on employment and wage, but also on other elements with human development implications. Findings of these surveys will be disseminated to the stakeholders through their inclusion in the subsequent version of the Tracking Report. Data on 2005 vis-\u00e0-vis 2004 show that China and India has been a clear winner by expanding their market shares in both United States and EU. On the other hand, landlocked countries such as Mongolia and Nepal and small island economies such as Fiji and Maldives were hit hard by the elimination of quotas: These countries\u2019 T&C exports declined significantly in 2005. Overall, other countries in the region are managing to hold on to previous gains especially after safeguards were imposed on Chinese T&C products. Increasing price competition however, casts doubts on their sustainability. Closures of factories, job losses and deterioration of worker\u2019s conditions are reported in the countries that lost export orders as well as in the countries that managed to keep their export volume. However, these countries do have an opportunity to utilise the window created by the imposition of safeguards on Chinese exports for the orderly management of their transition towards global competition. The Report is organised as follows: Chapter II discusses the general trend in Asia\u2019s share of US and EU imports of T&C products and provides country-specific analysis for selected countries. Chapter III deals with policy concerns relating to supply-side constraints that will have long- term implications on the competitiveness of T&C enterprises, particularly in those countries of the region that have either been losing out or are expected to lose out from the phase-out of T&C quotas. The final chapter concludes the discussions and provides recommendations on the way", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "602669df-2fbf-4a4b-8390-cd512031e67c": {"__data__": {"id_": "602669df-2fbf-4a4b-8390-cd512031e67c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f5154ab9bb9c369823179d7e4096e6fb7d9f1133c69595be536f2b919b5ca31"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c50eeed-bbd0-4f06-a433-52e066f091d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "197f6a8c0095e7b0abf9dab378d4298173c8b2a2f44746becbdd5f84098ab955"}}, "hash": "99b87f26d7e3f3c2c7aea457af764a7b067500dca26b17aed42c7a288ba659a0", "text": "forward. 2 3 II. Asia\u2019s Share of US and EU Imports of T&C Products: General Trend A Growing Market Asia\u2019s share of US and EU imports of T&C products continued to increase in the first year of the post-ATC regime. Table A-1 shows percentage shares of selected countries in Asia-Pacific and other regions that have trade agreements with the United States for imports of T&C products during 2004 and 2005. In 2004, nearly 42 percent of total US imports were from the Asian 12; now, Asia\u2019s share accounts for half of US imports of T&C products. Specifically, the comparison of import figures for the two years shows that the share of US imports from the Asian 12 rose from 41.3 percent to 49.8 percent in value terms and from 41.9 percent to 50.2 percent in volume terms. In contrast, regions that have trade agreements with the United States have lost their shares in US imports of T&C products \u2013 in spite of their preferential market access. The share of Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries plus Mexico in the US market declined from 21.6 percent to 19.2 percent in value terms and from 22.2 percent to 19.8 percent in volume terms. The share of African countries falling under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) \u2013 which are the beneficiaries of generous preferential market access in the United States \u2013 also declined from 2.1 to 1.6 percent in value terms and from 1.7 percent to 1.3 percent in volume terms. Percentage shares of the Asian 12 for EU T&C imports are shown in Table A-2. Notably, the share of the Asian 12 in EU imports is even larger than for US imports; in 2004, it was 47.2 percent in term of value and 56.2 percent in terms of volume. One year later, the share had increased to 53.2 percent in value and 61.4 percent in volume. China is the leading contributor to the growth of both US and EU imports of T&C products from the Asian 12. China\u2019s share of total US imports of T&C products, already 17 percent in 2004, continued to increase. In 2005, about a quarter of all US T&C imports were from China. Similarly, EU imports of T&C products from China rose from 23.0 to 30.7 percent in terms of value and from 26.0 to 33.4 percent in terms of volume. Among the Asian 12, Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Pakistan also increased their exports to the United States, as well as their shares of US imports of T&C products. However, among these countries only India managed to increase its share of EU imports of T&C products as well. Besides China and India, all other Asian 12 countries, even those benefiting from several variants of Generalised System of Preferences (GSPs), experienced declines in T&C exports to the EU. The next section provides more in-depth analysis of trade flows and implications on employment, where data are available, for selected countries. The US and EU import data for all Asian12 countries are provided in the Appendix. Country Analysis Bangladesh 96 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s T&C exports are concentrated on two markets, the United States and EU (World Bank, 2006: iii). Growth rates of Bangladesh exports of T&C to the United States and EU from 2004 to 2005 are 2.3 percent in terms of value and 4.2 percent in terms of volume (Table A-3). Europe, which has been Bangladesh\u2019s primary market for its T&C exports, slowed its imports from the country in 2005, especially in the category of woven ready made garments (RMGs) (HS 62). EU imports of woven RMGs dropped by 13 percent in both value and volume terms. On the other hand, Bangladesh succeeded in expanding its RMG exports to the United States. US imports of Bangladeshi RMGs, both knitted and woven, recorded two-digit growth rates. Figure A-1 shows that steady growth in Bangladesh\u2019s exports of RMGs and other made-up textile articles (HS 63) over the last 10 years. On the other hand, exports of yarns, fibres and textiles (HS 50-60) have been declining gradually.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c50eeed-bbd0-4f06-a433-52e066f091d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c50eeed-bbd0-4f06-a433-52e066f091d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sewing Thoughts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f5154ab9bb9c369823179d7e4096e6fb7d9f1133c69595be536f2b919b5ca31"}, "2": {"node_id": "602669df-2fbf-4a4b-8390-cd512031e67c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/sewing-thoughts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99b87f26d7e3f3c2c7aea457af764a7b067500dca26b17aed42c7a288ba659a0"}}, "hash": "197f6a8c0095e7b0abf9dab378d4298173c8b2a2f44746becbdd5f84098ab955", "text": "In fiscal 2004, with an export earning of US$2.148 billion, knitwear sector employed 500,000 workers, while the US$3.538 billion woven apparel sector provided direct employment to 1.3 million workers (Khondker et al, 2005). 80 percent of workers are women, with the female share greater in the woven apparel sector than in knitwear sector.

No evidence was reported on factory closures and/or retrenchment of workers in the initial post-ATC period of 2005. A survey by Majid and Hussain (2005) (cited in Khondker et al, 2005) reveals that 19 out of 35 firms surveyed had increased the number of workers since January 2005, while the rest reported no change. However, more than half of the firms surveyed experienced increased price competition and had to accept reduced prices for their products since the expiry of ATC. The increased competitive pressure was felt more in the woven RMG sector. Given the gender-biased employment patterns among RMG sectors, a decline in the woven apparel sector can have larger negative impacts on female workers; growth of knitwear production is not likely to offset the job loss among women in woven apparel sectors. Another survey by Ahmed et al (2005) found increasing pressure to meet the different codes of conduct and social standards set by different buyers among Bangladeshi garment producers. Achieving compliance with labour and social standards is by no means encouraged in every industry, and many attributed the improvements in labour and social standards in the post- ATC period to increased attention of buyers to such needs. The problem, however, is that extra burdens fall upon employers\u2019, and then workers\u2019, shoulders, without support from buyers or appropriate social infrastructure from Governments. For example, one buyer may require workers be provided with sandals while the other requires work shoes. Another 4 5 requires assembly spaces to be air-conditioned, while workers who live in slums without power are adversely affected by the temperature gap between workplace and home.3 Producers who supply garments to several buyers encounter inconvenience in meeting their demands. Producers are further overburdened by audits over labour and social standards; a greater burden is found on smaller producers who face resource constraints. Compliance with ILO-led labour standards in Cambodia, as discussed in Adhikari and Yamamoto (2005), was possible since the sector is relatively new. Investors there can open up factories that meet all requirements. However, for matured enterprises in countries like Bangladesh, it is costly to change infrastructure and meet all requirements, even as there exists a misperception among employers on the costs of compliance. For example, many studies show that the costs of providing maternity leave are not high (Rahman, 2005), yet introducing such regulations are considered costly by employers, and they often discriminate against pregnant women. Finally, reducing verbal and physical abuse against workers by employers and senior staff are costless, and provides a safer work environment and improves productivity. Ahmed et al (2005) also found a reduction in work hours due to buyer pressure to meet legal limit of 60 hours a week. While working within legal limit of hours is good for workers, negative impacts include reduced income and nutritional supplements, such as boiled eggs and banana/ bread slices, which are provided as snacks for overtime workers. As we discuss later, lack of nutrition impairs workers\u2019 productivity. Labour and social standards should be more demand-driven by workers, and buyers should help suppliers meet labour and social standards by guaranteeing longer-term contracts. Governments, with help from non- governmental organisations, should provide social programmes to improve workers\u2019 basic needs on diet, housing, transportation and public safety. The need for investing in human development will be discussed in the next chapter. India In the post-ATC era, India showed the strength of its exports in both textiles and clothing. US and EU imports of Indian T&C products grew 21.5 percent in value and 11.2 percent in volume from 2004 to 2005 (Table A-6). Two-digit growth rates are observed in many categories of T&C products, including knitted and woven RMGs. A significant decline occurred, however, in man-made staple fibres (HS 55) and knitted fabrics (HS 60), where the value of US and EU imports declined by 14.1 and 20.4 percent respectively in 2005. It should be noted that the US and EU markets accounts for about 70 percent of India\u2019s total T&C exports in terms of value4; yet India\u2019s latest trade data also support trends in the US and EU market.

The Indian T&C sector employs 35 million workers, which represents 11 percent of the total labour force (USITC, 2004: F-23). The industry has a well-integrated supply chain from the stage of cotton production to RMGs, and even beyond. Small and cottage units, with fewer than 11 workers, account for 80 percent of the industry, while medium (21-49 workers) and large units (more than 49 workers) account for 14 and 6 percent respectively (Unni and Bali, 2001). Although no job losses have been reported yet, many female workers are expected to lose their jobs when the textile industry replaces handlooms by machine looms. Handloom weaving is labour-intensive and predominately women\u2019s jobs in cottage industries. Investing in additional capitals and upgrading technology are important for the industry, but social safety nets, as well as alternative jobs for retrenched female workers, likewise are necessary. India\u2019s strength lies in the manufacture of medium-quality and relatively high-fashion RMGs for niche segments of the domestic and export markets (e.g., containing garments of considerable embroidery) (USITC, 2004). Government may wish to consider job creation strategies as well as skills development of female garment workers in the districts facing threat of job losses within T&C sector. Indonesia Indonesia\u2019s T&C sector, the country\u2019s major contributor of non-oil and gas exports, performed better in 2005 relative to 2004. Disaggregated data for US and EU imports, which account for about two-thirds of Indonesia\u2019s T&C exports, show that the overall value and volume increased by 5.9 and 4.3 percent respectively (Table A-7). Indonesia\u2019s exports to the United States alone grew by 19 percent, while its exports to the EU dropped by 9.6 percent in terms of value and 6.8 percent in terms of volume. Based on value, data on US and EU imports show a steady gain in RMGs over time, while textiles have been declining after peaking in 1998 (Figure A-5). From 2004 to 2005, US and EU imports of Indonesian cotton yarn and 6 7 fabric (HS 52) have declined by nearly 20 percent in terms of value and 17 percent in terms of volume. On other hand, exports of man-made filaments (HS 54) and man-made staple fibres (HS 55), as well as RMGs (HS 61-62), were holding up well in the US and EU markets.

Disaggregated data on T&C exports from Indonesia are hard to obtain in a timely manner. At the aggregated level, one of the latest trade and investment reports shows that garment exports reached US$ 7.5 billion in the first 11 months of 2005, topping 2004\u2019s full-year record of US$ 7.3 billion (US Embassy Jakarta, 2006).

Suspicions over illegal trans-shipments of textiles from China to the United States via Indonesia may account for part of the gap between on-paper records and witnesses at the producers\u2019 level (Febrina, 2006). About 3.5 million people are now working in the T&C sector in Indonesia, directly and indirectly (US Embassy Jakarta, 2005). According to the 2004 National Labour Force Survey, 1.1 million people were officially employed in the sector in 2004 down from 1.4 million in the previous year (Hakim, 2005). In addition to factory workers, the T&C sector, especially RMGs, hires many informal workers. In Bali, sewing \u2013 the most labour-intensive and costliest part of garment production \u2013 is contracted out to village groups. The tasks of garment production, which require economies of scale \u2013 e.g., cutting the cloth, inspection and quality control of finished garments, and packing \u2013 are done centrally (Papanek, 2006). Partly because of this decentralised production system, hourly compensation of Indonesian garment workers are the lowest in the region at US$0.27 (Table 2). A survey conducted between April and July 2004 in Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in Jakarta and Tangerang (Banten province) found that the basic wages that female workers in the garment sector received were Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) 500,000-674,550 (US$55-74) per month, when the minimum wage was IDR671,250 (US$73.70) in Jakarta and IDR660,000 (US$72.50) in Tangerang (Sudwind and UCM Jakarta, 2004). With overtime, which exceeded the hours of legal limit, bonuses, allowances and other compensations, workers received IDR 600,000-1,200,000 (US$66-132) per month but when asked how much they need to meet daily needs workers answered IDR850,000-2,000,000 (US$93-220) or IDR1,000,000 (US$110) as basic wages or without overtime. The survey used a very small sample and covered only five garment factories in EPZs5, but it appears a worker\u2019s wage is definitely not enough to fulfill her daily needs. Table 2.

In 2005, it was already reported that several companies in Surakarat (central Java) had reduced their workforce due to the absence of orders and increasingly high production costs. The Indonesian Textile Association predicts that nearly 50 T&C companies are laying off more than 20,000 workers; job losses may reach 400,000 by June 2006 following the policy of the state power plant to impose a surcharge on companies using more than 50 percent of their installed capacity at peak time, together with wage rises effective in January 2006 (Textiles South East Asia, 2006). The minimum wage for Jakarta had increased by 15 percent reaching IDR819,000 (US$81) per month.

The Ministry of Industry argues that half of the machinery at Indonesia\u2019s textile plants is more than 15 years old, and in need of repairs and upgrades, causing inefficiency and lowering price competitiveness. In January 2006 a number of local banks agreed to provide US$100 million in the form of loans to companies in the weaving and spinning industries with good financial track records, with another US$250 million coming from the World Bank's private financing arm, the International Finance Corporation (The Jakarta Post, 2006b; 5 A sixth firm produces shoes. 8 9 US Embassy Jakarta, 2006). Yet the industry still needs to fill the huge gap of estimated industry restructuring costs of US$5 billion. Some producers disagree with the Government\u2019s proposal of replacing machinery by arguing that buyers have not complained about their productivity and product quality; rather, they say, what they lack is working capital to operate during the idle capacity.

However, the survey, conducted in 2002 and 2003, found that respondents in all Indonesian provinces and at different firm sizes perceived substantial increases in formal taxes and charges collected by local Governments after decentralisation (Ray, 2003). As for informal exactions (e.g., petty corruption), which are common in Asia-Pacific, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia identified illegal exactions as the most serious impediment within the business climate (Saxena and Wiebe, 2005: 29) (Table 3). Ray (2003) found that respondents at small Indonesian firms perceived slight improvement after decentralisation, but larger firms reported greater amounts, greater frequency and more exacting agencies/ individuals in informal exactions.

Nepal The quota system under the MFA helped Nepal to establish and expand its RMG industry. In the early 1980s Indian exporters, constrained by the lack of quotas, turned to Nepal and established export-oriented garment manufacture there. At the same time, Nepal also expanded its exports of carpets, in which the country traditionally has a competitive advantage. The T&C industry grew rapidly and became a major foreign currency earner. Exports of Nepalese carpets peaked in 1992-93 and have been declining since. The peak of RMG exports occurred in 2000. In two years, the export level fell by half; the value of US and EU T&C imports from Nepal plunged to US$180 million in 2002 from US$327 million in 2000. A key reason for this is said to be the preferential market access granted to sub-Saharan countries by the United States under AGOA in 2000. Uncertainties and apprehensions regarding the post-ATC scenario also seem to have contributed to the gradual decline in Nepalese garment exports between 2000 and 2004 (Dahal, 2006). Nepal\u2019s T&C exports were heavily concentrated in the US and EU markets, accounting for 98 percent of total T&C exports. The United States alone accounted for more than 90 percent of T&C exports in early 1990s, but this share has been declining as Nepalese exports declined after 2000. Nepal has been hit hard by the elimination of quotas. Table 4 shows that at the beginning of 2005, Nepal was exporting only one-third of its 2004 level. Shipments for export orders recovered in the last quarter of 2005, but not enough to make up for their loss during the rest of the year. Overall, the value and volume of Nepalese T&C exports plummeted by 22 percent and 28.5 percent respectively. US and EU import data, with a time lag of shipments, also show a 17.5 and 29.4 percent decline in Nepalese T&C products, in value and volume respectively, from 2004 to 2005 (Table A-9). Loss in the US market is more severe than in the EU; among knitted and woven RMGs from Nepal, the value of US imports dropped by a devastating 55.1 and 30.5 percent respectively. Table 4.

These two products also lost major shares in the US markets in 2005, by 57.5 and 59.7 percent respectively. Thus, three out of the top five commodities in the US market are those that: (1) face more competition after the eliminations of quotas; and (2) are also produced by other countries in the region. With this kind of competition, a small country like Nepal is pushed out of competition at the initial stage. Export orders came back to Nepal toward the end of 2005, partly because of safeguards on Chinese products; buyers are looking for alternative production sites again. In the medium- and long-term however, Nepal urgently needs to diversify its exportable products as well as markets. 10 11 Table 5.
