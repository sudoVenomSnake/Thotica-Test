nge the structure of government institutions, to not tolerate corrupt conduct and to allo- cate resources to investigate and prosecute corruption. How do we persuade governments to develop political will? First is through increasing media consciousness about what is corrupt conduct and how the criminal justice system should be strengthened. Second is through the involvement of civil society, which uses democratic means to pressure govern- ments to pass anti-corruption laws and code-of-conduct legislation. The other advantage of a greater civil society voice is that it creates public consensus about the need to resist corruption, which in turn persuades witnesses that testifying against corruption is an act of courage and a social responsibility. In a democ- racy \u2013 indeed, in any country \u2013 there can be no greater voice than that of the people. Furthermore, all state institutions in a democratic government must be strengthened. These institutions, when weak and corrupt in themselves, under- mine democracy. They undermine the rule of law. They perpetuate the false belief that all is acceptable. Corruption must be prosecuted by strong, well- resourced and independent law enforce- ment bodies. These institutions are too easy to manipulate and subvert, often in the name of freedom and democracy. Lastly, anti-corruption agencies must have an educative role. Cases must be fought in an open court, under the glare of public scrutiny. One glimpse of a cultural or government leader in the dock teaches society more about the rule of law than a series of law lectures at the university. In such cases, the media must inform, monitor and report with- out losing objectivity. Prosecuting corruption is difficult but the solutions are apparent to those who have been at the front lines and survived. A failure to achieve those solutions, or to work towards them, will result in the failure of the rule of law. The Hon. Madam Justice Shameem is a judge of the High Court of Fiji, a position she has held since 1999. She was Fiji\u2019s Director of Public Prosecutions from 1994 to 1999, after prosecuting for 10 years. She holds law degrees from Sussex University, and Cambridge University, and is a barrister of the Inner Temple, London. Her special interest lies in the law of fraud and corruption and in children\u2019s rights.

These include: Budgeting. To protect judicial independence, for instance, budgets for the courts could be a charged item to minimize political inter- ference. Independent judicial councils could also present budget proposals directly to parliament. Specifics would depend upon the local context. Contempt of court laws. In most jurisdictions disobedience of a court order constitutes contempt of court. But who will judge the judges or check their power? A possible way could be to codify laws on contempt or drop them altogether. Alternatively, a body could be set up for self-regulation by judges guided by bar associations, senior lawyers and former judges.30 Appointments. Judicial appointments should be made by independent bodies with repre- sentatives from the legal system as well as from civil society. In the Philippines, for example, under the Action Programme for Judicial Reform launched in 2000, several citizen watch groups were formed to monitor the selection of the chief justice, ombudsman and election commissioners. Salary and working conditions. Judges should have salaries that match their experience and qualifications and they should be offered all necessary protection for their security. To deal with case overload and provide better access at the lower level, the number of benches could be increased. Security of tenure. Judges should serve fixed terms, for ten or more years, and should not be removed for reasons other than profes- sional misconduct. Promotion. Systems of promotion should be merit-based, rewarding those who have upheld the integrity of the law. Education and training. This should allow judges to gain an understanding not just of the law but also of ethical standards and of ways to resist external influences. This would help reform the organizational culture within the judiciary. Random case assignment. Cases should be assigned on objective criteria and judges should not work in courts where they have ties with local politicians. Transparent procedures. Cases should gene- rally be heard in public and judges should be required to give written reasons for their judgements. Courts can also be subject to independent monitoring. In Cambodia, for Systems of promotion should be merit-based, rewarding those who have upheld the integrity of the law CHAPTER 2: JUSTICE FOR SALE JUSTICE FOR SALE JUSTICE FOR SALE JUSTICE FOR SALE JUSTICE FOR SALE 53 53 53 53 53 example, since 2003 the Center for Social Development has been monitoring court proceedings through its the Court Watch Project. Similarly, in the Philippines, under the Action Programme for Judicial Reform, the NGO Bantay Katarungan has been moni- toring court proceedings and the screening of applicants for positions in the regional trial courts and courts of appeals. As a result, between 1998 and 2001, the Supreme Court took disciplinary action against judges for graft and corruption.31 Use of information technology. Transparency can also be enhanced by making much greater use of information technology. The Malaysian Government, for example, has decided to expand a pilot e-judiciary project that provides the judiciary and government agencies such as the police with easier access to court documents. In addition to enhancing transparency and accountability, compu- terization of the courts should help in provid- ing speedy, high quality and cost-effective justice, while also reducing corruption and harassment. In India the introduction in 1998 of ICT in court management has reduced the huge backlog in the Supreme Court. Encouraged by this the Government now has a five-year plan to computerize the national justice delivery system. This will include computer rooms in all 2,500 court complexes, and official laptops and training for 15,000 judicial functionaries.32 Viet Nam too has been making greater use of ICT. In 2001 the Office of the National Assembly (ONA) compiled a database covering 12 legal areas, more than 250 legal documents and more than 1,300 questions into a CD-ROM called \u2018Your Lawyer\u2019. This has been distri- buted to delegates to the National Assembly in all 61 provinces, offices of people\u2019s councils, and media organizations, as well as being available on the internet. In addition, the ONA has developed \u2018Lawdata\u2019, a compre- hensive database collecting legal documents in Vietnamese and containing more than 11,000 documents which are updated frequently. But ultimately, governments need to demonstrate the political will to root out corrupt judges.

Cleaning up the justice section is thus an urgent priority. Unless countries are deter- mined to ensure that their systems of justice are clean and fair, they are unlikely to be able to uproot corruption from other sectors \u2013 since there will be much less prospect of successfully prosecuting offenders. Much of this will require intensive insti- tutional reform \u2013 to ensure that police forces and the judiciary operate efficiently, with adequate salaries, and systems of checks and balances, both official and unofficial, to ensure that justice is delivered in an open and transparent fashion. This is likely to require significant investment. Justice does not come cheap. But on the other hand it should not be for sale.

Developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region have been expanding health services, though the region as a whole still spends less as a percentage of GDP than other parts of the world In rich and poor countries alike, governments assume the major responsibility for ensuring the availability of key services. In some cases, they will do so by regulating provision by the private sector, but in many developing coun- tries governments take responsibility for delivering the services themselves through government departments or public corpora- tions. As a result they employ large numbers of people as teachers or doctors or nurses, for example, directly as civil servants or indi- rectly as workers in public corporations that supply electricity, water or sanitation ser- vices. Most of these employees do their jobs conscientiously, often in very difficult circum- stances, but others exploit their position to their own advantage \u2013 to extract \u2018rent\u2019 from their privileged positions.

In the Philippines, 30 per cent of drug outlets carry fake drugs. A 2004 survey in Southeast Asia showed that among 188 tablets presented as the anti- malarial drug artesunate, more than 50 per cent were found to be counterfeit. International health officials are also concerned that fake antibiotics and anti-retrovirals will soon be leaking into the market. In the case of anti-malarials insufficient quantities of active ingredients, besides failing to heal unsuspecting pa- tients, can also lead to drug resistance. Concern about the rising counterfeit drug trade is such that the World Health Organization last year established the International Medical Products Anti-counterfeiting Taskforce. One of its key objec- tives is to encourage countries to recognize counterfeiting drugs as a crime against human security and to introduce legislation that deals specifically with the issue. The Agency has also set up the \u2018Rapid Alert System\u2019 (RAS) \u2013 the world\u2019s first web-based system for tracking the activities of drug cheats, which transmits reports on the distribution of coun- terfeit medicine to National Health Authorities in the region.

Another outcome of corruption in drugs supply is the provision of low- quality drugs Grand Corruption and Procurement Grand Corruption and Procurement Grand Corruption and Procurement Grand Corruption and Procurement Grand Corruption and Procurement Health funds can disappear at the highest level of government. In some countries 10 per cent of the health budget can disappear en route from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Health, and more subsequently leaks out through various side channels, as the funds flow from national governments to provinces and to local hospitals and clinics.1 Much of this corruption is linked with procurement as companies pay bribes for public contracts for major construction projects. There can also be kickbacks from suppliers of equipment or of ongoing services, such as meals or cleaning. Health ministry officials and hospital administrators can inflate the cost many times, colluding with private suppliers to share the difference. In any health service the largest expendi- ture after personnel costs is for drugs. Asia is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets for pharmaceutical products and many mul- tinational drug companies are planning to expand their investments and operations in the region. Corruption can occur at all stages of drug development and supply from approval and registration, to selection and distribution. For the drug companies one of the main priorities is to ensure that their products are prescribed, so they are profli- gate with their \u2018perks\u2019 for doctors that could be seen as forms of corruption. They might, for example, sponsor doctors at conferences, underwrite symposia, or pay expenses for doctors and their spouses to attend drug launches abroad. They may also give free drug samples and offer expensive gifts such as watches, air-conditioners, laptops or even down-payments for new cars. Another outcome of corruption in drugs supply is the provision of low-quality drugs. In some countries around one-third of drugs are expired or counterfeit (Box 3.1). These BOX 3.1 COUNTERFEIT DRUGS IN ASIA According to the World Health Organization, a counterfeit drug is \u2018a medicine, which has been deliberately and fraudu- lently mislabelled with respect to identity and/or source. Coun- terfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient active ingredients or with fake packaging.\u2019 The counterfeit drug trade is of particular concern in Asia and the Pacific because of the volume of drugs produced in the region and high levels of corruption at many stages along the pharmaceuticals supply chain.

This may involve, for example, buying positions at the time of hiring, along with nepotism or politi- cal or military influence for postings.

Bribery Bribery Bribery Bribery Bribery Users of health services are more likely to encounter corruption as a demand for a bribe. Health workers frequently ask for \u2018extra pay- ments\u2019 to speed up admission to hospital or to provide a particular drug or treatment. Bribery is common throughout the region, but particularly high in South Asia, as is evident from Figure 3.1. One survey of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka found that health workers often demanded bribes for admission to hospital, to provide a bed, or to give subsi- dized medications.2 In one Indian city, a social audit in the form of citizen report cards revealed that more than half of the respon- dents had paid bribes in government hospi- tals. Among people using hospitals in small cities the proportion paying bribes rose to almost 90 per cent. In maternity hospitals mothers even had to bribe the nurses in order to see their babies.3 Within some countries in South-East Asia, the proportion of people paying bribes tends to be lower perhaps because more people get their treatment in the private sector.4 These extra payments have now become so institutionalized that many people have come to accept them and even regard them as useful. In countries where the quality of pub- lic sector care is weak, they can see these informal fees as a form, albeit unreliable, of quality assurance. They regard health as so important that it is worth almost any price to get the best outcome. This is particularly the case for in-patient treatment, for which they have fewer choices: concerned about greater risk from invasive or intensive procedures ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 60 60 60 60 60 What can be done to curb this activity? First, steps will have to be taken to reduce the vulnerability of the drug-con- trolling agencies. Checks and balances should be enforced to ensure their integrity and neutrality, as well as making sure that these offices are adequately staffed. Additionally, ethical committees in hospitals should be streamlined and mecha- nisms should be in place to ensure that they implement the rules on conflict of interest. Secondly, the only training many doctors have on conduct- ing trials comes from the company in question or a contracted research organization, which may include trips abroad and other benefits.

At a low level this is common in most working environments and is usually more an issue of management failure. But at higher levels, and in more sys- tematic forms, this can be considered corrup- tion, since health workers are abusing their position by taking salaries while not showing up for work. Across the region reported absenteeism rates cluster around 35 per cent to 40 per cent and tend to be higher for doctors and nurses than for other health workers. In one survey from Rajasthan in India nurses were to be found in their posts in villages only 12 per cent of the time.6 Rates of absenteeism are also typically higher in rural areas, not only because of the lack of supervision but also because staff find it more difficult to get to work or are discouraged by the prospect of using clinics that lack equip- ment or drugs or are in a poor state of repair. The most extreme absenteeism takes the form of \u2018ghost workers\u2019. These are fictitious staff whose salaries are paid into the accounts of public officials. Grand corruption and many forms of petty corruption, as in other parts of public service, are often a reflection less of need than of greed. But there are other contributing factors. One is that health services are generally underfunded, so hospitals and health centres may feel the need to make charges just to cover the costs that are not being met by central government (Box 3.2). Since these payments are unofficial, however, they are unlikely to be accounted for fully and in institutions where management is weak will sustain an atmosphere where unofficial payments and corruption seem normal. BOX 3.2 DRUG EXPERIMENTATION Transnational pharmaceutical companies are providing much wanted capital investments but also challenging the region to improve its systems of regulation. In most countries the pharmaceutical regulatory bodies are understaffed and unable to cope with the new industry of drug testing. This has created much room for corruption. In India, for example, clinical tests have to be authorized by the ethical committee of the hospital that will carry out the trial and by the Drugs Controller General, which is a part of the Indian health ministry. This is, however, mainly a paperwork check. Random inquiries have found that some patients are not even aware that they are being experimented on. Hospitals are often in dire need of funds and for the sums offered by the pharmaceutical companies are willing to cut corners. In most cases the companies refer to written consent from patients or relatives, however interviews have shown that many people just accept what the doctor recommends, without understanding the implications. Additionally, even when these test drugs prove to be efficient most of the patients they are being tested on have to revert to their old drugs after the test period is over, because they cannot afford the new ones.

Some cross- national studies have indeed suggested that in countries where levels of corruption are higher some health inputs such as immuniza- tion are lower. This could be because vaccines or other supplies are being stolen or because the health workers are absent from their posts. Immunization rates may also be lower because corrupt officials have an interest in directing investment towards expensive curative care which offers greater opportuni- ties for rent-seeking \u2013 diverting funds from immunization programmes or other forms of primary health care. These cross-national comparisons have been supported by national studies.7 One study from a country in South-East Asia estimated that a 10 per cent increase in corruption, as measured by the perceptions of public officials as well as of service users, reduced the immunization rate by 10 per cent to 20 per cent and also the odds of complet- ing vaccination by four times. The same increase in corruption increased the waiting time in public health clinics by as much as 30 per cent and decreased user satisfaction by 30 per cent. This study also highlighted an interesting difference between urban and rural areas. In the urban areas, as corruption increased, households were more likely to be deflected to private providers.

A global study of 89 countries found that a two-point change in the corrup- tion rating, as measured by the World Bank control of corruption index, was associated with a halving of child mortality.9 Indeed even controlling for many other factors that would also reduce the death rate, such as per capita income, the level of female education, public health spending, the dependency ratio and the extent of urbanization, corruption still had a significant impact on child mortality. Of course not all of this corruption will be in health services. Child mortality, for example, will be affected by the availability of clean water and good sanitation, so corruption in these services too is likely to damage children\u2019s health. Hospitals often run short of supplies as a result of mismanagement, lack of funds and negligence, but this is exacerbated by corrup- tion. Some users may provide their own linen or food as a cultural preference, but they can also find themselves buying bandages, syringes and medicines \u2013 a significant burden for the poor. Bribery and the need to make up for miss- ing supplies inevitably discriminate against the poor. This is not because they have to pay more. Indeed in absolute terms it seems that compared with \u2018richer customers\u2019 they pay around 40 per cent less.10 However, these lower payments still represent a far higher share of household income, and if the poor pay less they may also get a lower quality service; those who can pay more will be able to jump queues and get preferential treatment in public hospitals. And when public health services are undermined by corruption the richer households have the option of paying for private care.

Examples from action around the region include: Reducing Informal Payments in Cambodia. In Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia in 1996, the monthly revenue from informal payments was estimated at $13,750 \u2013 about five times the monthly hospital payroll and about 45 per cent of the total budget. Since then the hospital has reformed the way it works. It has, for example, replaced informal payments with formal user fees and directs the revenue from these to pay bonuses for staff. Even so, patients are now paying less in official fees than they did in informal charges, and know too that the fees will be consistent and predictable. This has transformed the operation of the hospital, which treats many more people at a lower cost.11 Radio power in India. The radio programme \u2018To be Alive\u2019 is broadcast on state radio in the poor rural region of Kutch in Gujarat province. This is made by semi-literate rural people trained by a human rights organiza- tion to be amateur radio reporters. Often a whole team of reporters will carry out \u2018radio raids\u2019. They directed one, for example, at a doctor who was charging women for deliver- ing babies at a community health centre \u2013 a service which was supposed to be free for the poor. This sparked a government inquiry into illegal charging at primary health centres across the country.12 Removing fake drugs in Mekong countries. In 2003 in the Mekong subregion \u2013 Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunan Province of China \u2013 it was found that all coun- tries were using substandard or fake antimalarials. With the combined support of the US Pharmacopeia Drug Quality and Information Programme, USAID, WHO, and national and local governments, the regula- tory authorities in all these countries have been improving communications and coopera- tion across borders, so they have been able to notify each other of the circulation of fake drugs and remove them more quickly from all outlets.13 New prescriptions in China.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf1c9bce-6e83-4976-b19c-d95c02c810c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf1c9bce-6e83-4976-b19c-d95c02c810c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35b35950be7af36ad027777e04f2485ec83b2a9be629460f8b788261e2d6d601"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b8815d0-b16a-4cd2-aa12-eda178ce31ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "546bd57c3c574a98f477e0e8f1ff201500d46b48946e07099aa0b29e8df15bf1"}}, "hash": "5f5a523ee90c5d084d1eb8d8a61b0c6b5d4e48af1a7bf54a43881060003827fe", "text": "In June 2006, China\u2019s legislature adopted the sixth Amend- ment to the Criminal Law, stipulating that staff members of schools and hospitals will face criminal penalties if they seek bribes or receive kickbacks", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b853903c-8c22-445a-935c-d5042522dc61": {"__data__": {"id_": "b853903c-8c22-445a-935c-d5042522dc61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77ae843894aedd56ef03c83ee0be24c2742757a620da8b2fb96fd3d31634f525"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bb64b40-690d-439d-b4fb-7d256436b76a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4f5fdbbd5e8a70928228d3d8dd7516cf856f80d0774917c5ade66a35c5e70a4"}}, "hash": "0b8d1a67a11b983227418da0f1e0458ee66f32ef40cf0d3c6c0914801884be3a", "text": "or commissions. The former Commissioner of China\u2019s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) was subse- quently convicted for accepting more than $850,000 in bribes. The government has launched a large-scale investigation among the SFDA staff who are possibly involved in this case. All drug licences will be re-issued. The Ministry of Public Health now requires hospitals to separate the procurement of drugs from the writing of prescriptions so that neither hospitals nor doctors benefit from prescribing particular drugs.14 Education Services Education Services Education Services Education Services Education Services Throughout the Asia-Pacific region, education typically forms a large part of the public sector, consuming about 20\u201330 per cent of the national budget and employing a substantial proportion of each country\u2019s civil servants.15 Since most of these have direct contact with the general public, it is not surprising that education services are vulnerable to corrup- tion. Moreover, with so many people involved there are often strong vested interests that will resist attempts at reform. Unlike other social services, corruption in education can also affect behaviour and per- ceptions of future generations.

Some of the types of corruption prevalent in education systems in Asia and the Pacific are summarized in Table 3.2. Procurement Procurement Procurement Procurement Procurement Corruption in the procurement of material and labour for school construction can in- crease costs between two and eight times, as funds for school buildings are siphoned off by corrupt officials.16 It also reduces the quality of construction since contractors who pay bribes to get contracts try to offset some of the costs by using sub-standard materials. This can have tragic outcomes. Many coun- tries in the region are vulnerable to earth- quakes which have often laid waste to hundreds of schools, burying children within them. Although schools are not usually designed to be earthquake-proof they should provide at least some level of security, rather than instantly crumbling at the onset of an earthquake. Corruption can exist in the purchase of textbooks, desks, blackboards, and other supplies, as well as in contracts for cleaning services and meals. Supplies and funds are frequently misappropriated. In one province in Pakistan a social audit estimated that only 16 per cent of textbooks procured by the government reached the intended children.17 In Bangladesh in 2001, 25 million secondary level children started the school year without textbooks and when the books were finally delivered they were found to be full of errors.18 Ghosts and Absentees Ghosts and Absentees Ghosts and Absentees Ghosts and Absentees Ghosts and Absentees In many countries corruption is widespread in the hiring of teachers, which in the most extreme form, results in the recruitment of \u2018ghost teachers\u2019 or even in creation of entire \u2018ghost institutions\u2019 \u2013 with the allocated salaries and other expenses going into the pockets of corrupt officials. A related problem is teacher absenteeism. Surveys across the region show this to range from 16 per cent to 25 per cent in primary schools.19 Even so, teachers are almost never fired. Indeed since they are rarely disciplined even for repeated absence, it is impressive that there are so many dedicated teachers who work conscientiously. Bribes and Unauthorized Fees Bribes and Unauthorized Fees Bribes and Unauthorized Fees Bribes and Unauthorized Fees Bribes and Unauthorized Fees Just as families may need to pay bribes to get into hospitals, they may also have to pay bribes to get their children admitted to schools.

ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 64 64 64 64 64 Many see education as one of the few possible ways out of poverty and go out of their way to secure the necessary funds to put their children through school principals. At the higher education level the national government audited 18 institutions in 2003 and found that 15 per cent of all charges were illegal.20 While similar examples can be provided from other countries, it seemed that the main causes of corruption were the lack of accountability, low salaries and the monopoly of power, compounded by the shortage of specific guidelines or auditing systems. This problem is also common in South Asia where students are often required to make unofficial payments for admission to schools, for books, sporting or religious events, examinations, or promotion to higher classes. Bribes for tuition or a better grade may also be extorted in the form of sexual exploi- tation. Educators abusing their positions in this way betray the trust of the community, exposing children to illegal and unethical practices. This can affect boys, particularly at an early age, but girls may be more vulner- able since they are less able to challenge such abuse. Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Impact on the Poor Corruption reduces the funds available for education and lowers the quality.21 Siphon- ing off funds robs schools and pupils of equip- ment and facilities. The quality of teaching also suffers if there is corruption in recruit- ment or promotion or if teachers are fre- quently absent or make less effort in schools because they want to work as private tutors teaching some of the same pupils (Box 3.3). Studies have shown that higher levels of corruption are correlated with lower school enrolment and higher rates of repetition and dropout and illiteracy.22 Poor families also suffer if they have to pay bribes. Many see education as one of the few possible ways out of poverty and go out of their way to secure the necessary funds to put their children through school, often working at several jobs. If they cannot raise the funds their children are less likely to enrol or may subsequently drop-out. There are also long-term social costs. If richer people can buy admission to higher education, better exam results, or degrees, this blocks key routes of social mobility. At the same time, entire generations of youth are being mis-educated \u2013 to believe that personal success comes not through merit and hard work, but through favouritism, bribery and fraud. Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Education Services Education Services Education Services Education Services Education Services Governments urgently need to address cor- ruption in education. Otherwise schools will continue to transmit a culture of corruption to succeeding generations, undermining all other anti-corruption initiatives. Thus far, however, few countries in the region have been able to approach the issue in a comprehensive and effective manner. A number of initiatives BOX 3.3 CORRUPTION IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN BANGLADESH Bangladesh has a large number of private schools which receive Govern- ment support. Their interactions with the Government have provided numerous opportunities for corruption. First, in order to receive finan- cial assistance to pay the salary of school teachers, a private school has to renew its registration each year which means bribing the concerned officials. They might pay for this by requesting a contribution from teach- ers or by paying them less or by registering a non-existent teacher and passing the corresponding sum back to the official. A school that fails to make the payment is likely to find that their application will be lost or misplaced. Throughout the school year, the schools are also made to pay bribes to inspection officers and to get students registered for exams. The teachers themselves will also have to pay to get a job in a private school. First they need to \u2018manage\u2019 the school\u2019s managing committee and make a contribution to the district education officer. They will also need to pay to get enrolled in the monthly pay roll or if they want a promotion. The students are also drawn into the corruption cycle.

Practice shows that governments can tackle corruption in educa- tion through much closer supervision and by allowing communities more control over schools, through parent\u2013teacher associations and other local organizations (Box 3.4). Some successful initiatives include: Counting books in the Philippines. Textbook procurement and delivery in the Philippines has long been plagued by theft, patronage and favouritism. To tackle this, one of the country\u2019s best-known anti-corruption advo- cacy groups, Transparent Accountable Governance (TAG), in 2004 organized Book Count 2, bringing together a range of civil society groups, from NGOs to churches to Girl and Boy Scout groups, to monitor the delivery of books all over the Philippines. TAG is a joint project of the Makati Business Club, the Philippines Center for Investigative Journalism, the Philippines Center for Policy Studies, and Social Weather Stations, with funding provided by USAID, through a part- nership with the Asia Foundation.23 Digital attendance in India. Most rural schools in Rajasthan have only one teacher, so when the teacher is absent, children miss an entire day of school. Because the villages are often remote it is difficult to monitor atten- dance and the absentee rate has been over 40 per cent. The NGO Seva Mandir came up with a novel solution \u2013 requiring teachers to take a photo of themselves with the students at the beginning and end of each school day using cameras with tamper-proof date and time functions. They randomly selected 60 to serve as treatment schools and another 60 as a control group. Teachers received a salary of about $22 if they were present for at least 21 days in a month and a bonus of $1 for each additional day but were penalized $1 for each day they were absent. In the control schools, teachers simply received a monthly salary of $22 but were reminded that they could be fired for poor attendance and warned that each month there would be unannounced school visits. The results were striking. The schools with cameras made dramatic improvements and increased the number of child-days taught per month by one-third. The experiment was also cost-effective: average salaries in both groups were similar though this did not include the costs of cameras and programme administration \u2013 annually around $6 per child.24 Community management in Indonesia. In some schools in Indonesia corruption in the man- agement of funds has been minimized by the involvement of parent\u2019s associations which decide on the use of these funds and monitor them to ensure that they reach their intended destination. At the beginning of the school year, school officials meet with representa- tives of the parent\u2019s association to agree on an annual plan, then during the years provide them with a detailed accounting of BOX 3.4 EDUCATION AS A SOLUTION Education is frequently a site of corruption but can also offer solutions. A number of countries in the region, from Mongolia to Papua New Guinea, have introduced some form of anti-corruption education provid- ing children with the information and knowledge to take a stand on corruption for the future; this also partly contains the seeds of how corruption can be countered. Public education is an important part of Hong Kong\u2019s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). The Community Relations Department aims to change public attitudes towards corruption. The main targets, however, are young people who are reached through schools. From an early age children are being exposed to anti-corruption and morality lessons. ICAC also organizes a number of social events such as concerts and sports targeting youth. Effective moral education pro- grammes can help young people internalize the conviction that corruption is wrong and unacceptable. Ultimately fighting corruption should rely less on external controls and deterrents and more on self- motivation and self-discipline.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63a64af5-ae16-487b-bf0f-8efdd3ced8ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "63a64af5-ae16-487b-bf0f-8efdd3ced8ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "869443d2929d21a122bc6ed7f0ec7cba7efdfd47fb6778b9e64fe62e1107e78d"}, "2": {"node_id": "53a2a184-54a2-482b-b679-e41c7256f720", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "97a07c586942dc2e4730c96ccb866d805fb404756cf644367201e2171a166caa"}}, "hash": "7192a831c60ac91cd2109fafd06e735cbe99b80f62ef6306eb97297626c18db6", "text": "Source: http://www.icac.org.hk/eng/main/index.html ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 66 66 66 66 66 expenditures.

Some of the teachers were displaced, but others also used the earthquake as an excuse for absenteeism. A local NGO managed, however, to get a num- ber of schools functioning again by mobilizing local opinion. The NGO contacted leaders such as imams and elected representatives and encouraged them to put pressure on teachers. The NGO also organized workshops with teachers, local counsellors and clerics where they emphasized social and religious responsibilities for education and children\u2019s rights. Almost all the teachers participated in the workshops, and within two months of the earthquake most primary schools in the district were functioning again.26 Such examples should however only be considered as an indication of what is possible. What works in one context may not work in another. Some countries have, for example, had good experiences with decen- tralization but in others this has merely shifted corruption from one level of adminis- tration to another. No single intervention will be sufficient in itself, rather the more success- ful approaches have combined a comprehen- sive understanding of the problem with incentives, supervision, sanctions and partici- pation.27 Public Utilities Public Utilities Public Utilities Public Utilities Public Utilities Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have made progress in delivering essential services, particularly water; around 80 per cent of the population now have access to improved water supplies. Progress in sanitation has been slower: indeed South Asia\u2019s sanitation coverage, at only 37 per cent, is among the lowest in the world. As this implies, even for water many millions of people are still un- served. In 2004, more than 650 million people lacked access to safe water supplies, and almost two billion to safe sanitation.28 The situation is worse in the rural areas, and for the poorest families. Electricity supplies too can be erratic: many parts of the region suffer from low voltage operations or fre- quent power outages. Even these data overestimate access to services since the quality is often low. Water supplies, for example, can be intermittent and polluted by faeces from leaking septic tanks. This has serious implications. Each year millions of children die as a result of diar- rhoea and other diseases caused by unclean water and poor sanitation, compounded by erratic power supplies to health facilities. For businesses and households that rely on public grids, inadequate power supplies severely limit the technology they can use and their range and duration of economic activities. Grand Corruption in Infrastructure Grand Corruption in Infrastructure Grand Corruption in Infrastructure Grand Corruption in Infrastructure Grand Corruption in Infrastructure One of the main causes of low coverage and poor quality services is underinvestment. Extending water, sanitation and electricity coverage is expensive, requiring large-scale upfront investment for basic infrastructure. Much of this is being dissipated through corruption.29 Across the region the standard kickback for infrastructure projects is often quoted as 10 per cent of the value of the con- tract though in some countries it is thought to be 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Corruption can emerge through the whole cycle from project selection to subsequent repairs (Box 3.5).

Project selection Corruption can negatively affect the selection of projects. For example, corruption can divert resources away from social sectors toward defence and major infrastructure projects Corruption may also encourage the selection of uneconomi- cal projects because of opportunities for financial kickbacks and political patronage Planning stages Projects can be used as vote winners or opportunities for personal gain rather than on the basis of priority or avail- ability of financial resources Planning in favour of high value infrastructure (white elephant projects) and against the interest of the poor Project requirements may be overstated or tailored to fit one specific bidder When firms bidding for contracts offer \u2018training\u2019 or \u2018enter- tainment\u2019 to officials Inspection stages Weak oversight and supervision mechanisms that prevent the detection of fraud and corruption Kickbacks can be given to persuade inspectors to turn a blind eye to slow implementation of projects, unfulfilled contract requirements, and other instances of malpractice Mutually corrupt relations among construction companies, inspection teams and government authorities continued, with inspectors overlooking the improper construction Design Project design or timing of the project might be manipu- lated to benefit particular suppliers, consultants, contrac- tors and other private parties Bribes for favourable environmental impact assessment/ planning proposal/approval Over designed and overpriced projects can increase poten- tial corrupt earnings during implementation Kickbacks to government officials for rapid privatizations of utilities Bid and contract signing stage Political parties levy large rents on international businesses in return for government contracts Kickbacks for construction and supply contracts Officials receive excessive \u2018hospitality\u2019 from contractors and benefits in kind Inadequate advertising of tender Excessively short bidding time Construction Provision of equipment or goods of lower than specified ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 68 68 68 68 68 One contractor in South Asia described the process. Contractors, he said, have to pay at every stage. This starts with basic informa- tion. Public authorities have been known to publish advertisements for new tenders in obscure newspapers, particularly during festival times, so that potential bidders are unlikely to see them. Instead officials expect contractors to pay to be informed. Having dis- covered the project and made a bid, the con- tractor will then have to bribe the executive engineer to ensure that the bid is successful. When work has been completed the contrac- tor will need to pay the inspecting engineer for a good report. After completing the work some companies put khushi kora money into the budget as incidental costs (bribes are known as khushi kora or \u2018making happy\u2019. The term comes from the promise \u2018do the work we will make you happy later\u2019). The need to pay bribes to the authorities and mastans means that the contractors are obliged to engage in dui numbari kaj (illegal activities).30 Nevertheless, much of the blame lies with construction companies themselves which participate actively in all these activities, indeed frequently taking the initiative. They are well versed in the ways of colluding with other bidders or with officials in executing agencies, governments and financing agencies. Even before there is a proposal a contractor with insider connections can influence a contract\u2019s identification and creation as well as its specification, tender conditions, prepa- ration and design. Contractors also collude in tendering and bidding. A group of contractors will often put in coordinated bids in such a manner that their preferred candidate will win \u2013 on the understanding that the others will be desig- nated as sub-contractors or as winners for future projects. In many cases, officials are aware of the bid rigging. When this happens, the project costs include the \u2018grease money\u2019 to be paid by the pre-agreed winner, and a certain percentage goes to the agency\u2019s personnel.

The ensuing losses can be huge. It has been estimated that if the water sector operated in a transparent fashion, and corruption were eliminated, 20 per cent to 70 per cent of resources could be saved. The World Bank suggests that 20 per cent to 40 per cent of water sector finances are lost to dishonest and corrupt practices.31 For example, research in India into a Water and Sewerage Board found corruption in the following aspects of service delivery: Bulk water supply. The quantity of water to be supplied to residential, commercial or indus- trial units is under the control of a \u2018key-man\u2019 or \u2018line-man\u2019 who regulates the valves.

Local officials can also collude with owners of water lorries to supply water through lorries rather than through municipal pipes, enriching both ve- hicle owners and themselves in the process. Another technique is to bribe the water and sewerage board to tap directly into the main line and then supply water by donkey cart to villages and settlements. Accounts and recoveries. Officials may inten- tionally issue incorrect high bills to consum- ers in order to receive a bribe to correct the bill \u2013 blatant blackmail that can only be bypassed by influential people. Officials may also do the reverse \u2013 under-bill in return for a bribe or favour. Purchases. Staff commonly accept commission payments or kickbacks for purchases of everything \u2013 from heavy machinery to minor fixtures. Officials can, for example, raise a fake request for a purchase, then forge an entry in the stock register to say that the components have been supplied by colluding with a contractor who then issues a corre- sponding invoice, the proceeds of which he shares with the officials. This activity is also common in the maintenance of municipal vehicles, with officials paying fake bills for maintenance and fuel. New connections. Getting a connection is often designed intentionally as a very complicated process, so consumers may find it quicker to apply through a middle man, who may be an approved contractor or someone from the de- partment. As well as taking his own commis- sion, this person knows who to pay and how much, they may also provide a higher-volume connection at the price of a lower-volume one. One of the most high-profile cases of dubious provision of power supplies occurred in 1990 in the state of Maharashtra in India. A TNC attempted to supply power to the state through a subsidiary. This was achieved through secret negotiations that violated India\u2019s Electricity Supply Act. The project faced corruption allegations from its early stages. During subsequent litigation, the High Court of the state of Maharashtra observed that the state committee involved in the rene- gotiation \u2018forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency\u2019.

When a cus- tomer of Delhi Vidyut Board got an inflated electricity bill, a Parivartan volunteer accompanied him to the offices, but each time the officer would politely apologise for the delay and seek more time. On his final visit, the volunteer replied, \u2018Sir, I am not in a hurry. I have told my people at home that I will not be back for a week.\u2019 The officer replied, \u2018But I have to go now for a meeting with my Chief Engineer that will last till late in the evening.\u2019 The volunteer said, \u2018Sir, please don\u2019t worry.

Source: http://www.parivartan.com/satyagraha.asp In most cities in the Asia-Pacific region, utilities and services are considered the domain of government, but in some cases the utilities have been privatized. Faced with the deteriora- tion of public services, some metropolitan authorities have argued that services should be priced and paid for according to their value. International financial institutions and aid agencies have supported this view and have advocated the use of privatization schemes. Metropolitan infrastructure and services often require massive capital investments. These lumpy capital requirements can be met by public-private partnerships that may also increase managerial efficiency and allow the application of cutting-edge technological approaches. In 1997, the ownership and management of the Jakarta Raya and Metro Manila waterworks and sewerage system were transferred to joint consortia made up of international and domestic concessionaires. In both cities, the privatization initially resulted in considerable improvements. In Metro Manila, the concessionaires installed 238,000 new water con- nections, 128,000 of which were in urban poor communities.

Bangladesh offers a recent example. The current Interim Government says that one of the primary objectives of its administration is to tackle corruption. It has implemented far reaching and effective measures to prevent, identify and punish corrupt acts. However this has inadvertently worsened the situation of the poor since businesses are finally paying taxes on their products and passing these price increases to consumers. As a result there have been dramatic increases in the price of fish and rice, which are staples of the Bangladeshi diet. Many business leaders report that pro- cedures that used to require merely a bribe or a quick call to the right contact, now demand paperwork in triplicate with multiple rounds of approvals. Thus although citizens have welcomed the tough stance on corruption this support could be eroded by rising prices.36 For electricity supplies, much of the corruption is linked to illegal connections 8.

The customer pays a security deposit through an approved bank, which is the official fee. 13. The government electric inspector issues a test form, for which there is a charge. 14. When the contractor has completed the work and all meters have been installed the operations department energizes the line after payment of a bribe. In total, getting a permanent electricity connection for a medium-sized complex requires over $4,000 \u2013 a significant proportion of which is bribes. Source: Sohail (ed.) 2007. Although citizens have welcomed the tough stance on corruption this support could be eroded by rising prices from the main line. Since this can be detected quite easily, a middleman is needed to encour- age the electricity department inspector to turn a blind eye. In some areas almost all these inspectors are corrupt. They may take small payments but these can soon add up. In some countries around half the power dis- appears in the form of \u2018system losses\u2019. One survey of power supplies in India found that in the previous year 12 per cent of households had paid bribes to obtain services; of these, more than one-third had paid money to a line- men, while one-quarter had paid money to an agent or middleman37 (Box 3.8). Problems of corruption can also occur when the utilities are privately run though the contract may be obtained with a certain amount of \u2018generosity\u2019. The utilities company may, for example, invite municipal staff to visit its headquarters, paying for both the ticket and stay. Nevertheless overall corrup- tion tends to be lower. The cities of Kolkata and Mumbai in India, for example, have had BOX 3.8 THE TORTUOUS PROCESS FOR GETTING AN ELECTRICITY CONNECTION In South Asia, the process of obtaining a permanent elec- tricity connection for a new building or complex can involve a long and expensive series of steps: 1. The customer submits an application to the electric supply corporation through an approved contractor. She or he must also submit to the planning department copies of the site plan of the plot, the approved plan of the build- ing, the National Identity Card of the plot owner, the lease of the plot and sale deed for the plot along with an agreement to pay for the connection. 2. The planning department issues a load regularization agreement (LRA) in favour of the land owner. 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5317660e-f624-4b2d-bce4-989ee761cc8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5317660e-f624-4b2d-bce4-989ee761cc8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33279728833344c4531a20405097f8be8a0a71fbfb9832622e962ef300c2bfc4"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb199ac7-ce44-4f2b-a745-a041620cfdc3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9af47e3d5d7a90f82ee66e2855f499b6e5dcef881c06ddcf1a60db8fcf1f79d2"}}, "hash": "9682a3912eb4ac5022c0a21370db3a731b66c64c3aa73691394e3945232b7709", "text": "The customer sends an LRA to the chief engineer of the electric supply corporation for approval.

Even so, a review of the perfor- mance of the utilities conducted by the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission in 2005 showed that the company was still losing some $240 million per year as a result of corruption, mainly from stolen electricity and also from inadequate metering, billing and collection.39 The Costs for W The Costs for W The Costs for W The Costs for W The Costs for Water and ater and ater and ater and ater and Electricity Supplie Electricity Supplie Electricity Supplie Electricity Supplie Electricity Suppliesssss Corruption thus costs the water and electric- ity sectors millions of dollars every year, diminishing a country\u2019s prospects for provid- ing services for all. Globally it is estimated that corruption in the water sector absorbs 20 per cent to 40 per cent of all funds,40 while corruption and theft in the electricity sector each year costs another $40 billion.41 Losses on this scale cause significant damage: Inefficiency. Corruption seriously undermines the performance and effectiveness of both public and private sectors, discouraging the investment urgently needed to improve supplies. In one major city in the region it has been alleged that the public utility held back on improving water supplies in the areas supplied through kiosks or hydrants, for fear of losing the side payments that the hydrant operators paid to utility officials.42 The operators of water tankers are often controlled by powerful mafias that capitalize on inept water distribution systems and have effectively privatized the supply: after paying corrupt officials to turn a blind eye, they sell the water to hotels and other businesses.43 Warped distribution. Corruption skews deci- sions on who is likely to get services. Residen- tial suburbs, for example, can be left without water because the supply has been siphoned off to service the farm of a prominent politician. Capital-intensive investment. Corruption also biases investment towards large new infra- structure projects and away from smaller scale but less lucrative investment in the re- habilitation of systems or in improving op- eration and maintenance. Weak finances. Corruption undermines the long-term financial stability of utilities and thus their ability to offer reliable services to a wider population, while also diverting govern- ment revenues that could be used to improve water supply and other services.44 Environmental damage. Corruption con- strains overall water-resource management by encouraging inefficient use of freshwater or over-extraction of ground and surface water. Public health. Reducing supplies of drinking water directly undermines public health, and more so for the poor. Corruption in utility services can also undermine standards of health.

Effects on Poor People Effects on Poor People Effects on Poor People Effects on Poor People Effects on Poor People The most damaging effect is on the lives of poor people through high prices. As one consumer said to a researcher for this report: \u2018It is really tough for a day labourer to pay a high price for electricity and water. You know it is not possible to get electricity and water connections without bribes or extra money. So our budget is strained and we cannot afford to meet our needs. We cannot save any- thing for our future either.\u2019 Others said that they had been deprived of basic foodstuffs, medical facilities, incurred business losses and interrupted children\u2019s education because they had to spend money on bribes. In these circumstances many poor people feel power- less and helpless.46 Although corruption affects both sexes, it can present particular difficulties for women-headed households. Service providers may, for example, be more inclined to demand a bribe from women whom they consider to be more susceptible to coercion, violence or threats. Women are also at risk of sexual harassment, women-headed and other poorer households are likely to be less aware of where to file a complaint. For the poorest people, even low-quality services tainted by corruption are, of course, better than nothing. So any sudden enthu- siasm for clamping down on corruption at the consumer end \u2013 by cutting off illegal connec- tions in slum areas, for example \u2013 would leave them with no services at all. Uprooting Corruption in Utilities Uprooting Corruption in Utilities Uprooting Corruption in Utilities Uprooting Corruption in Utilities Uprooting Corruption in Utilities Many of the strategies for uprooting corrup- tion involve greater investment in services to minimize the shortages that encourage people to pay bribes. Public corporations need to im- prove standards of management and operate in a more transparent fashion. But consum- ers too can take direct action to get better services. Some examples from around the region including in sanitation (Box 3.9): A single window cell in India. At the end of the 1990s the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board introduced a number of customer-focused service delivery reforms. This included a process of consoli- dated applications for new connections \u2013 pre- viously a major source of corruption. Rather than filing an application in their local district office, customers now go to the Board\u2019s headquarters to a \u2018Single Window Cell\u2019 (SWC) which manages all the related activities, such as obtaining a road-cutting permit or land surveying. The Board pub- lishes the fee schedule for various plot and connection sizes in its office and in the press, thus reducing the opportunities for staff to levy excess charges. The process has been designed as a one-visit operation so the customer rarely leaves the SWC without an \u2018application token number\u2019, the equivalent of a receipt for acceptance of the application.

Al- though the tariffs were increased, these were used to subsidize connections and bills for the poorest people. Automated billing and collec- tion systems have replaced the often corrupt bill collectors. Inspection teams penalize those with illegal connections, which encourages people to report them. Customer service has also been improved with a free phone number and a 24-hour repair team for water leakages. Any staff associated with illegal connections are removed or punished immediately. More importantly, staff are not seen as a source of the problem but as a major part of the solution.

Even in household sanitation projects, there are opportunities for corruption when the government offers subsidies for latrine construction. Corrupt officials can direct these subsidies to relatively less poor families. Contractors brought in to do the work can over charge for construction, or use cement that contains too much sand. It is estimated that 20 per cent to 30 per cent of funds and materials are diverted from sanitation programmes due to corruption and dishonesty. One example of efforts to reduce this type of corruption comes from Kerala in India. In 2003, the Socio-Economic Units Staff are not seen as a source of the problem but as a major part of the solution sanitation and electricity services. This process in turn fuelled citizens\u2019 mistrust of Government and politics. In response, the Government in 1999 embarked on a massive national reconstruction process which in- cluded devolving powers to the grass roots, restructuring federal and provincial adminis- trations and reforming the civil service. As part of this the Government also introduced, along with direct involvement of the benefi- ciaries, a system of social audits to evaluate the outcomes. The government hoped that these audits would increase transparency and help reduce some of the mistrust while also monitoring the delivery of services. Donors too were attracted by these audits which would help measure the impact of their support programmes.47 Cleaner water supplies in Cambodia. The Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority has improved hugely over the last decade with the coverage in the city increasing from 25 per cent to 90 per cent. Between 1999 and 2006, the number of household connections Foundation (SEUF), a non-profit organization, worked together with local governments to carry out a subsidized sanitation programme, serving poor families. This ensured that local people understood the system which could then be monitored by different groups such as water and sanitation committees, women\u2019s groups and youth groups as well as households and local government. The programme used different ways to control spending such as public and open selection and multiple tenders, independent audits which required double signatures on receipts and surprise spot- checks of suppliers. Monitoring and mapping exercises were carried out with cross-checking to ensure validity and stop the flow of subsidies to ineligible households. This experience showed that triangulation is essential in ensuring the honest allocation of subsidies. Overall, up to 20 per cent could be saved on construction costs while improving the quality of sanitation facilities. Source: Water Integrity Network 2006.

They have protected themselves from corrupt practices through a number of inno- vative arrangements. First the Board of each PBS is selected by consumers. Then the meter readers are hired on one-year contracts that can be extended to three years with good per- formance, after which the meter reader has to seek a different career, which is not diffi- cult if they have a good record. Every year the management of each PBS negotiates an agree- ment that includes targets for system loss, collection efficiency, revenue and cost of supply per kilometre of line and debt repay- ment. The PBSs use independent consulting firms to survey rural areas, identify potential consumers and design the electricity distribu- tion network. They also display on a notice board the list of lines to be installed, to reduce the risk of corruption and nepotism in investment decisions and help to avoid constructing uneconomical lines. Reducing collusion in Pakistan. The Local Government and Rural Development Department (LGRDD) in Azad and Jammu Kashmir, Pakistan works in remote areas of the state, but keeps a tight rein on activities through field visits and biannual meetings. It has eliminated private contractors for all but the most technically complex of the 1,260 schemes; instead, its technical staff work with community members who provide the required labour and organize the purchase of supplies. In sum, it has limited the opportu- nities for \u2018cream skimming\u2019 and collusion. Moreover, the staff take great pride in their work and in reducing corruption.

Much of this corruption is tied up with procurement, as companies pay bribes for public contracts for major construction projects. People across the region often have to pay bribes just to obtain services which should be theirs by right. Many of the problems are linked to low investment which creates shortages that public workers can exploit \u2013 allocating scarce resources to those who are prepared to pay. Reducing corruption in health, education and other government services will require action from above and below. From above, govern- ments will need to ensure more transparent and better managed services; from below, users can work together to resist demands for bribes. So far few countries in the region have been able to approach the issue in a compre- hensive and consistent fashion. There are, however, many cases in which governments have been able to introduce more efficient and transparent systems and citizens have united to demand their rights.

Emergencies such as conflict, natural disasters or sudden changes in political configuration \u2013 sometimes referred to as \u2018special development situations\u2019\u2013 often bring out the best and the worst of human beings. Unarmed resistors in conflicts bravely confront their tormentors. Many people in natural disasters risk their lives to save others. Public servants will frequently remain at their posts, serving their communities while foregoing easy opportunities to reap material rewards for themselves. Neverthe- less, there are also people who take advantage of opportunities to enrich themselves when large amounts of cash and goods have to be transferred, sometimes very rapidly and with few administrative controls. Corruption can aggravate the impact of crises and undermine social safety net schemes. In turn, the availa- bility of no-cost or low-cost aid can create conditions for corruption. Over the past decade, most special devel- opment situations in the Asia-Pacific region have been linked to conflict \u2013 and have generally occurred in countries with the low- est levels of human development. As Table 4.1 shows, these also tend to be territories Governments and international agencies frequently have to respond with large-scale programmes, disbursing funds or materials to help people in difficulties. This may be the result of emergencies, arising from conflict or natural disaster, for example, and referred to as \u2018special development situations\u2019. Or they may be giving longer-term assistance in the form of \u2018social safety nets\u2019. In either case, resources destined for the poor risk being diverted by corruption. with the lowest rankings in the World Bank\u2019s control of corruption index (CCI). It seems likely therefore that many of these conflicts are linked to poverty and to the capacity and integrity of governance. Countries with low levels of corruption tend to have more coherent states with stronger social fabrics. Struggles between competing interests, there- fore, are less likely to degenerate into destruc- tive or violent conflict.

The most obvious is an extraordinary event, which leads to a breakdown of regular social, economic and or political interactions and the assumptions that underpin them. In the case of short-term emergencies this breakdown is further complicated by the arrival of international agencies typically under pressure to spend fast. The multi- plicity of newly arrived international agencies (UN, donors, IFIs, NGOs, contractors, etc.) can also be highly aggressive in seeking to establish their programmes and disburse their resources. They can also be eager to position themselves against the \u2018competition\u2019 and move quickly with flagship projects or face the risk of losing funds. This reduces the time avail- able for substantive programme planning and risk analysis \u2013 problems compounded by high rates of staff turnover. The diversity of adminis- trative systems among agencies makes it difficult to keep track of funds and supplies. This is most evident in procurement.

For instance, there is a usually multiplicity of agencies who try to apply normal controls in an abnormal environment. Governments and international agencies have to consider how the misuse of resources relates to efforts to achieve reconciliation and build peaceful societies. In this case there is a temptation to be more tolerant of corruption, allowing antagonistic groups to share the spoils as part of buying a kind of temporary peace. The pragmatic argument in favour of this practice is that it demonstrates that \u2018all have a stake in the system\u2019 and leads to some sense of immediate commitment to the initial peace process which, is hoped to deepen in time. But this is counterproductive: such \u2018peace agreements\u2019, in fact, usually contain the seeds of future corruption. Practices such as divid- ing up ministries among differing conflict protagonists can often lead to a kind of \u2018balkanisation\u2019 of the civil service, subverting any commitment to a merit-based administra- tive system by institutionalizing patron-client relationships. Ultimately, it is likely to repli- cate the fault lines of the earlier conflict. At times, war veterans and returning exiles may see reconstruction as a \u2018payback\u2019 scheme, using wartime sacrifices to \u2018justify\u2019 misuse of public offices and positions.3 Evidence from a number of countries shows that neglecting the corruption problem from the outset is a dangerous strategy, allow- ing corrupt elites to entrench themselves in politics and set up predatory schemes that are extremely difficult to eliminate later on. As in post-conflict environments, there can also be a major shift in patterns of economic ownership which opens up opportunities for corruption. For example, Indonesia in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, nationalized most of the large private banks In post-conflict environments, there can also be a major shift in patterns of econo- mic ownership which opens up opportunities for corruption ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 82 82 82 82 82 When corruption is seen as common, even \u2018normal\u2019, it becomes difficult and complex to reduce along with some of the businesses that had taken loans from them. The subsequent processes of asset consolidation, restructur- ing and (re)-privatization challenges were fraught with problems related to integrity and corruption. Along with the regime change, there is also the danger of shifting from one form of corruption to another. Corruption occurs in many centralized authoritarian regimes, because they lack the safeguards to curb abuses and exploitation of state assets by military officers or politicians and their cronies.4 In a more democratic environment, the new government may on the other hand choose to privatize state assets \u2013 public utili- ties such as water, electricity, telephony and transportation \u2013 only to see these captured by local, corrupt elites.5 Whatever the type of government, in some ways when it comes to corruption the percep- tion is arguably even more important than actual prevalence, since it can become a self- fulfilling prophecy.

Together these dynamics amplify the threats of corruption. Indeed evidence of a pre-existing corruption problem prior to the tsunami was seen through the prosecution of the then Governor of Aceh. This clearly demonstrated that corruption represented a real and serious threat to the post-tsunami re- construction programme. To pre-empt this potential threat, the Government designed the dedicated post-tsunami reconstruction executing agency, known by the Indonesian acronym of BRR, with an eye for ways to avoid some of the usual traps. Among these, was the establishment of a special and dedicated Treasury Office of the Ministry of Finance to manage all BRR payments. This has significantly reduced the costs and time delays that en- courage people to cut corners to manage funding issues. Substantive oversight is a key ingredient to any effective integrity system. To this end, the establishment of a dedicated BRR Oversight Council as well as a BRR Steering Council provides institutional mechanisms to ensure financial and policy compliance from the BRR Executing Agency. The Na- tional Parliament has also established an active committee to monitor BRR activities. Elsewhere at the institutional level, the Supreme Audit Agency has now established a permanent office in Aceh. To demonstrate further seriousness on countering corruption, the Corruption Eradication Commission has also established a presence in Aceh. Within the BRR Executing Agency, we radically adjusted the remuneration system for staff, scrapping numerous dis- cretionary stipends and top-ups to provide a single income. This reform has allowed us to both retain staff and also to establish integrity controls and initiate staff productivity con- tracting. To assist in the maintenance of systems of integrity, we established an Anti Corruption Unit first. It operates on the basis of preventing potential deviations including offering sug- gestions on correcting system weaknesses. The Unit also provides education on corruption-related issues to staff as well as to the wider public and passes information on possible cases of corruption directly to the Corruption Eradication Commission. We in BRR see the fight against corruption in Aceh and Nias as advancing Indonesia\u2019s wider struggle against corrup- tion. We recognize that this task is very difficult, particularly in a post-conflict situation where there is a need to build not just physical infrastructure but also the social fabric of the community and their government. We believe firmly that corruption both robs disaster victims of the support they need and also undermines ongoing and future support from gener- ous external supporters. In this regard, corruption is both morally wrong and also undermines programme success. Cor- ruption does not grease the wheels; it is a spanner in the works.

This would need some kind of interna- tional agreement \u2013 between bilateral and multilateral agencies and NGOs as well as representatives of the governments likely to be recipients of international emergency assistance. UNDP or the Development Assis- tance Committee of the OECD might take the initiative. Paying for controls. All programmes have legitimate management costs so donors should be made aware of the need to pay for fiduciary controls. Cutting costs to claim that every cent goes to hungry children is self- defeating if resources end up being stolen or misdirected. Indeed recent studies suggest that auditing ensures that more money goes to those in need.7 Active communications. Communicating with beneficiaries and other stakeholders, includ- ing local and national authorities is impor- tant. Apart from computer based systems, publication through print media, use of broad- cast media, local information boards, public meetings with local communities providing information, etc. are means to limit corrup- tion. Setting realistic expectations is an important factor in building trust. This argues strongly for public education to BOX 4.2 SEX FOR FOOD SCANDALS Corruption does not involve money alone. During and after conflicts, peacekeeping forces and aid workers who find themselves in a position of authority and control have exploited vulnerable women and children by demanding sex in exchange for food or other resources. Refugees and other displaced people who commonly lack the documentation needed to prove their entitlement to food, health services or shelter may be obliged to exchange sex for survival. This is partly a reflection of the breakdown of social norms and prohibitions that would normally be a constraining force in a society. The organizations need to replace these missing managerial and personal controls and build effective processes for complaints, including protection for whistle-blowers.

During conflicts NGOs have often continued to deliver public services as substitutes for collapsed government. Their established networks, internal systems and procedures offer some hope of integrity control. Local authorities or agencies such as universities could be mobilized to identify reasonableness of input prices. Supreme audit agencies. At the formal level, there may be great value in bringing together the supreme audit agencies of official donor nations to work with those of the affected society. Complaints management. Key agencies, work- ing with existing local or national entities should establish a joint and credible com- plaints system. People need to know how to lodge a complaint, what to expect and what future obligations may emerge. They also need to know the legal limits of investigative authorities. Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes Social Safety Net Programmes A number of countries in the region have social safety net programmes. Some are temporary, having been created in response to emergencies, while others are ongoing to provide the poorest citizens with some very basic security. These interventions vary from supplementary feeding for undernourished children to pensions for the old and disabled. They can also range from support to farmers through subsidies for seeds, fertilizers and water to providing income through unskilled employment in public works programmes. In the last years, microfinance has also become a widespread approach to reach out to the poor (Box 4.4). Although such programmes generally make a valuable contribution, they are also BOX 4.3 AID WATCH IN SRI LANKA One of the challenges of delivering recovery in crisis situations is that the needs and interests of the affected themselves are not reflected in the planning and implementation of projects, resulting in a severe dis- connect between their delivery and the corresponding needs on the ground. This not only contributes to delays, wastage and higher inci- dences of corruption but also feeds into existing feelings of isolation and disillusionment among the affected.

This is primarily because they involve better off, better- connected and better-educated people organiz- ing the distribution of public resources to people who are usually semi-literate and poor and therefore powerless and often unaware of their full entitlements. Moreover, as subsi- dies are involved, the beneficiaries, even when aware of their entitlements, do not always protest even when some diversion takes place \u2013 better to get something for free rather than nothing at all.8 Not surprisingly, some of the resources \u2018leak\u2019 along the way or are directed towards some less deserving groups. Thus, both types of errors take place compounded by corruption through the exclusion of the eligible and inclusion of the ineligible. This corruption can take many forms. It can, for example, appear at the outset when people have been asked for money to get their names registered or have to pay for their job cards and photographs, which are supposed to be free. Those organizing the schemes may also enrol non-existent workers or falsify the number of hours worked, or underpay workers or give them less food than they are entitled to. In labour-intensive work, supervi- sors can cheat on the volume of work done and on the number of people employed. Very often, workers themselves are willing to give a percentage of their wages to project officials and local elites, because what they get from projects by way of wages is usually more than what they would get paid by local landlords and other employers. Officials may also collude with contrac- tors to issue bills for inflated quantities of materials or food distributed. Contractors ostensibly running outlets for subsidized grains for the poor, can sell much of this on the open market at inflated prices.

Recently a con- sortium of aid agencies and microfinance institutions of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the mem- bers of the Small Enterprise Education and Promotion Net- work, have developed disclosure guidelines specifying the fi- nancial information that microfinance schemes should report. The CGAP recommends donor members make their support conditional on full compliance with these guidelines. Sources: Azfar and Azfar 2007; Littlefield et al., 2003; Sarangi 2007. One of the most popular tools for addressing poverty nowa- days is microfinance \u2013 small loans to individuals and groups who would not normally qualify for direct, commercial bank loans. By 2006, across the Asia-Pacific region, such schemes were reaching 98 million people \u2013 who received 85 per cent of such loans globally. Evaluations of the social and economic impact of these schemes have shown them to be very success- ful \u2013 achieving better nutrition and improved health out- comes, helping the poor to send their children to schools and improving gender equity through the empowerment of women. There have been fewer assessments of their vulnerability to corruption. This is partly because many do not work in a largely transparent fashion. However, two case studies, one from India and the other from Indonesia, have demonstrated the risks. In India, corruption prevails in some government- backed lending schemes. In some cases, collusion between government agents and bank officials results in leakages, for instance, demands of 10 percent of loans amount as bribes. The borrowers do not usually complain because they consider it standard practice. Since the government guarantees the loans, the bank is assured of the return of its principal at least. A survey of 10 groups that had taken loans from banks found that all of them had reported bribery as a precondition.

In some Pacific Islands, for example, it is found even among civil society organizations.9 In the 1990s, in an effort to use resources more effectively, public transfer programmes moved from universal provisioning to highly targeted transfers. This, however, assumes an accurate and fair basis for targeting, which may not always be available. Often the target- ing is based on the assessments of local officials who can classify their own less deserving friends or family as qualifying for assistance. In-kind targeting seems to be more corruption prone than simple cash transfers. It involves procurement and distribution of food grains involving private contractors who can short- change the poor by giving them substandard food supplies and under-weigh the quantities that they are supposed to supply. An ESCAP study, for example, concluded that in some countries in Asia resources lost through leak- ages range between 50 to 70 per cent.10 Uprooting Corruption in Social Safety Uprooting Corruption in Social Safety Uprooting Corruption in Social Safety Uprooting Corruption in Social Safety Uprooting Corruption in Social Safety Net Programmes Net Programmes Net Programmes Net Programmes Net Programmes With such negative experience in targeting, a number of schemes are moving away from traditional methods. Instead, more are using forms of \u2018self-selection\u2019, for example, by offering work or wages that only the very poor will accept. Similarly, for food distribution, schemes can buy cheaper but nutritious staples such as sorghum rather than distri- buting expensive grains such as highly processed rice and wheat. A number of coun- tries have also improved the efficiency of such schemes by ensuring greater community control and social audits. These include: Women\u2019s self-help groups in India. In several parts of India, particularly in Orissa, women\u2019s self-help groups are being supported to procure local produce for mid-day meals for school-going children. They not only purchase fresh supplies grown by local farmers, particularly women, but also cook and serve to children. This has considerably reduced leakages.11 Integrated services in the Philippines.

Social audits in India. India\u2019s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), provides for 100 days of guaranteed employ- ment to one member of every rural household, based on the principle of self-selection by focusing on unskilled, manual work. There are strong provisions for transparency and accountability at all levels. For instance, wages are to be paid in the presence of the community on pre-specified dates; all relevant documents are to be made available for public scrutiny; and regular social audit of all works has to be conducted, in tandem with India\u2019s Right to Information Act. This seems to be having an effect: corrupt officials are return- ing money they have taken from villagers and asking them not to complain to the social audit teams or at the public hearings.14 Community-based approaches are not, however, an answer on their own; there is always the danger of communities being co- opted by the local elite. Every effort should, therefore, be made to mobilize the local community through the media, using popular culture and folk traditions to explain to people their rights and entitlements as well as their roles and responsibilities in any project. This has to be an ongoing process. To be sustainable, community-driven approaches have to be backed by a legal framework and strong bureaucratic support. Minimizing the Leaks Minimizing the Leaks Minimizing the Leaks Minimizing the Leaks Minimizing the Leaks Any government programme that involves a transfer of resources to its poorest citizen has to anticipate the danger that the funds, materials or food may disappear en route to their intended destination. But there are ways to minimize the leakages. In the case of special development situations this may often involve setting more realistic standards, backed by effective auditing as well as programme design and speed.

Natural resources are prone to corruption for a number of reasons like inadequate property rights, among the poor, unequal power, remote locations, etc. (Box 5.1).

Given the nature of state capture, in some cases it can be difficult to distinguish this from pure mismanagement of natural resources. These different types of corruption can create complex and seemingly impenetrable webs of influence (Table 5.1). It might be tempting to envisage a simple linear model of corruption with dishonest public officials at one end and state-capture at the other. In fact, these options are usually interwoven with many ambiguous networks or associations between state officials, political elites and private businessmen. One report on the mining industry in Mongolia found that political elites not only demanded kickbacks from mining companies but also entered into numerous deals and joint ventures with them: \u2018the line between public and private spheres is almost non-existent.\u20194 Similarly, complex relationships can occur at lower levels, indeed they may be deeply embedded in social structures. One report on a small community living next to a wildlife sanctuary in India found that local the companies whose activities they are supposed to be regulating, or they can award concessions or favours to family members or political allies. Public officials also often blur the lines between their official responsibilities and their private interests. Many can be seen as using the \u2018revolving door\u2019, moving back and forth between public office and private companies, exploiting their period in a government department for the benefit of their future employers. An official in a forestry department, for instance, may support pro-timber policies and then join the board of directors of a major timber company. State capture.

Forest officers loyal to \u2018the system\u2019 could expect promotion; others would usually be transferred. For both the bribers and the bribed, the system had developed into a type of \u2018protocol\u2019 for the use of the forest. This system generally excluded the poorest households who could not afford to pay and also marginalized women who had fewer chances to establish \u2018closeness\u2019 to the forest officers by eating or drinking with them.5 The Extent of Corruption The Extent of Corruption The Extent of Corruption The Extent of Corruption The Extent of Corruption State and private elite groups \u2013 often in collu- sion \u2013 are thus in a position to monopolize access to resources and exclude the poor. As a result, a small elite often accrue the benefits from natural resources \u2013 doing little to promote broad-based economic development \u2013 or lift people out of poverty. This is evident across most important natural resource sectors from land to water to minerals. Land Land Land Land Land For the majority of poor people in Asia and the Pacific, land is a key resource in both rural and urban areas. In rural areas, the poorest do not own the land they live or farm on; they usually rent or share-crop or work as hired labour on the land of others. Even if they do own land, it will typically be the most marginal. In the urban areas, they often live in illegal settlements with little access to water, electricity and other urban services. Corruption related to land is often concerned with administration. In many countries there are few systematic records or maps, while legislation and registration systems are frequently inadequate. The situa- tion is further complicated when customary law recognizes access to land based on kinship. This may respect the rights of traditional groups but can also create opportunities for nepotism, favouritism, and clientelism. A 2002 Transparency Interna- tional survey conducted in five countries in South Asia \u2013 Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka \u2013 found land administration to be one of the three main sectors prone to corruption.6 Similarly, a study from the Pacific also identified land administration as one of the areas most vulnerable to corruption.7 In Bangladesh, 97 per cent of households were found to have paid bribes for land registration, 88 per cent for land mutation, 85 per cent to obtain land- related documents, 83 per cent for land surveys and 40 per cent to receive land.8 In addition to smaller-scale corruption related to registration, there can also be much larger scale corruption related to land grabs. A number of countries in South-East Asia, for instance, have seen the land of poor and indigenous communities seized for govern- ment or private developments.

Both surface and groundwater are important; for example, over half the popu- lation of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan has a livelihood-stake in groundwater irrigation.12 Corruption often distorts the provision of water infrastructure and influences decisions on who should benefit from water flows. This invariably works against the poor who are less able to exert political pressure or pay bribes. In some South Asian countries like Pakistan, irrigation officials routinely require bribes to ensure continuous supplies of water.13 Corruption is also a major factor in shaping policy, steering investment away from efforts to improve the efficiency of existing water provision, which offers fewer opportu- nities for kickbacks, and towards the more lucrative construction of dams and large irrigation schemes.14 \u2018In South Asia irrigation charges are typically very low by comparison with those in East Asia, both in absolute terms and as share of the value of production.\u201915 Low charges are justified for sustaining food security and poverty reduction but hide equity problems since poor farmers tend to pay more for irrigation water than larger landowners. Unequal access and unreliability of irrigation schemes maximize the opportunities for corruption in South Asia. Although irrigation charges are higher in China and Viet Nam, water is more equitably and reliably distributed across the system, enabling poor producers to finance payments through higher productivity.16 Fisheries Fisheries Fisheries Fisheries Fisheries Fishing is an important source of income to island and coastal developing countries. Asia- Pacific accounts for 49 per cent of global capture fisheries production,17 and fisheries contribute significantly to GDP in many low- income countries. In Bangladesh, fisheries provide over 5 per cent of the GDP and full time employment for more than 2 million people.18 Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a serious global problem, particularly to some of the poorest parts of the world. This represents not just a major loss of revenue, but is also threatening food security; fish stocks in many coastal areas of the region are being severely threatened by overfishing. The main causes are institutional weaknesses and lack of capacity. Many countries in the region prohibit the use of dynamite or cyanide for fishing, but these methods persist and there are few arrests, with even fewer prosecutions.19 In parts of South-East Asia, for example in Indonesia, the live fish trade could benefit many more fishing communities in the long term but instead is organized to ensure short-term gains for officials and entrepreneurs at the expense of fragile coral reef ecosystems and the local communities that depend on them.20 Forestry Forestry Forestry Forestry Forestry Forest products contribute to an average of 10 per cent of the GDP in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries.21 While the forest area has increased slightly in industrial countries since 1980, it has declined by almost 10 per cent in developing countries.22 Deforestation is also causing massive loss of biodiversity, flooding and soil erosion while exacerbating global climate change.

The value added of illegal log exports represented 3 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s GDP in 2000, or 17 per cent of the value added of the agricultural sector output. The government also loses considerable revenue, because almost no taxes are collected on illegal logging.

The United Nations Environment Programme reports that the situation in the past few years has spiralled out of control, with 25 to 50 trucks containing illegal logs crossing the border every day.28 The Pakistan Administrative Staff College in Lahore reports, \u2018it is alleged that an association of powerful businessmen have formed some- thing akin to a \u201ctimber mafia\u201d with represen- tation across government offices and state institutions.\u201929 The corrosive effects of illegal logging are not only confined to the forest sector. Forest products are bulky, making illegal lumber visible and easy to be intercepted by officials. In order for forestry corruption to thrive, a range of people including customs, police, local politicians and transport authorities need to collude, and as a result all these institutions lose their integrity.30 Wildlife Wildlife Wildlife Wildlife Wildlife Wildlife is a vital issue for poor people. Around 13 per cent of people living on less than a $1 a day are thought to rely on wildlife as a source of livelihood.31 South-East Asia is responsible for one quarter of the global trade in illegal wildlife,32 thought to be worth around $15 billion per year, or nearly $160 billion with the inclusion of wild-sourced timber and fish products.33 The problem is particularly acute in Asia, which hosts nine of the ten most endangered species. Much of the illegal trade is fuelled by the demand for TABLE 5.2 SOUTH-EAST ASIA, INDICATIVE ESTIMATES OF ILLEGAL LOGGING Country (various years) Proportion of illegal logging (%) Cambodia 90 Indonesia 70\u201380 Lao PDR 45 Malaysia Up to 35 Myanmar 50 Papua New Guinea 70 Thailand 40 Viet Nam 20\u201340 Source: World Bank, 2006e.

Following China\u2019s total logging ban in 1998, timber companies looked overseas to Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and West Africa. One report on the smuggling of illegal wood from Myanmar to China by ethnic Kachin people found that $125 per truck was paid to Burmese soldiers, $83 to the forestry department and $25 to the drug police. Then at the final stop before the border, the Kachin group collected a \u2018tax\u2019 from Chinese truckers before issuing documents that declared the shipments to be legitimate.40 In Lao PDR illegal logging and related cross-border trade is possible because of the collusion between importers, customs officers, the military and local party officials. \u2018Much of the border trade is conducted informally and illegally, largely in response to customs officials\u2019 demands for illicit payments.\u201941 Quantities of goods are systema- tically under-reported, with the savings in tariffs shared between the importer and local party officials.

The mining of sand is an environmentally damaging but highly lucrative operation; even in countries where it is governed by permits. In Sri Lanka much of this takes place illegally with police involvement or the use of permits procured through bribery.36 The mining of oil, gas and hard rock minerals is also susceptible to large- scale corruption which among other things leads to environmental destruction; mines and exploration sites are usually in remote locations where governance structures often are weakest. The problems are compounded when political elites have personal stakes in mining ventures.37 This is an issue in countries with mineral and oil deposits such as precious metals in Mongolia, phosphate and other minerals in Nauru and the Philippines. It also applies to oil, coal and gas industries that are established in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan, which are now being developed in Cambodia and Myanmar.

Partly due to the \u2018fair trade\u2019 movement, there is an increasing trend among consumers in developed countries to question the origin of products as well as the ethical records of the companies behind. The Impact on the Poorest The Impact on the Poorest The Impact on the Poorest The Impact on the Poorest The Impact on the Poorest While corruption in the management of natural resources creates significant obstacles for many aspects of national development, it is particularly damaging for the poorest communities: Loss of land. Many farmers have been driven into poverty as a result of land expropriations that have been expedited through corruption. In countries where land is owned collectively officials may illegally approve the conversion of farmland for construction or mining.45 This jeopardizes local food security, and may drive a mass of small farmers and peasants into poverty. The farmers who lose their land generally get little or no compensation because they have limited legal rights. Land culti- vated, either by the state or by village cooperatives leaves individual farmers with little recourse in the case of expropriation. Farmers can also lose their land following the breakdown of traditional systems of regula- tion on the use of common property. This may be due to population pressures but can also occur when public resources are leased out to commercial operators through agreements that grant exclusive access. Corruption in land administration is not limited to countries where land is collectively owned. In countries like India, for instance, private land can be legally acquired by the state for public purposes based on the Land Acquisition Act, but corruption sometimes takes place in land valuation, which can harm poor farmers. Loss of water rights. The poor can also be deprived of rights to water. In Pakistan, wealthier farmers often pay bribes to gain access to irrigation water as well as to ensure investments in new irrigation systems that benefit their land. This has been documented as far back as the 1980s.46 Overharvesting. Corruption is accelerating the exhaustion of many natural resources, not- ably primary forests and inshore fishing grounds on which many communities rely upon for their livelihoods. Deforestation and land use change is currently the source of about 20 per cent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The 2007/2008 Global Human Development Report identifies reducing deforestation as one of the main priorities to ensure that CO2 emissions can be sufficiently mitigated. In today\u2019s world the real climate change vulnerabilities linked to storms and floods are in poor rural communities such as in the great river deltas of the Ganges and the Mekong, as well as in sprawling urban slums.47 Mismanagement of resources.

In India the dominant model of irrigation infrastructure provision has aptly been described as \u2018build-neglect- rebuild\u2019 since maintenance is not a profitable business, but rehabilitation and new irriga- tion construction are.48 Meanwhile systems controlled by corrupt engineers or managers typically exclude the poor who cannot afford bribes and also operate at very low levels of efficiency, reducing agricultural output and incomes.

In many countries indigenous groups have tradi- tionally occupied land that is now being exploited by commercial interests in collusion with governments. As a result, they are being denied rights to self-determination which would require that they regain their land or resources or receive compensation. This in stark contrast to Article 26 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People adopted by the General Assembly in 2007, which recognizes indigenous peoples\u2019 inalienable collective right to the ownership, develop- ment, use and control of lands, territories and resources. Threats to health. People who live in areas where mining and other industrial wastes are illegally dumped into rivers face serious health threats from the effects of toxic chemicals. In Myanmar, gold-mining enter- prises not only pay taxes to the Government but also follow a well-structured system of personal payments to officials who can protect them from any repercussions for con- taminating the environment with mercury.49 Loss of public revenue. Poor people usually have a greater need for government services whose budget allocations are severely constrained by losses from corruption. The Government of Indonesia has estimated that lost forest revenue costs the nation up to $4 billion a year or around five times the annual budget for the Department of Health.50 Viewed in narrow commercial terms, deforestation only makes sense because markets currently attach no value to carbon repositories. Also, those profiting from overharvesting of forests often belong to powerful elites with little motiva- tion to change the existing market structures. In Indonesia, for example, the market return of commercial logging represents less than one-tenth of the value of the carbon bank its forests constitute. This means that people \u2018depending on forests for their livelihoods are losing out to economic activities operating on the basis of a false economy\u2019.51 However, while corruption is linked to loss of revenue deriving from the exploitation of forests products, we do not know the magnitude of the loss caused by corruption. Sustaining authoritarian regimes. People, especially the poor often suffer when authoritarian and highly corrupt governments gather wealth from the exploitation of resources. The Cambodian Khmer Rouge, for example, is thought to have received between $220 and $390 million a year from the sale of timber.52 Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Uprooting Corruption in Natural Resources Natural Resources Natural Resources Natural Resources Natural Resources Combating corruption in natural resources will rely on many of the same measures that can deal with corruption in general \u2013 greater openness, strengthening government institu- tions, improving enforcement and having media and civil society watchdogs ensure greater accountability. Given the highly cross-border nature of the problem, in addition to national remedies, international cooperation needs to be stressed. Overall the aim should be to empower citizens to have greater control over decision-making, while restricting the hidden power of corporations, concentrating less on efforts to improve effi- ciency or attract foreign investment and more on ensuring that policy making is not captured by the wealthy for their own self-interest.

The Phupan National Park, previously under the management of the Community Forestry Division of the RFD, was a site of constant conflict but is now managed by Udon Thani Forestry Region Office which works more closely with indigenous rights holders.53 Similarly, in India, a system of \u2018joint forest management\u2019 which started in West Bengal, has enabled villagers to reap the benefits of the forests they help manage. It also encourages more transparency in the management of forests, which has not been exempt from corruption. By 2002, co- management of forests was underway in 27 states, covering 18 per cent of the total forested area and involving more than 62,000 forest protection committees. In Andhra Pradesh alone these include 1.2 million, mostly tribal people. Nevertheless, many challenges remain particularly on the marketing side since many forestry products are still marketed through uncompetitive channels that reduce the profits received by low-income household producers.54 Joint management can be more difficult in the case of extractive industries. This is due to the economics of large-scale extraction plus the activities of companies that are typically bound with complex laws and regulations. Even so, NGOs, CSOs and others can help local people master complexities and conduct training sessions along with public hearings to review laws, policies and licences from a rights-based angle. There may also be opportunities for local communities to work with companies to make \u2018integrity pacts\u2019, as in the Philippines\u2019 mining industry where such pacts grant companies the right to operate subject to binding commitments to uphold human rights and comply with environmental standards. Multi stakeholder initiatives to improve accountability by equipping citizens, media and private companies can also be of help (Box 5.2). Resistance by Poor People Resistance by Poor People Resistance by Poor People Resistance by Poor People Resistance by Poor People On a number of occasions the poor themselves have taken direct action to resist natural resource corruption that denies them access to land, fisheries and forests. Early in 2007, for example, tribal fishers in 44 hamlets protested outside the office of the Satpura National Park (a tiger sanctuary) against the Madhya Pradesh State Government\u2019s decision not to renew their fishing lease for the man-made Tawa reservoir which falls within a protected area of the park, even though a Government task force on the issue had endorsed their fishing rights. Some alleged that the Government\u2019s decision to revoke the community\u2019s fishing rights was connected to their involvement in exposing government corruption.55 BOX 5.2 REVENUE WATCH Revenue Watch International (RWI) is a multi-stakeholder initiative that works with civil society, media and policy makers in resource-dependent countries. The Institute works with key organizations such as the World Bank, Columbia University, the Democracy Center, Global Witness, Save the Children (UK), Transparency International and Oxfam. The mission of RWI is to improve democratic accountability in natural resource-rich countries by equipping citizens and the media with the information, training, networks and funding they need to become more effective monitors of government revenues and expenditures as well as by advising governments and policy makers on best practices in resource revenue management. This also works with companies to encourage and support an accountable and transparent presence in resource-rich countries.

Increase the Supply of Increase the Supply of Increase the Supply of Increase the Supply of Increase the Supply of Natural Resources Natural Resources Natural Resources Natural Resources Natural Resources Corruption is often driven by scarcity; this is clearly demonstrated in natural resources which may be limited by their natural availability. Scarce resources such as wildlife, water, fish and minerals may generate high prices or demand that opens the way for bribes and kickbacks. One way of limiting the opportunities for corruption in natural resources is to expand the supply \u2013 by planting forests, establishing fish farms or harvesting rainwater for irrigation. It has been estimated that plantation forests managed exclusively for wood and fibre on just 4 per cent of existing forest lands could meet 50 per cent to 60 per cent of world forestry demand by 2050.56 With plunging natural fish stocks, fish farms already provide a major portion of global output. However, replenishing natural resources needs to be managed carefully, since planted forests compete for land with natural forests. Similarly, fish farms could be avenues for increased pollution into rivers if not managed properly. In other words, expanding supply can bring significant gains but it can also be controversial and has to be carefully designed to protect the environment and avoid penalizing the poor.

Corrupt exploitation of natural resources often takes place in remote regions, far from official concern and public scrutiny, and precisely in those areas inhabited by the poor.57 Improve- ments in monitoring can be achieved directly by using new technologies. In Cambodia and Indonesia, for instance, remote sensing is being used to identify forest concessions that were awarded illegally. Monitoring and transparency can also be promoted by the use of independent monitors, which is now gaining ground in the forestry sector.

So far, however, countries in the Asia- Pacific region have shown little interest in policing their companies abroad. Malaysian logging companies are prominent in the timber industry throughout Asia and the Pacific. There is potential here for the Govern- ment to encourage these companies to commit to a corruption-free environment in their operations abroad.

Progress at an inter-governmental level is attributed to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), also supported by the G8 summit in 2003. EITI took PWYP a step further by requiring financial disclosure by host governments. So far, 22 developing countries have signed up to EITI, although only two are from the Asia- Pacific region: Mongolia and Timor-Leste. Once a host government commits to the EITI all companies operating in its territory, including those that are state-owned, have to follow a set of principles and publish infor- mation on payments. EITI implementation is carried out with the active support and financial assistance of donor agencies, inter- national financial institutions, corporations and civil society organizations. Although transparency is important, it is only one step along the way. The financial deals can be immensely complex offering companies, and governments numerous ways of concealing corruption. In many cases the deals can only be fully understood in conjunction with contractual agreements which are often confidential. Even if the key information is published, it can be difficult to extract evidence of state capture from floods of extraneous data.

In many countries in the region, fishery and forestry departments are responsible both for maximizing fish and forest production, as well as monitoring and conserving the resource base. Not surpris- ingly, this creates a conflict of interest and fertile ground for corruption. Other institu- tional reforms include rewards and incentives for corruption prevention. As illustrated in Sri Lanka, a financial reward for detection of anything illegal has been used to motivate customs officers to identify illegal exports of ornamental fish and other rare plants and animals. A negative response to state weakness and potential corruption is to limit the ways that the state can gain from corrupt natural resource management. Many natural resource rules allow significant state discretion which creates opportunities for corruption. Discretionary powers of state officials can be limited by simplifying the rules and making greater use of new technology. In Karnataka in India, land registry has been a major source of corruption; village revenue officials often monopolize the revenue records which have frequently been tampered with. Now the Bhoomi programme has facilitated the computerization of the records and so limited the power of state officials to control land transactions.60 The most extreme way to limit state discretion is privatization, although the very process of privatizing state assets can generate corruption. In theory once a company is in the private sector, it will be less prone to state- led corruption. In practice privatization may sometimes only shift the power from one corruptor to another, increasing the power of private companies and the conditions of state capture. A first step is to ensure that open access to natural resources upon which the poor depend are not privatized by elite groups in a defacto way. Such unwanted privati- zation may occur when traditional systems of regulation on common property use that worked in the past have broken down, partly due to population pressure combined with other factors. It can also happen when public resources such as forests are leased out to commercial-scale operators under concessions agreements which grant exclusive access, driving out the poor. The central issue here is for the government to establish a clear and transparent regulatory framework for resource access rights, whether or not they are publicly or privately held. In this regard, privatization may also have a positive impact as it can provide initiatives for managing resources appropriately and sustainably.

There are also more generic international codes of conduct. The United Nations has been promoting the Global Compact which includes anti-corruption principles. While Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other NGOs initially welcomed the Global Compact initiative, some now question its effectiveness because the pact is voluntary, its standards are unclear and there is no process for monitoring or enforcement.

More wildlife, for instance, is being traded illegally because an economic boom in the major client, China, has driven up the demand.61 Several South-East Asian coun- tries have emerged as willing sources of supply \u2013 particularly Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam \u2013 facili- tated by high levels of poverty, lack of environmental awareness, institutionalized corruption, and the long and porous borders between South-East Asian nations. But protected wildlife is not just being smuggled by the poor. This is a very profitable activity and has attracted syndicates of organized criminal groups operating from Malaysia, Singapore, South China, Thailand and Viet Nam, who are also involved in drugs, illegal logging and human trafficking. One way to tackle these issues is tougher cross-border controls and regional coopera- tion. Unfortunately, the main regional group- ings \u2013 ASEAN and SAARC \u2013 have done relatively little to set regional standards for improved governance of natural resources. The prospects appeared to improve at the Thirteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) held in Bangkok in October 2004. This is one of the few multilateral environmental agreements to which all ten ASEAN member states are party. At the meeting, ASEAN announced an initiative to work together to address the region\u2019s rapidly growing illegal trade in CITES-protected species and ten ASEAN countries committed towards developing a Regional Action Plan for 2005\u201310. Subse- quently there has been little action, however, and attempts to limit the trade in wildlife and protect the environment have largely failed. In any case, the announcement of a trans- boundary wildlife trade action plan between Lao PDR and Viet Nam is a positive sign.62 China\u2019s support for these efforts is critical for success on controlling and limiting this trade. The East Asia Ministerial Conference on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance, which took place in 2001, could play a role in promoting regional cooperation in regulating illegal logging. The conference adopted the Bali Declaration, whereby participating countries committed themselves to increase their efforts to regulate the forest sector and strengthen bilateral, regional and multilateral collaboration to address illegal logging and violations of forest law.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22e319ef-830b-4297-8805-6ba35c9562fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "22e319ef-830b-4297-8805-6ba35c9562fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ff2e47467a00532b1da1da4a25a7af4992c439273c1803cac6c877d5ce8fcf6"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb9eeea9-55d8-4cfa-a94f-7fc1115fe227", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bfef91af27bb3a8870f921529ee4af44529d190968a661ef9554be82b4e7adb"}}, "hash": "67793fe1961ac486cf325aee89832a4f0a3ec6f8fdcd34abe8521012bddbdde5", "text": "The conference set up a regional task force to advance the Declaration\u2019s objectives, and the following discussions have led to bilateral agreements between the UK and Indonesia as well as Japan and Indonesia to combat illegal logging and the international trade in illegally logged timber.63 The 2007/2008 Global Human Development report also emphasizes the need for strengthening international cooperation in creating incentives for conservation and sustainable management of rainforests and backs international finance transfer plans on ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 104 104 104 104 104 What", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c1daabc-ba11-49b9-bf7d-11e40f9fc7b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c1daabc-ba11-49b9-bf7d-11e40f9fc7b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6385463695fdfc9000ec6cf3f46df6481921d5606995db9120830146aa733a22"}}, "hash": "6385463695fdfc9000ec6cf3f46df6481921d5606995db9120830146aa733a22", "text": "is clear is that this has to be a combination of national and international action deforestation as advocated by among others Indonesia and Malaysia.

Much of the responsibi- lities rest with domestic firms, transnational corporations, banks and external develop- ment partners. Up to one-third of firms are thought to pay bribes for public procurement contracts in emerging economies.4 In addition many businesses are imposing undue influ- ence on national laws and institutions.

In addition, many countries in the region have established parlia- mentary committees on corruption the Hong Kong/Singapore-type single anti- corruption agency. Despite the limited number of success stories, policymakers and development agencies continue to invest scarce resources in agencies that have doubt- ful impacts, often operating in a political environment that shows little commitment to tackle the root causes of the problem. According to the UNCAC, State Parties to the Convention have the option to choose whether to grant responsibilities to a single organization or to divide responsibilities bet- ween various prevention and law enforcement institutions. The single-agency approach places a number of key capabilities, responsi- bilities, and resources under one roof, thus creating a powerful centralized agency (ICAC style) to lead the anti-corruption drive. The multiple-agency approach aims to combine the efforts of various units or agencies with specific anti-corruption responsibilities that may be scattered among departments. The first Asia-Pacific country to establish an independent ACA was Singapore which in October 1952 set up the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).7 The most recent cases were in Bhutan, which in 2006 established the Office of the Anti-Corruption Commission and Mongolia which formed the Independent Authority Against Corruption the same year (Table 6.1). Some countries with notable ACAs include: Singapore. To curb corruption during the colonial period, the British relied on the Singapore Police Force. This was a serious mistake, not least because of the prevalence of corruption within the police. In 1952 there- fore the Government created the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, giving it three main functions: to receive and investigate complaints; to investigate misconduct by public officers; and to examine public service procedures so as to minimize opportunities acts are outlawed \u2013 either as part of general legislation, or as laws against specific forms of corruption. Legislation can also cover issues such as money laundering, public pro- curement and ethical codes. Of the 28 coun- tries in the region that responded to a survey for this Report,5 22 countries report specific legislation on corruption. In addition, over the past five years many countries in the region have established parliamentary committees on corruption. It is also important to protect \u2018whistle- blowers\u2019 \u2013 individuals who disclose informa- tion about wrongdoing. The survey shows 11 countries offer some protection to whistle- blowers though this may not be very strong. Of the countries in the region that were not a part of the survey, Hong Kong (SAR), China, Republic of Korea,6 Australia, Japan and New Zealand have enacted laws or programmes for whistle-blower protection.

As a police agency of the central government it cannot investi- gate corruption offences in the states without the consent of the state concerned. Unlike Singapore\u2019s CPIB and Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC, the CBI is not independent of the police and does not focus entirely on corruption. Indeed, as a police agency, the CBI has three major areas of operation: anti-corruption in the public sector; economic crimes; and special crimes includ- ing organized crime and terrorism.10 The CVC, on the other hand, is free of control from any executive authority. It is considered the main anti-corruption agency in India, monitoring and advising central government agencies. However, it plays a mainly supervisory role.11 Malaysia.

The Anti-Corruption Act was passed in 2001 and the Korea Indepen- dent Commission Against Corruption (KICAC) was formed in 2002. Its functions include policy making and coordination, monitoring corruption, protecting whistle- blowers, encouraging civil society involve- ment, improving the legal framework and promoting ethical values in society.20 Unlike the other ACAs, the KICAC cannot investi- gate corruption cases itself; it has to rely on the Board of Audit and Investigation and other agencies.21 A government committed to curbing corruption should demonstrate its political will by providing the ACA with adequate staff and funding and the ability to operate inde- pendently without political interference. In almost all countries in the region, the ACAs are dependent upon government funding and several face severe budgetary constraints. In most cases the heads of the ACAs are appointed by political leaders or by commit- tees that include politicians and generally report to the legislature or the parliament. Independence. One of the first issues is where the ACA is located in government. If the agency reports to the office of the Prime Minister, for example, it can be used as a weapon against political opponents. In the Asia-Pacific region, the experience has been mixed. Some govern- ments, such as those in Singapore and Hong Kong (SAR), China, have resisted this temp- tation; others have not. Ideally the ACA CHAPTER 6: CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP 111 111 111 111 111 should be a completely independent body. Where the ACA is not structurally indepen- dent, its power is dependent on the strength of its bureaucratic and political patrons, who depending on the environment, can be very powerful or very weak. In some cases, a com- bination of outside accountability and strong political support from the press and the pub- lic can overcome the absence of formal guar- antees of independence. The autonomy of the ACA can also be strengthened by ensuring that the selection and appointment of the executive(s) of the ACA is a shared responsi- bility of several institutions (Table 6.2).22 ACAs in most countries do not require any formal complaint to investigate corrup- tion; some have the authority to both investi- gate and prosecute; others also have the power to investigate corruption in the private sector. Another important issue is independence from the police. Some agencies do have this advantage, but others do not, so a corrupt police force may be free to investigate its own members. One can also examine the records of these agencies in pursuing the \u2018big fish\u2019 or senior officials. Again the record is mixed, with some agencies doing very little to address corruption by the powerful. Staffing and budgets too can vary considerably, Macao\u2019s CAC, for instance, spends over $22 per capita of population23 compared with only $0.08 in Indonesia (Table 6.3).24 Oversight, accountability and control. The ability of the ACA to work in an unbiased way will depend on appropriate checks and balances as well as constant scrutiny through various oversight mechanisms. Hong Kong\u2019s ICAC, for example, has its activities examined by four independent committees which include representatives from civil society, in addition to an independent ICAC Complaints Committee which receives, monitors and TABLE 6.2 APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SOME ACAS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION Appointment head of the ACA Hong Kong (SAR), The Commissioner is appointed by the chief execu- China tive.

Some countries have decided to shift reporting lines from a single-person institution such as the Prime Minister to the parliament, allowing various political parties to scrutinize the activities of the ACA.26 Focus. The agency\u2019s mandate needs to be prac- tical and carefully focused. Many countries propose the Hong Kong approach (prevention, investigation and education/awareness) Whether a country has chosen a single or multi-agency approach, success in the fight against corruption depends to a great extent on cooperative relationships with other elements of government though their agencies have neither the resources nor capacity to emulate Hong Kong (SAR), China. The most successful agencies have a clear focus (Table 6.4). Coordination. Whether a country has chosen a single or multi-agency approach, success in the fight against corruption depends to a great extent on cooperative relationships with other elements of government. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, and it probably breaks down often even in cases where it has been achieved. As a result, agencies are regularly frustrated by their inability to secure infor- mation, cooperation and prosecutions. In Indonesia, however, the KPK has been charged with coordinating and supervising all institutions involved in anti-corruption activi- ties.27 Bhutan has established a national Anti-Corruption Council to coordinate efforts of various stakeholders and plan and review the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. Public Credibility Public Credibility Public Credibility Public Credibility Public Credibility Finally, how does an ACA ensure its credibi- lity among members of the public? The follow- ing three aspects are important indicators: Consideration of all complaints. Does the public perceive that all complaints, no matter how small, will be followed up on? What proportion of complaints does it investigate? Does it investigate anonymous complaints? The Republic of Korea, for example, has penalized the disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity or any information that would reveal this to encourage citizens to come forward with their complaints.28 This goes hand in hand with laws to protect whistle-blowers. Public perceptions. Does the public believe that the agency investigates effectively and does not abuse its powers? Does the public believe TABLE 6.4 ANTI-CORRUPTION AGENCIES: SOME EXAMPLES OF FOCUS Focus Hong Kong The ICAC Ordinance requires the Commissioner to (SAR), China investigate \u2018any\u2019 suspected corruption. The agency\u2019s policy has been to take this literally, pursuing all corruption allegations without a priori selection cri- teria, although it is within the sole discretion of the Attorney General to decide which cases to prosecute. ICAC first focused on the public sector and only later started to focus its attention on the private sector. In 1974, 80% of the cases were from the public sector, today about 60% are from the private sector. ICAC has a comprehensive mandate. However, trials for minor cases are costly so there is a selection process that takes place at that level (if the offender admits then prosecution for minor cases, will be avoided).

CHAPTER 6: CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP 113 113 113 113 113 An ACA is also a double-edged sword and can be used by an incumbent government for good or dishonest purposes that the ACA will keep their corruption re- ports confidential? Is it seen as incorruptible? Enforcement. Does the agency enforce the anti- corruption laws impartially, or does it concentrate on petty corruption and ignore grand corruption? Are the rich and powerful protected from investigation and prosecution for corruption offences? How are complaints against the agency\u2019s own officers dealt with? Within ACAs of the Asia-Pacific region, the two strongest in this respect are those in Hong Kong (SAR), China and Singapore. In Hong Kong, for instance, many complainants, rather than preferring to remain anonymous, now identify themselves. Over the period from 2001 to 2006, the agency received 24,000 complaints of which 83 per cent were pursuable. Meanwhile 2,751 people were prosecuted of whom 83 per cent were con- victed and over 1,000 civil servants were disciplined.29 The CPIB in Singapore is less forthcom- ing with information on its operations. The CPIB\u2019s small staff complement of 82 persons compels it to focus on investigation of corrup- tion cases at the expense of the other func- tions of prevention and education. Indeed, the CPIB\u2019s Achilles heel is its neglect of public relations.30 It has, however, published opinion polls on corruption. In 2005, nearly 90 per cent of the respondents believed that corruption was very much under control and 86 per cent felt that in Singapore corruption control was better than in other countries. According to the respondents, the low level of corruption in Singapore could be attributed to the political will to keep corruption under control; the heavy punishment for corruption offences; and the effectiveness of the anti- corruption law.31 The CPIB has convicted a series of high officials including, for example, in 1995 the Deputy Chief Executive of the Public Utilities Board for accepting bribes from contractors.32 Some of the other agencies have a lower reputation. This may partly be the result of under funding, however, in a number of cases agencies pursue political agendas, or their members themselves are not above corruption. It should be stressed that an ACA is only as effective as its incumbent govern- ment wants it to be. An ACA can only be independent, permanent, accountable, credi- ble and effective if it is supported by a government that is committed to eradicating corruption. Any anti-corruption agency can be overpowered by a corrupt government or a crooked system. An ACA is also a double- edged sword and can be used by an incumbent government for good or dishonest purposes. ACAs are not therefore the best solution for every country. What is needed first is a clear analysis of the political and economic situation, power-relationships and cultural patterns. This may well conclude that the right solution is an ACA. But it should not be designed or created until there is sufficient political consensus on an anti-corruption strategy and agreement on what the agency will do to implement that strategy effectively. If a government decides to establish an ACA, it can enhance the prospects for success by providing it with an adequate budget and sufficient staff, by not interfering in its daily operations and most importantly by resisting the temptation to use it as a political weapon against critics or opponents. In the hands of a clean government, an ACA can be an asset and a powerful weapon.

Some countries in Asia had merit-based policies in the past but have not maintained this tradition and make too many appointments on the basis of favouritism.33 Both the Philippines and Thailand, for example, have civil service commissions to ensure that recruitment and promotion in their civil services are fair, though they still do not always ensure appointments based entirely on merit.34 Better Civil Service Compensation Better Civil Service Compensation Better Civil Service Compensation Better Civil Service Compensation Better Civil Service Compensation Cash and non-cash benefits are both impor- tant part of compensation packages. The Russian curse \u2018May you live on your salary!\u2019 illustrates the universal importance of paying civil servants adequate salaries. Surveys in many countries have identified low salaries as an important factor responsible for corrup- tion among civil servants. In Indonesia, a 2001 national survey \u2013 comprising 650 public officials, 1,250 households and 400 businesses \u2013 found that all three groups iden- tified low salaries of civil servants as the most important cause of corruption.35 Similarly, in surveys on corruption in five South Asian countries by Transparency International in 2001 and 2002 respondents identified the low salary of employees in various sectors as a cause of corruption.36 Adequate salaries are not just important for economic survival they also confer status in society. So the most obvious response would be to raise salaries and first and fore- most to reduce the gap between those in the public and private sectors. However, this is likely to be expensive and governments may not be able to pay enough to compete with the levels of income from bribes. In any case, while this will reduce the motivation for petty corruption, it is unlikely to reduce grand corruption, which is caused less by need than by greed. Non-cash benefits like recognition, titles, training and exposure-visit opportuni- ties can also be useful incentives under appropriate circumstances. Closer Closer Closer Closer Closer Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring Government will therefore need to supple- ment salary increases and merit-based promo- tions with tighter systems of monitoring and control that can detect corruption swiftly and punish it severely. This should alter the mindsets of civil servants so that they see corrupt activities not as \u2018low-risk, high-reward\u2019 but as \u2018high-risk, low reward\u2019. Monitoring systems, must however be carefully designed if they are not to multiply bureaucratic proce- dures and \u2018red tape\u2019, which in themselves increase opportunities for corruption. Governments should also publicize proven cases of corruption among civil servants, since the threat of \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 serves as a strong deterrent. The Chinese Government has been taking stern action. Gan Yisheng of the Party\u2019s Central Commission for Discipline and Inspection reported in May 2007 that it had sent a special team of inspectors across the country to question local party bureaus, state-owned enterprises and banks. The team also looked at conspicuous acts of corruption, the buying and selling of government posi- tions, several dubious promotions and other acts of malfeasance. They uncovered around $10 million in illicit payments and funds. After a month-long nationwide \u2018discipline\u2019 campaign, nearly 1,800 officials confessed to their involve- ment in hundreds of acts of misconduct.37 CHAPTER 6: CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP 115 115 115 115 115 The acid test of the political will of a government is therefore its determination to investigate politicians and senior bureaucrats \u2013 and to punish offenders Reducing Red T Reducing Red T Reducing Red T Reducing Red T Reducing Red Tape ape ape ape ape Corrupt civil servants love red tape.

One success in Indonesia was the jailing of the son of a former president, initially for graft and later for arranging the murder of the Supreme Court judge who had convicted him.

India too has caught some senior officials. The Central Vigilance Board in its 2005 Annual Report said that it had prosecuted various officials from the Central Board of Excise and Customs, including a commis- sioner and his senior staff. Other senior officials too have been dismissed as a result of corruption include a commissioner of Delhi Police; a chief engineer of the Ministry of Railways; scientists from the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research; and a direc- tor of the Department of Health.40 Such cases are few and far between. In Fiji, for instance, one of the most notorious cases of corruption concerned the National Bank of Fiji, a case which started in 1995 but has yet to produce any results. Similarly, a more recent case in the Water & Sewerage Department of the Ministry of Works con- cerned payments to contractors caused losses of $9 million, resulting only in a $500 fine and the transfer of a senior water engineer.41 Curbing Corruption in T Curbing Corruption in T Curbing Corruption in T Curbing Corruption in T Curbing Corruption in Taxation axation axation axation axation One of the most damaging forms of corrup- tion for government budgeting is in taxation. Much of this arises as a result of excessive red tape which opens up opportunities for interactions between taxpayers and tax offi- cials.

Partisan politics penetrated all aspects of public life, a problem that resulted in the decline of public trust. For many years, the country was identified as one of the most corrupt in the world. Ineffective formal controls and lack of citizen- oriented anti-corruption accountability mechanisms added to the crisis of inte- grity. This called for a longer-term change process with a strong reform regime that would sit at the core of the good governance agenda in Bangladesh. Effective public accountability mecha- nisms and ongoing parliamentary over- sight of Government activities are essential to promote democracy and economic development with a pro-poor focus.

For more than a decade, I have kept a close eye on gover- nance issues and reform, and it is heart- ening to observe the growing political disposition to move towards improving overall governance, including measures against corruption. Although Bangladesh had shown very little inclination to comply with international standards on corruption, the interim Government that came to power in January 2007 acceded to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), just one month later. Crucially, 2007 also saw the long- overdue implementation of a 1999 legal judgment putting in place the necessary framework for an independent judiciary. The process of operational separation of the judiciary from the executive commenced on 1 November 2007. This will gradually strengthen the overarch- ing framework of checks and balances between the three branches of the State. Next, under new leadership, the national Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) and related task forces under the National Coordination Committee are prosecuting a number of high-profile individuals on serious charges of corrup- tion, abuse of power and criminal activities. A number of such cases have been successfully discharged, with inves- tigations in progress for many others. The reconstituted ACC is also formulat- ing its first strategic plan, which will set out a longer-term vision for the \u2018controlling, suppressing and preventing\u2019 of corruption in Bangladesh (Anti- Corruption Commission of Bangladesh, 2007). In addition, the Government has initiated a series of significant institu- tional reform measures toward strength- ening of the Election Commission, Public Service Commission (PSC), the University Grants Commission and local Government authorities. A new Chair and new members have been appointed to the PSC, in an effort to restore that body\u2019s image; in turn, they have undertaken modifications in the examination system to ensure that civil service recruitments are transparent and fair. Finally, driven by the top leadership of the Government, the process of formulating a National Integrity Strat- egy (NIS) is under way, with full imple- mentation expected to begin at the end of 2008. This will offer an overarching vision for further development and implementation of good governance and anti-corruption reforms. Such a strategy is expected to highlight the need for public- and private-sector changes, involve public awareness campaigns, and seek international cooperation. It will be based on the premise that good governance is fostered by encouraging and facilitating a process of dialogue and building constituencies among key participants, by creating demand within a wider rubric of public awareness. Thus, the NIS will seek to strengthen internal controls in State institutions and will aim to induce a shift in culture by encouraging the adoption of citizen- owned accountability mechanisms. All this is most welcome news indeed. Ultimately, when reforms have been successfully implemented, Bangladesh will witness strengthened institutions of accountability; stronger citizens\u2019 accountability mechanisms, with effective participation of media and the private sector as partners; and strengthened internal control measures across selected public sector agencies. Most importantly, it will have developed an ethics- and value-based foundation for its public service.

Evidence from 68 countries shows that between 1982 and 1999 while the rate of taxation on profits fell from 46 per cent to 33 per cent, revenues from taxation of profits rose from 2.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent of the national income.43 Governments wanting to reduce corrup- tion in the tax system also need to reduce the powers of individual officials. There are two strategies for this. First, in countries where the same unit does assessment and adminis- tration they could re-engineer tax depart- ments to separate the two functions. Second, they should not assign tax officials to any particular jurisdiction but give them tasks randomly.44 Another way to dent the monopolistic power of tax officials is through competition.

One more measure is to reduce the number of \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 who can exert con- trol over a particular activity. One option is to ensure that for each kind of economic activity there is a \u2018one-stop\u2019 licensing and regulation authority. This strategy for streamlining business licensing has been put into practice in many US states. India in 1999 introduced a similar agency, the Foreign Investment Implementation Authority. It would also be valuable to reform the taxation system. For example, in the early 1990s, as much as 81 per cent of potential taxpayers in India were not captured by the tax net.45 To rectify this situation and thus to expand the tax base, India adopted the \u2018one-in-six\u2019: any person fulfilling one of six criteria must file a tax return irrespective of his or her level of income \u2013 a measure that significantly extended the tax net.46 Governments could furthermore make more use of taxes that are less susceptible to corruption, such as value added taxes (VAT). However, an important issue for VAT is the time it takes to issue refunds. While a long delay may offer time for proper assessment, it also creates an incentive for bribing tax officials. Tax authorities must therefore strike a balance between proper scrutiny and prompt refunds.47 Privatization Privatization Privatization Privatization Privatization In addition to reforming public services, governments can also consider privatizing or outsourcing some of them. This is often suggested cure for corruption as well as increasing transparency and efficiency. A strengthened private sector may also serve as a check to a government\u2019s exercise of power when it acts independently to defend its interests.48 However, this assumes that the private sector itself will operate in an ethical fashion and that is likely to be less corrupt. This is frequently not the case. Corruption, both \u2018petty\u2019 and \u2018grand\u2019, is also rife in the private sector. For example, in China in the first eight months of 2007 state prosecutors handled 8,040 commercial bribery cases involving more than one billion yuan ($140 million).49 An alternative to full privatization is a public-private partnership: the government makes an arrangement with the private sector to provide public infrastructure, community facilities and related services \u2013 with the partners sharing the investment, risks, responsibility and rewards. When introduced for large-scale projects, however, Governments wanting to reduce corruption in the tax system also need to reduce the powers of individual officials ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 118 118 118 118 118 People are now starting to believe they have a right not just to good government but also to see how that government works and gain ready access to information these have had mixed results; they seem to have worked better on a smaller scale as part of local, grass roots actions. As yet, there is relatively little research on the social impact of privatizing social services. Most investigations have focused on economic efficiency rather than impact on re- distribution and the poor. It is clear that governments need to be concerned not just with whether services should be privatized but also how. They have to undertake focused measures to improve the chances that poor households will benefit. If policy is weak before privatization, it will also be weak after privatization. Privatization is clearly no substitute for a responsible policy of redistribution.50 The Right to Information The Right to Information The Right to Information The Right to Information The Right to Information In the past, even democratically elected governments have operated as fairly closed systems, assuming paternalistically that poli- ticians and public officials knew best how to govern and no-one else needed to know how they did it. They have therefore generally preferred to reveal information only when convenient or when it served their own purposes. In recent years, however, there has been a major conceptual shift. People are now start- ing to believe they have a right not just to good government but also to see how that govern- ment works and gain ready access to infor- mation. For example, the process through which the Indian Right to Information Act was drafted and has come into force illus- trates the power of sustained public pressure.

Thus far, no Pacific Island country has adopted such a law, although the matter has been debated extensively in Fiji. However, in August 2006, Iosefa Maiava, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Pacific Islands Forum, called for appropriate legislation.52 Beyond national governments, there have also been policies of information disclosure from a number of intergovernmental organi- zations. At the forefront, have been the inter- national financial institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks. The World Bank, for example, adopted its Policy on the Disclosure of Information in 1994. In 1997 UNDP also adopted a Public Information Disclosure Policy and UNESCO has made a commitment to do so.

In 2006, however, following intense pressure from civil society organizations these plans were dropped. In China the ordinance on Openness of Government Information also focuses on the publication of financial and development information. It requires public bodies to disclose economic and social development plans, statistical information on national development and reports on fiscal budgeting and final accounts.

It also requires local governments to release a wide range of information on revenues, expenditures, special funds, land- use planning and subsidies, contracting, allocations for emergencies and social relief.54 To be effective, this information must of course reach people.

In practice, however, they will find their path blocked by long lists of \u2018exceptions\u2019. One of the main exceptions, rendering many documents off limits, is national security. Indeed in many countries the laws ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 120 120 120 120 120 One way to promote positive participation is to ensure that officials are engaged from the outset totally exempt certain security or intelligence bodies supposedly on the grounds that such information would be beneficial to a potential enemy. Whether or not this is actually the case, it also denies citizens information on what is being paid and to whom. This is a major issue since in most countries\u2019 defence usually has one of the largest budgets, with a considerable element of discretionary spend- ing and is thus highly susceptible to corrup- tion. There are, however, overrides around this. India, for example, while generally excluding intelligence agencies, does allow for the disclosure of relevant information \u2018pertaining to allegations of corruption or human rights violations\u2019.59 Governments may also be reticent about publishing details of internal decision-mak- ing. They may believe that if the minutes of all discussions could surface subsequently in newspapers, politicians and public officials would be less willing to express their opinions frankly. Unfortunately, they usually overreact to this possibility by drafting the exception in unduly broad terms. Under the Japanese law, access to information may be refused on the grounds that it would un- necessarily cause \u2018confusion\u2019.60 The Thai law similarly excludes all internal opinions and advice, although this does not cover technical or factual background material.61 Since these exceptions could readily be used to hide corrupt activity it is important that the legislation also includes the possibi- lity of overrides. Both the Indian and Japanese laws allow public bodies to override exceptions when this is judged to be in the overall public interest, which is often the case when the information relates to corruption.62 Other Disclosure Legislation Other Disclosure Legislation Other Disclosure Legislation Other Disclosure Legislation Other Disclosure Legislation Outside of general right to information laws, most countries include disclosure rules in other pieces of legislation, allowing the public to find out. Some ways include disclosing the salaries of senior public officials, using land registers to identify the owners of property and inspecting the ownership structures of publicly listed companies. In the Philippines, for instance, senior of- ficials are required by the Constitution to pub- licly file a declaration of their assets, liabili- ties and net worth. This applies to the Presi- dent, Vice-President, officers of the armed forces with general or flag rank, and mem- bers of the Cabinet, Congress, Supreme Court, Constitutional Commissions and other con- stitutional offices.63 In addition, national leg- islation requires all public officials to file a publicly accessible statement of assets, liabili- ties and net worth, along with a disclosure of business interests and financial connec- tions.64 Encouraging Access Encouraging Access Encouraging Access Encouraging Access Encouraging Access Legislation is, however, only the first step. The highest levels of government also have to sustain their support and public officials have to engage positively and meet their obligations fulsomely. This requires some fundamental reforms. For many government bureau- cracies, this will involve considerable rethink- ing since they have typically been engineered for the purpose of not sharing information. Without adequate preparation, they can therefore find themselves inundated with petitions to which they are unable to respond, leading to long delays. One way to promote positive participa- tion is to ensure that officials are engaged from the outset. They need to be involved in all debates on the right to information and have the opportunity not just to understand the obligations but also to appreciate the benefits they can derive. Initially officials can feel threatened, but their nervousness usually CHAPTER 6: CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP 121 121 121 121 121 SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION \u2013 SOLUTIONS FOR PREVENTING AND CURBING CORRUPTION IN CHINA By Prof.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7210e118-5707-45b2-a853-8a39062a8bf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "7210e118-5707-45b2-a853-8a39062a8bf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9593d5b62493ff7747a818a59d5306b1477e51dabb7e0fc9f8f6d6e737e2270e"}, "2": {"node_id": "84707ce6-5507-4277-ac3f-596b609754da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c254be499a203a808c2ecf273eecdc924a9ea375a4ba3ca2fda10c8156738178"}}, "hash": "f5ceeb957e2c41322dd34c866a8f42c73355cd8574555a5771e41598b16ee388", "text": "Zengke He Contd...

Open and competitive elections can empower the people and enable them to choose among different political elites. As shown in other countries in the world, where there are alternatives for the people to choose, the political establishment would have stronger motivation to act in the best interests of its constituencies. Secondly, the media should be made more independent from the control and interferences of certain government officials. In developed countries, the media is considered the fourth \u2018public power\u2019 besides the legislature, executive and judiciary, playing a vital role of checks and balances on the decisions and actions of governments and public officials. There are numerous cases where journalists from the private news media are engaged in investigative reporting. Corruption is uncovered and publicized, ruining the reputation of corrupt officials and bribers. Some corruption scandals have caused such great public outrage to force the govern- ments to take systematic measures to tackle corruption. There are many good lessons for China from other countries, when it is mobilizing social forces to rein in corruption. A freer and more robust media can become a powerful ally of the government to cope with corruption. Thirdly, it is necessary for China to make the law-making and policy- making processes more inclusive and participatory for various stakeholders. The main function of public policies and laws is to redistribute social resources and justice, influencing various social groups. If there is no legal way to influence these processes, the rich will then try to influence policy processes by bribes, and the poor will be marginalized, having no say in the decisions and laws that will affect their life. The Chinese Government should continue to broaden its engagement with citizens, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector through public hearings, public consultations via the media, the internet and round-table discussions, etc. Currently, there are many pilots of public hearings about govern- ment decisions and consultations on leg- islation which are organized on an ad hoc basis. It is now time to move to sys- tematic and standardized arrangements. The fourth aspect is to make public affairs and processes more transparent. Access to government information by citizens is a precondition for citizens to know how the government works. The right to public information is also a basic right of citizens enshrined in the Chinese State Constitution. Trans- parency in government affairs is one of the most effective ways to prevent corruption. Access to information laws, standards and mechanisms allow the public to access government information easily and set up remedies for citizens to hold governments and officials accountable for failing to meet such standards. Among these, e-governance is proven an efficient, low-cost way to make government information accessible and transparent. Transparency in government affairs can also overcome the culture of secrecy within bureaucra- cies to expose the administrative processes to greater public scrutiny. The fifth area where China should look into in order to fight corruption is independence and professionalism of the judiciary. An independent and fair judicial system can play a key role in enforcing laws against corruption, while corruption in the judiciary will destroy public confidence in governments\u2019 efforts to combat corruption. This is because the judiciary is often said to be the last gatekeeper of justice. If it is susceptible to interference by the admin- istrative branch or other political pressure, it would not be able to act as an independent third party to make fair judgment on governments\u2019 decisions and provide legal remedies for citizens when their rights and interests are unlawfully infringed upon by the admin- istrative branch. Given the key role of the judiciary, the professional standards of judges are of great importance. With- out high professional standards, the quality of judicial decisions cannot be guaranteed. In order to improve the independence and professionalism of the judiciary and prosecution services, reforms should be carried out on such systems as selection and appointment of judges and prosecutors, financing courts and prosecution services, higher remuneration schemes for judges and secure tenure for judges, etc. The sixth area is to continue public administration reform by making government regulations less and better and public services more efficient and transparent. Complicated administrative regulations often create a lot of red tapes and thus give rise to more oppor- tunities for bribery taking and giving. In the past three decades, China has introduced several rounds of public administration reforms in response to the needs of the emerging market- oriented economy.

The very poor are therefore most likely to benefit via the activities of NGOs or other institutions of civil society. Unfortunately, even NGOs do not always use their rights. Those that do so most actively are generally those that were involved in the struggle to obtain a right-to-informa- tion law, since they are committed to making it deliver the desired benefits. NGOs are also more likely to exercise their rights if they are pursuing a specific objective such as deliver- ing basic entitlements to the poor. There is also potential for abuse. Some people will use RTI to pursue personal agendas. Civil servants, for example, some- times file RTI cases against colleagues who have been promoted over them or for other personal reasons. These and other requests, counter to the spirit of the right to made more independent and professional so that they can perform in a transpar- ent and effective way and are subject to public scrutiny. Seventh, there is a need to streng- then the institutions of external audi- tors. External auditing on government bodies and public institutions is a very powerful mechanism to reveal corrup- tion and deter public officials from corruption. The Chinese Government needs to strengthen the institutions of external auditors, make external audits more regular, publish the audit reports and take strong and prompt measures against those officials who are found to be corrupt. The eighth area of anti-corruption measures is to breed professional and business ethics via a process of consen- sus building. There are no perfect laws, and law enforcement is both costly and time-consuming. Therefore, it makes sense to raise the ethical standard of civil servants and businessmen through education and training. Codes of conduct and ethical standards are more likely to Contd... The very poor rarely exercise their rights fully subsides when they find that the feared consequences do not materialize. One way to overcome their concerns is to provide them with training where they can learn about the processes alongside the representatives of civil society who are likely to be asking for infor- mation. While the information is in principle available to all, in practice it tends to be accessed more by the wealthy and higher educated. The very poor rarely exercise their rights fully. They may be able to take advan- tage of information that is disclosed automati- cally, in the media for example, but they are less likely to request information themselves \u2013 hindered perhaps by unfamiliarity with the processes, illiteracy, cost, the time needed, the difficulty of making a request or simply because they fear, or do not trust public be abided by if officials and business leaders participate in the codification of rules and make their voices heard. Meanwhile, professional ethics could be effective if they are tied with the career development of civil servants. Similarly, business ethics, including corporate social responsibilities (CSRs) could be made more effective if the compliance with standards positively influence the reputation and profit of the relevant corporations, and vice versa. The ninth area is to create a more favourable policy and regulatory environment for civil society organiza- tions. A strong and active civil society is a forceful check and balances on state power. The watchdog role of civil society on the potential abuse of state power cannot be replaced by any other government supervision bodies. Making civil society independent from the state is the first step for the development of civil society organizations (CSOs). The Government needs to improve the legal and policy environment for civil society development, reduce the current restric- tions on civil society organizations with regards to registration, donation, tax, etc., encouraging CSOs to criticize the wrongdoings of government officials. The tenth and final area is to make it easier for the victims of corruption and whistle-blowers to report corruption cases. Legal reform is needed to make the victims of commercial bribes seek legal remedies and get compensation in a less costly and time consuming way. Whistle-blowers should be protected by the law for their personal safety and career development.

CHAPTER 6: CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP 123 123 123 123 123 Governments may use new technology to make their activities more transparent but they can also misuse it to exercise greater control over the lives of their citizens information, can absorb much of the time of RTI focal points and reduce their capacity to respond to genuine cases. Overall it is probably too soon to judge whether RTI legislation has worked. India has had some success but in the seven other Asian countries it is too soon to say. They have only had their laws for a short time; indeed China\u2019s legislation does not even come into force until May 2008. In any case, access to information is only one factor impacting on corruption; so it may be difficult to identify a specific outcome of RTI processes. e-Governance e-Governance e-Governance e-Governance e-Governance Developments that facilitate transparency entail the development of right to informa- tion communications technology (ICT) and the extension of e-governance. But there are dangers in this. Governments may use new technology to make their activities more transparent but they can also misuse it to exercise greater control over the lives of their citizens. Corrupt officials too may also be able to exploit such systems to their own advantage. Nevertheless, governments and service providers can use new technology to become more accountable and responsive. India, for example, in 1998 introduced ICT in court management and reduced the huge backlog in the Supreme Court. This has now encouraged the government to formulate a five-year plan to computerize all 2,500 court complexes and provide laptops to over 15,000 judicial func- tionaries. There are also plans to create a database of new and pending cases and to digitize the law libraries and court archives \u2013 all of which can help combat corruption in the judiciary.65 In an effort to propagate the idea of zero tolerance for corruption, India\u2019s Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has begun to share with citizens a large amount of infor- mation related to corruption. The CVC website has published the names of officers from the elite administrative and revenue ser- vices against whom corruption investigations have been ordered or on whom penalties have been imposed. While promoting transparency and accountability, this also serves as a preventive tool. Any citizen can lodge a complaint. Although the complaints cannot be anonymous the Commission has to ensure that the identity of the complainant remains secret.66 The Commission scrutinizes the information and then as appropriate passes the information on to the Central Bureau of Investigation or the Income Tax authorities. Some public authorities are also using ICT to minimize corruption applications for licences and other permits. In 1999, the Seoul Metropolitan Government, for example, launched an Online Procedure Enhancement for Civil Applications (OPEN) covering 54 common procedures. By March 2001, close to 1.5 million people had visited the website and there had been 39,000 civil applications. The OPEN system has made the administra- tion much more transparent, as those officials responsible for corruption-prone areas, such as permit or approval procedures, now have to upload reports and documents to enable citizens to monitor the progress of their applications.67 Another process that can benefit greatly from computerization is land registration.

Compute- rizing a corrupt system will make the situa- tion even worse, since those engaging in public sector corruption can take advantage of advanced technologies and porous interna- tional borders to move their funds around. If governments are to minimize these risks they must design their systems to counter corruption. Many governments have placed the development of national e-government plans in the hands of IT staff in ministries. While they may be able to make the technology work, they are unlikely to know enough about corruption. They need to work therefore with legal and anti- corruption experts. E-governance needs to develop on a continuous basis and also to be guided by the priorities of citizens. The opportunities for such involvement are likely to expand in the years ahead. Second-generation telecentres, combined with the increasing power of mobile devices can enable citizens to partici- pate in governance not just once in five years through the ballot box, but on a daily basis through their interaction with honest and responsive administrations. Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation Cross-Border Cooperation In an increasingly integrated global economy, corruption too has become a cross-border issue. Some argue that globalization will have a positive effect on corruption and that open- ing up national processes to international scrutiny and the pressures of a free market should make them more transparent. Others claim that deregulation of markets in the South has in many ways made developing countries more vulnerable to corruption than ever. There is probably an element of truth in both propositions, but it seems clear that countering corruption will need determined action by governments, international agencies and international corporations working together. The most important step forward in international cooperation has been the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Entered into force in December 2005, this is the first global legal instrument designed to achieve far-reaching reforms to combat corruption. It also presents for signa- tories important anti-corruption mecha- nisms, including public-sector reform, the right to information, extradition laws, anti- money laundering laws, corporate social responsibility, strengthening the indepen- dence of anti-corruption agencies and ethical codes of conduct for civil servants. Table 6.6 shows the regional pattern of support of the Convention. Within the Group of 8 industrialized nations, all are signatories. However only five have ratified (Canada, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States), meaning those that have only signed the Convention are not willing to be legally bound by it. Most Asia-Pacific coun- tries that have signed the convention have abstained from being bound by paragraph 3 of Article 66, which deals with \u2018Settlement of Disputes\u2019 between state parties, with possible deference to the International Court of Justice if a deadlock occurs. Other parties have abstained from this paragraph includ- ing the United States, South Africa and the European Union. In addition to UNCAC, countries in Asia and the Pacific are signatories to a number of other relevant international treaties. The only regional agreement for Asia-Pacific is the ADB/OECD Regional Anti-Corruption Action Plan (Box 6.1). The Pacific Plan, was endorsed in October of 2005 by all member CHAPTER 6: CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP CRUSHING CORRUPTION FROM THE TOP 125 125 125 125 125 states of the Pacific Island Forum. The Plan is a central tool in the fight against corruption in the region (Box 6.2). The Plan endorses a regional anti-corruption strategy which seeks to strengthen legislation and other measures in many Pacific Island countries as well as create regional anti-corruption institutions such as a regional Ombudsman and an Audit and Customs Office. In addition, across the region there are over 70 bilateral treaties,69 specifying legal surrender by one country to another of an individual accused or convicted of an offence and agreeing on procedures gathering evidence for use in criminal cases, transferring crimi- nal proceedings to another state or carrying out foreign criminal sentences.

BOX 6.1 ADB/OECD ANTI-CORRUPTION INITIATIVE FOR ASIA-PACIFIC The ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific was launched in 1999 and supports its 28 member countries and economies in strengthening anti-corruption policies and frameworks. The process is driven by the commitment of its members to the goals, standards and implementation mecha- nism laid out in the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia-Pacific. The Action Plan sets standards for member governments in four areas: effective and transparent systems for public service; anti-bribery actions, promoting integrity in business, and public involvement in the fight against corruption. These areas reflect the range of issues covered by the UN Conven- tion Against Corruption as well as other relevant interna- tional instruments such as the OECD Anti-Bribery Conven- tion. A set of mechanisms supports the implementation of the Action Plan by the Initiative\u2019s member governments. These mechanisms include the facilitation of regional policy dialogue and measurement of progress in anti-corruption reform; provision and dissemination of good practices to support the regional dialogue; capacity building, as well as the facilitation of partnerships with relevant constituencies in and beyond the Asia-Pacific region, such as UNDP. Through this unique implementation and review mecha- in the region, but they have also been involved in dishonest and illegal practices, in some cases colluding with corrupt leaders, particu- larly in the extraction of natural resources and in pharmaceuticals.

Others have been less scrupulous. In Hong Kong (SAR), China a survey in 2006 found that 76 per cent of international companies believed that they had failed to win new busi- ness in the previous five years because a com- petitor had paid a bribe.70 While many TNCs have developed their own codes of conduct, a number of interna- tional agencies and civil society organizations have also set up guidelines to encourage TNC commitment to a corruption-free business environment. One of the most important mea- sures is the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in Interna- tional Business Transactions \u2013 further deve- loped at the global level by the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. This has spurred other international initiatives such as the UN\u2019s Global Compact framework. The latter is a voluntary initia- tive for businesses which are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environ- ment and corruption. Principle 10 reads: \u2018Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.\u2019 The Global Compact has so far en- listed over 2,900 businesses in 100 countries to promote socially responsible policies in the anti-corruption area.71 Civil society organizations have also been very active in creating awareness of TNC initiatives there are comprehensive frameworks for monitor- ing and evaluation involving a variety of stakeholders from governments to civil society, led by the Pacific Plan Action Committee. Importantly, many of these new governance struc- tures will explicitly include issues pertaining to resource man- agement, perceived in the Pacific as an extremely \u2018wet\u2019 sector for corruption. Underscoring all these reforms is the harmoni- zation of traditional and introduced governance systems; corruption is said to occur in the grey area between the two. Since many Pacific Island countries are very small and have limited capacity, rather than having national anti-corruption agencies, there could be a regional body to respond to the special needs of such countries and promote effective economic integration and collective security.

One example is Transparency International\u2019s \u2018Business Principles for Countering Bribery\u2019 \u2013 developed in partnership with companies, academia, trade unions and non-governmen- tal bodies. International financial institutions such as the World Bank are beginning to take on an anti-corruption regulatory role when their own financing is involved, by investigat- ing and sanctioning companies. TTTTTax Hav ax Hav ax Hav ax Hav ax Havens and Money Laundering ens and Money Laundering ens and Money Laundering ens and Money Laundering ens and Money Laundering For developing countries, one of the main problems in prosecuting and punishing corrupt officials and businesses is that the proceeds of corruption are laundered through offshore banks and held in secret accounts in tax havens, concealing the dishonest and illegally obtained money and making it hard to track down assets looted by corrupt leaders. A number of NGOs, like the Tax Justice Network, have lobbied to bring these issues to the discussion table, and governments and international development agencies are now starting to respond. In 1989, for example, the G7 founded a Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) which has listed 40 anti-money laundering measures that have been accepted internationally as policy bench- marks.

While many of them are promoted and protected by developed countries, Asia-Pacific is also home to a sub- stantial number. Major ones identified world- wide in 2000 were 71 in number, including 21 from OECD member countries and 13 from the Asia Pacific; in 2007 these have come down to 39 overall of which one is among the OECD members and 6 are in Asia Pacific, the later being all islands.75 In Singapore, foreigners have been allowed to acquire residency through investment.

Singapore\u2019s Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002 ensures robust inter- nal regulations, partly through the inclusion of the \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 initiative which requires financial institutions to report suspicious transactions to the authorities. However, currently the scheme only applies to transactions linked to serious crime or terrorism. Revenues derived from illegal logging or other environmental crimes appear to fall outside its scope.77 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 128 128 128 128 128 Corruption is such an insidious and pervasive phenomenon that it has to be tackled at many levels simultaneously Tax havens are an issue that has to be addressed through global cooperation. There is little point in closing down existing tax havens if they are replaced by new ones. As a response to this, and to help developing nations recover assets stolen by corrupt leaders, UNODC and the World Bank in 2007 launched the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) initiative. This will give developing countries financial and technical assistance to strengthen their institutional capacity to retrieve stolen funds and invest them in development programmes \u2013 and to monitor their use to ensure that they are not stolen a second time. It will also help countries bring their laws into compliance with the UN Convention Against Corruption. StAR emphasizes the need for developed and developing countries to work in tandem. While such money frequently originates in developing countries, much of it is being hidden in developed countries. Developing countries need to strengthen their public institutions; at the same time developed countries must demonstrate stronger political will and carry out the necessary legal reforms backed up with consistent investigation.78 By the end of 2007, Switzerland, one country known for its secretive banks, had signed on to the StAR initiative, hopefully making it increasingly difficulty for corrupt money to find a safe hiding place. As a part of the initiative, UNODC and the World Bank appealed for all countries to ratify and implement the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which only five of the Group of Eight developed countries have done. Among the countries earlier seen as tax havens in Asia-Pacific, the Maldives acceded to UNCAC in March 2007. China ratified in January 2006; the agreement will be applicable also for Macao and Hong Kong. Singapore is a signatory to UNCAC but has yet to ratify the agreement.

But one thing is clear \u2013 governments have to set an example and take the lead. They need take a determined stand, enacting the necessary legislation, launching effective institutions to investigate corruption and root it out. A number of governments have put together some of the required ingredients: anti-corruption agencies, right to information legislation, e-governance and greater international cooperation, but most still have a long way to go. However action from the top is only a part of the picture. This needs to be reinforced by pressure from below, which is the subject of the next chapter. Corruption is injustice, silence is consent.

Across the region many individuals and groups are increasingly becoming less tolerant of corruption and the damage that it causes, and are taking direct action. The Power of the Media The Power of the Media The Power of the Media The Power of the Media The Power of the Media One of the principal watch groups monitor- ing and exposing corruption is the media \u2013 press, radio, TV and increasingly the internet. They can serve many important functions, beyond just exposing corruption. The media can sustain an open and trans- parent flow of information, fostering a climate of opinion that is increasingly intolerant of corruption. The most dramatic cases of media inter- vention occur when investigative journalists expose cases of grand corruption \u2013 leading to prosecution, or at least the resignation of high-profile offenders. This has been seen in many Asia-Pacific countries. In the Philippines, for example, investigative report- ing provided evidence that led to the impeach- ment of political leaders. The investigations brought out instances of tax kickbacks and bribes. Tackling corruption is not a job for governments alone. Civil society must play its part \u2013 by monitoring and reporting on standards of government and also by refusing to pay bribes or collude with corrupt officials. Individuals, civil society organizations and the media all need to stay alert, demanding the highest ethical standards and resolving to reject corruption wherever it appears. There have also been high-profile cases in India. In 2001, for example, journalists from the website tehelka.com wrote about large- scale corruption in defence procurement. This eventually led to the resignation of the defence minister. Posing as representatives of a large military supplier, journalists approached leaders of the ruling party and members of the army\u2019s top brass, showing that they were willing to accept bribes in the billions of rupees. This demonstrated what people had long suspected: that defence and army officials were skimming huge amounts from military contracts. This expos\u00e9 shook the Indian political and defence establishments. The tehelka.com journalists suffered some harassment and their website was forced to shut down, but they have now reappeared producing a high-quality weekly paper.1 Journalists in China too have exposed low- and mid-level corruption, contributing to the removal of local officials from office, often with the tacit endorsement of higher government officials. In 2005, for example, Xinhua (the official news agency) publicized the results of a government audit showing that $1 billion meant for infrastructure projects and public compensation in the poor, north-western province of Gansu had been diverted or embezzled. More than 40 officers were caught, including a vice-mayor of an eastern city who was jailed for taking bribes.2 ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 132 132 132 132 132 As well as exposing individual cases, investigative exposure can lead to more profound reforms was revised, increasing the controls on indi- vidual contributions. If any campaign worker is found to have broken the rules, the election result can be overturned.5 Similarly, in the Republic of Korea, the Government of President Kim Dae Jung, in 1999, responded to a popular clamour for election reforms by imposing ceilings on contributions to political parties by individuals and companies and establishing annual subsidies for political parties.6 Exposure on the Internet Exposure on the Internet Exposure on the Internet Exposure on the Internet Exposure on the Internet Those with vital information on corruption can now use the internet, regardless of how constrained the press is. During the 2000 election campaign in the Republic of Korea a coalition of 600 grass roots organizations had found that 15 per cent of the candidates for parliament had serious criminal records and many others were guilty of tax evasion or dodging the draft. They published the names of blacklisted candidates on a website. The website got 1.1 million hits on election day and of 86 blacklisted candidates, 58 lost.7 Why did the newspapers not take the initia- tive?

Similarly, in China, blogs, of which there were as many as 33 million by the end of 2006,9 have led to a rise in public discussion on corruption. One blog by an independent journalist has exposed corruption, including the case of a local official who stole $400,000.10 In the Philippines, in the heat of the mass protests against a former president, the internet was a hive of activity for Filipino The Party eventually launched an investi- gation of the erring officials, with media publicity providing legitimacy and generating public support for the probe. Such tacit endorsement of expos\u00e9s of corruption has encouraged ground-breaking journalistic investigations. In 2002, a journalist probed corruption in the securities market in Lanzhou \u2013 the capital of Gansu. His reports resulted in the closure of over 400 illegal companies by the government. But the jour- nalist also received death threats as a result, including one from a businessman whose illegal practices he exposed. Gansu officials banned his reports, saying these contributed to instability in the province, prompting him eventually to move to Beijing.3 Press publicity can be particularly effec- tive against two especially pernicious types of corruption. The first is extortive corruption in which a government official demands a bribe to provide a service. Victims tend to report this type of corruption to the press. The second type of corruption that the press can expose is collusion between bureaucrats and their clients. In this case, neither has any incentive to expose malfeasance, but journa- lists do, motivated either by their professional ethos or the prospect of a good story.4 As well as exposing individual cases, investigative exposure can lead to more profound reforms. The uncovering of serious systemic flaws can catalyse public discussion and debate, ultimately leading to an overhaul of structures and systems. In many democra- cies the exposure of corruption in electoral fund-raising, for example, has generated lively public discussions and in some cases has led to greater restrictions on campaign finance. In Japan, for instance, scandals linked to campaign contributions in the 1990s led to new laws designed to limit the influence of corporate money in elections.

In India, one woman set up a blog to protect her husband \u2013 a whistle-blower work- ing in the civil service of the State of Karnataka. Her husband had reported on col- leagues who were supplementing their sala- ries with bribes. He was pushed around the civil service and forced to switch jobs seven times in nine months. Scared by the murder of several people in India known to have exposed corruption, his wife built a website \u2013 fightcorruption.wikidot.com \u2013 to make his case known to the world. \u2018In the YouTube era,\u2019 she reasoned, \u2018it is harder to kill a man who has a bit of internet renown. I wanted to inform the people that this is happening, that my husband is a whistle-blower, so that it becomes the responsibility of every citizen to protect him\u2019.11 The internet has clearly provided a rela- tively free space where individuals and groups can articulate views and provide information unavailable in the mainstream media. But this is not an option open to most people. In the rural areas and among the semi- literate in particular, few people have access to the internet.

It should be emphasized that this index is concerned with freedom and does not judge quality. A free press may, for example, concentrate less on news and more on entertainment. Nor does it say whether the media report responsibly; rather than promoting a reasoned debate and consensus the press may simply exploit its freedom by peddling sensationalism or fomenting cynicism and conflict. There can also be constraints on capacity. Some journalists lack the skills for textured and in-depth reporting. As a result, the most successful investigative reports tend to be those that focus on individual wrongdoing, on stories with clear villains, rather than on more complex issues linked with social inequality, injustice, harmful public policy, or unaccountable social and political structures. In practice, does a free press contribute to the reduction of corruption? The picture is mixed. For one thing, the restrictions can come from different directions. Those in countries towards the bottom of the list tend to come from strong government control. This is the case of Myanmar, for example. And in Singapore a muzzled press, fearing restrictive defamation laws and breaches of official secrets, practices considerable self censor- ship.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1a5b8e7-14bc-4581-a9f9-86eedd5e7703": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1a5b8e7-14bc-4581-a9f9-86eedd5e7703", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68bd437457748a7e75b2b7baa9251dd3b61f415e8683d04f359b5e5ad3572afa"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a2f6d10-218c-4ec0-8836-12d10437b116", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "340e6870d2a5e20b0feaa20dee34b9751b841bb330af133c4ccbb86e12af903b"}}, "hash": "00cacbf797331e36f59eb9fd8ccd85e28e8a3ba9f57c609eaa31be2ee9dd50a1", "text": "In any case, nearly all of Singapore\u2019s media outlets, including internet service providers, are run by companies with close ties to the ruling party.

In Singapore, for example, corruption is low largely because a highly efficient government controls the system from the top, punishing offenders severely and by paying bureaucrats quite well. The Philippines, on the other hand, despite a lively press which has exposed the corruption of a number of presidents and high-ranking government officials, is thought to have high levels of corruption. After a former political leader threatened tax audits and other government sanctions against the owners of critical media outlets, they toned down their reporting on the corruption and other wrongdoing of his administration.13 Other countries in the region have a similar combination. India has one of the region\u2019s longest traditions of press freedom yet corruption remains rife. Indonesia too, especially since the fall of Suharto, has seen a proliferation of new newspapers. Yet it is still perceived to be one of the more corrupt countries in the region. Clearly a free press is not enough. What these countries need in addition are clean and efficient systems of justice that will follow up on widely-reported allegations. Nevertheless it would be wrong to say the media in these countries has been completely ineffective. In India, Indonesia and the Philippines, media reporting has helped create public pressure for reform, even if this has been slow to materialize. It could also be argued that without a free press the situation in these countries would have been far worse. Of course freedom has to be balanced by responsibility, without which credibility can be seriously compromised.14 A free press could further improve the situation in Singapore. The country controls corruption at home but has had less success controlling the behaviour of its government- owned enterprises overseas. With even greater freedom, the Singaporean press could expose such activities and make state entities more transparent and accountable. The country would also benefit from more critical reporting on the perks of high-level officials, their transactions and decisions. Ethical Standards of Journalism Ethical Standards of Journalism Ethical Standards of Journalism Ethical Standards of Journalism Ethical Standards of Journalism Even if the press is free, its ability to combat corruption can be compromised by low ethical standards. In many countries journalists are only too willing to accept payments from those on whom they are covering. In 2001, the Alliance of Independent Journalists in Indonesia surveyed hundreds of reporters and found that 70 per cent of those in East Java and 97 per cent in Jakarta were taking envelopes of cash from their news sources.15 The Jakarta office of the Southeast Asian Press Alliance also reported that 64 state- owned firms and government departments set aside $173 million for \u2018cultivating journalists\u2019 in 2001 (Box 7.1). Similarly the Philippine Centre for Investigative Journalism in 1998 polled 100 beat reporters in Metro Manila and found that 71 had been offered money by their sources. Of these, 24 admitted they took the money, with 16 keeping the cash for themselves and 8 turning it over to their editors.16 Enabling the Media to Expose Corruption Enabling the Media to Expose Corruption Enabling the Media to Expose Corruption Enabling the Media to Expose Corruption Enabling the Media to Expose Corruption The media can promote good governance if they retain editorial independence, abide by high ethical and professional standards and know that their rights will be guaranteed.

Such people were known as \u2018bodrex\u2019 \u2013 an Indonesian brand of headache tablet. The persistence of \u2018envelopmental journalism\u2019 is often attributed to the generally low salaries journalists receive.

The Alliance of Independent Journalists began an \u2018anti- envelope\u2019 campaign in 2000 to raise aware- ness of the problem and its pernicious impact. The organization has also lobbied for higher wages for journalists. The anti-envelope campaigns were in the form of posters, research, pamphlets and in-house education. Fem\u2019Link in Fiji.

In addition, they need to ensure that laws on libel and defamation are not so restrictive that they prevent reporting on issues related to corruption. There is always the risk of media excesses, but these are best controlled through independent press councils, media- watch groups, ombudsmen and other bodies independent of government. At the same time, citizens need to be able to interpret the media critically and distin- guish good journalism from bad. The press is more likely do its job well if the public demands it. This awareness can be fostered in schools, for example, by teaching media literacy. Media organizations should also be more transparent about their ownership, editorial decision-making processes as well as the pressures and restraints on their reporting. Across the region there have been a number of examples of ways in which the media have helped combat corruption. Community media in Nepal.

Moving along the technological ladder, in the Philippines in the 1990s, \u2018envelopmental journalism\u2019, which took place in the 1970s and 1980s, has been replaced by \u2018ATM journalism\u2019.

In 2007 the United Nations Development Programme formed a partnership with the private sector, including the Siam Cement Group and PricewaterhouseCoopers, to train journalists across the region on how to cover corruption stories and understand basic ethics of balanced reporting. More than 45 reporters from 11 countries in Asia and the Pacific have taken part in workshops that have allowed them to work through potential corruption stories. Journalists from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor- Leste and Viet Nam have shared their experiences. Even when the media itself is not launching investigations it can still play a vital role through its normal reporting functions. Thus if it reports regularly on the activities of public anti-corruption bodies, it serves to reinforce their position and dissuade public officials, who might otherwise meddle in their work. By persistently snapping at the heels of public officials and keeping an eye on businesses, a lively press helps sustain a democratic system and discourages those tempted to engage in corrupt practices. Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations Civil Society Organizations While media can prepare the ground work, accountable government has to be sustained by citizens themselves, through the ballot box and by acting through civil society organiza- tions (CSOs). These are self-organizing autonomous groups, such as trade unions or religious groups, that operate in the realm between the household and the state, helping citizens to forge shared values, build trust, and engage in cooperative activity. They can also enable citizens to check abuses of power by government. Corruption control would seem to be a compelling CSO cause.

By Teten Masduki Likewise, the Judicial Commission, Attorney\u2019s Office and police face real obstacles in carrying out their oversight functions. In general, the Indonesian commu- nity has not truly experienced living in a democratic culture, which was only reintroduced after being absent for a long time. Since the 1999 election, a regional autonomy policy has been intended to reduce the centralization of power in national authorities, who were prone to an oligarchic abuse of power. But as implemented, this policy has ended up distributing practices of abuse of power to the regions, opening access for local elites and politicians to regional resources susceptible to manipulation. Local budgets have been allocated more to serve officials\u2019 interests rather than to improve public services. Meanwhile, the business community has been burdened by ordinances enacted by local governments in efforts to increase regional revenues, which leads to a high-cost economy. Thus, the will to change from within the Government is barely there. At the same time, there has been little democratization process to open up opportunities for public participation in local governance. Checks and balances practically do not work, not only because of collusion with local government, but also insufficient control by the public because civil society remains relatively weak. Given the continuing worrisome combination of State capture and petty or bureaucratic corruption, however, anti-corruption reform must be pushed by civil society, the private sector and the media \u2013 a condition that the national anti-corruption programme overlooks. Each must be mobilized to increase external needs for economic and political reform. Still, an anti-corruption social movement is burgeoning, even if it does not yet have a strong enough foundation to make a significant difference. The extraordinary growth of free speech and free media since the start of the new democratic era has made major inroads toward this expansion.

This also takes place in developed countries, as shown by various electoral financing scandals. In Indonesia, however, the influence of the elite is huge, and could paralyse almost the entire democratic system. This must be vigorously countered by a grand coalition between government and non- government reform forces in order to overcome obstacles still posed by the bureaucracy and formal politics. Business and political conspiracy, which flourished under the kleptocracy and managed to control almost all national economic resources, is currently seeking a new relationship that fits in with the newly fragmented political landscape. One tycoon complains that channelling funds to a number of influential, political powers is no longer sufficient to secure business protection. And this offers hope for the future; bribing what has been termed the \u2018roving bandit\u2019 may begin to be no longer so effective, when corrupt actors and centres are spread out and no longer monolithic, while policymaking is no longer centralized. When corrup- tion loses its benefits, it will shrink. Having a stronger civil society and private sector can hasten that day in Indonesia. Teten Masduki is an anti-corruption icon in Indonesia. Since 1998 he has been head of the Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW). In 2005, he received the 2005 Ramon Magsaysay Award for public service. Getting out of the trap of corruption is not easy. This is particularly so in the case of Indonesia, which suffered from more than three decades of kleptocratic rule that still retains a strong grip on the Government and business. In the paternalistic culture of Indonesian society, I witness that corruption trickles from the top down. Yet even since the advent of demo- cracy in the country, neither global anti- corruption programmes implemented in Indonesia, nor tens of millions of dollars in international aid, nor domestic efforts have motivated civil society, business and Government to jointly fight corrup- tion. A 2007 Governance Assessment Survey conducted in 10 provinces and 10 districts concluded that illegal charges are still common and corruption eradica- tion is hindered by the lack of serious attention from government and non- government institutions alike. There- fore, it is time to rethink our ways to fight corruption. Are they relevant to the issues in Indonesia? Most anti-corruption programmes in the country target the strengthening of government institutions, starting from the establishment of new institutions to the managerial reform of existing ones. This may arise from the largely govern- ment-to-government funding for good governance programmes. But this sets aside the strengthening of social institu- tions and expansion of public participa- tion channels. In this case, corruption seems to be regarded as a managerial problem or failure of government \u2013 judiciary, bureaucracy, fiscal systems, parliament \u2013 instead of as a result of imbalanced relations among the State, society and business. Nothing is wrong with the objectives of reforming government institutions. However, with policymakers who have low political will and limited ownership of a reform agenda, this approach faces a huge challenge in implementation and has led to democratic corruption. Efforts to undermine new anti-corruption institutions in Indonesia, such as KPK and the corruption court, have been continuous,21 which can be viewed as an expression of resistance from those whose interests are being disturbed.22 CHAPTER 7: CITIZENS ON WA CITIZENS ON WA CITIZENS ON WA CITIZENS ON WA CITIZENS ON WATCH TCH TCH TCH TCH 139 139 139 139 139 As NGOs and CSOs become more attractive channels for aid, careful scrutiny will be required to distinguish the well-run and effective, from the inept or corrupt to benefit from the actions of one individual or organization, then few will feel compelled to do the \u2018heavy lifting\u2019 themselves, especially given the risks inherent in confronting the powerful and privileged who may resort to violence.

With regard to micro-finance activities, a lack of transparency can facilitate corrupt transactions. Many micro-finance institutions do not maintain transparency in financial disclosure; unlike organizations like Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and Spandana in India.25 As NGOs and CSOs become more attractive channels for aid, careful scrutiny will be required to distinguish the well-run and effective, from the inept or corrupt. CSOs may find it very hard work if combating corruption is their sole objective. Instead it is better to have more CSOs that see controlling corruption as an important contribution to their overall objectives. Those may be improving health, other services, or creating income-generation activities for the poor. Ideally, there should be a broad coalition of CSOs that might share some public values but are sustained by diverse incentives and appeals. Attempts to jump-start a network of CSOs which are aimed only at tackling corruption may not produce sustainable results, and may even waste scarce resources and political opportunities. How Can CSOs Help Check Corruption? How Can CSOs Help Check Corruption? How Can CSOs Help Check Corruption? How Can CSOs Help Check Corruption? How Can CSOs Help Check Corruption? CSOs in the Asia-Pacific region that want to counter corruption can face a number of obstacles. In some countries, particularly in East Asia, CSOs face quite a hostile environ- ment; they have limited resources and many of their members \u2013 often, those harmed most by corruption \u2013 are preoccupied with basic survival. Tackling corruption means mobiliz- ing the weak against the strong \u2013 and with- standing the reactions of powerful people and entrenched interests, many of whom go to great lengths to protect their corrupt advantages. As a result, CSOs may make little head- way in poor and highly corrupt countries. CSOs might in principle help such countries improve social conditions, support better governance and contain corruption; but in these countries it is also difficult for CSOs to take root and survive. CSO action against corruption is thus unlikely to bear fruit in poor, undemocratic societies; indeed it is more likely to result in risk, repression and apathy. CSOs work best when they have material resources and the liberty to influence those in power. In Thailand after 1992, for example, civil society organizations put themselves in ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 140 140 140 140 140 Civil society groups can monitor govern- ment activities and ensure that policies are carried out strategic positions and became involved in monitoring political activities. They participated in poll-watch activities during elections and advocated for social and political reform.26 Civil society groups sustained by a free flow of information can monitor government activities and ensure that policies are carried out thereby fostering accountability and contributing to better governance, especially in developing countries.27 But it is important to recognize their limitations, however, and appreciate what CSOs cannot and can do (Box 7.2). In poorer societies CSOs are more likely to check corruption indirectly via their long- term contributions to human development. Indeed, the CSOs most valuable in a struggle against corruption might have origins, agendas and incentive systems that have nothing to do with good governance or public life, but still teach organizational skills, build social networks and mutual trust, creating a sense of efficacy. The more diverse the range of groups active in civil society, the more they will be able to stimulate citizen activity across a whole range of concerns.

He identified four types: material incentives, purposive incentives, specific solidary incentives, and collective solidary incentives.28 If CSOs are to engage wholly or partly in combating corruption, how might these incentives apply? Material incentives. These are rewards of tangible value, such as money or goods. Anti- corruption CSOs are unlikely to have extensive individual material rewards, but may be able to offer \u2018exclusive material incentives\u2019 \u2013 things of real value, perhaps created by the group\u2019s own efforts, that can be restricted to members only. Poor people\u2019s savings associations, for example, were founded in difficult circumstances but still accumulated significant resources through small individual contributions. They offered valuable aid \u2013 money for burials, help in the time of emergency \u2013 on a members-only basis. Anti-corruption groups might emulate this model by setting up a kind of \u2018corrup- tion insurance\u2019 in which members pool information and small contributions, while making binding pacts not to compete corruptly. Those who actively support the group and abide by the non-corruption pledge could be given access to information, legal advice and even modest amounts of cash to reduce the impact of corrupt pressures they could not avoid. Purposive incentives. These refer to the satisfaction of achieving a significant goal. In fact, the most obvious incentives for an anti- corruption CSO are purposive: after all, the organization seeks reform. Where those goals are deeply personal, purposive incentives may be enough, at least for a time. But as a group grows and matures, it will need more diverse appeals. Specific solidary incentives. These can include offices, awards, honours and citations along with exclusive access to information. For example, where it is safe to do so, anti- corruption CSOs could present well- publicized \u2018Corruption Fighter of the Year\u2019 awards. Some people will do a great deal to earn such recognition.

And a reform- oriented CSO getting into the business of offering ethical \u2018seals of approval\u2019 to leaders, parties, agencies or private interests would carry its own hazards; doing so will require formidable resources and create risks of embarrassment, should \u2018approved\u2019 people and groups be revealed as corrupt. CSOs can contribute best by concentrating on providing information, expertise, and sustaining a sense of strength in numbers. Do CSOs Actually Help? Do CSOs Actually Help? Do CSOs Actually Help? Do CSOs Actually Help? Do CSOs Actually Help? Does a strong civil society help weed out corruption? One way to get a sense of this is to plot an index of corruption against an index Strong and successful CSOs will be better able to sustain them- selves by using a diverse repertoire of incentives and appeals overall master plan; strong and successful CSOs will be better able to sustain themselves by using a diverse repertoire of incentives and appeals. What sort of relationship should CSOs have with local regimes: contentious or cooperative? To some extent, the answer depends upon the political options available, and upon the state of civil liberties and rule of law. CSOs must be forthright about oppos- ing corruption, and when possible they should seek cooperative relationships with the regime, giving government officials reasons and incentives to oppose corruption, while helping them develop the means to do so. Under most circumstances, CSOs should avoid becoming investigative bodies, whistle- blowers, or forces of anti-corruption vigi- lantes. Political leaders are unlikely to welcome this.

This includes an indicator of Institutional and Social Capacity based on among other things, the number of active environment-related CSOs. These indicators, like those for corruption, have limitations, notably that they are too often based on perceptions. Still, they provide a useful starting point. With the exception of the ESI social and institutional capacity indicator, which was calculated only for 2005, the data used here refers to 2006. How do estimates of civil society strength relate to the corruption rankings? Figure 7.1 shows a scatter plot for values on the Corruption Control Index (CCI) and the Voice and Accountability indices for 2006, presented for the Asia-Pacific countries for which data are available. This indicates that countries with a marked tendency for stronger voice and accountability are more effective at corrup- tion control. The slight increasing slope suggests that the benefits may even increase at a positive rate. The result should however be treated with caution. Both variables are likely to be influenced by other factors not measured here, and there is no indication of the direction of causality. Still, the results are interesting because both variables originate in the same project and reflect the same methodology. The positive relationship could also result from the methods and assump- tions employed. However, it is reassuring that mapping the CCI with the ESI Institutional and Social Capacity measure, for those countries on which we have both the indices produces a similar result (Figure 7.2).

Australia, New Zealand and Japan lie to the upper right, while Myanmar anchors the less-favourable lower-left quadrant. On the other hand, countries such as Bangladesh and India, which hold competitive elections, lie toward the lower left of the plot or no higher than the middling areas. This suggests that where democracy is most effective at checking corruption it does not necessarily do so through the system-level \u2018hardware\u2019 such as elections but through the deeper ability to voice demands that are taken seriously by government \u2013 very much the role of CSOs. If that is so, then effective CSO action against corruption need not await the emergence of a fully-elaborated democratic system. Nevertheless, social restraints evidently do not tell the whole story; Bhutan and Lao PDR, with similar levels of institutional and social capacity, have quite different levels of corruption control.

The NGO, MKSS has developed a strategy, based on jan sunwai or \u2018public hearings\u2019. First it obtains official documents \u2013 for example, related to construc- tion records for school buildings \u2013 then it brings people from villages where the cons- truction works were said to have taken place and reads out the documents. It also invites local officials, giving them a spot on the podium and videos of the events to promote honesty and to add gravitas to the proceed- ings. Not infrequently, the official informa- tion is wrong, exaggerating the distance materials had been transported or the amount of work done. These hearings and the monitors road-building \u2013 examining the original plans then sending young people out into the field to discover what, if anything, was actually built, and if so, how well it was constructed.

Clean hands in Cambodia. In 2005, in partner- ship with a wide range of organizations, the NGO Pact Cambodia launched the \u2018Clean Hand Campaign Against Corruption\u2019. The campaign aimed to mobilize public support for anti-corruption efforts and increase the willingness of people to talk openly about corruption. The campaign involved publica- tions, radio shows, television, posters and many other materials, including stickers and t-shirts. New laws in the Republic of Korea. Over twenty national NGOs formed the Civic Solidarity Network for the Legislation of Law to Prevent Corruption. This law was proposed to parlia- ment in late 2000 through public hearings and enacted in June 200133 and resulted in the establishment of the Korea Independent Commission Against Corruption.34 Social auditing in Pakistan.

SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL CHAPTER 8: DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION 149 149 149 149 149 Chapter Chapter Chapter Chapter Chapter Driving Out Corruption Driving Out Corruption Driving Out Corruption Driving Out Corruption Driving Out Corruption 88888 Most of today\u2019s developed countries achieved greater control over corruption as a by- product of human development By the end of 2007, across the world, 104 governments had ratified or acceded to the United Nations Convention Against Corrup- tion. This is a heartening indication of a changing international mood, as well as a fresh commitment from many developing countries to tackle an age-old problem with greater urgency and determination. They have history on their side and particularly the experience of richer coun- tries. Over the centuries, most of today\u2019s developed countries achieved greater control over corruption as a by-product of the develop- ment process. Steadily, they built stronger institutions that operate within clearly defined systems of incentives and rewards, checks and balances, separation of powers as well as reduced red-tape. They also benefited from relatively engaged and free media and other organizations of civil societies, which moni- tored governments and exposed misdeeds. The process is certainly incomplete while the political and business landscape in developed countries is still regularly illumi- nated by the flares of high-level scandal and corruption. To some extent, governments have even legalized corruption as is seen in some types of permitted high-pressure lobbying. Nevertheless, it is now rare to see corruption on a large and systemic scale. The developed countries have also been able to reduce one of the principal causes of corruption: shortages. The day-to-day corrup- tion that affects daily lives of citizens is under check. Centuries of development in richer countries have contributed to an age of abundance. This is evident in health services. With the notable exception of a few, most advanced countries have health services that provide basic and inexpensive or free access for all. Electricity and water supplies too are widely available. Indeed, in countries where utilities have been privatized, one of the main problems is to have an actual sense of quality service \u2013 since standards are difficult to compare across competing providers \u2013 and fend off a barrage of sales calls from compe- ting providers. The situation remains very different in many developing countries of Asia and the Pacific where government institutions are often weak and thus susceptible to bribes from business interests, that take advantage of the greed of corrupt politicians or civil servants. At the same time, most public services and utilities remain plagued by extensive shortages, generating opportunities for officials to demand \u2018speed money\u2019 or \u2018grease money\u2019 to complete the simplest tasks; also resulting in \u2018survival corruption\u2019 among the poor. Even when dealing with some relatively modern corporations, customers can be expected to bribe employees to get a satisfactory service. Corruption may have been viewed in the past as unpleasant and unethical and probably unavoidable. Now across the Asia-Pacific region it is being pushed more into the foreground and challenged as being damaging and unacceptable. Governments and civil society, at national and international levels, are finding new ways to drive out corruption, working both from the bottom up and top down. ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 150 150 150 150 150 Today, genuinely combating corruption makes more political sense than ever before goods and services offered but also in the way they produce them.

Citizens are becoming increasingly impatient \u2013 expecting cleaner government and businesses \u2013 and governments are starting to respond. As ever, the first steps have been rhetorical. Sensing a change in voter mood, today\u2019s politicians in the Asia-Pacific region now find it worthwhile to place the fight against corruption high on their stated political agendas, to show that they are tackling corruption. Military leaders who in the past might have justified coups to \u2018save the nation\u2019 from allegedly dangerous political ideology, are now more likely to claim that they are seizing power to protect the public from corrupt politicians. A grave danger of this new \u2018coup dispensation\u2019 is that popular anger at official corruption can become a pretext for suppressing civil and political liberties, and, as a further consequence, even less public accountability. The growing distaste for corruption among citizens sends an impor- tant signal to democratic leadership \u2013 today, genuinely combating corruption makes more political sense than ever before. This is especially so in sectors like water and electricity, health and education, which not only confers credibility to the government, it also greatly promotes everyday citizen satisfaction, while helping achieve the MDGs and further human development. National political imperatives are being reinforced by international economic pressures. The Asia-Pacific region is now the heartland of globalization. Its largest manufacturing and service corporations are major players on the world stage. Having achieved global reach, they also have to meet global standards, not just in the quality of the CHAPTER 8: DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION DRIVING OUT CORRUPTION 151 151 151 151 151 The Report has identified three areas to consider for focus \u2013 the police, social services, and natural resources through communications technologies, is creating new opportunities across Asia and the Pacific. How can the countries of the region best seize the moment? As this Report has illustrated, there is no one route or single answer. Action has to come from many directions. Governments can achieve a great deal by establishing a legal framework, strengthening public institutions and building systems of control to ensure that their administrations operate openly and trans- parently. These systems will work best if they are supported by many elements of civil society, and in particular by NGOs and the media, which can monitor government and businesses and help keep them honest. Action, thus, has to come simultaneously from above and below. Any faltering resolution at the top needs to be propped up by ongoing pressure from below \u2013 from a civil society that is aware, expects change, and that can rely on free and competitive media for whom exposing corruption is both a duty and an opportunity. This combination of pressure from above and from below \u2013 a \u2018sandwich situation\u2019 that triggers a symbiotic relationship, each strengthening the other1 \u2013 can dissuade potential corruptors and the corrupted from pursuing immediate gain at the cost of institutions.

Politicians, civil society leaders and businessmen/women who work to combat corruption can also point to the huge political and economic dividends on offer. Politicians, for example, who can claim credit for rooting out corruption from sectors like water and electricity, health and education, can derive fresh sources of legitimacy from a more satisfied electorate. And businesses that align themselves with higher standards of corporate governance can devote their energies to boosting their own growth and profits legitimately rather than seeing their investment funds leech away unproductively into the pockets of corrupt officials. At the same time, governments and civil society organizations working to combat corruption will also be sustaining democratic governance. For just as democracies can be undermined by corruption, so they can also be fortified by effective, transparent, and closely monitored national institutions that sustain their integrity within interlocking systems of checks and balances. Empowering people through citizen education is the foundation for prevention that can reduce the extent of catch now and punish later. Setting the Priorities Setting the Priorities Setting the Priorities Setting the Priorities Setting the Priorities Nevertheless, addressing corruption can be a daunting proposition. Governments may find themselves facing a broad array of complex and difficult issues, while lacking the funds and personnel to respond effectively. There is always the danger therefore that the responsibility of fighting corruption will fall on the shoulders of a small number of honest but already overburdened officials. It may be better therefore to focus initially on a few specific areas. Naturally those priorities will depend very much on national circumstances. Across a region as vast and diverse as Asia and the Pacific, the approaches will often differ radically from one country to another. The Report has identified three areas to consider for focus \u2013 the police, social services, and natural resources \u2013 as, from a human development perspective, one criteria is clear: governments should be seeking ways ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 152 152 152 152 152 Governments should be seeking ways of reducing the forms of corruption that hit the poor the hardest All countries in the region should join the United Nations Convention Against Corruption of reducing the forms of corruption that hit the poor the hardest. Hauling the rich and powerful before the courts may grab the headlines, but the poor will benefit more from efforts to eliminate the corruption that plagues their everyday lives. Countries could make immediate progress by identifying and dealing with some of the worst areas, whether in health services, education or in public utilities, and thus improve the access of the poor to essential services. This will also have immediate political dividends. Education, in particular, also is a means to help prevent corruption, including its inter-generational spread. Some of this type of corruption is termed \u2018petty\u2019 in the literature. But this is clearly a misnomer. The dollar amounts may be relatively small, but the demands are incessant, the number of people affected enormous, and the share of incomes of the poor high. Another priority should be addressing corruption within police forces. This is partly because of the immediate damage it causes, since corrupt police officers are in a uniquely powerful position \u2013 able to back demands for bribes with physical or sexual violence \u2013 but also because addressing corruption within the police and justice systems can pave the way for dealing with corruption elsewhere. Improving police services so the personnel are seen as friends of honest citizens can greatly reduce the sense of fear and injustice among the poor. Natural resources need prioritized atten- tion as well before it is too late, especially where they are the backbone of livelihood for the poor. With the growing international recognition on the degradation of the environ- ment and climate change, there is little time to lose in preserving our natural resources. Even when governments have laws in place for managing the utilization of forests, fisheries, land and minerals, corruption can undermine such legislation because of the huge profit potential. The worst affected are people in remote locations and the poor.

Through UNCAC, both developed and developing countries can cooperate to develop a common understanding of corruption issues and devise a coherent set of strategies. By acting together they can also frustrate corrupt indi- viduals and corporations who seek to exploit differences in national laws and procedures. In addition, member countries can support each other in building technical capacity \u2013 establishing links between complementary institutions and strengthening prosecuting agencies, while establishing broad frame- works for prevention. Another important international opportu- nity is afforded by the Stolen Assets Recovery (StAR) Initiative, a partnership between the World Bank and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, which allows developing countries for the first time to recover \u2013 from safe havens in developed nations \u2013 assets that have been stolen by corrupt leaders. Despite the value of these two inter- national agreements, they are still far from achieving universal acceptance.

In the Asia Pacific the proportion is even lower, 10 out of 35, so there is still a long way to go. Thus, in addition to action by governments, CSOs and the media could join the debate to make constructive suggestions in addressing the concerns of governments. 2. Establish Benchmarks of Quality 2. Establish Benchmarks of Quality 2. Establish Benchmarks of Quality 2. Establish Benchmarks of Quality 2. Establish Benchmarks of Quality To reduce corruption, governments will want to design public institutions that incorporate the necessary controls, checks and balances. This is a difficult task. So, to judge their success, a starting point could be international benchmarks \u2013 standards that have been set around the world for different types of organizations. These can be tailored to country contexts. Benchmarks can apply, for example, to anti-corruption agencies, using indicators that reflect the methods for appointing the head of the agency, the security and independence of its funding, and its staffing levels. The effectiveness of anti- corruption agencies can also be assessed by the number of offices or sectors that are immune from investigation, the protection that they afford to whistle-blowers, and the proportion of complaints that they investigate. Similar indicators could be devised for other institutions that have a strong bearing on corruption, such as the offices of the auditor general. There can also be benchmarks for national media \u2013 press, radio, TV and the internet \u2013 on characteristics that affect their ability to expose corruption. These could include type of ownership, editorial independence, freedom from censorship and the extent of competition. These and other benchmarks can help assess gaps and deficiencies and indicate what it would take to remedy them. 3. Strengthen the Civil Service 3. Strengthen the Civil Service 3. Strengthen the Civil Service 3. Strengthen the Civil Service 3. Strengthen the Civil Service Countries with high levels of corruption generally have weak civil services, with underpaid and under-trained staff. This is a difficult issue, since raising standards or wages may require significant investment beyond the budgets of poorer countries. It may, however, be possible to raise salaries to levels that are at least closer to those prevail- ing in the private sector. But all governments should be able to create public bodies such as civil service commissions that can oversee recruitment and ensure that appointments and promotions are based on merit, not favouritism. These measures would need to be complemented by rigorous systems of monitoring and control that can detect corruption swiftly and punish it severely. While it is necessary to strengthen national civil services, what is probably more important is to build capacity at the local level. A number of countries in the region are decen- tralizing many functions to lower tiers of govern- ment, but find that local officials or institutions lack the necessary funds or skills. Combined with weak systems of monitoring and control, this can lead to higher levels of corruption. Governments and donors will clearly need to invest much more in local government.

Information techno- logy and e-governance, however, offer fresh opportunities to make administration more open, transparent and neutral, reducing the layers and number of face-to-face interac- tions, thus breaking the monopoly of corrupt officials and allowing citizens to keep abreast of administrative processes. Information technology has already shown its value in a number of countries by speeding up court processes and systems of land registration. It is also, for example, allowing public utilities to establish \u2018one-stop shops\u2019 where all the elements required to achieve a new power connection are brought together for their convenience, without having to traipse from one office to another with multiple bribes harvested en route. Public IT projects can have their problems. Often they are overly ambitious and costs can spiral out of control. There is always the risk that officials may exploit the systems for their own corrupt purposes. But relatively modest IT systems can help to limit the exces- sive discretion of officials and help reassure citizens that they will be treated fairly. Information technology is one of the key components of right to information processes, since responding over the internet can dramatically reduce information publishing costs. Here too there are hazards, notably the risks of releasing floods of electronic documents that make it difficult to discern the critical facts and figures. This is an area where NGOs and the media can play an important part, training both themselves and the public on how to sift and analyze the data. New technology can also contribute to better monitoring of natural resources, through satellite imaging, and even at a more modest level using digital cameras to monitor the daily performance of education and health services. example, strengthening codes of conduct for business associations and professional bodies, as well as voluntarily enlisting with the UN Global Compact. Among the professions, the most critical ones for corruption are those of lawyers and accountants \u2013 without them, large scale corruption, specially that which crosses national borders, would not be possible. In the codes of conduct, at both national and international levels, they could incorporate ways to specifically take account of corruption and establish appropriate guidelines. Services of senior lawyers, accountants and professional associations could be utilized for this for better self-regulation and ensuring that the codes of conduct are well publicized. 5.

They now have some tried and tested models to follow, including that of India, which has one of the most progressive acts in the developing world. However, fulfilling the right to informa- tion requires much more than legislation \u2013 it also demands a new public ethos of openness. From the outset therefore, public officials need to be engaged and convinced about the value of RTI and develop the capacity to deal with requests promptly and appropriately. At the same time, the media and other parts of civil society have to learn how to use RTI sys- tems responsibly.

Support Citizen Action Some of the most striking successes in addressing corruption have occurred where local organizations have taken the initiative to monitor public works and investigate the extent to which officials and contractors have fulfilled their commitments. This has enabled civil society organizations, local communities and local governments to work together to supervise public projects. Given that local governments usually have a limited capacity to monitor projects themselves, they could take greater advantage of these opportunities by regularly publishing the basic information on contracts to facilitate citizen auditing. At the same time there are many other actions that people can take as individuals to combat corruption \u2013 asking questions \u2013 resisting demands for bribes, reporting the activities of corrupt officials and refusing to deal with corrupt businesses. TTTTTaking the Higher Path aking the Higher Path aking the Higher Path aking the Higher Path aking the Higher Path The developing countries of Asia and the Pacific are likely to shed many corrupt prac- tices, in both government and business, as a natural by-product of modernization. How- ever, they do not have to wait for development to take its course for this. Nor should they. Just as most countries in the Asia-Pacific, in order to improve the conditions of their poorest communities, are designing targeted policies and programmes to eliminate poverty and meet the other MDGs, so too can they devise programmes specifically to tackle corruption. As we have seen in this Report, some are already doing so. Indeed this focus on corruption serves a similar purpose, since corruption can hinder WHAT INDIVIDUALS CAN DO The primary responsibility for tackling corruption lies with governments. However with cooperation from businesses and civil society organizations that have the resources and the skills to carry out the necessary changes, individuals also have the power to contribute. What can individuals do? As citizens and consumers, some of the ways in which people can use their power include: Know your rights. Learn about your legal rights and entitlements such as the right to information or eligibility under government schemes. Exercise consumer power. Patronize only businesses you believe to be behaving ethically and responsibly; your money is your economic vote. Encourage politicians fighting corruption. Vote for people who vow to tackle corruption and check whether they are following through on their promises. Support community groups who check local services. This would include, for instance, parent-teacher associations to watch over the conduct of school management and neighbourhood groups which monitor social services. Learn how to file complaints. Find out how to lodge complaints against corrupt services, whether directly or through NGOs, trade unions, or business organizations. Report corruption. Take the time to report any instance of corruption you have encountered, however minor. Resist demands for bribes. While it may seem easier to pay bribes to sidestep red tape or gain quicker access, in the long run almost everyone loses.

In the context of corruption, bribing a police constable for a traffic violation is corruption, but when the same constable leaves a roadside caf\u00e9 after a snack without paying, it may be seen as perfectly natural. In fact if the constable insists on paying, that may be considered odd, even suspicious \u2013 perhaps a raid is being planned? 5. For example, in rural India the poor may think it is perfectly legitimate to draw water from pipelines that take water to the city (making unauthorized holes in the pipes with the knowledge of field staff of the water board \u2013 even paying them a \u2018fee\u2019) when the pipes pass through wayside villages without serving them. But the city dwellers, and even the water board, would consider such local collusion a form of corruption - field staff collecting bribes in return for turning a blind eye to the water theft and damage caused to the infrastructure. 6.

The indicators are grouped into three broad categories: (1) popular measures of corruption, (2) political economy conditions that could be linked to corruption, and (3) socio-economic factors. This last category includes the human development index (HDI) and indicators relating to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Data Cov Data Cov Data Cov Data Cov Data Coverag erag erag erag erageeeee For the purposes of this report, countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region have been grouped into three categories: East Asia, South and West Asia, and the Pacific. The total number of countries and territories is 44: 18 from East Asia (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Hong Kong China (SAR), Indonesia, Japan, Korea Rep. of, Korea DPR, Lao PDR, Macao China (SAR), Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Viet Nam); 9 from South and West Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran Islamic Rep. of, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka); and 17 from the Pacific (Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia Fed. Sts., Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu). They are presented in alphabetical order within groups. Blanks (..) indicate non- availability of data. Data Sources and Inconsistencies Data Sources and Inconsistencies Data Sources and Inconsistencies Data Sources and Inconsistencies Data Sources and Inconsistencies The Regional Human Development Reports Unit is a user of datasets, not a producer. The Report draws from data produced by inter- national institutions with the resources and expertise to collect them. Data sources are given in abbreviated form at the end of each table, while the full citations are available in the statistical reference. These sources are UNSTAT online, The World Bank, UNDP Global HDR (not a data producer), Univer- sity of Maryland, Transparency International and International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) ratings by Political Risk Service (PRS) group. Use has also been made of online sources but URLs may change over time, which explains why the date of access of a given website is mentioned for all online sources. Because international sources often rely on data supplied by national authorities, there can be inconsistencies between the data reported by these two sources. There are several reasons for this. International data agencies often apply international standards and harmonization procedures to improve comparability across countries. When inter- national data are based on national statistics, as they usually are, national data may need to be adjusted. When data for a country are missing, an international agency may produce an estimate. Because of the difficulties in coordination between national and interna- tional data agencies, international data series may not incorporate the most recent data.

In addition, data are presented at different points in time, in order to capture trends over a longer period. Thus, the tables present data on most indicators at five-year intervals (i.e. 1990, 1995, 2000) and the latest year for which data are available for most countries. For example, the latest Corruption Perceptions Index refer to 2007 while some socio- economic indicators refer to 2004. The latest data for most indicators are for 2005. How- ever, data for all four reference points are not available for some indicators. This gap has been addressed, whenever possible, by report- ing data for the year nearest the reference points.

First, the World Bank\u2019s Control of Corruption Index (CCI), which captures corruption for a large number of countries, draws upon multiple sources of data. Second, another popular measure of corruption is the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) corruption risk ratings by the Political Risk Services (PRS) group. However, it primarily caters to business interests, which limits its use for broader analytical purposes. Third, perhaps the most popular measure of corruption is Transparency International\u2019s (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). This report does not make extensive use of the CPI because this index relies heavily on perceptions. The three indices are briefly discussed in the sections that follow. Control of Corruption Index Control of Corruption Index Control of Corruption Index Control of Corruption Index Control of Corruption Index The CCI, produced by the World Bank, measures the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain. This includes both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as \u2018capture\u2019 of the state by elites and private actors. It is based upon surveys of business leaders, public opinion and assessments by country analysts and is available for 213 countries and territories for the years 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002 to 2006. The CCI values are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one in each period. The values of the CCI range from minus (\u2013)2.5 to 2.5, with higher values indicating higher control of corruption; conversely, lower values indicate higher corruption. ICRG Corruption Score ICRG Corruption Score ICRG Corruption Score ICRG Corruption Score ICRG Corruption Score The ICRG corruption scores, produced by PRS, are assessments by staff and relate to actual and potential corruption in the INDICA INDICA INDICA INDICA INDICATTTTTORS ORS ORS ORS ORS 185 185 185 185 185 1 For detailed discussion, See Hawken and Munck 2007. following forms: excessive patronage, nepo- tism, job reservations, \u2018favour-for-favours\u2019, secret party funding and suspiciously close ties between politics and business. The ICRG corruption scores are available for 146 countries from 1984 to 2006. The scores range from 0 to 6, where 0 indicates the highest potential risk of corruption and 6 indicates the lowest potential risk for any country. Higher corruption signifies that high government officials are likely to demand special payments and that illegal payments are generally expected throughout lower levels of government. This can transpire in the form of bribes connected with import and export licenses, exchange control, tax assessment, police protection or loan transactions. Corruption Perceptions Index Corruption Perceptions Index Corruption Perceptions Index Corruption Perceptions Index Corruption Perceptions Index The CPI, produced by TI, is a composite index that draws upon surveys of business people and assessments done by country analysts. The CPI ranks countries in terms of the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians. The CPI started with 41 countries in 1995 and expanded to 180 countries in 2007. The CPI values vary from 0 to 10.

There are also grounds for believing that measures may reflect certain observable factors, such as poverty or poor economic performance, which are assumed to be consequences of corruption and hence used to impute (backwards) the presence of corruption. In either case, because measures are not firmly rooted in first-hand experience with corruption, it is hard to have strong confidence in comparisons of percep- tion-based measures of corruption, over time. Then there is the issue of sample design and the design (and wording) of question- naires. Because \u2018corruption\u2019 can mean many things, questions that use this word without defining it, are of little use in an attempt to estimate the level of corruption across countries or over time. Indeed, it is hard to compare the responses from vaguely worded questions in any meaningful way. Yet such practices are common in questionnaires used to gather data for popular measures. Like- wise, when different questionnaires that use different questions are used to produce an index, the lack of uniformity weakens the basis for comparison. The desire to construct indices of broad empirical scope and to develop time series is understandable and such attempts deserve to be supported.

The survey was carried out on behalf of TI by Gallup International, as part of the Voice of the People Survey between July and September 2006. An interesting features of the GCB is that it measures the perception of corruption in different sectors/public institutions, such as: politician/political parties; parliament/ legislature; police; legal system /judiciary; tax revenue; business/private sector; medical services; media; education system; utilities; registry and permit; services; the military; NGOs; religious bodies. These measures are ratings on a scale of 1 (not at all corrupt) and 5 (extremely corrupt).

Finally, sample sizes and the respondent pool of the surveys used to generate indices also vary considerably, raising yet new questions about comparability. The need for further work to develop and consistently apply an instrument suitable for measuring corruption across time and space must be duly recognized.

The values of this measure vary between \u201310 (strongly autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic). Durability of Current Political Regime Durability of Current Political Regime Durability of Current Political Regime Durability of Current Political Regime Durability of Current Political Regime Produced by the Centre for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland, this indicator refers to the number of years since the most recent regime change or the end of a transition period defined by the lack of stable political institutions. The first year of the new regime is given the value 0. Each subsequent year adds one point. One must note that durability of the regime does not imply changes in the political party in power but the number of years since the last substantive change in authority characteristics. Military in Politics Military in Politics Military in Politics Military in Politics Military in Politics The PRS produced this measure which is based on the premise that military involve- ment in politics (even at the peripheral level) diminishes democratic accountability, since the military are not elected by anyone. The values of this indicator vary between 0 and 6. Lower values indicate a greater degree of military participation in politics and a higher level of political risk.

Government Stability Government Stability Government Stability Government Stability Government Stability This indicator, produced by the PRS, represents an assessment both of the government\u2019s ability to carry out its declared programme(s) and its ability to stay in office. The indicator is composed of three sub- components: government unity; legislative strength; popular support.

Democratic Accountability Democratic Accountability Democratic Accountability Democratic Accountability Democratic Accountability The PRS-produced indicator of democratic accountability is a measure of how responsive a government is to its people. Its essential message is that the less responsive it is, the more likely the government is to fall, peace- fully in a democratic society, but possibly violently in a non-democratic one. The values depend on the type of governance experienced in a particular country.

Law and Order Law and Order Law and Order Law and Order Law and Order Law and Order, produced by the PRS, are assessed separately, with each sub-component comprising 0 to 3 points. The law sub- component is an assessment of the strength and impartiality of the legal system, while the order sub-component is an assessment of popular observance of the law. Thus, a country can enjoy a high rating of 3 in terms of its judicial system, but a low rating of 1 if it suffers from a very high crime rate or if the law is routinely ignored without effective sanction (i.e. widespread illegal strikes). The values of the indicator vary between 0 and 6; higher values indicate greater strength and implementation of the legal system.

Notes: Extent of Democracy: The values vary between \u201310 (strongly autocratic) to +10 (strongly democratic). Durability of current political regime: Does not imply change in the political party in power but the number of years since the last substantive change in authority characteristics. The first year of the new regime is given the value=0. Each subsequent year adds one. Military in Politics: Values vary between 0 and 6.

High marginal tax rate. A high marginal tax rate creates incentives for unscrupulous behaviour, including bribing of tax officials by individuals and business to avoid compliance. Indeed, low tax revenue (to GDP) in many developing countries is partly explained by tax evasion. \u2018Government imposes taxes to finance public services. But taxes must first be collected, and high tax rates do not always lead to high tax revenues. Between 1982 and 1999 the average profit tax rate worldwide fell from 46 per cent to 33 per cent, while profit tax collection rose from 2.1 per cent to 2.4 per cent of national income.\u20192 A recent public opinion survey by Global Corruption Barometer 2006 INDICA INDICA INDICA INDICA INDICATTTTTORS ORS ORS ORS ORS 225 225 225 225 225 for corruption. \u2018Enforcing a simple contract in India takes 56 procedures and almost 4 years.

By the time the judge decides the case, the defendant\u2019s assets have disappeared.\u20196 Level and nature of public expenditure. A high share of public investment could also be an indicator of high vulnerability to corruption among public officials: there is considerable evidence of massive corruption in public procurement (contracts), poor quality of materials and work and widespread petty corruption in the public sector. Because military expenditures are exogenously determined and are out of public scrutiny, this is an area that offers much opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour, including grand corruption stemming from military deals. Inequality. The literature suggests that inequality and corruption are linked: \u2018High inequality and strong and distinct differences in power define the structural and cultural setting in which corruption takes place \u2013 grand corruption as well as corrupt exchanges at the lower ranks of society.\u20197 Further, it seems that the link between corruption and inequality is not direct: \u2018There is a causal spiral from inequality to corruption (and back) and from both inequality and corruption to low levels of trust and from low levels of . . .", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc9b9af8-31d2-4fc4-8787-20af3abe099f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc9b9af8-31d2-4fc4-8787-20af3abe099f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9be320a3b655a0649742c015e1b1101c6ae9e9e3c74e97e169a51acbc17ad532"}, "2": {"node_id": "84e87886-674c-42ef-9ce5-b84bd6848cb9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a9d38d37f9140f157bcfc494340413101a21da61d2f4658d33635179d8ccecb"}}, "hash": "54df11f85edfb24d9daacd4e2f52c0f5f4685f8729c1e0fd07afc05a424908cb", "text": ". . trust to corruption.\u20198 To capture this phenomenon, inequality is proxied by the ratio of the income share of the top 20 per cent to that of the bottom 20 per cent. Access to services. The empirical literature suggests that there is pervasive corruption in basic public services, such education and health: \u2018Cross-national studies on the relationship between corruption and health and education outcomes find that health and education outcomes are worse in countries with high levels of corruption.\u20199 There is a significant relationship between corruption and child mortality. People who do not have access to safe drinking water source are likely to indulge in corrupt transactions to secure this basic necessity. Similarly, scarcity of medical practitioners found tax institutions to be the third most corrupt public institution in Asia-Pacific countries.3 Trade policy.

It follows that the degree of openness to foreign trade should be an important factor in determining the level of rent-seeking activities, or the extent of corruption.\u20194 Thus, regulatory trade policies that restrict exports and imports or, more generally, that restrict market access to the rest of the world, affect business and the allocation of resources. Restrictions imposed by the rest of the world often induce exporters to adopt corrupt practices to gain market access in other countries. Regulatory and transaction costs. Multiple procedures (numerous gatekeepers) and high transaction costs can encourage corruption. Regulations create opportunities for rent-seeking, which mean that bureaucrats have to be bribed \u2018to do what they are supposed to do\u2019 (to avoid delays in processing of documents) and also \u2018to do what they are not supposed to do\u2019 (to bypass rules and regulations that have high transaction costs).5 In terms of starting up a business, World Bank (2006) notes, \u2018[C]umbersome entry procedures mean more hassle for entrepreneurs and more corruption, particularly in a developing country. . . . Each procedure is a point of contact \u2013 an opportunity to extract a bribe.\u2019 Similarly, if the registration of property is a complex, time- consuming and difficult task, it is, in effect, an incentive for assets to remain in the informal sector. Such assets cannot be used as collateral; property values are also lower if formal titles do not exist. Similarly, if contracts can easily be enforced this encourages entrepreneurs, since it narrows the space ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT ASIA-PACIFIC HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 226 226 226 226 226 and of essential medicines creates fertile grounds for corruption. Corruption in the education sector is widespread and may take many forms, including procurement of basic materials and services, contracting, poor quality of services, absenteeism and \u2018ghost teachers\u2019, bribes for admission and even certificates, etc. Gupta et al. (2000), using univariate regressions, show that corruption is correlated with school enrolment, repeater (failure) rates, dropout rates, continued schooling through grade five and illiteracy. The coefficient for dropout rate is 0.36; for illiteracy and the repeater rate, it is 0.24. Education is also critical for access to resources and opportunities. Higher access to public institutions increases awareness about public programmes creates pressure among the public officials for improving transparency and accountability and encourages public debates about policies. There is also some evidence that improvement in education increases pressure (voice) from below. A fine example of this is work of a grass root, mass-based initiative organization in India, known as Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS), which was instrumental in the creation of Right to Information Act. MKSS \u2018walked from village to village asking simple questions: Did the people know the amount of funds that was coming to their village for development? How was the money that came from different sources actually spent? Although these questions were simple, the poor and impoverished of India had never dared to ask.\u201910 In short, MKSS armed the poor with knowledge that led to greater access to information, which, hopefully, will have a negative impact on corruption. The other side of the coin is also true: a high rate of illiteracy mean that people will not be able to scrutinize public programmes, and therefore, vulnerability to corruption is high. Dependence on natural resources. Natural resources exploration is an extremely high rent-seeking activity, possibly because a significant share of the revenues accrues direct to the government. Collier (2007), discussing what he calls the natural-resource dependence trap, pointed out that a centralized source of easy and unaccountable cash is detrimental to a fledgling democracy because it creates patronage machines and lowers the pressure to develop a social contract that comes with effective taxation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc92db1b-9220-40fb-aaf9-f1c25325d432": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc92db1b-9220-40fb-aaf9-f1c25325d432", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90fd8c5a247a0193832c82b12507f000e14db49992fee4e318b6584109a72df8"}, "2": {"node_id": "d13f9f99-8517-464b-9624-010c593f2e8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "918f5c3e29a1746fd2a4ad29cf6c4207352cc06a5225e1c41a39aeedf49b39c4"}}, "hash": "5aafd16329666e2db572dcd417cd6eaf699293f7611c50a486e3911ebbc4cec6", "text": "The associated increase in rent-seeking opportunities may help to explain the paradox Sachs and Warner (1995) noted: a negative relationship between natural resource abundance and long-run economic growth.

The information revolution (internet, telephone and mobile phones) has substantially improved access to information in most Asia-Pacific countries, particularly during the last decade. The diffusion of technology increases public awareness about the government programmes and helps to increase access to public services and reduces irregularities in distribution. Relative wages in the public sector. Much has been said about the link between low public sector wages and corruption. Mauro (1997) noted that \u2018when civil service pay is low, civil servants may be obliged to use their positions to collect bribes as a way of making ends meet, particularly when the expected cost of being caught is low.\u2019 Incentive structures thus become critical in the fight against corruption. One such incentive is efficiency wages according to which firms sometimes pay above-equilibrium wages to boost worker produc- tivity.12 Van Reickenghem and Weder (1997) uses efficiency wages to argue that, under certain circum- stances, higher wages in the public sector can deter corruption by increasing the potential loss resulting from detection. Using data on some 25 countries, this study finds a significant impact of the public-private wage differential on the level of corruption. Rauch and Evans (1999), in a study covering 35 developing countries, present quantitative evidence to demons- INDICA INDICA INDICA INDICA INDICATTTTTORS ORS ORS ORS ORS 227 227 227 227 227 trate that corruption is higher in countries where civil service recruitment and promotion procedures rely less on merit-based considerations. Importance of FDI/ODA. High foreign investments may make a country more vulnerable to corruption, especially \u2018grand corruption\u2019 involving businesses and politicians. In fact there is a high correlation between corruption and FDI in countries with high levels of centralized corruption and state capture. Eggar and Winner (2005), studying 73 developed and less developed economies, observed that \u2018corruption is a stimulus for FDI, on the grounds that corruption can be beneficial in circumventing regulatory and administrative restrictions.\u2019 In other words, there is \u2018a clear positive relationship between corruption and FDI\u2019. Wu (2006), studying cross-border direct invest- ment, used a distance measure of corruption between host and source countries and finds that \u2018corruption distance\u2019 deters cross-border investment. Multina- tional firms with the capacity to engage in bribery do so whether or not there is transparency; those accus- tomed to operating in transparent environments find it difficult to overcome the administrative complexities in corrupt environments. Others find a negative relationship between corruption and FDI (using the CPI as the measure of corruption) Lambsdorff (2005) argues that grand corruption deters investors for less than petty corruption because the former is more predictable than the latter. It is plausible that \u2018tax heavens\u2019 and \u2018special economic zones\u2019, which are prevalent in Asia, create adequate space for corruption because they invite investors with a series of concessions. Nevertheless, the jury is still out on link between corruption and FDI. ODA is also prone to corruption, as the literature on the link between ODA and growth suggests. If aid is given to corrupt regimes, then it can \u2013 and does \u2013 lead to corruption. \u2018Too often, aid money is diverted for personal use. But some of it also ends up funding subversive activities \u2013 including unjust wars \u2013 in sub-Saharan Africa.\u201913 Informal sector. The \u2018informal sector\u2019, for the purposes of this discussion, encompasses small-scale manufac- turing, trade and transport services and other services that are not counted by the formal sector. Particularly in less developed countries, and even in developed ones, a relatively large number of firms operate in an informal fringe. While these firms have the capacity to place their products in the markers, they do not pay taxes and go largely unnoticed by the authorities. The very existence of the informal sector suggests that entry into the formal sector is regulated or excessively costly. \u2018This immediately suggests that corruption or administrative inefficiency could be on the basis of such phenomenon. Anecdotal as well as documented evidence suggests that corruption, the informal sector and government behaviour play an important role in the determination of welfare and growth in a developing economy, if not an advanced one.\u201914 De Soto (1989, 2000) notes that start-up costs and red tape are a major determinant of the size of the informal sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e40fe910-0bf0-4db1-9cff-1c93b5d67065": {"__data__": {"id_": "e40fe910-0bf0-4db1-9cff-1c93b5d67065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ac46f3fd0837b77bf751f9dc0cb89d3cd5f3fe815928adbd866dd3ad7b317a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4891f79c-d4af-4cc4-a454-52880c560d76", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2008-tackling-corruption-transforming-lives", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7690ceeaa6f708b9234b1d090290df9019262a5a00e3e9890acacf395d1fa374"}}, "hash": "6af2d52ebc10db19f3c874cfeedf1f0b1f409280792b70348ce19c71cdad5c69", "text": "Bureaucrats, in an effort to maximize private gains, often have an incentive to set costly artificial barriers, which not only push firms underground but also has a negative effect on growth.

It has the same legal effect as ratification. Accession usually occurs after the treaty has entered into force. Anti-corruption agencies Separate, per- manent agencies with the primary function of providing centralized leadership in core areas of anti-corruption activity, including policy analysis and technical assistance in prevention, public outreach and information, monitoring, investigation, and prosecution. Bribery The act of offering someone money, goods or services in order to persuade him or her to perform an action, often illegal, in the interests of the person offering the bribe. Civil service Refers to the civilian employees of a government in the various ministries and includes teachers and policemen but not the military, judiciary or those employed in statutory boards or public enterprises. Clientelism An informal form of social organization characterized by \u2018patron-client\u2019 relationships between people of different social and economic status: a \u2018patron\u2019 (relatively powerful and wealthy) and his/her \u2018clients\u2019 (relatively less powerful and wealthy). The relationship includes a mutual but unequal exchange of favours, which can be corrupt. (Patrimonial and clientelist practices can institutionalize hegemonic elites and political corruption, often reaching the highest ranks of state power). Collusion A usually secretive act of cooperation or collaboration among two or more parties to mislead or defraud others (of their rights). Counterfeit drugs Medicines, which have been deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity and or source. Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insuffi- cient active ingredients or with fake packaging. Cronyism Favouritism shown in treatment of friends and associates, without regard to their objective qualifications; could be treated as a form of corruption. Cultural determinism Refers to a convic- tion that culture determines and dominates our behavioural and emotional approaches to issues of society and existence.

Gift economy An \u2018economic system\u2019 in which goods and services are given without any explicit agreement for immediate or future quid pro quo. Typically, a \u2018gift economy\u2019 occurs in a culture or subculture that emphasizes social or intangible rewards for generosity and gratitude. In some cases, simultaneous or recurring giving serves to circulate and redistribute valuables within a community. This can be considered a form of reciprocal altruism. Sometimes, there is an implicit expectation of the return of compara- ble goods or services, political support, or the gift being later passed on to a third party. Ghost institutions Institutions that show up on account books but do not actually exist anywhere. Examples include \u2018ghost schools\u2019 that process vouchers without providing education; a form of corruption. Ghost workers Staff that show up on account books but do not actually exist in reality. They are fictitious workers invented to siphon off resources by corrupt persons. Graft (Verb) To obtain money dishonestly by exploiting one\u2019s position of power or authority. (Noun) The rewards of corruption: the loot, booty, payoffs, or spoils.

Usually associated with petty corruption. Integrity system An integrity system is a political and administrative arrangement that encourages integrity (adherence to a set of moral or ethical principles). A country\u2019s National Integrity System (NIS) comprises the whole of government and non-governmental institutions, laws and practices that can, if functioning properly, minimize levels of corruption and mismanagement. The concept of NIS has been developed and promoted by Transparency International as a framework with which to analyse corruption in a given national context, as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of national anti-corruption efforts. Kickback An illegal secret payment made as a return for a favour or service rendered; a form of corruption. Lobbying An attempt to influence an out- come in favour of or against a specific cause, typically directed at government and elected officials. Money laundering The process whereby the origin of funds generated by illegal means is concealed so that it appears to come from a legitimate source.

Nepotism Granting offices, contracts and benefits to friends and relatives, regardless of merit. Perks Refer to entitlements or favours bestowed upon an individual based on the office/position held. Petty corruption Corruption involving smaller sums and typically involving more junior officials; also known as administrative corruption or retail corruption.

Petty corruption is bribery in connection with the implementation of existing laws, rules and regulations. Political will The demonstrated and credible intent of political actors to attack perceived causes or effects of corruption at a systemic level. Principal-agent model Explains how corruption occurs when an agent betrays the power entrusted in him/her by a principal to pursue his/her own interest by accepting or seeking a benefit from a service seeker, the client. Ratification Defines the international act whereby a state indicates its consent to be bound to a treaty if the parties intended to show their consent by such an act. Red tape Excessive formal rules and procedures, which increases the potential for corrupt interactions and impedes/retards people\u2019s access to public services. \u2018Speed money\u2019 is often paid to bypass red tape and speed up transactions.

The cover design plays on mathematical symbols to depict the relationships between men and women\u2014what they are and what should be. The equality symbol signifies that all people\u2014women, men and those with other gender identities\u2014are inherently valuable and ought to be equal members of the family and society. Other symbols\u2014unequal, less than, greater than, approximately equal\u2014draw attention to the presence of gender gaps, be they in public spaces, at work or in the home. About the separators Folktales and historical accounts provide a peek into society\u2014as it was or can be imagined. Asia-Pacific has a wealth of local stories, ideas and experiences from the past. The chapter separators present a few selected nuggets. A common thread is women\u2019s power and voice, their creativity and capability. Men are protagonists, not adversaries, in the search for equality, which benefits society as a whole. These short narratives complement and contrast with the Report\u2019s data and analysis, providing a lyrical break between chapters.

The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report (APHDR) is an important resource and instrument to explore critical development concerns. The Report thus informs policies from a human development perspective, putting people at the centre of development debates. As a regional public good, the APHDR focuses on issues that are of common concern to several countries in the region, have sensitivities that are better addressed at a regional level, or have clear cross-border dimensions. The APHDR is an independent intellectual exercise developed through a regional participatory process that draws from the contributions of many. The theme for each Report is also selected through consultations that include participants within and outside UNDP. The more nuanced focus of the Report is guided by substantive and diverse inputs that bring together Asia-Pacific stakeholders from governments, civil society, academia, research institutions, the media, the private sector and others.

About the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report v Since their inception in 2003, UNDP\u2019s Asia- Pacific Human Development Reports have been stimulating a lively dialogue within the region on a range of important issues. Prepared by experts from Asia and the Pacific, the Reports present an authentic account of human development progress, possibilities, and challenges in this vibrant and fast- growing region.

Despite the region\u2019s many economic gains, the Report chronicles how in many instances women across the region continue to be held back and disadvantaged. Even as many women have benefited from their countries\u2019 improved education, health, and prosperity, they continue to face barriers to the same opportunities available to men. The Report makes it clear that achieving gender equality promotes human develop- ment\u2014not only for women, but for whole societies, and is central to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Where we see progress towards these goals lagging the most is often where the needs and status of women and girls are accorded low priority. While recognizing that each country is unique and needs to develop its own Foreword responses, the Report calls upon policy makers to correct gender imbalances through a broad \u201cagenda for action\u201d across three areas: supporting the economic empowerment of women, promoting women\u2019s political voice, and advancing women\u2019s legal rights. Central to undertaking such efforts, the Report argues for unwavering political leadership across the board, and highlights also the need for men and boys to help foster attitudes and take actions to empower women. Like its predecessors, this is an indepen- dent Report commissioned by UNDP to contribute to human development discourse and policy debates in Asia and the Pacific. By highlighting that human development cannot be achieved if fifty per cent of the population is excluded from the opportunities it brings, UNDP hopes that the Report\u2019s insights will inspire further discussion, and inform the work of development practitioners and policy makers in the region and beyond as they seek to achieve gender equality. Helen Clark Administrator, UNDP The analysis and policy recommendations of this Report do not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations Development Programme, its Executive Board or its Member States. Mention of firm names and commercial products does not imply endorsement of the United Nations. The Report is an independent publication commissioned by UNDP. It is the fruit of a collaborative effort by a team of eminent experts, stakeholders, and the Human Development Report Unit (HDRU) team of the UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific, Colombo Office, led by Anuradha Rajivan. The Asia-Pacific region has witnessed remarkable economic progress and rapid development in recent decades, yet gender inequality remains entrenched even through this era of change. The region lags behind on gender parity on multiple counts, despite progress on several other dimensions. While overall indicators for economic prosperity, educational attainments and access to healthcare have improved for the region\u2019s population over the recent decades, gender gaps have not closed. Moreover, the region has seen divergent trends towards gender equality\u2014notably, while East Asia and the Pacific have made significant advances, South Asia\u2019s progress on many counts has been slow. A girl born in South Asia today still has very different life chances compared to her counterpart in East Asia in terms of health status, educational attainments or employment opportunities. All countries face challenges\u2014even those performing well on the income, health and education indicators. People, particularly women, continue to confront discrimination in jobs, disparities in power, voice and political representation, and laws that are prejudicial on the basis of their gender. This Asia-Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) interrogates how some countries in the region have succeeded in narrowing gender disparities more than others. It does this by engaging three arenas where public policy can make a difference by: \u2022 Building economic power \u2022 Promoting political voice \u2022 Advancing legal rights The Report engages these three areas to understand the persistence of gender Preface inequalities in the public domain, and pinpointing barriers that hold people back from realizing their potential as equal members of society. This report is not a document embodying a Utopian wishlist \u2013 instead, it provides concrete interventions in three specific domains, where public policies have demonstrated their potential. The proposals are timely\u2014we have a few years left to push for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and the recent global economic crises has forced policy makers to review what they consider conven- tional wisdom. Indeed, the global economic crisis and rapid development offers new opportunities to benefit both women and men, as governments search for economic growth drivers and seek to mobilize all available resources. Persistent gender inequa- lity continues to deprive the region of a signifi- cant source of human potential, and remains a barrier to progress, justice and democracy.

The Asia-Pacific region as a whole, especially South Asia, ranks near the worst in the world\u2014often lower than sub-Saharan Africa\u2014on basic issues such as protecting women from violence or upholding their rights to property, as well as on indicators in such key areas as nutrition, health, education, employment and political participation. Sub-regional disparities are striking. Overall, East Asia is pulling ahead of South vii Asia on progress toward gender equality. In the Pacific, a complex brew of customary laws, practices and constitutional provisions represents a key factor behind the subordi- nate status of women. Thus, the failure to realize equality on the basis of gender translates into fewer choices, increased human poverty and lower human development for everyone\u2014both men and women. The APHDR suggests a vision for pros- perity for the region that can be shared by all could arise from unleashing the potential of a hugely underutilized resource\u2014women\u2014to seize new opportunities amid the global economic downturn. Both men and women could then find innovative pathways to revitalize their economies and better their lives. Neglecting gender inequalities puts the region\u2019s progress towards the MDGs at peril\u2014while focusing on gender interventions now will fast-track efforts towards achieving the MDGs. The Report argues that gender equality is a right, gender equality is good economics, and gender equality promotes democracy. The ways of translating these into concrete path- ways are through building economic power, promoting political voice and advancing legal rights. Piecemeal efforts will not do: nor will gender equality automatically come about without sustained, comprehensive efforts and long-term commitment. A focus on achieving gender equality must be retained over time. Policymakers need to consider far-reaching systemic and institutional changes in addition to changes in mindsets. Without conscious efforts in these three areas, however, inequa- lities in the region are likely to widen. Building women\u2019s economic power requires removing discriminatory barriers to assets, prioritizing investments in health and education, expanding paid employment and making mobility safe for women. Promoting women\u2019s political voice can be viii achieved by instituting quotas for women representatives, training first-time leaders to improve the quality of participation, recog- nizing the \u2018women\u2019s vote\u2019 in political parties and adopting gender-friendly budgets. Legal equality for women can open the door to transformation in other spheres. Discriminatory laws should be changed and gaps filled, backed by diligent enforcement. Access to justice must be broadly available, whether that means taking justice to people through mobile courts or providing free legal aid. Bringing equality within reach requires political will and leadership. Greater capacity for effective policymaking is key. Progress must be rooted in local contexts. In line with the solution orientation of APHDRs, the Report recommends an agenda for action that requires transforming insti- tutions, changing attitudes and strengthening assessments. This multi-pronged agenda for action in economic, political and legal spheres includes: implement international commit- ments; craft economic policies to support gender equality; make the content of educa- tion, as well as access to education, more gender-equal; boost political participation; pursue gender-equitable laws; address legal discrimination and close gaps between laws and legal practice; collect better data and strengthen capacity for gender analysis; and foster new attitudes. The publication of this Report is espe- cially timely as we have crossed the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Elimi- nation of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The widening of equal choice and voice is the greatest enabler for fairness and quality of life. The Report provides an opportunity for the region as a whole to reflect on what has been accomp- lished for gender equality and, more importantly, what remains to be done and how to achieve it. It aims to catalyze discus- sions by providing the human development perspective with possible solutions from Asia-Pacific countries. Particular solutions will depend on every country\u2019s specific circumstances. The APHDRs have been engaged by a wide cross-section of partners and stake- holders contributing to their analyses, messages and usage. These reports are products of the robust process of galvanizing Asia-Pacific expertise, including consultations with stakeholders from all the three sub- regions\u2014South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific\u2014and preparation by an independent team.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92973c9f-0fac-4afc-8911-39941c12fb23": {"__data__": {"id_": "92973c9f-0fac-4afc-8911-39941c12fb23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2010: Power, Voices and Rights", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a8695ebcb353c3bee2294aa1b64bf99092af5c10610ddf3a5958fb5a140dfab"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6861e15-4f9d-4689-98b9-26ef26746fd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-human-development-report-2010-power-voices-and-rights", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "684ebf484787093769439aac1555c395f023cd00bbdd8827615cefc0f296b1a9"}}, "hash": "d986bf3873b2a25ac71a9bd802ea1efb6c34e1bba510ee18835b6d6f234c2678", "text": "This imparts the report with its independent voice and anchors it with its regional ownership.
