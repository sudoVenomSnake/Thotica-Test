A planetary emergen- cy and the pandemic have depleted the world\u2019s natural resources and widened poverty and inequality. Up to one billion people could be living in extreme poverty by 2030 unless we seize this opportunity for a decisive push towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But this is also a moment of choice: an op- portunity to learn from our experience, to do things differently, to aspire to greater shared goals. This new Strategic Plan 2022-2025 describes how UNDP intends to work togeth- er with our partners to deliver what\u2019s required of us in these extraordinary times. Collaborat- ing across the revitalized UN system and be- yond for stronger collective results. Applying integrated approaches aimed at transforma- tive change. Supporting governments and communities to rebound from COVID-19 and build forward better. The Strategic Plan is grounded in UNDP\u2019s continued commitment to eradicating poverty, accompanying countries in their pathways towards the SDGs and working towards the Paris Agreement. It envisions bold goals, making a difference to millions of lives, including through tackling multidimensional poverty, energy access, elections participa- tion and development financing. It explains how UNDP will develop our six signature solutions \u2013 powered by digitalisation, innova- tion and development financing \u2013 for greater impact. It sets out practical steps towards be- coming an even more agile and anticipatory organisation, investing further in our people, business model and operational excellence. The Plan describes how the combination of our deep local experience and our rich glob- al network, tapping into countries\u2019 knowledge and shared experience, delivers value to our partners. How we will foster innovation and creativity to help change systems and tackle the hardest challenges standing be- tween us and the SDGs. All this to scale and accelerate progress towards green, inclusive tran- sitions that empower every last person through greater opportunity and resilience. The Plan is the result of extensive collaboration with our many partners. I am immensely grateful to them, and to all our UNDP teams, whose contribu- tions have helped produce a Plan that truly reflects the diversity of all the countries, communities and people whom UNDP serves. I invite you to read the Plan itself and learn more. With your support and collaboration, together UNDP can work with countries to expand people\u2019s choices for a fairer, sustainable future, to build the world envisioned by Agenda 2030 with planet and people in balance.

Compounded by a climate emergency, political polarization and challenged multilateralism, continued conflicts and forced displacement, the number of people living in poverty rose in 2020 for the first time since 1998 by an estimated 119-124 million. Inequalities are growing, and the traditional social contract is no longer working for many. Today\u2019s development challenges are dynamic, interconnected puzzles of multidimensional risk that require systemic solutions. Multilateral cooperation is vital in addressing these shared challenges that cross boundaries of geography and time. No country has yet achieved the combination of very high human development with a light ecological footprint. The impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are growing. In this complex, uncertain landscape, the SDGs and the Paris Agreement offer clarity of purpose and a way forward. In the next four years, UNDP will work with countries to make a difference to millions of lives: 100 million people to escape multidimensional poverty 500 million people to gain access to clean energy over US$1 trillion 20,000 people 170 countries and territories of public expenditure and private capital investment in the SDGs at UNDP working together across 800 million people to participate in elections, many for the first time Promoting As the United Nations system technical lead on the socio-economic response to COVID-19, UNDP is supporting govern- ments in developing and implementing inclusive economic stimulus packages to restore the livelihoods of those newly poor, through combined interventions including health, education and digital access. In Viet Nam, UNDP is \u201cfuture-proofing\u201d governance systems through anticipatory approaches, and better understanding and management of risk. In Somalia, UNDP is helping strengthen community resilience to climate change and water scarcity by supporting water conservation infrastructure and education at local level, coupled with national policies on disaster risk reduction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d943fbc6-c08b-4f55-b737-4e2918cbb386": {"__data__": {"id_": "d943fbc6-c08b-4f55-b737-4e2918cbb386", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-strategic-plan-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Strategic Plan 2022-2025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-strategic-plan-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6523d6be931c8d7c386d91d045bbd4b9378bd3b3f2595a295ac3aaf4e303e244"}, "2": {"node_id": "0613d83a-a9f8-4475-a4f1-0289cfebf2a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-strategic-plan-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c4ac970b0410e371b37693f6394c68271c1904954450d90b89fe0aba1ee121a"}}, "hash": "01fd25df49ca70230f7f788cb18ccd62adf2f2b307b32c9603245e44839e734c", "text": "The Africa Mini-Grid Programme, supported by UNDP, is improving the financial viability of renewable energy mini-grids in 18 countries, encouraging private investment, lower tariffs and expanded service. 4 5 Helping Supporting Supporting Global COVID-19 response", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e87d8299-e7ae-4d61-9bd7-92119c803cfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e87d8299-e7ae-4d61-9bd7-92119c803cfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-strategic-plan-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Strategic Plan 2022-2025", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-strategic-plan-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "375f51c3fdb4c6a3c4da9995d1f75d970ef5bc080d556ef506ba7f732934d8a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "40247e1b-8f5e-4bbf-9626-1bb8cec3a16f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-strategic-plan-2022-2025", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd78212ad0e52b108601891706eace986e715a5d2c8bf4d03639654308bd8976"}}, "hash": "5d0af36feec2e3c6a6205924fec3b60b19f7030cf428b918421c971d95771f29", "text": "Beyond climate resilience Renewable energy at scale Governance for the future 6 7 What we do Development \ufb01nancing 2030 Agenda B u i l d i n g r e s i l i e n c e L e a v i n g n o o n e b e h i n d Structural transformation Poverty & inequality Governance Resilience Environment Energy Gender equality Global public goods Integrated development solutions driven by country priorities Digitalisation Strategic innovation UNDP\u2019s work is summarized in the Strategic Plan by this \u201c3x6x3\u201d framework: This combination will help UNDP continue to deliver on what it does best: integrated development solutions driven by country priorities. 3 DIRECTIONS OF CHANGE supporting countries towards three directions of change: structural transformation, leaving no-one behind, building resilience 6 SIGNATURE SOLUTIONS ENABLERS 3 through six signature solutions: poverty and inequality, governance, resilience, environment, energy, gender equality enhanced by three enablers: strategic innovation, digitalisation, development financing X X UNDP\u2019s development offer 8 9 Poverty and inequality Tackling inequality of opportuni- ties by investing in the enhanced capabilities people need to move above the poverty line and keep moving forwards.

Governance Helping countries address emerging complexities by \u201cfuture-proofing\u201d gover- nance systems through anticipatory approaches and better management of risk. Signature solutions Supercharged for greater results Learning from the experience of the last four years, UNDP will: \u22b2 Prioritize where country demands are greatest \u22b2 Focus on UNDP\u2019s strongest capabilities and role within the UN system \u22b2 Refine and develop the signature solutions for greater impact and scale \u22b2 Deliver integrated solutions through a systems approach Directions of change Guiding people and planet beyond 2025 During this Plan and beyond, UNDP will be accompanying countries towards the SDGs through country programmes, driven by national development choices, and with poverty eradication at their core. To this end, we support countries in pursuing three directions of systemic change: Structural transformation: including green, inclusive and digital transitions: working with countries to effect change in systems and structures that shape a country\u2019s sustainable development Building resilience: strengthening countries and institutions to prevent, mitigate and respond to crisis, conflict, natural disasters, climate and social and economic shocks Leaving no-one behind: a rights-based approach centered on empowerment, inclusion, equity, human agency and human development 11 Enablers Maximising development impact Enablers are capacities and approaches to scale-up development impact for country partners and within UNDP\u2019s own systems: Digitalisation Supporting countries to build inclusive, ethical and sustainable digital societies Development financing Partnering with governments and the private sector to align public and private capital flows with the SDGs and mobilise finance at scale Strategic innovation Empowering governments and communities to enhance the performance of entire systems, making them adaptive and resilient Global partnerships Forging connections for the SDGs Delivering results at the speed and scale needed to reach Agenda 2030 depends on close partnerships with a diverse range of actors working towards common goals. UNDP\u2019s longstanding partnerships leverage the diverse capabilities, resources and knowledge of our partners: MEMBER STATES UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CIVIL SOCIETY AND NGOS ACADEMIA PRIVATE SECTOR The next four years will see UNDP strengthening these existing partnerships and forging new ones.

Bureau for Asia and the Pacific Strategy, Policy and Partnerships POLICY BRIEF THE POST-COVID-19 FUTURE FOR GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 3 The global economy has seen a trend towards internationalized production through Global Value Chains (GVCs) over recent de- cades. However, developing regions differ greatly in the nature and extent of GVC integration. Like any production model, GVCs come with benefits and challenges. Narrow specialization and trading in tasks makes it possible to realize important efficiency gains, and to generate income and employment in a wide variety of source economies. But of course, sensible regulation is need- ed to ensure that GVC development is consistent with broader environmental and social goals. In particular, greater reliance on globalized networks of production and consumption makes it all the more important to ensure that robust social safety nets are in place domestically. While the COVID-19 pandemic put GVCs under stress, the main risk to the model\u2019s continued viability is political rather than economic or commercial.

The first is the geographical separation of production and consump- tion, visible in the growth of world trade post-1945: consumers became increasingly less reliant on na- tional sources of supply, while producers became increasingly less reliant on national markets for their output. More recently, the production process itself has undergone a similar disintegration. For much of the 20th Century, goods were largely produced in one place using domestic supply chains (even if shipped somewhere else for final consumption), but the latter part of the 20th Century and the first decades of the 21st have seen an important shift towards the inter- nationalization of production. From domestic supply chains, we have increasingly moved towards global value chains (GVCs), which divide production into dis- tinct units, split across locations according to narrow patterns of comparative advantage. Indeed the \u2018chain\u2019 terminology is something of a misnomer: GVCs, in fact, operate more like networks, in the sense that they are complex and nonlinear, rather than linear chains. Conceptually, a value chain \u201cdescribes the full range of activities that firms and workers do to bring a prod- uct/good or service from its conception to its end use and beyond. This includes activities such as design, production, marketing, distribution, and support to the final consumer\u201d (Frederick, 2016). A GVC, there- fore, arises when actors carry out these activities in different countries, rather than within the confines of a single country. As the International Trade Center (2017) points out, many GVCs are regional rather than global in scope, as they focus on firms within a single geographical region covering more than one country. True GVCs are most frequently the domain of very large firms that have the resources to research and coordinate suppliers from all over the globe, but the analysis of GVCs and regional value chains (RVCs) is conceptually very similar, so we combine them into a single analysis here, only drawing a distinction when it has analytical salience. From an analytical standpoint, the rise of GVCs favours a number of shifts in emphasis in thinking about trade and investment relationships (Cattaneo et al., 2013). On the one hand, spreading production activities across numerous countries tends to make countries somewhat less relevant as units of analysis, and firms somewhat more relevant. Of course, both remain relevant in an overall sense, but the change in relative emphasis is significant. Similarly, trade policy usually focuses on industries or sectors as economic aggre- gates, but GVCs make the paradigm of trading in tasks more relevant (Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008); the definition of activities becomes finer and incorporates services as goods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cdc2593-1dc1-423c-b330-eb1554985f7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cdc2593-1dc1-423c-b330-eb1554985f7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59d3e794ed39f34e96a368ec5574ebc0629acf4b2c944081766e36061404e789"}, "2": {"node_id": "db7920a9-e817-4419-89d8-36b34693809b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f27125afda82157b711f6d474cb9aeaed7fa7d99d156c3c48c15b6241901827"}}, "hash": "5e47a98aeb02dbe9b169e536aa0908541b08901bdfef38030c2eba674ca47c94", "text": "Finally, government policies remain important determinants of the location of economic activity, but the role of GVC lead firms means that private standards assume greater relative importance than in the past.

Baldwin presents the Republic of Korea as the paradigmatic case. The focus in the 2000s shift- ed towards joining existing value chains, rather than developing new ones from the ground up. Over time, countries shifted into higher value-added activities. Baldwin (2011) notes that China\u2019s use of its external sector to support rapid growth has had some elements of this approach, as has Viet Nam. In the GVC develop- ment model, specialization by comparative advantage takes place at the level of narrowly-defined tasks rath- er than sectors. Similarly, trade in intermediate goods and services takes on increased importance. GVCs operate as finely-optimized complex systems, with inventories reduced to low levels in order to reduce carrying costs, and reliance placed on sophisticated and efficient transport and logistics systems. While the policy world has seen extensive discussions of GVCs over recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has lent new salience to this process. On the one hand, the years since the Global Financial Crisis have gener- ally seen slower growth of world trade and GVCs than in the preceding decade or so. But, at the same time, political pressures in some leading economies have suggested that internationalized production may be seen as less desirable from the perspective of the do- mestic economy and society than was the case in the recent past. This questioning is reinforced by difficulties observed in some supply chains in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when initial shortfalls for prod- ucts, such as personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer, may have posed risks for public health. Stat- ing these issues by no means prejudges our response to them, but their prominence in public discussions INTRODUCTION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 5 increases the importance of bringing facts, data, and analysis into the discussion, with the aim of reaching a robust and nuanced understanding of the issues. Against this background, this brief seeks to provide further evidence about the economic and social im- plications of GVCs. In addition, it will chart out some forces that may influence GVCs\u2019 future development. It explicitly adopts the point of view of developing countries, by which we mean low- and middle-income countries as determined by World Bank data.1 The brief proceeds as follows. The next section discuss- es the measurement of GVC activity and provides some basic information on the nature and extent of GVC integration around the world. We then discuss econom- ic and social impacts of GVCs in more detail. We follow with a focus on trade policy, in particular the question of the extent to which recent moves by some large econo- mies can disrupt GVC development elsewhere. We then turn to the future, by addressing a selection of major issues that will influence GVC development over the medium term. The final section concludes by address- ing key findings and policy implications. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has lent new salience to discussions about the costs and benefits of global value chains\u201d For the World Bank 2021 fiscal year, low-income economies are defined as those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of US$1,035 or less in 2019; lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,036 and $4,045; upper middle-income econo- mies are those with a GNI per capita between $4,046 and $12,535; high-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $12,536 or more (World Bank, 2021a). 1 The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 Standard trade data do not give much help in identify- ing or measuring GVC trade.2 The reason is that they measure trade on a gross-shipments basis; for exam- ple, the recorded value of a mobile phone imported into Japan from China is the full shipped price of the mobile phone. However, if the mobile phone was pro- duced in a GVC, as is typically the case, then it embod- ies inputs from all around the world: the screen comes from one country, the processor from another, design services from another still, and pre-loaded apps from yet another.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaf92c48-dc84-4aa9-880e-e9d5030ce785": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaf92c48-dc84-4aa9-880e-e9d5030ce785", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cf6ab5bdd6b5854d5b3cbad06d08f714ff9d9b62bba39b4d56a59563a6d7d7c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1a3a7ca-c86c-4d1b-8370-8ff7de15fbec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f21de671f21e85fba90f1ee499da3857405d305817a6db5103179fd4fd29b961"}}, "hash": "519261b2aff59a7eb0e9104af353b89f32d98e921a0d8ab08acacf4933cac9e8", "text": "Measuring GVC trade would ideally iden- tify all of these instances of value addition separately, so that the number of exports recorded from China to Japan corresponds to the value added by Chinese firms.

For an individual product, one could conceivably identify the different sources of value added by tracing them through inter-firm linkages in the supply chain,3 but systematic application of the approach calls for more sophisticated methods. With this in mind, economists have developed a num- ber of approaches for measuring trade in value-added terms, in essence an attempt to reframe the available data so as to focus on movements of value added rather than the simple gross value movements cap- tured by standard sources. The operations involved are complex, involving a marriage of standard trade data and input-output tables. Given that reporting lags for detailed national accounts\u2014used to construct in- put-output tables\u2014trade in value-added data typical- ly only become available with a delay of some years from the relevant date. Still, they have already offered important insights into GVC growth and development since research in this area started in earnest in the early 2010s. The literature discloses two key summary measures of GVC integration that come from trade in value-added data. Backward participation captures the proportion of a country\u2019s gross exports accounted for by value added sourced elsewhere; that is, it summarizes the extent to which a country\u2019s gross exports embody inputs, both goods and services, sourced from abroad. Forward participation is the mirror image: the pro- portion of a country\u2019s gross exports used by other countries in order to produce their own exports; that is, the extent to which a country\u2019s gross exports are embodied in those of other countries. While there are numerous methodologies available to measure these linkages, all with subtle differences, one example suf- fices to provide a general impression of GVC spread and development. We use the methodology from Borin and Mancini (2019), as it appears in the World Bank (2020). Results are based on the Eora global input-output table, which currently extends to 2015 only, due to the reporting lag referred to above. Figure 1 provides a first cut of these data, focusing on differences across exporting regions. Experience varies considerably from one region to another, as evidenced, for instance, by different balances of back- ward and forward linkages in gross exports. The gen- eral finding, however, is the same: by 2015, GVC trade, by which we mean the total proportion of backward and forward linkages in gross exports, comprised at least one third of the total in all world regions, and as much as 50 percent or more in some cases. Between 2000 and 2015, the proportion of GVC trade in total exports grew in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean and North America. The two Asian re- gions, East Asia and the Pacific and South Asia, both saw increases in the proportion of GVC trade in total exports, particularly in South Asia. Within Asia, none- theless, GVC trade takes place primarily in East Asia and the Pacific; South Asia sees a more limited amount of this type of interaction, in keeping with the much lower level of regional integration. Moreover, the time period in Figure 1 masks two distinct evolutions: more rapid increase generally took place prior to 2009 rath- er than following it, in line with a general slowdown of global trade growth post-Global Financial Crisis. GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS: A DESCRIPTION OF THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY See Shepherd (2020) for a review of the methodological issues. For instance, Xing (2020) uses such an approach to show that Chinese firms contribute about 25 percent of the value-added in the iPhone X, with 45 percent coming from Japan, the Republic of Korea and other economies, and a significant proportion from the United States of America, as well. 2 3 The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 An important point to keep in mind is that, while GVC analysis first arose in the context of manufacturing sectors, such as electronics and motor vehicles, the phenomenon itself is actually ubiquitous across sec- tors, including primary industries and services. While intensities differ, GVCs have the scope to operate in most parts of the economy, in particular with the rise of digital technologies and more liberal policies that make services more tradable than in the past (e.g., Shep- herd, Forthcoming 1). Figure 2 provides some evidence to support this point, namely backward and forward linkages for each of the 26 sectors in the Eora data- base (for the most recent year of available data, name- ly 2015). It clearly shows that GVC trade is significant in all sectors, even some", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "924943be-5530-4513-9b5c-adaef272fbd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "924943be-5530-4513-9b5c-adaef272fbd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e93187cb2d082061cb863e624a20f6cea122fa3a086f7ee010c9b367680df55e"}, "3": {"node_id": "073fb03d-f91e-47b0-9e58-f56148e46c9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f15442c8a238c9c472ed39edf4b1b79c1152851d1d91820b031ad89e6046564"}}, "hash": "5470ef66da7ce6eddf601176d9841428e7c532b421fd02274e5f7f8a1dcf156a", "text": "services typically not provided commercially (where trade values are very low; the da- ta appear in proportional terms, which masks this fact).

Standout examples include transport equip- ment, electronics, and textiles and apparel. Special- ization varies from country to country, but in a global context, Asian countries have enjoyed notable success in these sectors. From a future standpoint, evolutions in consumer preferences towards environmentally-focused goods, such as electric vehicles or green energy products like solar cells, mean that existing value chains may need to retool to produce distinct, but re- lated, goods. Given the continent\u2019s history in the sec- tors in question, it would appear relatively well-po- sitioned to take advantage of new opportunities in these areas.

At the outset, it is im- portant to be clear about how to assess this question. The counterfactual benchmark is vital: Namely, what would the economic and social consequences be of restricting GVC trade relative to its actual observed levels? Stating the question in this way makes clear that it is not enough to highlight a particular negative consequence of GVC participation and to assume that restricting GVC development would eliminate that consequence; it could just as easily make it worse. So, the analytical question relates to the way in which the evidence shapes up as to the impact of a marginal change in GVC integration: Would it improve economic and social outcomes, or would it worsen them? From an economic perspective, the effects of GVCs are best understood as a particular case of the gains from trade and specialization. All of the standard arguments apply: trade results in lower prices and more variety for consumers, and larger markets for producers. But because GVCs also result in substantial changes to input sourcing, they also offer the prospect of productivity gains at the firm level, stemming from their ability to source the best inputs available globally. Despite the difficulty of teasing out causal effects, the anecdotal evidence is compelling. Hoekman and Shepherd (Forthcoming), comparing country-level pro- ductivity changes between 1980 and 2000 with those between 2000 and 2017, shows that productivity grew faster during the second period rather than the first in most low- and middle-income countries. Breaking down the same data by region shows that all coun- tries in South Asia and 86 percent of countries in East Asia and the Pacific likewise saw stronger produc- tivity growth between 2000 and 2017 than between 1980 and 2000, within the limits of the available data by country. So, the spread of GVCs at least coincides with a pick-up in productivity growth in the developing world, and the available evidence looking at GVC link- ages specifically, such as Alfaro-Urena et al. (2020) on Costa Rica, shows that the link is indeed causal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "073fb03d-f91e-47b0-9e58-f56148e46c9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "073fb03d-f91e-47b0-9e58-f56148e46c9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e93187cb2d082061cb863e624a20f6cea122fa3a086f7ee010c9b367680df55e"}, "2": {"node_id": "924943be-5530-4513-9b5c-adaef272fbd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5470ef66da7ce6eddf601176d9841428e7c532b421fd02274e5f7f8a1dcf156a"}}, "hash": "6f15442c8a238c9c472ed39edf4b1b79c1152851d1d91820b031ad89e6046564", "text": "(2020) on Costa Rica, shows that the link is indeed causal.

While the rise of large countries like China and India has played an important part in this develop- ment, it has had a much wider reach: Between 2000 and 2018, 56 percent of low-income countries, 51 percent of lower-middle-income countries, and 46 per- cent of upper-middle-income countries increased their share in world exports \u2014 meaning that their exports grew at a faster rate than world exports as a whole, and this during a period of unusually rapid global trade inte- gration (Hoekman and Shepherd, Forthcoming). A large literature using micro-data has arisen showing that firms that engage with the international economy, including through GVC linkages, tend to be larger and more productive than firms that focus on the domes- tic market only, and that they also pay higher wages to their workers than domestically-focused firms (e.g., Brambilla et al., 2017). Recent literature also shows that internationally engaged firms in developing countries tend to employ more women than firms that focus on the domestic market only (e.g., Shepherd, 2018; Rocha and Winkler, 2019). Results like these suggest that international engagement can have benefits for workers through increased employment rates and higher wages, which, in turn, can translate into gains in human wellbeing and enhanced capability. How does this technical literature sit with other work that emphasizes the sometimes-poor working condi- tions in some GVC sectors, such as apparel? Saxena (2020) brings together a collection of contributions looking at GVC governance in light of the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, while Blattman and Dercon (2017) use an experimental approach to highlight the limited benefits of factory work in Ethiopia relative to other opportunities, such as self-employment. From a social perspective, civil society should concern itself about ensuring safe and sanitary working conditions in firms of all types, including those linked to GVCs. But there is no evidence suggesting that international- ly-engaged firms perform systematically worse on this metric than do firms that serve the domestic market only. From a causal perspective, the culprit is more likely to be lax standards or lack of enforcement, rath- er than internationally linked status. Indeed, interna- tional linkages could conceivably prove an advantage, to the extent that lead firms have the ability to propa- ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF GVCS: WHAT DOES THE EVIDENCE SAY? The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 10 gate superior standards throughout their supply chains and take steps to monitor compliance (e.g., UNCTAD, 2012). International initiatives to improve such stan- dards, boost compliance capabilities, and monitor performance offer key steps in supporting better work- ing conditions in low- and middle-income countries around the world, including in Asia. Historically, low- and middle-income countries have generally sought to avoid linkages between trade and labour standards in forums, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), and this stance has caused friction with high-income countries. The development of private-sector stan- dards and the availability of financial and human resources to support compliance have improved pros- pects relative to the pre-GVC era and with arguably less risk of countries becoming locked out of interna- tional trade as a result of labour issues. Clearly, finance for firm upgrading in developing countries remains a key priority in this area. This analysis shows the importance of keeping coun- terfactuals in mind when assessing the development impacts of international engagement, including through GVCs: the appropriate yardstick is wheth- er a marginal decrease in international engagement or, equivalently, an increased focus on the domestic market would promote human development through higher wages or better working conditions. No empiri- cal evidence exists for such a link, with the policy liter- ature sometimes distracted by comparisons between desired working conditions and those observed, rather than those observed and those potentially observable with a change in the variable of interest. An additional set of considerations relates to the distributional impacts of trade opening. But these issues are again not specific to GVCs but, rather, a particular manifestation of standard trade economics. Trade economists have long accepted that a margin- al increase in openness benefits some people in the domestic economy but harms others, for instance through unemployment or lower incomes, based on the distribution of comparative advantage by sec- tor (e.g., Stolper and Samuelson, 1941).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "434bba5f-ec0c-48b8-adb3-86620cf18b05": {"__data__": {"id_": "434bba5f-ec0c-48b8-adb3-86620cf18b05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb7ef5b25faff9bf36e3d9b6409a9c6b62a133d9326d2d96fac3c11a73ae7539"}, "2": {"node_id": "13cfc2ff-6246-48c4-a998-2d7ea547d731", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "222bec3b53f46afc13a09f5a25124001c521a95ace0e756a0ab63feb9a2344df"}}, "hash": "7dbff6d64cb7948581e7aacaef9a8452d94ea3f987755bac56eacc9a08830d4c", "text": "However, the size of the gains from opening is large enough to fully compensate those who lose.

The answer, however, is not to restrict trade but instead to work on the institutional and political economy issues that have made it difficult to protect people properly from the negative conse- quences of either economic policy changes or, more broadly, the vicissitudes of life. As economies continue to become more reliant on trade linkages, including through GVCs, the point becomes increasingly salient and urgent (Hoekman and Shepherd, 2020). From a human development perspective, distributional issues play a key role, as they do from a political economy standpoint. But policymakers need to be careful to avoid kneejerk responses that do not pay sufficient attention to the underlying economic mechanisms. Fo- cusing on developing general redistribution policies as well as social safety nets is both more efficient and effective in the medium to long term in promoting hu- man development objectives than is restricting trade and investment flows. \u201cWhile intensities differ, GVCs have the scope to operate in most parts of the economy, in particular with the rise of digital technologies and more liberal policies that make services more tradable than in the past\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 11 Indeed, concerns over distribution have partly driven recent changes in trade policy in the United States, which has imposed duties unilaterally against China. A fair reading of the literature on the \u2018China shock,\u2019 namely the huge increase in imports from China in the 2000s, would be that adjustment costs proved higher than had generally been believed, and that unem- ployment of displaced workers has lasted longer than expected (Autor et al., 2016); but at the same time, increased demand for United States\u2019 exports, particu- larly in services, created more jobs than those lost in manufacturing (Feenstra and Sasahara, 2018). None- theless, a part of public opinion in the United States has focused on trade as the vector not only of man- ufacturing job losses, but also of rising inequality. All of this led to the imposition of unilateral tariffs against China under the Trump administration. The disconnect between expert analysis and a section of public opin- ion in the United States and other countries highlights the way in which international economic linkages in- tersect with broader geopolitical questions, which are outside the scope of this brief. An additional issue that has arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic relates to the fragility of GVCs themselves. Anecdotally, important goods underwent shortages in the early days of the pandemic, with standout examples in personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer (APIC, 2020). To some extent, re- strictive trade policies amplified the shock, as produc- ing countries restricted exports (Park, 2020). Given the above context, concerns over ensuring supply continu- ity of critical goods have transformed into a discussion about the merits of \u2018re-shoring,\u2019 or the shortening of GVCs to emphasize a greater amount of local content. These interlinked dynamics give rise to two important empirical questions, which, as yet, have no conclu- sive answers in the literature. First, how easily can the spread of GVCs be undone through the imposition of unilateral trade policies, such as tariffs? And second, how desirable is it\u2014from a supply-chain resilience point of view\u2014to use such measures to bring about a substantial re-shoring of some activities currently undertaken through GVCs? Shepherd (Forthcoming 2) uses a global trade model with GVCs to provide an answer to the first question. The unilateral tariffs, to which China responded in kind, are very high relative to baseline levels, up to 25 per- cent ad valorem in some cases. The trade policy shock is therefore very large. However, while there is some unravelling of GVC linkages, there is by no means a wholesale disintegration of the model, at least in terms of the proportion of gross exports accounted for by GVC trade. While GVC trade shrinks substantially in absolute terms, so, too, do other kinds of trade, so that the change in terms of proportions appears much smaller. Shepherd (Forthcoming 2) estimates that the tariff shock represents between three- and five-years\u2019 worth of undoing GVC growth at the previous trend rate in the affected countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5675842b-5e19-4dda-b184-e7889b686768": {"__data__": {"id_": "5675842b-5e19-4dda-b184-e7889b686768", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "940c72739eff7b21bf84128c4383696b83981ba20c45c581c8b0f67b76cda667"}, "2": {"node_id": "871a9e1d-c65e-4901-8f78-d0061ec92170", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab581720dbbcaa05ea37d344cc11ad7e3000a00ec854ebd15e2980edfa9394ba"}}, "hash": "9ab17d932983fc3668cebe9a05b376dc2ff43a47a38d6fd1a302a8c8d6199069", "text": "The effect is far from negligible, but, given the very large shock involved, the analysis shows that in the absence of policies de- signed specifically to disrupt production sharing\u2014for instance, by targeting foreign input use rather than trade in general \u2014 it is extremely costly to radically alter the prevalence of GVC trade.

They look at the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Part- nership (CPTPP), both of which involve a number of economies in Asia. They find that lowering trade barri- ers through these agreements has significant potential to boost GVC trade. For CPTPP countries, the agree- ment produces the equivalent of 12 years of additional GVC integration, based on the rate observed between 2000 and 2018. For RCEP, the figure is around five years. Importantly, GVC integration increases with countries outside the agreements as well. From this perspective, continued efforts to move forward on re- gional integration seem likely to support, rather than disrupt, existing GVC structures. From the perspective of re-shoring, OECD (2020) uses their own global trade model to look at the impacts of shifting to more domestically-focused supply chains. They find that, far from decreasing volatility, this, in fact, increases it. The result should not be surprising given that most economic shocks are not perfectly correlated across countries, so diversifying suppliers allows countries to effectively diversify risk. Having a TRADE POLICY, RESILIENCE, AND GVCS: HOW FRAGILE AND WHAT SOLUTIONS? The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 purely domestic supply chain means that, if a shock hits the local economy, it has no shock absorber, and this results in increased volatility. Despite these results, the issue of supply chain resil- ience remains an important one, in particular when GVCs produce public health or safety necessities. Indeed, there is evidence that the private sector has already taken steps to improve resilience in light of the vulnerabilities exposed by the COVID-19 pandem- ic. But these efforts focus on diversification, supplier redundancy, and technology, rather than large scale re-shoring (McKinsey Global Institute, 2020). While the issue may call for policy intervention at some point, the case for a broad-based policy response appears weak as long as the private sector has undertaken steps that may go at least some way towards reme- dying the problem. In time, there may be a case for greater regulation of some GVCs on the grounds of en- suring public health, but such needs will require case- by-case assessment rather than general approaches. In any case, any intervention will need to balance the efficiency advantages of GVC production against other social objectives. Experience with past shocks offers a useful guide to potential redesign of GVCs in the immediate future, without wholesale changes to the business model. The floods in Thailand in 2011 led to a global shortage of some electronics components, particularly hard drives. However, technological change combined with private-sector reassessment of risk has led to an effective diversification of suppliers, with countries specialized in alternative technologies, such as sol- id-state, drives effectively assuming part of the global market (Reuters, 2016). Despite the strategic impor- tance of the sector and the size of the shock, public policy changes in importing markets ultimately did not become necessary to deal with the aftermath of the 2011 floods. Hoekman and Shepherd (2020) argue that the world economy has seen a rise in the proportion of services as a component of overall economic activity, at the same time that services have, through technologi- cal and regulatory change, become more tradable. WTO law recognizes four modes of trading services: a lawyer in Buenos Aires can advise a client in Seoul by email; the client can travel from Seoul to Buenos Aires, then return home; the Argentinean law firm can estab- lish a subsidiary in the Republic of Korea and use it to sell services to the client; and, finally, the lawyer can travel temporarily from Buenos Aires to Seoul. These four modes of supply for internationally-traded ser- vices are difficult to measure, even 25 years after their inclusion in the WTO legal framework. They do not fit easily with standard approaches to tracking trade data. Statisticians at the WTO have developed an experi- mental dataset that uses advanced techniques and the available data to provide a first, approximate picture of trade in services by mode of supply. Figure 3 shows that services trade has grown steadily over recent years, with mode 3 (entry through a foreign subsidiary) the dominant one. Both points are important, the first because world trade growth overall has been relative- ly muted since 2009, the second because discussions on the tradability of services often ignore this mode of supply.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cad8de98-c580-4ca5-b488-e53b71b51ce5": {"__data__": {"id_": "cad8de98-c580-4ca5-b488-e53b71b51ce5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de1ad26ea2433c0807f9c977ba2df19f9b154ede140a47b7b257f77b3b60fc49"}, "2": {"node_id": "8aefd2f9-2c33-4481-9d16-3b8a1a768fc5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d98ef68f4ff4c8e658c3f6d373dacab8bf90c6a6973ebd8a124ffb82b1ad3595"}}, "hash": "bef036e14ed181f9a9ed1254aebd98a5dd293656749a4abb0ee5694c6b454954", "text": "Under the WTO\u2019s four modes of supply, there is no longer any such thing as a \u2018non-tradable\u2019 ser- vice; high costs or other impediments may make such trade rarer, but the structure in principle allows for the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3cae5ba-751a-44d8-bc12-edbf2eed55cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3cae5ba-751a-44d8-bc12-edbf2eed55cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a61edc1ddc80c4e193f091e12bef8045c33d95513003d8aab64232348d13bb4f"}, "3": {"node_id": "37c3ba0c-dd05-478d-b80e-778db4f22ea2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6af77f2fcef89d890d843755c4881dd2ebf69c3b6de9c3e69f3b89ffb58509d"}}, "hash": "62801b444721ddcb8ed2230b3228b756ea7a15146ab2d691a9c601d03b0fbec9", "text": "trading of all service activities. Figure 3 shows that this kind of trade is robust and quite comparable in im- portance to the global economy to total merchandise trade. Moreover, we showed above that a substan- tial proportion of this trade takes place through GVC structures, now an important fixture in many services sectors. The rise of the services economy has caused con- cern among some economists and policymakers, who emphasize the special role manufacturing has played in successful development stories (e.g., Rodrik, 2015). They argue that manufacturing has three character- istics that make it particularly desirable from a devel- opment point of view: it generates positive spillovers; FUTURE ISSUES: SERVICES, DIGITALIZATION, AND AUTOMATION The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 13 Source: WTO TISMOS database (2021) Figure 3: Total world exports of services by mode of supply, 2005-2017 (US$ billion) 16,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2017 Mode 1 Mode 2 Mode 3 Mode 4 it supports productivity growth through competitive pressures coming from world markets, since manufac- tured goods are easily tradable; and it creates large numbers of jobs for workers with limited education. Such an argument implicitly assumes that services do not possess these characteristics. But as Helble and Shepherd (2019) point out, services in fact constitute a very large economic aggregate with a huge amount of heterogeneity across subsec- tors. When examined in detail, the data do not always support the contention that manufacturing has the three characteristics listed above while commercial services do not. With increasing trade in services, as shown above, competitive pressures that can promote productivity upgrading have correspondingly intensi- fied. While measurement remains challenging, there is evidence that some services sectors have seen rapid rates of productivity growth, on par with some manu- facturing sectors, and, in particular, that the two sec- tors have closely linked productivity rates due to the increasingly strong input-output relationship between them (Hoekman and Shepherd, 2015). Indeed, Shep- herd (2019) shows that productivity growth in services served as an important, but under-recognized, aspect of the development of \u2018Factory Asia\u2019 in the 1990s and 2000s; revealed productivity growth rates in the rap- idly-industrializing Asian countries proved only slightly below those seen in their booming manufacturing sectors. In addition, Winkler (2019) shows that service firms can generate positive spillovers at the local level in much the same way as occurs in manufacturing, though firm characteristics appear as an important mediating factor. There are important points of similarity in the modern world economy between manufactured goods and commercial services. Where the distinction appears most problematic is in terms of the third point above, namely jobs. Anecdotally, jobs in high-productivity services sectors tend to require a relatively high level of education. The premature deindustrialization thesis The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 14 \u201cInternational initiatives to improve workplace safety, social protections and other standards, boost compliance capabilities, and monitor performance offer key steps in supporting better working conditions in low- and middle-income countries around the world\u201d therefore carries most weight regarding the large number of jobs needed in low- and middle-income countries \u2014 jobs that the service sector must create going forward. Many forces underpin this increased importance of services. One deals with preferences: as incomes rise, consumer spending tends to shift towards services. However, technological change is also an import- ant part of the equation. Recent decades have seen manufacturing firms using more and more services inputs, sourced both commercially in the market and internally through employment of service-performing workers. Surveys by Low and Pasadilla (2016) indicate that in the Asia-Pacific region, manufacturing firms could, on average, see around half of their total costs accounted for by services inputs. This proportion will likely increase given the trend towards more automa- tion in manufacturing, with its accompanying demand for engineers and technicians. The same holds true for digitalization, where one can understand the transfor- mation of physical goods into disembodied informa- tion as a shift from goods to services. While these kinds of technological changes have real potential to bring about changes in global trade, they have important implications from an empirical per- spective.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37c3ba0c-dd05-478d-b80e-778db4f22ea2": {"__data__": {"id_": "37c3ba0c-dd05-478d-b80e-778db4f22ea2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Post COVID-19 Future for Global Value Chains", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a61edc1ddc80c4e193f091e12bef8045c33d95513003d8aab64232348d13bb4f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3cae5ba-751a-44d8-bc12-edbf2eed55cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/post-covid-19-future-global-value-chains", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62801b444721ddcb8ed2230b3228b756ea7a15146ab2d691a9c601d03b0fbec9"}}, "hash": "b6af77f2fcef89d890d843755c4881dd2ebf69c3b6de9c3e69f3b89ffb58509d", "text": "On the one hand, there is evidence that auto- mation can pose genuine problems on the score of employment, although it may benefit some workers as well (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019).

Industrializing countries have tradition- ally used their low labor costs to compete effectively in world markets. The GVC model too depends to some extent on this initial entry point. But does that compara- tive advantage disappear with large-scale automation? Freund et al. (2019) examine whether or not this has happened with the rise of 3D printing in the market for hearing aids. While this development could have led to a re-shoring of production from Mexico and other countries, the data suggest that it has had less empirical importance in general; indeed, exports of physical hear- ing aids from other countries may even have increased. So, this one piece of evidence suggests that in some circumstances, technological change that appears to undercut a labour-cost advantage may not lead to de- creased trade and GVC integration. Shepherd (Forthcoming 3) offers another example that gives reason for scepticism. He examines the case of e-books: This technological change should have al- lowed countries to abandon trade in physical books in favor of trade in data files only. Again, the data do not support this contention. There is little evidence that in- creased uptake of e-books caused a decrease in trade in physical books. Of course, low- and middle-income countries will not automatically and necessarily benefit from these tech- nological changes. There is good reason for concern about exclusion and marginalization, but, for the mo- ment, the data do not suggest those effects are wide- spread. More broadly, these changes make clear that low- and middle-income countries need to continue investing in their own technological capacity, as well as in their human capital. Doing so will not only avoid potential dislocation should the analysis here prove unduly optimistic, but will also position them to move up into higher value-added activities within existing GVCs. Indeed, these priorities align with the need to create jobs in services sectors, which typically require higher levels of qualification, at least in comparable in- ternationally integrated sectors. Continued investment in both basic and further education will play a vital role in strong employment performance, which, in turn, helps reduce poverty. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 15 By 2021, GVCs have become a well-established fea- ture of the global economic landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic initially placed them under stress, but they have also provided part of the response, from produc- ing and distributing large quantities of personal pro- tective equipment, to developing and distributing vac- cines. There is thus no simple answer about the impact of the pandemic on GVCs, but it seems premature to diagnose a wholesale failure of the system, or to fore- cast a large-scale shift to other means of production. On the other hand, the pandemic has brought to the forefront a number of issues that have already been identified within the GVC model, from the need to engage a wide range of countries in promoting wide- spread development, to the importance of resilience to shocks. Technological change, such as the rise of the services economy with accompanying digitalization and automation, certainly poses challenges for low-in- come countries still in the early stages of industrializa- tion. They will need to adapt to these new realities, but the general model of joining GVCs, rather than devel- oping full domestic supply chains, still offers import- ant potential advantages. Critically, developing capac- ity to produce and use services and new technologies will shape the ability of firms to join and move up in GVCs. From a policy perspective, it will be import- ant to invest heavily in human capital development through education and training systems, as well as to ensure basic service provision, including internet con- nectivity. While low labor costs represent a source of comparative advantage, increasing incomes necessar- ily undermine it and make it all the more important to shift towards a skill-based labor market. In addition, ensuring openness to trade and invest- ment flows, along with developing social safety nets and redistribution mechanisms, will help align human development and economic objectives but will also ensure continued support for this development model in a political economy sense.

Of course, backsliding on these advances poses a real risk given the size of the economic shock associ- ated with the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is nothing to suggest that restricting movements of goods, ser- vices, and capital across borders will aid in recovery. Rather, it is likely that supporting an open, rules-based trading system remains a key economic policy objec- tive, particularly for smaller low-and middle-income countries, as it provides them with a source of external demand to aid in the recovery effort. Ensuring open- ness to services as well as goods has emerged as a policy priority for many of these countries, in particular those that suffer from geographical disadvantages, such as being landlocked. Borchert et al. (2017) show that policy barriers in \u2018connectivity services,\u2019 such as telecommunications and transport, serve to increase the isolation of geographically disadvantaged coun- tries from world markets. Accounting for trade in intermediates\u2014a key feature of the GVC model\u2014makes clear that the economic losses from protectionist trade policies are higher than previously thought (Ossa, 2015). Using trade policy to attempt to re-shore substantial portions of GVC activity would therefore involve major economic costs, in particular since the evidence suggests that pro- duction-sharing is relatively robust under trade policy changes, at least in proportional terms when it comes to tariffs. As such, while unilateral actions by large countries undoubtedly pose real challenges to the rules-based multilateral trading system, they do not appear to have fundamentally changed the ability of GVCs to operate as they have become accustomed to do in recent years. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 16 Similarly, it would not be appropriate to frame GVC-related policies too strongly in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic shock. The shock is an unusual one in that it brought strongly-correlated country-level shocks, at least in the early days of the pandemic. More commonly, country-level economic shocks are much less strong- ly correlated; in this case, the ability to diversify risk by relying on multiple suppliers in multiple countries becomes an advantage of the GVC system, not a negative feature. While the private sector continues to reassess its approach to resilience\u2014looking in particu- lar at building in redundancies that can better respond to major economic shocks\u2014the public sector does not yet have an obvious mandate to impose a particular vision of risk management from the outside. Of course, a much stronger case exists for using public-sector resources to maintain inventories of critical equipment in circumstances where the private sector cannot do so optimally. But that would involve forward-looking purchase arrangements between governments and GVCs, not policy involvement in the planning decisions of GVCs as such. While the pandemic has posed real challenges to economies in all regions and at all development levels, the widespread availability of safe and effective vac- cines should support a return to more favorable condi- tions. Against that background, there is every reason to expect that GVCs will continue to play an important role in global trade, and that developing countries will continue to successfully adopt outward-oriented growth strategies. \u201cEconomic, social and trade policies need to respond to technological change, invest in human capital, ensure trade and investment flows, develop social safety nets, and make GVCs resilient to future shocks\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 17 Figure 1: GVC trade by exporting region, percent of gross exports, 2000 (a) and 2015 (b) Figure 2: GVC trade by sector, percent of gross exports, 2015 Figure 3: Total world exports of services by mode of supply, 2005-2017 (US$ billion) Acemoglu, D. and Restrepo, P. 2019. \u201cAutomation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor.\u201d Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 33, No. 2, pp. 3-30.

PANDAY MELTING GLACIERS, THREATENED LIVELIHOODS: CONFRONTING CLIMATE CHANGE TO SAVE THE THIRD POLE The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 3 The region of Asia containing contiguous ranges of high glaciated mountains is often referred to as the Third Pole. According to The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment (Wester et al., 2019)1, even with the increase in global average temperature capped at 1.5\u02daC above pre-industrial levels, glaciers in the region will lose one third of their ice volume by the year 2100. If current emission trends were to continue, the mountains would lose two thirds of their ice vol- ume by 2100. The region contains the world\u2019s third largest storage of frozen water. Glaciers here provide a key source of dry-season water in the ten major river systems; loss of this water source af- fects agriculture, drinking water, and hydroelectricity production. Over 240 million people live in the Himalaya and nearby moun- tains; 1.7 billion live in the river basins downstream, while food grown in these river basins reaches 3 billion. Major efforts will be needed to adapt to the coming changes. The melting of the Third Pole does not take place in isolation. It is closely connected to the same human activities and drivers that are also polluting the region\u2019s air, driving global climate change and raising sea levels. The countries surrounding High Mountain Asia have some of the worst air pollution in the world, and are very sensitive to changes in monsoon precipitation. Addressing all of these issues together requires ambitious and coordinated mitigation actions. The world\u2019s economy has no choice but an ur- gent move to net zero emissions of greenhouse gases; it must shift away from fossil fuel use in energy, transport, and other sectors, while changing diets and agricultural practices. The countries of the region also need to reduce emissions of black carbon and oth- er short-lived air pollutants that have a climate impact and are con- tributing to melting the Third Pole. Luckily, addressing many of the same combustion sources provides climate, air quality and health co-benefits. Everyone has a role to play in the major changes needed in the coming decade, from individuals to governments to UNDP. This brief distils the latest science on an ominous possible future and suggests urgent responses. ABSTRACT 1 Arnico Panday was a coordinating lead author of this assessment.

In 2015, glaciers covered almost 100,000 square kilometres (km)5 of High Mountain Asia, con- taining 3,000-4,700 cubic km of ice (Bolch et al., 2019), with just under half in the Himalaya and Karakoram (Nie et al., 2021). During winters, large parts of High Mountain Asia experience snowfall, while many lakes and high altitude stretches of rivers freeze. When gla- ciers retreat, vacated depressions often fill with water, forming glacial lakes. The exact number of glacial lakes is not firmly established, and varies in time; esti- mates range from 4,260 to 8,200 for the HKH region, including 1,466 to 2,323 lakes in Nepal alone (Bolch et al., 2019). Sometimes called the Water Tower of Asia (Immer- zeel et al., 2010), or of the World (Xu et al., 2008), the Third Pole cryosphere plays a critical role in regu- lating the water supply over a large region. Glaciers and snowmelt supply key sources of dry-season water in the ten major river systems that originate in the HKH (Scott et al., 2019): the Amu Darya, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, Irrawaddy, Mekong, Salween, Tarim, Yangtse and Yellow (Sharma et al., 2019). Cryospheric storage and dry-season release of water provide vital support for agriculture, hydroelectricity and drinking water (Nie et al., 2021). Over 240 million people live in the region\u2019s mountains; 1.7 billion live in the river basins downstream, while food grown in these river basins reaches 3 billion people (Sharma et al., 2019). Anthropogenic climate change has caused much of the Third Pole cryosphere to melt rapidly, with poten- tially far-reaching consequences. With a few excep- tions, the area and the volume of glaciers has steadily decreased throughout the region. While the melting cryosphere of High Mountain Asia has far-reaching downstream impacts, this takes place in the context of larger changes. The melting is driven by broader anthropogenic modifications of the atmosphere, and accompanied by broader impacts of these modifica- tions. The Third Pole lies downwind from some of the most heavily polluted places on Earth. Air pollutants INTRODUCTION Including Greenland. While the origin of the term Third Pole is unclear, it obviously relates to the vast snow and ice that characterize the other two polar regions. The author himself does not like the term Third Pole, because a pole is the point of intersection between a planet and its rotational axis, which only exists at the North Pole and the South Pole, whereas this region spans across several thousand kilometers and does not sit anywhere near the axis of rotation. The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate uses the term High Mountain Asia for the same region. This policy brief will use the terms Third Pole and High Mountain Asia interchangeably. Incidentally, these same mountains also appear in the cryosphere chapter of The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment by Bolch et al. (2019), itself based on the classification in the Randolph Glacier Inventory (see https://www.glims.org/RGI/index.html) and consistent with the region considered by the Third Pole Environment program based in Beijing (see http://www.tpe.ac.cn/webindex/). 2 3 \u201cWhile the melting Third Pole is very visible, with large downstream consequences, the impacts of other anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere might arguably lead to even more widespread human suffering\" The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 Wester et al.

Protecting the cryosphere of High Mountain Asia, and addressing interrelated is- sues needs a broadening of attention beyond climate adaptation to ambitious mitigation. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 Atmospheric temperatures around the globe have increased rapidly in recent decades and are projected to continue rising. A 140-year-old ice core record from a central Tibetan glacier shows several colder and warmer periods, with the strongest warming starting in the 1990s (Yang et al., 2008). Air temperature records from the Tibetan Plateau show significant warming beginning already in the 1950s (Liu and Chen, 2000), when global average temperatures remained relatively flat due to atmospheric dimming by heavy pollution in industrialized nations (Wild et al., 2007). Over the past two decades, temperature increases in High Moun- tain Asia have become more pronounced: Across the region, average temperatures increased by around 0.104\u00b0C per decade between 2001 and 2014 (Krishnan et al., 2019). By current projections, temperatures will continue to increase till mid-century, regardless of the climate scenario (Hock et al., 2019). Model simulations predict that even if global average temperatures stabilize at 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, at least 1.8\u00b0C of warming in the Himalaya and 2.2\u00b0C in the Karakoram will still occur (Krishnan et al., 2019). Temperatures in High Mountain Asia are rising faster than almost anywhere else on the globe ex- cept in the Arctic and Antarctic. Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) has been observed across the Tibetan Plateau and the HKH, whereby the higher you go, the more rapid the increase in temperature.6 Theory says that rising temperatures affect the cryosphere in several ways. First, a larger fraction of precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, at a higher This section summarizes current scientific knowledge on past, present and fu- ture changes in the Third Pole\u2019s cryosphere, and on the downstream impacts of these changes. altitude. Rain falling onto snow or ice surfaces causes rapid melting. With increasing average temperatures, the snow line7 moves up, leaving progressively smaller snow \u2018islands\u2019 around the peaks. Finally, snowmelt al- ready occurs earlier in the spring (Barnett et al., 2005). The region\u2019s extreme geographic diversity means that cryosphere impacts vary significantly, with some places becoming more vulnerable than others. While the Himalaya receive four fifths of their snowfall during the summer monsoon, the Karakoram receive two thirds of their snowfall in winter as a result of westerly cyclones. The upper Indus Basin generally has more snow at lower elevations than the Himalaya (Bolch et al., 2019) and the glaciers in the Karakoram stretch down to lower elevations than in the Himalaya (Nie et al., 2021). Himalayan glaciers appear more sensitive to temperature increases because summer snowfall is more likely to turn into rain than winter snowfall (Bolch et al., 2012). With the exception of parts of the Karakoram, eastern Pamir and western Kunlun, High Mountain Asia has experienced widespread decreases in both the area and volume of glaciers in the past three decades (Bolch et al., 2012; Nie et al., 2021). Glaciers in the Himalaya have been retreating since the mid-19th Century, although from the 1920s to the 1940s many remained stable. Glacial retreat accelerated in the 1990s (Bolch et al., 2012). Figure 2 represents the observed chang- es in glacier mass in different sub-regions pre- and post-2000, illustrating both the results and the limited availability of data. THE NARROW STORY: A MELTING THIRD POLE AND ITS IMPACTS OBSERVATIONS AND FORECASTS OF THE THIRD POLE CRYOSPHERE While data collection at high altitudes is sparse, it has firmly established EDW in the region. A variety of researchers have hypothesized mecha- nisms to explain EDW (Krishnan et al., 2019; Pepin et al., 2015). These mechanisms include: (1) The albedo effect, whereby a rising snow line and tree line decrease the surface reflectivity (compared to snow covered and bare surfaces), leading to absorption of more sunlight, greater heating of the surface and warming of the air.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b2a082d-f65a-4894-9786-c4f891b04ab0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b2a082d-f65a-4894-9786-c4f891b04ab0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Confronting Climate Change to Save the Third Pole", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e715d5688eae4292e45ed422496247566fcccd18f8f524b62a5dcd2229489c5e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6efa54bd-34e4-423a-a94e-0ea8d14b7e00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ff8ff5a278dbd7e5d0b97eb42ab214350e4a107b768705a0381e9175ebdc4a5"}}, "hash": "daf25798cc943d4e82cae166e022ea40acdc855a1ee6d43c3ef2822476790f62", "text": "(2) An increase in elevation of the cloud condensation level (and thus an increase in the temperature at which cloud formation releases heat).

Individual glaciers in the Karakoram sometimes rapidly surge forward and retreat again (Bolch et al., 2019). The Karakoram region has experienced an increase in precipitation and a small decrease in summer tempera- tures (Hewitt, 2005), which may explain the surge in glaciers. However, the western disturbances that bring snowfall to the Karakoram have shown increasing vari- ability (Krishnan et al., 2019). Other mountain ranges in High Mountain Asia, including the Hengduan, the Qil- ian, the Tien Shan, as well as the rest of the Pamir and Kunlun, have all seen reductions in both glacier mass and glacier area since around 1970 (Bolch et al., 2019). Models forecast a loss of two-thirds of the HKH\u2019s gla- cial mass if current anthropogenic emissions trends continue (Bolch et al., 2019).8 This model scenario (IPCC RCP8.5) assumes that economies will keep growing without significant greening. All modelled scenarios, regardless of emission assumptions, project continued loss of glacier mass in the near-term. All also project accelerated deglaciation in the Karakoram (Bolch et al., 2019). By mid-century, model results diverge on the rate of melting, depending on which IPCC emissions scenario for greenhouse gases they assume. In the IPCC RCP8.5 scenario, the extended region will lose two thirds of its glacial mass, with the eastern Himalaya seeing a near total loss of its glaciers (Bolch et al., 2019). While a small hope exists that mit- igation can achieve the Paris Agreement target of not exceeding a temperature increase of 2\u00b0C, the IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C makes clear the enormous difference in impacts between global temperatures stabilized at 1.5\u00b0C versus 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC, 2018). This has inspired climate activists around the world to aspire for a 1.5\u00b0C world. But this may not suffice for High Moun- tain Asia; The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment points out that even if global average temperatures stabilize at 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, High Mountain Asia would still likely lose one third of its glacier mass by the end of the century, with the Himalaya losing half of its glacier mass (Bolch et al., 2019; Wester et al., 2019).9 Note: The circle size represents the glaciated area; the colour denotes the rate of change in meter water equivalent (MWE) per year pre-2000 and post-2000. Numbers inside the circles denote the number of studies available pre- and post-2000 for that region. Source: Wester et al. (2019) Figure 2: Changes in glacier mass in different subregions This assumes IPCC scenario RCP8.5. There is some uncertainty in these projections: IPCC attaches medium confidence to the prediction of magnitude and timing of glacier losses in future climate scenarios, but, as pointed out earlier, a 1.5\u00b0C increase in global average temperature would result in higher temperatures in High Mountain Asia (Hock et al., 2019). 8 9 The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 9 Glaciers are not the only shrinking part of the cryo- sphere. Seasonal snow cover has also decreased. While snow cover has strong interannual variability, it has clearly decreased at lower elevations, where precipitation has switched from snow to rain (Hock et al., 2019). The snow line \u2013 the altitude above which snow persists year-round \u2013 has gradually shifted to higher altitudes, leaving smaller areas snow-covered. Shrinkage of snow-covered areas and snow volume will likely continue in the coming decades in response to warming, with the snow line continuing to climb to higher elevations (Bolch et al., 2019). Figure 3 shows the loss of both glacier and snow cover on a prominent Himalayan peak. A decrease in snow cover causes further climate impacts. The amount of snow on the Tibetan Plateau affects the plateau\u2019s reflectivity, and thus its surface heating and the strength of the low pressure that forms over the plateau.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f3228f6-94ba-483a-8f2a-7a191ec98a75": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f3228f6-94ba-483a-8f2a-7a191ec98a75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Confronting Climate Change to Save the Third Pole", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e60a34080917f2e98875fb3dc716d042c46a82275931bbd2b480bfb9911758d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "04b746a6-1638-4561-a425-5581327c22f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a502250d278be76c6978aa9125071027dd7fbcc8bba37a085a76512601d6023e"}}, "hash": "196b7de0681a49cb60c11119fbe93c0cadffb5aa8912c013c03f899f14026ca3", "text": "This has a strong impact on atmospheric circulation and on the Asian monsoon (Bolch et al., 2019).10 Reduction in snow cover also cre- ates a local feedback: When snow disappears from a small patch to reveal darker rock underneath, the sur- face albedo (reflectivity) decreases and the dark rock absorbs more sunlight.

Melting permafrost on steep slopes can trigger landslides and rockfalls (Hock et al., 2019); if these fall onto glacial lakes they can create waves that breach the moraines holding back the lakes (Bolch et al., 2019). Teleconnections like this are common: The 2010 floods in Pakistan were connected to a heatwave in Russia, while the monsoon is also con- nected to Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (Lau and Kim, 2012; Wang et al., 2009). Mountain permafrost contains less soil carbon than Arctic permafrost, so its melting might have less feedback on climate than the melting of the Arctic Tundra, which would release large amounts of methane into the atmosphere (Hock et al., 2019). 10 11 Note: In (c) massive high altitude forest fires obscured the views of the peak on 31 December 2020, while (d) shows the peak the next morning on 1 January 2021.

Glacial lakes can grow rapidly, often held back by unstable moraine dams. When a moraine dam fails, a catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) drains the entire lake down the valley. 65 GLOFs have been recorded in the Himalaya since 1930 (Nie et al., 2021). GLOFs have destroyed roads, trails, houses, fields, hydropower plants and lives, as happened during the Dig Tsho GLOF in Nepal in 1985 (Hock et al., 2019).12 Some glacial lakes in the region have grown rapidly, causing alarm (Fujita et al., 2009). While no consensus has yet arisen about whether data show an increasing occurrence of GLOF events in recent decades, there is consensus that the growth in number and size of glacial lakes increases the risks for the future (Nie et al., 2021). 21 dangerous lakes have been identified in Nepal and 52 in India (Bolch et al., 2019). Emergency action averted a po- tential GLOF from Tso Rolpa Lake in Nepal in 2000, by constructing a siphon and an open channel that allowed a reduction in the lake\u2019s water level (Pokharel, n.d.). The Third Pole is not unique. In mountainous regions around the world, the cryosphere is melting. Observa- tions confirm alarming and ongoing decreases in the cryosphere from the Antarctic through the Andes, the Caucasus, the East African Highlands, the European Alps, New Zealand Alps, the Rockies, and Scandina- vian and north Asian mountains (Hock et al., 2019). The melting rates in High Mountain Asia are higher than the global average, but not overwhelmingly so. The differ- ence from other mountainous regions is that the Third Pole contains a larger volume of frozen water, and the changes here affect a far larger number of people. Note that the Kedarnath disaster in India that killed several thousand in 2013 resulted from a landslide damming a stream, creating a lake that then burst out, and not from a GLOF as occasionally reported (Shrestha et al., 2015); see https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/what-re- ally-happened-in-uttarakhand-41550. 12 A warming Third Pole, with a retreating cryosphere, affects water availability in the rivers downstream.

This fraction shrinks as one travels down the length of a river and more rain-fed tributaries join it (Bolch et al., 2012). The dependence on the cryo- sphere varies among river basins; for example, while only 9 percent of the water reaching the delta of the Ganges originates in glaciers and snow, the Indus river flows through a much more arid region, collecting far fewer rainfed tributaries: 78 percent of the water at the mouth of the Indus originates in the cryosphere, including 46 percent from snow and 32 percent from glaciers (Immerzeel et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2019). In fact, the Indus Basin is the second most wa- ter-stressed basin in the world (Shrestha et al., 2015). Climate changes and retreating glaciers affect water availability in several ways. As a glacier recedes and thus reduces its store of frozen water, it sends more water into the river downstream earlier in the spring. However, as the glacier shrinks further, there comes a point when that process slows down and less water becomes available (Hock et al., 2019). While glacial water has already declined in some areas in the world with small cryospheres, the contribution of the Hima- layan cryosphere to rivers will likely peak in the 2040s (Hock et al., 2019).

In contrast, warmer winter temperatures and less snow in the Karakoram will have a bigger impact on the Indus River\u2019s peak flow in the spring (Bolch et al., 2012). As the amount of water storage in the cryosphere shrinks, however, river basins become more dependent upon highly variable monsoon rainfall (Nie et al., 2021). The changing water availability due to a shrinking cryosphere has wide-ranging impacts on economies and livelihoods. In the Himalaya, decreasing water availability in the dry spring months will increasing- ly affect hydropower production during what has already become the most challenging season (Scott et al., 2019). In fact, across the region, 15 percent to 40 percent of hydropower production depends on glacial meltwater during the dry season (Nie et al., 2021). While few studies have examined the economic impacts of this dependence in High Mountain Asia, a study in Peru found losses of US$ 5 million per year from the reduction of water to the operator of the Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato hydropower plant, resulting in a loss of $20 million per year for the broader economy (Hock et al., 2019). In addition to changing water availability, glacier retreat and moraine erosion change the silt load in rivers, potentially filling reservoirs faster (Hock et al., 2019). Changing water availability in rivers due to a shrink- ing cryosphere affects agriculture in certain regions. Scientists have projected reduced productivity in irri- gated agriculture in the Indus basin, as well as in some other high mountain areas (Hock et al., 2019). Parts of northern Pakistan and Ladakh have irrigation systems that depend solely on glaciers and snowmelt (Scott et al., 2019). For high mountain pastures and farms, less winter snow cover means less soil moisture (Hock et al., 2019). Rainfed terraced farms on hill slopes are less affected by changes in the cryosphere, but fields in the valley bottoms might see impacts if their irrigation de- pends on large snow-fed rivers. In India and Pakistan, more than 100 million farmers depend upon on irriga- tion water coming directly from the Indus and Ganges Rivers rather than from their tributaries (Hock et al., 2019).13 In many places, glacial meltwater provides critical protection during droughts, when other water sources fail; this has proven particularly important in the Indus and Tarim Basins (Nie et al., 2021).

Tourism will also see impacts, not just in the closure of the small number of ski resorts in the region (in Kashmir, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan), but also because many other tourism products in the region, including trekking, depend on selling vistas of snow-covered mountains, such as those in Figure 3. While no evidence has appeared of increased fre- quency of GLOF occurrences in recent years, rapidly retreating glaciers will allow the growth of many new potentially dangerous glacial lakes in the coming decades, including lakes that do not yet exist (Hock et al., 2019). With the building of more dams, diversions, hydropower plants, bridges, roads and valley-bottom settlements, the likelihood increases of a GLOF caus- ing costly damage and high casualties. Note that many residents in the Ganges Basin depend on pumping ground water, with an estimated 20 million pumps (Scott et al., 2019). 13 \u201cThe melting of the Third Pole is closely connected to the same human activities and drivers that are also polluting the region's air, driving global climate change and raising sea levels\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 Current global emission trends are disastrous for High Mountain Asia, and would result in a loss of two-thirds of all glacier mass by the end of the century, accompa- nied by a range of other interconnected problems. The Paris Agreement\u2019s target of stabilizing global average temperatures at less than 2\u00b0C above pre-in- dustrial is insufficient to protect the snow and ice of High Mountain Asia. In fact, even stabilizing the global average temperature at 1.5\u00b0C will be too warm, as that will still cause a warming of 1.8 to 2.2\u00b0C in High Moun- tain Asia, resulting in a loss of a third of the region\u2019s glacier mass by the end of the century. Investment in adaptation to the changing water availability due to Third Pole melting, and to broader impacts of climate change, will do much to protect the most vulnerable people and nations, but adaptation alone is insufficient. The melting of glaciers and snowfield of High Moun- tain Asia is driven by the global increase in green- house gases as well as by black carbon and other pol- lutants of regional origin. The same phenomena also drive the region\u2019s air pollution problem and changes in the monsoon. The shrinking of the glaciers and its impacts are not an isolated disaster, but a symptom and a symbol of a broader problem with how humans treat the atmosphere. To save High Mountain Asia\u2019s glaciers, clean up the region\u2019s air, protect the monsoon system, and address climate change on a global level, the world\u2019s economy urgently needs to draw down greenhouse gases. It needs to stop using fossil fuels and also reduce emis- sions of black carbon and other short-lived air pollut- ants. This calls for shifting billions of people to clean cooking and heating, bringing about major changes in agricultural practices and diets, and massively reducing open fires. It also requires a rethinking of urban spaces and promoting sustainable walkable cities.

People in High Mountain Asia have responded to increasing water stresses in several ways. Some have switched to crops that need less water; some have adopted new irrigation technologies \u2013 for example, an engineer in Ladakh invented \u201cice stupas\u201d to store water in frozen artificial glaciers (Hock et al., 2019). Farmers will need support to design and invest in locally-appropriate water storage solutions, or to shift to agricultural practices that consume less water. Hydropower producers will need to adapt. A shrinking cryosphere will affect the availability of water in rivers, in some cases shifting and increasing early spring run-off, and in other cases reducing dry-season water availability. The amount of silt in the rivers will also change. While existing hydropower plants may have fewer available solutions and more difficulty recoup- ing investments, designs of new hydropower plants and grids will need to take into account the changing climate and water availability. Infrastructure design will need to accommodate larger floods. Designs of hydropower projects, roads and bridges will also need to take into account the existence of current or potential future glacial lakes upstream, and the potential size of a GLOF. Even on slopes and valleys not at risk for GLOFs, more ex- treme rainfall will require larger storm drains and more attention to slope stability. All of this calls for surveys, calculations and additional engineering capacity these. While in some cases, siphoning off glacial lakes can mitigate the risk of GLOFs, it will not be possible to avoid disasters altogether. Disasters caused directly by cryospheric change will comprise a small fraction of the disasters occurring in the region, but all need better preparedness. High Mountain Asia faces disasters of many kinds, from low-frequency earthquakes to high-frequency land- slides, floods and coastal storms (Vaidya et al., 2019). Most floods occur during the monsoon season and have no direct connection to the cryosphere. While dozens of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods have been re- corded, some with heavy losses of lives and infrastruc- ture, their overall impacts amount to a small fraction of those created annually through monsoon-induced floods and landslides (Bolch et al., 2019; Vaidya et al., 2019). Cryosphere-induced disasters need the same sort of preparation as others: early warning systems, infrastructure designed to withstand low-probabili- ty-high-loss events, emergency services trained and on stand-by, as well as institutional mechanisms in place to support victims in rebuilding their lives. The latter has special importance in mountain areas, which have a higher incidence of poverty than the plains (Wester et al., 2019). In many places, vulnerability to other impacts of climate change (precipitation, tem- perature and their impacts on livelihoods) will exceed those triggered by cryospheric changes. One key priority is the protection of the most vul- nerable. Climate change exposure is one of several vulnerabilities in the mountains; adaptive capacity de- pends on many non-climatic factors, including poverty, but also policies, institutions and processes (Gioli et al., 2019). Societies and individuals in the mountains have considerable practice in adapting to variability, and farmers appear to have already begun changing their practices. However, concern remains that they will have limited ability to tackle the newly-emerging \u2018surprise\u2019 challenges of accelerating climate change (Mishra et al., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba235823-35e2-4026-8c90-f0a6c469c6eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba235823-35e2-4026-8c90-f0a6c469c6eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Confronting Climate Change to Save the Third Pole", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5dbed04c2977853ba42537f439781e37c8c8bf117a6aeef45cd64ce7f3920b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c6da250-4efe-4b77-ab3a-157b0b2dbebd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/confronting-climate-change-save-third-pole", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8058a7c45a92a08358bee531532b9f0ddb1ee034a3e0dcc19ff27708f4d9d3e3"}}, "hash": "8d57943c348d83bf282aa6c8eadb9319d3476cae7a8eb8306e2658ee751075f6", "text": "Improving adaptation requires data and information, capacity-building and early warning systems, as well as better designed infrastructure.

These structures ur- gently need creation, alongside increased investment and cross-border collaborations on data collection and monitoring (Nie et al., 2021). The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 14 The global increase in both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants drives the melting of the cryosphere. Globally, the biggest driver of warming is carbon dioxide (CO2). Since the mid- 1800s, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by al- most 50 percent due to two human activities: the burn- ing of fossil fuels, which transfers to the atmosphere carbon that was stored underground for millions of years; and large-scale deforestation, which transfers to the atmosphere carbon that was stored in the bio- sphere (Hawken, 2017). With an atmospheric lifetime of 100+ years, CO2 is well-mixed16 around the globe. Its impacts thus do not depend on its source or source region and will also persist even after emissions re- duction. Along with other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, sulphur hexafluoride and various hydrofluorocarbons [HFCs]), CO2 warms the atmo- sphere by absorbing outgoing infrared radiation, and radiating some of that back to the surface.17 Globally, the second biggest contributor to warming is black carbon (BC), which is emitted into the atmo- sphere during incomplete combustion in the form of fine charred particles (Bond et al., 2013). BC warms the atmosphere by absorbing incoming sunlight. When present in elevated atmospheric layers, it warms them, reducing the sunlight reaching the land surface (Ra- In this section, we examine the main drivers of the melting Third Pole and their broader impacts, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants, due to human activities. manathan and Carmichael, 2008; Tripathi et al., 2007). This can cause local dimming of up to 10 to 20 Watts per square meter (Streets et al., 2006; UNEP/WMO, 2011). BC has an atmospheric lifetime of days to weeks; much of it thus remains concentrated in a handful of heavily polluted regions. High Mountain Asia is near three of the world\u2019s five regions with the heaviest BC loads: East Asia, South Asia (particularly the Indo-Gan- getic Plains) and Southeast Asia (Gertler et al., 2016). Along with the greenhouse gases methane, ozone, and HFCs, BC is classified as a short-lived-climate pollutant (SLCP). Because of SLPCs\u2019 short atmospher- ic lifetimes, their mitigation yields rapid climate results, while also giving other co-benefits (UNEP, 2011). In fact, mitigating SLCPs globally will provide a one-time reduction in warming of up to 0.5\u00b0C (IPCC, 2018; Shin- dell et al., 2017). Along with wind-blown dust, BC also helps melt the cryosphere in a second way: when BC deposits onto white snow or ice surfaces,18 it darkens those surfaces, increasing the absorption of sunlight and accelerating melting (Gertler et al., 2016; Yasunari et al., 2010).19 Although less dark than black carbon, desert dust can play a similar role. Snow darkening by wind-blown dust particles from the Thar Desert has been observed high in the Himalaya (Gautam et al., 2009; Saikawa et al., THE BROADER STORY WITH THE SAME DRIVERS: AIR POLLUTION, MONSOON CHANGE AND THE GLOBAL CLIMATE THE DRIVERS OF ATMOSPHERIC CHANGE: GREENHOUSE GASES AND SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS When a gas is \u2018well-mixed\u2019 its concentration varies very little over long distances.

Figure 5 shows a satellite image of a typical winter day, with the ground of the IGP barely visible through the haze. The atmosphere above the IGP has warmed at a rate of 0.25\u02daC per decade, while the surface has dimmed and cooled (UNEP, 2019).

Episodic cross-Himalayan pollution can be transported through the major south-north valleys and by being lifted and advected over the Himalaya.

Pollutants from the IGP reach the Tibetan Plateau along several pathways. They can cross through deep valleys such as the Arun and the Kali Gandaki or at high altitude during favourable weather conditions (Brun et al., 2011; Dhungel et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2019; L\u00fcthi et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2011).

Among these cities, a dozen exceeds WHO stan- dards for annual average concentrations more than tenfold, including New Delhi (Figure 8a) (Saikawa et al., 2019). These levels have immense health impacts in cities, especially for the most exposed populations, such as street vendors, traffic police, and others who spend considerable time on the street (Gurung and Bell, 2012; Shakya et al., 2017). In fact, the highest av- erage levels of PM2.5 exposure in the Asia-Pacific are in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan (UNEP, 2019). Poor air quality is not limited to large cities. Observa- tions in rural Uttar Pradesh, Chitwan and Lumbini have found pollution levels comparable to those in very polluted cities, indicating that hundreds of millions of people on the IGP face exposure to very unhealthy air (Praveen et al., 2012; Mehra et al., 2018; Rupakheti et al., 2018; Rupakheti et al., 2016; Wan et al., 2017). During the dry season, emissions from millions of local pollution sources across the IGP merge into a thick haze layer that can last for months and extend up into the mountains (Figure 5 and Figure 8b and c). This has consequences for local climate and visibility (Dey and Girolamo, 2010; Gautam et al., 2010; Di Girolamo et al., 2004; Praveen et al., 2012; Saikawa et al., 2019). The reduced sunlight and poor air quality have also led to significant impacts on agricultural productivity (Auff- hammer et al., 2006; UNEP, 2019).

Indoor combustion of solid fuels is also a very large source of outdoor pollution. 1.9 billion peo- ple in Asia and the Pacific use solid fuels for cooking and heating (UNEP/WMO, 2011). Figure 9 shows the death rate due to air pollution in countries of Asia-Pa- cific.

Global climate change is also likely significantly alter- ing monsoon precipitation, causing large shifts in the timing and location of rainfall, causing major impacts on agriculture (Krishnan et al., 2019). The impacts of global CO2 emissions thus have acutely felt effects in this region. Nepal, for example, expects to see fewer rainy days, but more days with extreme precipitation in the future (MoFE, 2019). Changing monsoon patterns mean that agriculture and drinking water supply in some places will suffer as a result of water shortag- es, while other places will suffer from too much water bringing floods and landslides. Just four large flood events in rivers downstream between 2000 and 2013 together killed more than 10,000 people and displaced 50 million (Prabhakar et al., 2018). While precipitation forecasts are more uncertain than temperature fore- casts, total summer precipitation will likely increase in the Ganges, upper Salween and upper Mekong Basins, but not in the Indus and Brahmaputra Basins; total winter precipitation on the other hand, will likely increase in the upper Salween and upper Mekong Ba- sins (Shrestha et al., 2015). The regional climate is changing in other ways too. During the past two decades, the IGP have seen an in- crease in persistent winter fog events tied to increased air pollution and changing agricultural practices (Saikawa et al., 2019; Syed et al., 2012). Stretching over hundreds of kilometres and lasting for weeks, these fog events affect the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people, with a particularly large impact on the lives and livelihoods of the poorest as well as on air, rail and road transport (Ganguly et al., 2006; Gautam et al., 2007; Saikawa et al., 2019; Syed et al., 2012; UNEP, 2019). Recent projections expect increasingly severe summer heat waves in the IGP, again with impacts on the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of people (Krishnan et al., 2019; Prabhakar et al., 2018). By providing a larger number of surfaces onto which water drop- lets condense, pollution initially spreads the available water in a cloud among a larger number of smaller droplets too small to rain out, thereby delaying rainfall. However, as the cloud collects more water and the larger number of droplets grows big enough to rain out, the delayed rainfall will become much heavier (Rosenfeld et al., 2008). And they take place at scales ranging from individual cloud drop- lets to entire mountain ranges. 20 21 \u201cHigh Mountain Asia has some of the worst air pollution in the world, and is very sensitive to changes in precipitation.

The same set of human activities, causing emissions of specific gases and particulates drive both the melting of the Third Pole and these other changes. The inter- connected problems and solutions call for coordinated policies, incentives, and actions for effective mitigation (UNEP, 2019). The Third Pole\u2019s loss of snow and ice is not just a symptom of larger problems, but can also serve as a unifying symbol to address them.

The special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C by the IPCC (2018), however, emphasizes the huge difference in climate impacts between a world with temperature stabilized at 1.5 versus 2.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This has driven the global discourse towards stabilizing the climate at 1.5\u00b0C by achieving net zero CO2 emissions in the coming decades. This would entail investment in a wide variety of solutions, some currently cost-effective, some less, in sectors ranging from buildings and cities, to energy, food, land use, materials, and transport (Hawken, 2017). One important priority is ending fossil fuel subsidies; according to an International Monetary Fund esti- mate, in 2015 the fossil fuel industry received $5.3 trillion in direct and indirect subsidies, equivalent to 6.5 percent of global GDP (Hawken, 2017). The protection of the snowfields and glaciers of High Mountain Asia, along with the region\u2019s air quality and monsoon system, requires concerted global action well beyond the Paris Agreement in order to stabilize Earth\u2019s climate at a lower tem- perature. This requires going far beyond gradually phasing out CO2 emissions, and making a concert- ed effort to reach a peak as soon as possible and then draw down22 atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Since impacts of CO2 emissions do not depend on the source, and emissions take place across many different sources and sectors, one should start with feasible sources that provide the biggest potential Figure 7 illustrated the inter-connections between processes that change the Third Pole cryosphere and processes that drive air pollution and monsoon chang- es. The individual problems cannot be addressed in isolation; they all require changes in the drivers on the left side of the figure. for quick and easy reductions. Project Drawdown, a California-based organization, has worked with hundreds of experts to quantify the impacts and costs of the most promising such solutions (Hawken, 2017). The top ten include removing HFCs from refrigeration, investing in wind and solar power, reducing food waste and switching away from meat, letting trees grow on pastures, and reducing popula- tion growth through education of girls and improved access to family planning. Due to CO2\u2019s long lifetime, it will take far too long to stabilize global temperatures through CO2 mit- igation alone. This is where mitigating short-lived climate pollutants comes in. By scaling up existing technologies, (UNEP/WMO, 2011), reduction of SL- CPs can provide a 0.5\u00b0C of avoided warming while achieving significant societal co-benefits (Shindell et al., 2017; UNEP, 2011). In fact, as illustrated in Figure 10, without reducing SLCPs it will be almost impos- sible to contain global temperatures within 1.5\u00b0C by the year 2100 (IPCC, 2018). Mitigating SLCPs alone also makes no sense, since warming driven by CO2 would continue and at some point overwhelm the one time temperature reduction of 0.5\u00b0C from SLCP mitigation (Shindell et al., 2017). Effective mitigation will require a set of integrated solutions based on an analysis of all the impacts. The interrelated nature of many of the problems and solutions makes it easy to address multiple is- sues in an integrated way through politically expe- dient framing.

SLCP mitigation and fast CO2 mitigation are both needed. Source: IPCC (2018) The 25 most important measures to clean up Asia-Pacific\u2019s air quality fall into three categories. The first category is called \u201cRegional Application of Conventional Measures.\u201d These comprise measures that normally form centrepieces in air quality manage- ment, but have not seen broad deployment around the region. They include industrial emission control through end-of-pipe devices and emissions standards; emission standards for vehicles, along with vehicu- lar inspection and maintenance; and dust control on construction sites and roads. The second category of measures, \u201cNext-stage Air Quality Measures\u201d remain uncommon in Asia and the Pacific. These include banning open burning of agricultural crop residue and residential waste, preventing forest and peatland fires, livestock manure management (to reduce methane emissions), better management of fertilizer application, improved brick kilns, reducing emissions from interna- tional shipping, and reducing leaks and emissions from refineries and paint production. The third category consists of measures that contribute to economic and human development priority goals through air quality benefits. The first of these involves switching house- holds away from solid fuels, to cook and heat with electricity or gas. In fact, one study identified switch- ing to clean cooking as the most important measure to reduce black carbon reaching the cryosphere (The World Bank, 2013). Other solutions include shifting electricity production from thermal to solar, wind and hydropower; giving households incentives for more energy-efficient appliances and for installing rooftop solar panels; introducing energy efficiency standards for industries; promoting electric vehicles; improving public transport; improving solid waste management; several measures to reduce methane emissions includ- ing intermittent aeration of rice fields, two-stage water treatment and biogas recovery, pre-mining recovery of coal mine gas, stopping routine flaring and reducing leaks in oil and gas production; as well as full compli- ance with the Kigali Amendment to replace HFCs in refrigeration. A number of these measures are identi- cal to ones listed by Project Drawdown to reduce CO2 globally, underscoring the interconnectedness of the problems and solutions. Figure 11 illustrates the impact of implementing these 25 measures on levels of PM2.5 exposure. While imple- mentation of current legislation already ensures that the number exposed to high levels of air pollution will not grow by 2030, implementation of the 25 measures will The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 24 greatly decrease the exposure levels faced by these four billion people.

Global CO2 emissions are dominated by China, the United States, the European Union and India; significant emission reduction in those countries will make a big difference globally, while the current net-zero conditions in Bhutan have virtually no impact on the global environment.

The region is one of the most complex in the world, and only detailed environmental monitoring and research will detect vulnerabilities and future challenges. This requires allocation of sufficient funds to environmental mon- itoring and research. (2) Many countries of the region have notoriously low levels of communication between academics and decision-makers. These countries should develop platforms that allow effective communication of physical as well as social science results relevant to policymaking, along with questions from policymak- ers that require academic input. (3) As the complex interplay between human activi- ties, drivers of environmental change, and impacts cross a variety of sectors, governments will need to strengthen cross-sectoral institutions that can reach across typically siloed ministry structures. (4) Issues and problems cross borders, both between subnational jurisdictions and between countries. This calls for developing effective communication platforms to ensure cross-border sharing of data, information, knowledge and experiences. (5) Multinational and intergovernmental institutions and fora need strengthening, along with a mandate to develop regional frameworks and targets, agreed upon by the region\u2019s governments, to protect the Third Pole. This can become a unifying goal that takes attention away from smaller contentions in the region such as border disputes.

They will need to provide disincentives for burning crop residue and garbage, and create walkable cities with convenient public transport. They may also be able to restrict entry of vehicles and materials that do not meet certain standards. National governments have the responsibility to adopt taxes and rules that promote clean transport and energy, that pro- mote investments by firms in appropriate areas.

Regional and global organizations, from the HKH- based ICIMOD, to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), as well as various UN bodies need to use the weight of international mandate to push for cross-bor- der coordination, cooperation, and sharing. At times, they may need to grow louder about calling their mem- ber countries to action. UNDP itself can play an important role both globally and within member countries. First, it can set an ex- ample through its country offices, replacing its vehicle fleets with only electric vehicles and powering its offic- es through renewable energy. Second, it can launch an educational campaign on what responsible leadership means for the next decade, providing guidelines to politicians but also raising the expectations of voters. Finally, it can seek to enter into partnerships with big technology firms, getting them to pledge to use only renewable energy at their server farms and to use their platforms to educate the public and to provide complete lifecycle analyses and environmental impact information for all of the products they sell.

INTRODUCTION Background Over history (1610 BC to AD 2014), there have been 1,212 confirmed tsunamis, of which 245 have been deadly. In the last 50 years alone there have been 37 deadly tsunamis or approximately one deadly tsunami every 1.5 years1. Although catastrophic tsunamis may not be as frequent as extreme climate events, the loss of lives and economic consequences of such events are substantial. Seventy-six per cent of tsunamis that have occurred took place in the Pacific Ocean and its marginal seas. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) tsunami were two of the worst tsunamis in recent years. Despite progress make in seismological and tsunami science in the last 50 years, these tsunamis caused devastating damage in the countries they hit. A tsunami can occur any time; there is no tsunami season, and tsunamis can strike during the day or night, and during good or bad weather2. Whilst both structural and non-structural measures are important and required, structural measures such as building sea walls can be costly and may not be long term solutions to withstand tsunami waves. Tsunami awareness and preparedness are key to mitigate the impact of tsunamis and prevent loss of lives and property. A lesson learned from the 2011 GEJE was that people should not be too dependent on early warning systems but be able to react based on their own judgement, and they can do this only if they are aware.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2ee3b78-4c01-412f-87e5-080e0cf48ab1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2ee3b78-4c01-412f-87e5-080e0cf48ab1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Guide for Schools to Prepare for Tsunamis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03379b2887b0c9335d2f2e2afcf3063f2413baea6d2ce957f303199b27aa1a19"}, "2": {"node_id": "1775940b-3a8b-4756-9199-53fed4449a50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbfb863ae21bd45611b03a57d86816058e3e5d755b0f5049e21d74bd528c55d9"}}, "hash": "4d6d23e5ecc78171d76beb61c70623c17a55b3cfd9cdb75024d6ad55c3843095", "text": "With these objectives, in 2017-18, UNDP implemented a regional project titled Partnerships for Strengthening School Tsunami Preparedness, hereafter referred to as the project, funded by the Government of Japan.

The Regional Guide has two main sections: Seven Steps of School Tsunami Evacuation Drills (Chapter 2), and School Tsunami Preparedness (Chapter 3). The Seven Steps are based on the technical expertise of internationally reputed agencies that UNDP partnered with for this project \u2013 the International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC), Hawaii; the IOC- UNESCO Indian Ocean Tsunami Information Center (IOTIC), Indonesia; Tohoku University, Japan and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). They illustrate the minimum steps for an effective tsunami evacuation drill. The chapter on School Tsunami Preparedness highlights measures that schools need to have in place before to be able to carry out an effective evacuation during a tsunami. These range from assessing their existing preparedness to assigning roles and responsibilities and engaging with external agencies outside the school system for effective evacuation. An important consideration is also how to address the special needs of students who are very young and those that may be physically disabled or injured so that they are not left behind. No one school drill or preparedness plan can be the same \u2013 each is distinct and needs to be tailored to its unique context4. The plans vary based on their location (urban/ rural), topography, distance from the sea, and cultural context. In addition to providing general guidance that are applicable to all tsunami risk schools, this guide also highlights the importance of context and that preparedness is an iterative process. By adapting this guide to schools\u2019 needs, schools can improve their preparedness and enhance the safety of their students and teachers during a tsunami event. It is also important to note that in many countries, schools have been used as temporary evacuation shelters or relief camps in the event of a disaster. However, the focus of this guide is to strengthen the preparedness and awareness of the school students and staff in the event that the school may be affected by a potential tsunami, hence, this guide will not cover the possible use of the school as a temporary shelter. 4 Pacific Tsunami Museum, Tsunami Evacuation Guidelines for Schools in Hawaii, 2012. CASE STUDY FROM JAPAN: The Miracle of Kamaishi Kamaishi East Junior High School was able to save more than 3,000 lives in 2011 during a devastating tsunami. When a magnitude 9.0 earthquake occurred, the school\u2019s students and staff immediately evacuated from the school buildings and moved to the assembly area. Students and staff followed the procedures which they had learnt through the school\u2019s tsunami disaster prevention education. The evacuation of the school also prompted neighbouring schools and local residents living in the city to evacuate as well. During the evacuation, students from the high school helped younger students make their way to the assembly area safely. While 1,000 people in the city still lost their lives, only five of them were school- age children, and they were not at school when the earthquake occurred.

SEVEN STEPS OF TSUNAMI EVACUATION DRILLS If a school receives a tsunami warning, the school is required to take immediate action by evacuating all students and staff to safety. This chapter defines seven steps that schools should take to evacuate. It is important that school drills are conducted to practice these steps and test the school preparedness plans regularly so that students and staff know what to do in the event of an actual tsunami. By following the Seven Steps of Tsunami Evacuation Drills, it is estimated that all students and teachers can be evacuated from the school buildings to the assembly area ideally within 15-20 minutes. Under the project, this was the minimum time that schools required in the event of a local tsunami5. In this chapter, reference has been made to Committees and Task Teams that schools should establish to strengthen preparedness. The composition of the teams and functions are described in chapter 3. These are indicative and based on the expert technical reports reviewed, as well as actual teams that were set up to manage the evacuation drills under the project. It is up to the schools to decide how to constitute teams that are required to fulfil the tasks defined in chapters 2 and 36.

Immediately upon hearing the signal, all students in classrooms \u201cDrop, Cover, Hold\u201d under sturdy tables and desks, or under door frames and concrete posts, or cover their heads with chairs. Note: \u2022 DROP down on hands and knees; this protects students from falling but allows them to move if they need to; \u2022 COVER heads and necks (or their entire bodies if possible) under a sturdy table or desk (if it is within a few steps of them). If there is no shelter nearby, then they should cover their heads and necks with their arms and hands; \u2022 HOLD on to their shelter (or their position to protect their heads and necks) until the shaking stops. If the shaking shifts their shelter around, they should move with it8. 7 A Terms of Reference for a Simulation Coordinator is included in chapter 3. 8 Civildefence.govt.nz \u201cWhen an earthquake happens, DROP, COVER, HOLD\u201d. Note: \u2022 An alternate warning system to alert the entire school should be in place in case of power failure. \u2022 In the event of a real earthquake or tsunami threat, teachers should not wait for tsunami warnings and evacuation orders. Instead they should take students to the assembly area, especially for a short lead-time tsunami. STEP 2: DROP. COVER. HOLD STEP 1: HEAR A LOUD SOUND SIMULATING AN EARTHQUAKE Teachers make sure that children move away from windows, glass, doorways, and unfastened furniture. Teachers ensure the classroom door remains open in order to prevent their students from being locked inside the classroom due to falling debris during an earthquake. Teachers then also \u201cDrop, Cover, Hold\u201d themselves while continuing to remain alert and monitor their students during the earthquake. Students and teachers Hold until the siren stops during a drill. Students taking cover under the table.

Students and teachers gather together. All students and teachers Drop down to their knees, Cover their heads and necks with their arms and hands, and Hold until the shaking stops. In science labs and kitchens: Teachers extinguish burners and close containers with hazardous materials and/or place them out of harm\u2019s way before taking cover. People in kitchen areas stay away from hot stoves, overhead cabinets, and from hazardous materials that may spill. In a wheelchair: The occupant locks it and takes the \u201cbrace position\u201d covering their head and neck. If in stadium seating, they will take the brace position in their seat. In a recliner or bed: They do not try to move elsewhere during the shaking, and Cover their head and neck with their arms or a pillow until the shaking stops10. Note: \u2022 \"Drop, Cover, Hold\" is a crucial measure to prevent students to protect their heads and necks from getting hit by objects that could fall during a real earthquake or high wind conditions. Students and teachers should \"Drop, Cover, Hold\" immediately and every time they feel the ground shaking, and Hold until the earthquake stops and the ground stops shaking. \u2022 Students and teachers are advised to start counting out loud when they feel the shaking begin during an earthquake. If the earthquake lasts more than 40 seconds, teachers should evacuate students immediately and take them to the predetermined assembly area instead of waiting for an official warning to arrive. \u2022 Teachers ensure the classroom door remains open during an earthquake in order to prevent their students from being locked inside the classroom due to falling debris on the other side obstructing the door from being opened. \u2022 In the event of a real earthquake, teachers and students should expect aftershocks. Though these secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake, they can be strong enough to do additional damage and to weaken structures11. 9 International Finance Corporation, Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Guidance for Schools, 2010 10 Shake out, Earthquake Preparedness Guide For People with Disabilities and Others with Access and Functional Needs. 11 Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization, Get Ready for the Earthquake: Follow 5 steps before the earthquake, during the earthquake, after the earthquake,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d3d663d-6678-4fd2-afe3-3f172c8d1c11": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d3d663d-6678-4fd2-afe3-3f172c8d1c11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Guide for Schools to Prepare for Tsunamis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27994cae4b8ad3cbb4dedee6ac17e9582415ec876c0aa24d78e351aff0f4ded7"}}, "hash": "27994cae4b8ad3cbb4dedee6ac17e9582415ec876c0aa24d78e351aff0f4ded7", "text": "2013.

Source: Earthquake Country Alliance, How to Protect Yourself During an Earthquake https://www.earthquakecountry.org/dropc overholdon/ 9 Once the signal simulating an earthquake is off, teachers check the safety of students. The Early Warning Team12 informs the Simulation Coordinator of any natural or official warning signs of a tsunami. The Simulation Coordinator then activates a second pre-determined signal. The Simulation Coordinator makes an announcement that a tsunami has occurred and instructs staff to carry out an evacuation, following their designated roles for this situation. Teachers immediately take their students from their classrooms to the predetermined assembly area, while carrying their evacuation backpacks (containing attendance lists, first aid kits, water, flashlights etc.)13 with them. Teachers keep their students grouped by their classes and with their buddies in order to ensure the headcount can be carried out quickly, to keep students calm, and to prevent students from being left behind. When evacuating classrooms, teachers lead students from the front. Teachers check that the evacuation route out of the school building is clear14 Class Monitors (or student captains) are at the rear of the group and check everyone stays together15. Students preferably walk out - and not run - from their classrooms in queues. Students cover their heads with their hands or with books until they arrive at the assembly area. Students do not go back into their classroom under any circumstance. Evacuation Assistant16 support teachers and students to move quickly and calmly out from the building and make their way to the assembly area using pre- determined evacuation routes. All school members evacuate on foot. Local authorities, traffic police, hospitals, and local communities are involved to support students to move safely to the assembly area. Especially in urban areas, 12 A Terms of Reference for an Early Warning Team is included in chapter 3. 13 See full list of equipment in chapter 3. 14 International Finance Corporation, Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Guidance for Schools, 2019. 15 Ibid. 16 A Terms of Reference for Evacuation Assistants are included in chapter 3 STEP 3: EVACUATE HAZARD ZONES LESSONS FROM THE PROJECT: Ideal Response Time The response time for evacuation after the issuance of a tsunami warning is dependent on several factors. These include whether the tsunami is local or distant, size and period of the waves, the near-shore bathymetry and shape of the coastline, the state of the tide etc. Under the project, the response time available differed for each country and school based on the tsunami risk and location. For instance, in Samoa, the schools were located barely 150 metres from the coast and students had about 15-20 minutes to evacuate. Given that the land is quite flat, the students and teachers had to run almost one kilometre inland to the safe evacuation zone. In other countries such as the Maldives, students had almost two hours to get to safe areas so they could evacuate in an organised manner and walk to the safe evacuation zones. 10 traffic police are required to stop traffic in traffic police are required to stop traffic in order to enable students to evacuate safely. Ambulances should be on standby in case accidents occur or students with special needs require additional assistance. The Safety and Security Team17 carries out a final sweep to make sure there is no one left behind in the school building once the school has been evacuated. Note: \u2022 A Class Monitor can be selected within each class, and they can assist the teacher to evacuate students safely. If the teacher gets injured, the Class Monitor can seek help from Evacuation Assistants18. \u2022 The lower the school grade, the more important it is for teachers to be directly involved in the drill. The higher the grade, the more students are able to participate, for example in conducting head counts or developing scenarios. \u2022 The buddy system is a useful means of effectively evacuating students. By pairing students as buddies (groups of two people), all students can evacuate classrooms safely and students are likely to be calmer because they can help each other. The buddy system is also particularly useful for ensuring students who have", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5c78686-7ddb-4ba2-81a4-1fc5a8e19956": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5c78686-7ddb-4ba2-81a4-1fc5a8e19956", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Guide for Schools to Prepare for Tsunamis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e68bb73f9a52913fc0143addbc273798234934bfa14c3b77bdc3cf121b8e2490"}}, "hash": "e68bb73f9a52913fc0143addbc273798234934bfa14c3b77bdc3cf121b8e2490", "text": "physical disabilities or who are injured get the additional support and assistance they require. \u2022 In the event of a tsunami, 2-3 members of the Safety and Security will go ahead to check if the evacuation route is clear and indicate to the Simulation Coordinator any alternate route already identified by the School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee. \u2022 Using motor vehicles during a tsunami event needs to be avoided as they can impede the quick evacuation from hazard zones to assembly areas, with traffic congestions making roads impassable19. \u2022 Teachers ensure students are careful about any potentially dangerous materials (such as debris from damaged infrastructure, broken glass, petroleum, gas, sewage lines etc.) along or near evacuation routes. \u2022 The Safety and Security Team checks whether school utilities are switched off in order to avoid damage to utilities and collateral damage to properties adjacent to the school. \u2022 In the event of a distant tsunami that takes hours to reach the shore20 the school cooperates with local authorities to control congestion caused by the huge influx of people and ensures that all students and staff arrive at the assembly area safely at least an hour before the tsunami arrives 21. 17 A Terms of Reference for the Safety and Security Team is included in chapter 3. 18 A Terms of Reference for Evacuation Assistants is included in chapter 3. 19 Pacific Tsunami Museum, Tsunami Evacuation Guidelines for Schools in Hawai\u2018i, 2012. 20 See Annex 1 for further information on different types of tsunamis and examples of response times. 21 UNESCO/IOC, A tsunami Warning, 2005. 11 Teachers keep their students grouped by their classes when they arrive at the assembly area. Teachers keep the situation calm and safe and watch out for strangers. As required, the First Aid and Relief Team22 performs first aid on injured students and staff. Note: \u2022 If possible, it is advisable to provide water and snacks at the assembly area so that students and teachers stay hydrated. \u2022 For some schools, the assembly area is an elevated area within the school premises. This is because a school is far from coastal zones or because its buildings are more durable and higher than other buildings in the community23. These schools should be prepared with equipment that can enable school members to survive for at least 72 hours. Ideally, these schools should have adequate facilities including toilets and clean water. The teacher of each class starts counting the students who are present by roll call in order to confirm the number of students present and identify if any students are missing. Roll call simply means the teacher calls out loud for each student by their name, using the same order as the attendance or registration sheet. Teachers report to the Simulation Coordinator on the status of the students, including any students that may be injured or unwell. After confirming the headcount and reporting to the Simulation Coordinator, teachers organise recreation activities to keep students calm and prevent panic. In the event that any students are missing, the Simulation Coordinator reports the names and identifying features of the missing students to the Rescue Team24. The Rescue Team searches for missing students or staff in the assembly area for a designated time. If all missing students are found, the Simulation Coordinator can signal the end of the drill. 22 A Terms of Reference for the Safety and Security Team is included in chapter 3. 23 Ministry of Education, Republic of Maldives, Guide for School Emergency Operations Plan, 2009. 24 A Terms of Reference for the Rescue Team is included in chapter 3.

All students and teachers return to their classrooms. 25 International Tsunami Information Centre IOC of UNESCO, Tsunami Warning, 2005. STEP 6: SIMULATION COORDINATOR SIGNALS END OF DRILL Note: \u2022 After a real tsunami event, the students and teachers may be relocated to a temporary evacuation shelter with the help of Evacuation Assistants. The same process of evacuating from the school to the assembly area is followed again \u2013 walking with buddies, headcount on arrival and reporting of any students or teachers that may be missing or injured. \u2022 In the event of a real tsunami, parents need to be notified in advance where they will meet their children. Parents should not come to the school, but instead should meet their children at the temporary evacuation shelter. Family reunification booths will be set up for this purpose. Students under the age of 16 are not permitted to leave except in the company of an adult approved in advance by a parent or guardian. Teachers ensure students are patient and follow safe family reunification procedures, and do not leave with anyone except those approved in advance by their parent or guardian. Evacuation Assistants keep the records of students who are released. 13 Debriefing to evaluate or assess the drill is important to identify what went well, what did not work, and what were the gaps and areas that need improvement so that the school preparedness and evacuation plan can be improved. There are two types of debriefing: a hot debrief, where the assessment is conducted immediately after the drill exercise to generate initial feedback, and a cold debrief, where the assessment is conducted within four weeks of the exercise. They complement each other: the hot debrief provides immediate feedback while the drill is still fresh, and the cold debrief allows time for reflection and greater insights. Teachers conduct hot debriefs with their students immediately after returning to their classrooms after the drill is finished. Similarly, the Simulation Coordinator conducts an initial hot debrief with the School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee 26 , staff, teachers, student representatives, and external observers. The Simulation Coordinator will then conduct further cold debriefs over the following weeks. The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee uses the result of these series of debriefs to propose recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the school\u2019s tsunami response, in particular given the school\u2019s unique challenges and cultural context. Once the improvements are implemented, the school should hold further drills to assess the outcomes and to iteratively identify further areas of improvement, as well as to ensure all students and staff are familiar with their expected roles. 26 A Terms of Reference for the School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee is included in chapter 3. STEP 7: ASSESS DRILL TO IMPROVE FOR THE REAL EVENT LESSONS FROM THE PROJECT: Reflections by Drill Evaluators For the schools under the project the drill evaluation revealed a range of gaps and issues that needed to be addressed, especially since many of the schools lacked preparedness plans. For instance, in Tonga and Solomon Islands, new evacuation routes were built as either they didn\u2019t exist or the older routes were no longer safe. Across all countries, many teachers felt that they themselves lacked the knowledge and training to respond to a tsunami warning, hence requested the need for user-friendly manuals. The involvement of the neighbouring community \u2013 the local authorities, local NGOs, parents, traffic police and even the military was perhaps the most important lesson \u2013 that preparing a school requires preparing the community in which the school is located in. Based on these lessons, chapter 3 identifies key ways in which schools can strengthen their preparedness to tsunamis and conduct successful drills. 14 3. SCHOOL TSUNAMI PREPAREDNESS Evacuation drills test preparedness plans and measures and help to address gaps and improve them. For a drill to be conducted successfully, it must be part of a preparedness and awareness plan. For all the schools under the project, awareness education programmes and workshops to review existing preparedness preceded the conduct of the drills. Broadly, the preparedness measures include the following which are elaborated upon in detail below: 1) Assessing the existing school tsunami preparedness through the collection of baseline data; 2) Identifying gaps in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb64867d-7beb-417f-97a1-1cc55e08ef8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb64867d-7beb-417f-97a1-1cc55e08ef8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Guide for Schools to Prepare for Tsunamis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3b2a3e699e0f442fdc1b099202b99db6e05f98e8961b7473308c67ac5a74150"}, "3": {"node_id": "d6722fb8-300b-4d17-8a5b-94a931ec7cad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d1bb19ec49080c4ba03ec16b0275ac8080d33529daf851b922f6f857e7a0cc2"}}, "hash": "ca75ca4da99e4d27e56c4e4c7ef129aef0ad05340ec3b7f2ce0e8e0156f46c25", "text": "preparedness and making recommendations; 3) Setting up teams and clarifying their roles and responsibilities; 4) Developing school preparedness plans; 5) Procuring equipment required by the school; 6) Raising awareness of tsunami risks through a range of activities; and 7) Supporting students after a real tsunami event. All these measures must consider the context of the school, be gender-sensitive and inclusive in their approach and address special needs of those who may have disabilities or injuries. The first step is to assess the existing school preparedness to tsunami risk. This information indicates the extent to which school members are currently prepared for, ready to respond to, and able to recover from tsunamis. The baseline data can be collected in two ways: (i) schools collect general information, and (ii) schools assess their existing safety information across five parameters. A tsunami warning requires the entire community to evacuate. School preparedness is more effective if the emergency plans are harmonized with those of local governments and surrounding communities.

General information A school should have general information such as total number of staff and students, emergency contact numbers and available facilities. An example of what this information should include is provided in the table below: General information to collect Further information and means to aggregate data The principal (and deputy) (names / contact numbers) Focal point in case of emergency (name / contact number) Total number of support staff (male / female) Total number of teachers (male / female) Total number of enrolled students (male / female) Total number of students with special needs (names / medication, symptoms etc.) School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee (names / contact numbers) Number of available emergency kits (contents of emergency kits) List of contact details of students\u2019 parents/guardians (names / contact numbers) Emergency contact numbers near the school (telephone numbers of emergency and support agencies) (e.g. nearest fire departments, hospitals, police station, radio and television stations, tsunami centre) School facilities (number of buildings / floors / classrooms / canteens / staff housing / water tanks etc.) The distance from the school to the coast and the school\u2019s elevation above sea level The distance of potentially feasible assembly areas from the school Table 1: Proposed format for General School Information for Emergencies27 b. Safety information In 2006, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC-UNESCO) and LIPI Indonesia developed a School Preparedness Assessment manual to assess the preparedness level of a school based on five preparedness parameters: a) policy, b) knowledge, c) preparedness and response plan, d) early warning system, and e) resource mobilization capacity. 27 As suggested in the project report from UNDP Pakistan - Tsunami Evacuation Plans For six schools: Reducing Loss of Lives of School children from Tsunamis in Asia-Pacific through Better Awareness and Preparedness, 2018. 16 Under this project, the tool was updated by UNDP in partnership with IOC-UNESCO and LIPI through a series of consultations with the Government of Indonesia, UN agencies, civil society, school representatives, and experts. The tool was developed into a mobile application called STEP-A Strengthening Tsunami and Earthquake Preparedness and tested in several schools in Indonesia, Maldives and Sri Lanka during the first phase of the project. STEP-A can be used to assess the existing status of school preparedness at regular intervals thereby assessing not only the baseline but also the actions and improvements made to address tsunami risks28. 28 See Annex 3 for the STEP A checklists.

Photo: UNDP Indonesia 17 Based on the drills conducted, the project identified gaps across the five parameters and proposed recommendations to address them29 a. Policy \u2022 The scoping missions undertaken under the project showed that the level of schools\u2019 preparedness to tsunamis varied from school to school. \u2022 Disaster preparedness education was not uniformly integrated into school curriculum. Moreover, where it was integrated, teachers did not find it user-friendly and it lacked practical application. \u2022 Most schools did not have committees or teams for carrying out drills, training staff and coordinating with external partners including the local community. Recommendations: \u2022 Education policies should include integration of disaster preparedness education into school curriculum. Practical information on how to respond to a tsunami warning and do\u2019s and don\u2019ts should also be shared. \u2022 A school policy can help to formalize the disaster preparedness arrangements that a school may establish, and this policy should include collaboration with other partners such as the local administration, the traffic police, hospitals or even the military as may be applicable in the country context. \u2022 Each school should establish teams with clear roles and responsibilities for preparedness and conduct of tsunami drills. Some of the teams have been mentioned in chapter 2 and the next section describes in greater detail their roles. For instance, an overall team, such as the School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee, should be established including members of the school administration, staff, student representatives (including from vulnerable groups), parents, and the local community30. Depending on the context, experts from the fire services, the police, the health department etc. could also join and support the Committee31 29 UNESCO/IOC, School Based Disaster Preparedness 30 International Finance Corporation, Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Guidance for Schools, 2010. 31 UNDP India, School Disaster Management Plan. 2. GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 18 b. Knowledge The lack of awareness of tsunami risk amongst staff and students was also apparent in many schools even in the most tsunami prone areas, hence, a need to organise tsunami education and awareness before developing or testing the plans was strongly felt. Recommendations: \u2022 Staff and students should be aware of hazard risks in general and in particular how it affects them. Such awareness raising can be done in a variety of ways \u2013 through posters, signages and instructions; through theme days, competitions and events; and through other fun learning activities. For instance, in Thailand, interactive information booths were set up to provide practical information in a fun and non-threatening way. \u2022 Schools can also collaborate with other schools and local NGOs to hold events to increase awareness of tsunamis and tsunami drills for people living in the community32. For instance, in Viet Nam, rock concerts and art competitions were organised raising awareness of tsunami risks to the schools and also the local community in the city of Hanoi. \u2022 Several schools under the project used the opportunity to conduct comprehensive disaster awareness and education training for teachers and students on recognising tsunami trigger signs and even learning first aid practices. Teachers can use various teaching materials to increase the awareness of students (see Section 6). Teachers can encourage their students to share the knowledge about tsunamis and drills they learned at school with their families and neighbours33. \u2022 For most schools, this was the first time that a comprehensive awareness programme and drill was conducted. In some countries, Training of Trainer materials were developed that could be shared and help more schools replicate drills. c. School Preparedness and Response Plan \u2022 Most schools did not have tsunami/ disaster preparedness plans. Where they existed, the plans were not updated or tested through drills. \u2022 Most schools did not have risk information, such as hazard maps or inundation data which are necessary to identify safe evacuation routes. Hence, much of the evacuation route mapping was based on local knowledge of past tsunamis or floods, and not performed scientifically. \u2022 Some schools did not have the proper equipment needed for tsunami drills and did not have enough", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebc8bb88-bbc2-41b2-b56a-2b853706badb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebc8bb88-bbc2-41b2-b56a-2b853706badb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Guide for Schools to Prepare for Tsunamis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68ecc8470e6369ac027b105d6b7de2fb6133a8630dce64ddeb896a3ec9511dec"}}, "hash": "68ecc8470e6369ac027b105d6b7de2fb6133a8630dce64ddeb896a3ec9511dec", "text": "first aid kits in particular. \u2022 Some students and teachers needed extra help because they were not fit enough to run to the assembly areas. 32 UNDP, Tsunami Vulnerability of Bangladesh: Science-based Assessment and Recommendations. 33 Ibid. 19 Recommendations: \u2022 Each tsunami prone school should have its own disaster preparedness plan that\u2019s unique to its location, topography and cultural context. The plan should include a comprehensive assessment of the hazard risks to the school, roles and responsibilities of staff and students, equipment and facilities available, special needs of students with disabilities or others, coordination with external partners, evacuation routes, and process of evacuation. \u2022 The plan should be developed in a consultative and collaborative manner \u2013 involving staff, student representatives, and students with special needs as well as parents, the local administration, local hospital, the local community etc. as required. \u2022 Schools should determine main and alternative evacuation routes and ensure that communication is still possible despite poor network services34. d. School Early Warning System Most of the schools did not have the proper tools or an alarm system to receive and disseminate early warning messages from reliable sources. e. Resource Mobilisation Capacity A lesson learned was that a school drill especially where students and teachers need to leave the premises to evacuate to a safe location cannot be done in isolation and requires the support of a host of external partners. 34 UNDP, Tsunami Vulnerability of Bangladesh: Science-based Assessment and Recommendations. Recommendations: \u2022 Schools should have access to tsunami warning information from official reliable sources such as governments\u2019 meteorological department. An Early Warning Team can help to understand and interpret warning information from both natural signs and official warnings. \u2022 Schools should be equipped with bells, whistles, alarms, signages, loudspeakers and any other kind of device required to conduct an evacuation. Wheelchairs for students with disabilities or injuries and first aid kits should be available and accessible. All equipment should be regularly checked, stored safely, and maintained. Officials explain the evacuation signages in local language. Photo: UNDP PNG 20 Recommendations: \u2022 The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee should engage with parents and local authorities to develop tsunami risk and resource maps, to decide the location of assembly areas and evacuation routes, to conduct and assess drills, and to make plans for temporary shelters35. Schools could build partnerships with local hotels or hospitals if there is no safe place to evacuate in the school grounds during a tsunami event. \u2022 Local government, traffic police, and local hospitals were engaged in the drill preparations and process, as were armed forces and private organisations depending on the context. Moreover, NGOs such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have a large network of volunteers that can be deployed to support safe evacuation. \u2022 Before the conduct of a drill, it is also important to inform students and their parents beforehand what is going to happen so that they are prepared and do not panic. For instance, during the first drill in Bali, several students fainted due to dehydration or because they were not used to running up several flights of stairs to reach the safe evacuation point. In the follow-up drills teachers instead told their students to have adequate breakfast, and water and snacks were provided at the assembly area. 35 UNISDR Asia and the Pacific, Guidance Notes: School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness, 2010. LESSONS FROM THE PROJECT: Including Students with Disabilities in Tsunami Preparedness Schools may have students with disabilities that require special support during tsunami preparedness and awareness. Disabilities could be of different types \u2013 visually impaired, hearing disabilities or physical disabilities that require different kinds of support. To be able to address their special needs, schools should: 1. Include students with disabilities as members of the School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee so that they can contribute to the planning process; 2. Consult experts on disability inclusion in tsunami preparedness and evacuation in order to understand what support is required; 3. Procure equipment such as wheelchairs or stretchers that can be used both by students with disabilities or injured students; 4. Train evacuation assistants to communicate with and support students with disabilities so that they can be safely evacuated. Please note that these measures are recommended for tsunami-prone schools that may have a few students with disabilities and not for tsunami-prone schools that are dedicated to students with disabilities \u2013 the latter will require more specialized procedures that this regional guide does not cover.

These can be categorised into four Task Teams with each comprising 5-8 persons depending on the size of the school45: 45 Ibid. The Team: 1. Evacuation Assistants: They could be senior students from the school or volunteers from the community that are responsible for: \u2022 Helping students and teachers evacuate by using pre-determined evacuation routes and accompanying them on their way to the assembly area. \u2022 Providing additional support to students with mobility issues. \u2022 In the event of a real tsunami where the school members have been relocated to the temporary evacuation shelter, they set up family reunification booths and keep records of the students who are released. 2. The First Aid and Relief Team: They could be trained school medical staff or trained volunteers from the community that are responsible for: \u2022 Performing first aid on injured students and teachers at the assembly area. \u2022 Holding first aid trainings for students and teachers. 3. The Rescue Team: They could be trained school administration staff that are responsible for: \u2022 Searching for missing students or teachers in the assembly area after receiving the list from the Simulation Coordinator. \u2022 In the event of a real tsunami, they inform the government\u2019s First Responders to support search and rescue efforts. 4. The Safety and Security Team: They could be trained school administration staff that are responsible for: \u2022 Carrying out a final sweep to make sure there is no one left behind in the school once the school has been evacuated. \u2022 Checking whether school utilities (such as the gas and electricity) are switched off. \u2022 In the event of a real tsunami, 2-3 team members go ahead to check if the evacuation route is clear and indicate to the Simulation Coordinator any alternate route already identified by the School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee. \u2022 In the event of a real tsunami, after the \u2018all clear\u2019 message is issued, the Team goes back to the school first to assess whether it is safe for students and teachers to return to their classrooms or if they should go on to the temporary evacuation shelters, and reports their assessment to the Simulation Coordinator for appropriate action. 25 e) The Logistics Team The Logistics Team consists of at least 20 people including school administration staff and senior students. f) The Administration and Finance Team The Administration and Finance Team could consist of 3-5 school administration staff. The Team: 1. Purchases the equipment46 and supplies (water, snacks, medical etc.) requested by the Logistics Team. 2. Keeps records of the internal and external partners, supplies and equipment the school may require after a tsunami. g) The Documentation Team The Documentation Team consists of at least 5 people including staff, school medical staff, and senior students (both a boy and a girl). The Team: 1. Identifies important educational and administrative documents, makes copies of these documents and stores them in a safe place (such as on external USB drives that the Team can carry with them during an evacuation). 2. Brings the list of students, staff, and their emergency contacts during an evacuation. 3.

Produce a tsunami risk and resource map for the school and community A tsunami risk and resource map is typically a sketch of an area or a place showing the hazard risks it is vulnerable to and the resources or facilities available that can be used to respond to the risks. Tsunami prone schools can develop a risk and resources map that includes data on past tsunami experiences to understand how potential tsunamis could affect the school and the community and use this information to draw a risk and resource map. The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee who is responsible for producing the map should engage the school authorities, staff, and student representatives in developing the map. External partners including local authorities, parents, local NGOs, and others should be involved in the process of mapping the risks surrounding the school. The process of making the map can also contribute to increasing the community\u2019s awareness of and preparedness to tsunamis.: Safe and Be Prepared, 2014. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002289/228963e.pdf The steps below explain how a school can develop a tsunami risk and resources map. a) Collect data on past tsunami experiences The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee should contact local authorities to access data on past tsunamis that occurred in the area and affected the schools48. If such data is not available, the Committee should organise consultations with local authorities, community members, and local NGOs to collect anecdotal evidence of tsunami events and their impacts on the school and surrounding areas. If possible, the local authority or School Committee should reach out to tsunami expert agencies for risk information or joining the consultations. 48 UNDP is supporting countries in the Asia-Pacific region to develop disaster loss and damage databases to record historical disaster data for risk informed development planning by Governments. LESSONS FROM THE PROJECT: Gender-sensitive Approach to Tsunami Preparedness While disasters do not discriminate, they may have differential impact on boys and girls. Schools should follow a gender-sensitive approach by: \u2022 Ensuring that girls and female teachers are well represented in the Committee and all Task Teams. \u2022 Addressing special needs of adolescent girls in the event of an evacuation (for instance, those that may be menstruating). \u2022 During the hot debriefs, discussing issues related to safety and privacy for both boys and girls.

Identify potential assembly areas and temporary evacuation shelters50 The Committee, community members, and local authorities should identify potential assembly areas, either within or outside the school grounds, and mark them on the tsunami risk and resource map. In the event that a school may not be safe to return to, the evacuated staff and students will be taken to temporary evacuation shelters. Buildings selected as temporary evacuation shelters should be: \u2022 Located in a safe area that is easily accessible and not too far from the assembly area; \u2022 Designated for the school only so that students are in a safe environment; and \u2022 Equipped with electricity, water supply, and toilets. iii. Identify tsunami evacuation routes The risk and resource map will help to identify potential evacuation routes from the school to the assembly areas. Alternative evacuation routes should also be identified to be used in worst case scenarios such as landslides occurring at the base of steep slopes or rainfall creating floods along local streams, storm sewers, and canals. Arrows can be drawn on the map to indicate the primary and alternative evacuation routes. 50 For more information please see: Save the Children, Limiting and planning for schools as temporary evacuation centres in emergencies: Policy brief and practice guidance for Pacific Nations, 2017. https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/55716_55716stc01439schoolsasevacuationcen.pdf The assembly areas should be: \u2022 An open space that is safe from potential hazardous materials and debris; \u2022 As far away as possible from coastal zones (the safe distance will be based on the estimation of the possible inundation of water); \u2022 At as high an elevation as possible; \u2022 A place where public facilities such as toilets and clean water are accessible (or can be built); \u2022 Able to be reached in a few minutes by walking or running; the time needed to get there should be estimated when determining assembly areas.

LESSONS FROM THE PROJECT Organising Disability-inclusive Drills in Thailand The drill planning process helped identify students who may need special care while evacuating such as elementary school students or students with disabilities. In Thailand, three of the schools had students with physical disabilities. An expert from the Disability Council of Thailand was invited to train the school authorities on disability inclusive disaster risk reduction (DiDRR) and share practical ways on how to involve students with disabilities in the planning process and evacuation drill. Students with mobility issues were evacuated on wheelchairs during the drills. The instructional drill video that was produced includes the importance of supporting students with disabilities or injuries so that no one is left behind. 31 3) Testing and updating the school preparedness plan Producing a good school preparedness plan is an iterative and ongoing process of practicing drills and preparedness measures, evaluating their effectiveness, and implementing policies and measures to improve them. Schools can test their preparedness plans by practicing drills and updating plans based on the analysis of the results of the post-drill debriefs. The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee is responsible for this. By practicing drills, schools can assess the feasibility of their preparedness plans, the first aid skills of school members, the effectiveness of warning dissemination systems, and school members\u2019 understanding of the plan57. Drills also enable schools to identify weaknesses in their plans which may require further clarification or adjustment. Once a school has updated their preparedness plan, they can test the effectiveness of the changes during the next drill58. This process enables schools to tailor their plans to meet the needs of their school members in their unique context (including their location, topography, distance from the sea, and culture)59. Schools should try different scenarios when they use drills to test their plans60. For instance, a school can conduct a drill under a scenario where some teachers are injured during an earthquake, necessitating Class Monitors to lead their classmates in the evacuation. Schools should initially test their plans using simple scenarios, and progress to more complex scenarios which engage an increasing range of stakeholders. School members can be informed of drills in advance, or schools can practice drills without prior announcement in order to assess different aspects of their preparedness plans61. Drills should be always treated as though they are a real tsunami event 62.

By involving students, teachers, and neighbouring communities in learning about tsunamis and evacuation planning, schools ensure that all parties are aware of the risks and know how to respond to a tsunami warning. i. Increasing tsunami awareness amongst students In addition to basic tsunami information that may be part of regular school curriculum, schools can access additional resources for age-appropriate learning materials. ii. Increasing tsunami awareness amongst students\u2019 parents Schools should also prepare materials for parents with information on their role during school tsunami drills including inviting some parents to observe and evaluate the drills.

Increasing tsunami awareness in the community Schools can increase awareness of tsunamis in the community through: \u2022 Campaigns: Schools can organise media campaigns to disseminate tsunami information through channels such as leaflets, flyers, posters of tsunami themed-days, tsunami warning signs, and evacuation map banners. The information can be disseminated in public places such as intersections, markets, and communal public areas67. \u2022 Themed-days: Students can organise tsunami themed-days. Students can exhibit murals and distribute flyers they designed for the event 68 . The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee can prepare booklets and guidebooks to provide additional information on tsunamis and drills69. Furthermore, increasing awareness and providing knowledge on tsunamis for students, their parents, and their communities will empower people to engage in grassroots initiatives that build community risk reduction capacity, such as performing local vulnerability assessment and mapping initiatives, identifying hazards, developing resilience action plans, and implementing those plans70. 66 International Finance Corporation, Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Guidance for Schools, 2010. 67 The State Ministry for Research and Technology Indonesia, Guideline Tsunami Drill Implementation for City and Regency 68 UNESCO Viet Nam, Assessment and Preparedness Toolkit. 69 The State Ministry for Research and Technology Indonesia, Guideline Tsunami Drill Implementation for City and Regency. 70 UNESCO, A Teacher's Guide to Disaster Risk Reduction: Stay Safe and Be Prepared, 2014.

These school events were opened to people in nearby villages. In remote areas. they became enjoyable community events. Drawing competition: The campaign in Viet Nam concluded with the national award ceremony for the drawing competition that was run in every participating school. The national event enjoyed large donor and media attention. Photo booth : After a long drill day, students in Thailand had fun in a photo booth using thematic props (painted tsunami waves; flags etc.) they created during drill preparations. Photos help students memorise and the purpose of the event. Photo competition: To commemorate 13 years from the last tsunami in Thailand, schools organised a photo competition to explore students\u2019 perceptions towards tsunamis. Rock concert: Inviting young pop and rock musicians to perform in campaign events in Viet Nam generated significant media coverage and social media attention for disaster awareness. Videos: Some countries produced short educational videos on how to conduct a tsunami drill in schools. In the Philippines, it resulted in organising drills in every tsunami-prone schools in Eastern Visayas region. LESSONS FROM THE PROJECT Raising Awareness on Tsunamis Celebrity ambassador: Campaign \u201cSchools of Son Tinh\u201d in Viet Nam named a TV presenter Ms. Thuy Van their celebrity ambassador. Ms. Van participated in key events and gave several media interviews for television and newspaper about disaster preparedness.

It will likely to be displayed in children\u2019s home together with other keepsakes. Celebrity ambassador Thuy Van. Photo: UNDP Viet Nam 39 The School Emergency and Disaster Preparedness Committee should plan for how teachers can support their students after they experience a tsunami71. Children are more likely to experience serious trauma than adults, and teachers\u2019 support can be crucial for students to recover as teachers interact with their students on a daily basis and are often one of the few adults they trust. Students\u2019 parents may not be able to take care of their children fully as they too are suffering trauma. Students who have gone through a tsunami event can have trauma from the losses of their families, friends, and houses. A typical response of students to these losses is grief. Whilst some students can verbalise their feelings, many students cannot express themselves and instead reveal their grief through behavioural changes. In order to support their students after a tsunami event, teachers should become more sensitive to changes in their students\u2019 language or behaviours72. 71 Ibid. 72 UNESCO, A Teacher's Guide to Disaster", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "573fba0a-11d3-4360-80c8-89805b40afdc": {"__data__": {"id_": "573fba0a-11d3-4360-80c8-89805b40afdc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional Guide for Schools to Prepare for Tsunamis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ef88f1c55cb9115b187b5df4055f61491adab0e687dc1bbc748a76fe6efc430"}, "3": {"node_id": "66ff5f45-dd76-4cdb-9b5c-8f073bdeb7b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regional-guide-schools-prepare-tsunamis", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa7a12b9c236aa1ade280430f9e7975f507a6daa703551f7e6b8a298e862eacd"}}, "hash": "9d708061810d491b38212a83c0b2105338f2546c5bcf7eda8ccd6a837c77056f", "text": "Risk Reduction: Stay Safe and Be Prepared, 2014. 7.

For instance, the Committee can connect these students to local hospitals in order to provide them with the appropriate professional treatment and support they need.

The three key components of relaxation exercises are typically breathing, visualisation, and physical movement, and teachers can pick exercises that are culturally appropriate. \u2022 Drawing classes, to help students express themselves visually where they feel unable to do so verbally. \u2022 Engage the parents to better support their students, both at school and at home. \u2022 Hold group meetings amongst school staff, both to share feedback on exercises and relaxation techniques to better support their students, and to give each other emotional support. As the teachers also experienced the tsunami, they are likely to be suffering from trauma as well and could be at risk of becoming overwhelmed without the support of their peers. 41 4. ANNEXES Annex 1: Background information on tsunamis This section will discuss the different types of tsunamis and some examples of ideal response times to (i) Distant tsunamis and (ii) Local tsunamis. A tsunami is a series of waves caused by an earthquake beneath the ocean floor or a major landslide into the ocean73. A tsunami\u2019s effects include not only the rapid flooding of low-lying land, but also dangerously strong currents. As the water travels inland, these currents scrub the ground and pick up large debris, giving the waves an additional element of destructive force74. Whilst some tsunamis occur far away (distant tsunamis) and take hours to reach shores, other tsunamis are generated near the coasts of countries (local tsunamis) and can reach their shores in just a few minutes. It is important to know the difference between these different types of tsunamis as this determines how people are able to respond to them. i. Distant tsunamis A distant tsunami is caused by a great earthquake that occurred far away in the ocean, up to a thousand kilometres away, and can take over three hours to travel from its source to the coast75. Distant tsunamis occur less frequently than local tsunamis but can have devastating impacts. People 73 A Guide to Tsunamis for Hotels: Tsunami Evacuation Procedures. IOC Manuals and Guides, 69.

The school will firstly receive a tsunami watch issued by the National Disaster Management Office and Meteorological Services Office (or the equivalent government departments in each country) through radio and television broadcasts. A tsunami watch informs the school that a magnitude 7.0 or larger earthquake has occurred which could cause a tsunami which could soon affect the area where the school is located78. The Early Warning Team then monitors whether this tsunami watch is cancelled or whether it is upgraded to a tsunami warning79. The Early Warning Team also observes if there are any natural warnings of a tsunami event. The school prepares for a possible evacuation of students and staff from school buildings, including potentially using alternative evacuation routes. Once the likelihood of a tsunami occurring has been verified, the school will receive a tsunami warning from the National Disaster Management Office or Meteorological Services Office. It will state that a tsunami with significant coastal flooding and powerful currents is expected (or imminent) at the coastline of the community and may continue for several hours after the arrival of the first wave80. Whilst it is possible to accurately predict the speed and direction of a distant tsunami, it is more difficult to predict the height of the tsunami's waves. This determines how dangerous a tsunami will be, and tsunami waves can be small and harmless or huge and devastating81. Schools should prepare for the worst-case scenario. Schools should also be aware that they may not be able to receive the tsunami warning due to power or communication system failures, so if any natural warnings of a tsunami are observed after the initial tsunami watch, then the school should immediately evacuate all students and staff82. 76 Pacific County Emergency Management Agency, Do you know the difference between a Local Tsunami and a Distant Tsunami? 2015. 77 Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. 2014.

Local tsunamis A local tsunami is generated by a nearby earthquake that occurred within two hundred kilometres, and can reach the coast within minutes or up to an hour83. A local tsunami is preceded by a strong earthquake which makes it hard for people to remain standing, or by a slow shaking of the ground for a longer time84. The first wave of a local tsunami may reach coastal areas within minutes of the earthquake stopping85. Historically, 90 per cent of tsunami casualties have been caused by local tsunamis86. A local tsunami may also be preceded by the rapid rise and drop of the sea level, which exposes reefs, rocks, and fish on the seabed87. Furthermore, a loud \u201croaring\u201d sound which is similar to that of a train or a jet plane can be heard from the ocean as a tsunami gets close to the coast88. Ideal response time Earthquakes may be the only tsunami warning signals for a local tsunami and the school should respond to this natural warning immediately89. The school may not have enough time to receive official warnings for a local tsunami because of its short arrival time. The school may not even receive any official warnings from tsunami warning centres or local governments because of power and communication system failures caused by the earthquake90. 83 Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.

Realizing this vision will require mobilizing a diverse range of public and private resources to contribute to sustainable development outcomes. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which outlines a framework for financing the 2030 Agenda, calls for integrated approaches to finance that are driven at the national level.1 Countries face a number of challenges in developing an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. Mobilizing the scale of public and private resources required while maximizing their impact on the social, environmental and economic dimensions of the 2030 Agenda presents a range of challenges, from managing complex financing instruments to designing and implementing effective policies, and collaborating with a diverse range of actors. These challenges are often rooted in, or made more difficult by, misalignment between the planning and finance policy functions of government, as well as the participation of only a narrow group of stakeholders in dialogue and decisions on financing. In many contexts, there are opportunities to strengthen the connections between the tools of national planning, which set out a development vision to aspire to, and the financing policies a government uses to manage its own resources and influence those invested by others. National development plans may have developed without a clear sense of their financial viability. Policies towards different types of finance may have developed without a clear sense of how they come together or how the outcomes they target collectively contribute towards the SDGs. At the same time, dialogue about the contributions that different forms of public and private finance can make to the SDGs is often limited to a narrow group of policymakers specialized in financing. With limited 1 It notes that \u201ccohesive, nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of our efforts\u201d. Addis Ababa Action Agenda, paragraph 9. Available at: http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/ uploads/2015/08/AAAA_Outcome.pdf participation from wider actors across government, the private sector, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other actors, opportunities to build a broad-based reform agenda may be missed and innovative solutions overlooked. In response to these challenges, UNDP has developed the Development Finance Assessment (DFA) as a tool to identify opportunities to mobilize additional sources of finance and use existing financial resources more efficiently to achieve the SDGs. The DFA offers support for governments and their partners in identifying and building consensus around solutions to address financing challenges. It makes finance issues accessible to policy and decision makers beyond the technical specialists in ministries of finance. It follows a process of multi-stakeholder consultation informed by accessible analysis on finance policy issues and what they mean for a wide range of actors and builds an agreed roadmap that can support progress across a range of areas (Figure 1), including: \u2022 Strengthening the link between planning and finance policy functions, for example by: strengthening the governance mechanisms that align policies and annual budgets to the national development plan; estimating the cost of national development plans; and developing holistic strategies for mobilizing the public and private resources that will be needed to realize the objectives of a national plan. \u2022 Strengthening multi-stakeholder dialogue on financing, for example by: supporting multi- stakeholder SDG platforms at the country level; incorporating public and private finance into regular progress reporting; and enhancing multi-stakeholder participation in policy processes. \u2022 Solutions and reforms for mobilizing resources, for example by: strengthening policy and capacity to attract sustainable, inclusive private investment; and accessing untapped sources of international finance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7458a6bd-a508-465a-a303-31ea1bf451f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7458a6bd-a508-465a-a303-31ea1bf451f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c2943ced91d06602020206d33bd6b415ce6ff08a8eada890efba2a9e3ffdbb6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec67e02f-17f7-444f-bd36-ecf1ccc37312", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65d579bf1003343c6f4e08516cfecc4179a7aa10453ef2a0dc0779726b007a18"}}, "hash": "76f1cfdcd6b867b3419361162259e73c6c92b2fcdd382b6950cf5e1e7ce62d1d", "text": "\u2022 Effectively managing finance for results, for example by: achieving better development outcomes with public finance, developing outcome-based incentives for private investment; broadening the mandate of revenue authorities; more effectively targeting 2 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK vulnerable or excluded populations; strengthening parliamentary scrutiny over finance; and enhancing data collection systems.

It aims to demystify technical debate on public and private finance and brings together decision makers from across government, the private sector, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), NGOs, development partners and other actors. By engaging this wide group of actors and making financing dialogue more accessible, the DFA aims both to build a broader base of support for reform agendas and to identify innovative solutions to the challenges of financing the SDGs. By bringing together and building a constituency of actors working together on financing the SDGs, the DFA makes an important contribution to the establishment of SDG platforms at the country level. These platforms can stimulate innovative solutions to the challenges of realizing the SDGs and be a catalyst for more widespread and effective partnership between actors. The DFA is centred around an analytical framework that informs discussions throughout the DFA process. It is a multidisciplinary framework which assesses the elements a government needs to have in place to instigate an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. It includes five dimensions that encompass a wide spectrum of policy and institutional factors. It undertakes a comprehensive analysis of finance trends and assesses integrated planning and financing functions, public\u2013 private collaboration, monitoring and review frameworks, and transparency and accountability.2 Within each of these areas, it identifies ways to enhance an integrated approach to public and private finance. It aggregates information from a wide range of sources and uses case studies from other countries to help inspire practitioners about potential policy solutions. The framework is designed to be adapted to the context and priorities of the country in question, and can be applied at the macro, sectoral and/or thematic level. In this way, the DFA can support governments and their partners to develop a more integrated approach to financing the SDGs. It can help to draw together and complement reforms that may be ongoing or planned in a range of areas such as mobilizing particular resources, enhancing the impact of finance on SDG outcomes, costings exercises and capacity development. 2 This builds on prior work on integrated national financing frameworks, for example, in UNDP (2016).

UNDP is uniquely placed to support countries in the DFA assessment. The organization\u2019s multidisciplinary strengths and ability to convene dialogue, bringing together stakeholders from diverse public and private communities to work together, responds directly to countries\u2019 needs in developing wider participation in financing. UNDP has a long history of supporting countries in both the areas of planning and finance policy and its central focus on sustainable development means it can often offer a fresh perspective in these areas. Through its network of country offices, UNDP also has access to a wide range of knowledge across countries and academic disciplines that allows them to advise on the financing opportunities and approaches that a country may benefit from. The DFA is one component of a wider portfolio of finance- related services that UNDP offers countries, including the Financing Solutions for Sustainable Development platform,3 and others which are outlined in the UNDP guidebook on financing the 2030 Agenda.4 In addition, UNDP, as the support platform of the UN development system providing an integrator function in support of countries in their efforts to realize the 2030 Agenda, facilitates a joined-up support of UN Funds, Programmes and Agencies at the country level in Financing for 3 Accessible at: http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home. html 4 UNDP (2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a12d56f-5df5-456c-b1b6-d4e3c88c554c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a12d56f-5df5-456c-b1b6-d4e3c88c554c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2910c528cba0a0e3c4dba3a7a61686a6647e7a3cdda6923b103eb4087c00131c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c18ef576-99de-4bee-bb0d-ae4f9c61eb10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2662c692bef3f04a06ba12e9cb991aff0e0ae7e5ff5c67d2fe85eaae6dc43fb"}}, "hash": "d6e2113499566b7dc38cc4dcda827db5522e0d0ec94f4605ddf8fc39fcf930a3", "text": "html 4 UNDP (2018).

DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Development. UNDP has supported or is supporting DFAs in 25 countries at the time of publication (Figure 2). This guidebook outlines the objectives, process, analysis and outcomes of a DFA. It is designed for government officials as well as UNDP country offices and UN country teams (UNCT) and other stakeholders such as development partners, civil society organizations (CSOs) and private sector organizations that are interested in participating in the DFA process. It aims to inform these stakeholders about the relevance of a DFA to their context and policy priorities. It can also be used by the teams undertaking a DFA as a basis for guiding the process, analysis and design of a roadmap. This version of the guidebook, version 2.0, has been revised based on the experiences of DFAs over 2014\u20132018 and consultations undertaken over late 2017 and 2018. It will continue to be developed, including the addition of forthcoming modules on DFAs in conflict-affected situations, at the subnational level and focusing on thematic priorities such as \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d. The DFA guidebook is complemented by a sister document, Country innovations for integrated SDG financing, which presents practical examples of country experiences in reforms designed to enhance the integration of planning and finance policy functions and the integration of public and private financing for the SDGs.

The DFA guidebook is divided into three modules covering different aspects of the process: \u2022 The first module details the analytical framework. It presents an overview of the framework as a whole alongside guidance on each of the five dimensions. The concept, guiding questions and sources for each dimension are detailed. The guiding questions are divided between contextual questions that are important for understanding the current financing context at the country level, and core questions, that are at the heart of the DFA\u2019s added value, which help to identify and develop recommendations for the roadmap. \u2022 The second module outlines the process of undertaking a DFA, from the initial scoping, determination of roles and responsibilities and set-up to the implementation of the process and follow-up. \u2022 The final module provides guidance on developing a roadmap, outlining the steps that can be taken, providing a number of examples of common recommendations and listing a number of relevant service offerings that can provide support in specific areas of financing. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 5 Module: the DFA analytical framework At its core, the DFA process is informed by an analytical framework that looks at the elements a government may use to implement and instigate an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. It aggregates information from a range of sources to paint a uniquely holistic picture of public and private finance flows. And it assesses the policies and institutions used by government to mobilize and maximize the impact of public and private finance on the SDGs. This module is structured as follows. The first section presents an overview of the analytical framework and its added value in relation to other financing assessments. The second section presents an overview of the finance flows that are covered by the DFA analysis and summarizes common sources of information. The third section details the core analytical framework. The guiding questions for each dimension are divided into contextual questions that build a rigorous understanding of the country context and core questions which frame the analytical added value of the DFA. Optional questions that some oversight teams may wish to explore are also included. This section of the module also describes how to undertake the quantitative analysis that the DFA offers. Overview of analytical framework The analytical framework includes five interlinked dimensions which are analysed in the DFA (Figure 3, also summarized in Box 1). The five dimensions are designed to provide an integrated approach to financing the SDGs.5 They are built on the following logic: \u2022 Understanding the landscape of public and private finance is critical for an effective integrated approach to financing the SDGs. The first dimension of the DFA assesses financing trends \u2013 the context, trajectories and availability of all resources in relation to the scale of investments and services required to achieve the SDGs. It looks at available information on the costs or implied financing needs of the SDGs or national plan, though the DFA itself does not undertake a costing exercise. \u2022 It then looks at the foundations of governments\u2019 systems for financing. Integrated planning and financing connects development aspirations with the policies used to realize them. An integrated approach implies complex decision-making processes underpinned by strong leadership and an institutional architecture that breaks down intra-governmental silos and promotes policy alignment and coordination among themselves and with non-state partners. 5 The structure of the analytical framework builds on lessons learnt from past DFAs which were summarized for the Asia-Pacific region in the 2016 UNDP report Achieving the SDGs in the era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and for the ASEAN region in the 2017 ASEAN\u2013 China\u2013UNDP report Financing the SDGs in ASEAN. These reports developed and used an earlier version of the analytical framework and can be accessed at: http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/ rbap/en/home/library/democratic_governance/achieving- the-sustainable-development-goals.html and http://www. asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/library/democratic_ governance/Financing-SDGs-in-ASEAN.html respectively.

Public\u2013private collaboration, including a policy environment that promotes not just growth in investment by private sector and other actors but also sustainable, inclusive growth, is important. \u2022 Strong systems for monitoring and review that track financing and monitor progress towards SDG outcomes are needed to inform ongoing finance policymaking. \u2022 Finally, transparency and accountability between actors, through mechanisms such as parliamentary oversight, participatory policymaking and development effectiveness and coordination mechanisms, are important for the purposes of scrutiny and to help ensure efficiency in resource use. These are all integral components of an integrated financing approach. They are all interconnected. Weaknesses in one dimension can limit the effectiveness of financing overall. If the planning and finance policy functions of government are misaligned, for example, then it will be difficult to know whether current financing trends and planned reforms will be sufficient to realize national objectives. If businesses are not transparent about their impacts, then government\u2019s ability to support growth in positive areas and mitigate risks in harmful ones can be limited. If monitoring systems are weak or monitoring is untimely, it will be challenging to identify the most and least effective areas of policy. If the policy environment is not enabling for civil society then its role in holding others to account is reduced and effectiveness may be diminished. The DFA analyses these dimensions, considering key aspects of each and using them to build a picture about a government\u2019s approach towards integrated financing for sustainable development. It highlights the strengths of current systems and identifies opportunities to further enhance the ability for government and its partners to finance sustainable development. These form the basis of the DFA roadmap. The following sections outline the approach to be followed in the DFA analysis. The assessment draws on information and expert analysis from a range of sources to build a unique holistic analysis of public and private finance for sustainable development. It aggregates information from a range of analytical sources, undertakes a rigorous data analysis, builds on consultations with key stakeholders and identifies relevant case studies of successful reforms other countries. Key terms used in the analytical framework are defined in Annex A. Box 1. The dimensions of the DFA analytical framework The DFA analyses the factors that link planning and finance and brings together actors for a more integrated approach to financing the SDGs. It looks at the strengths of existing systems and identifies opportunities where policy change or reform could further enhance financing for the SDGs. The analysis is underpinned by five dimensions which constitute an integrated approach to financing the SDGs and which can be applied at the macro, sectoral or thematic level: 1. Assessing financing trends. What opportunities and challenges does the financing landscape present for realizing national sustainable development plans? 2. Integrated planning and financing. How are planning and finance policy functions aligned to mobilize the resources needed to realize sustainable development plans? 3. Public\u2013private collaboration. How does government create an environment that promotes inclusive and sustainable contributions to development from private and public actors? 4. Monitoring and review. What systems exist to track finance and monitor SDG outcomes, and how are these used to inform policies that aim to deliver SDG outcomes? 5. Transparency and accountability. How do governments and other actors hold each other accountable and engage in policy dialogue that supports greater effectiveness? 8 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK What is the analytical added value of a DFA? The DFA builds as comprehensive a picture as possible of public and private financing in the country context. It maps trends in public and private finance and assesses opportunities to mobilize financing for the SDGs or to meet specific financing needs. This holistic perspective is the basis for an inclusive dialogue among decision makers from across government, the private sector, NGOs, development partners and other actors. The DFA focuses on strengthening the interconnection between the planning and finance policy functions of the state for a more holistic, integrated approach to financing. It looks at how to strengthen the financing element of planning processes and how to enhance the policies used to mobilize public and private finance in practice, in line with national plans. The DFA identifies opportunities and ways to overcome challenges in mobilizing and enhancing the impact of public and private finance for sustainable development outcomes. It analyses the policies, processes and institutional structures by which the government manages its resources and influences those invested by others.

It supports more inclusive, accessible dialogue with a view to building support for reform, forging partnerships and stimulating innovation. The DFA analytical framework can be applied at the macro, sectoral and/or thematic levels. The intention of the analysis is to support policy change and reform for stronger and more integrated financing of the SDGs. The analytical framework is designed to be tailored to the areas where there is potential to move forward on financing. This could be at the macro, sectoral or thematic level, in relation to SDG prioritization or acceleration, or in support of the development or review of a key national plan or policy. Box 2 summarizes the connection between the DFA and other UNDP services; Annex B provides more detail about the focus and added value of the DFA vis-\u00e0-vis other financing assessments. Box 2. The DFA and other UNDP analysis on financing the SDGs The analytical framework links to other analyses supported by UNDP, given the organization\u2019s role in fostering evidence-based dialogue and supporting governments in policy development, as well as strengthening institutions and systems needed to mobilize resources and use them effectively. It draws on Rapid Integrated Assessments (RIA),6 institutional reviews, governance and capacity assessments and the mainstreaming, acceleration, policy support (MAPS) approach.7 The DFA analytical framework is also a core component of the financing solutions approach introduced in the UNDP Financing Guidebook8 and links to the Financing Solutions for Sustainable Development platform.9 It also draws upon sector-specific financing work such as public expenditure reviews in areas such as climate finance,10 analysis on biodiversity finance (BIOFIN)11 that looks at institutional and expenditure reviews, the costing of biodiversity interventions, and resource mobilization strategies. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 9 Box 3. The DFA in response to UN Development System support to countries in financing the SDGs The analytical framework links to efforts undertaken by the UN Development System to provide quality integrated technical support for the implementation and financing of the SDGs, responding to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s vision on strategic financing in the UN development reform agenda. Its analysis and process can provide useful inputs to the Common Country Assessment (CCA) and UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) processes, while ensuring the main objective of the DFA is to support a country\u2019s efforts for financing the SDGs. The DFA can also be initiated as an entry point to explore opportunities with the two domains of changes for the Joint SDG Fund, in particular supporting unlocking SDG financing. Finance flows and data sources overview The DFA undertakes a uniquely holistic analysis of public and private finance. It collates this picture by bringing together data and analysis from a range of sources that each look at individual financing flows.

What is the current mix of resources being invested and spent? \u2022 What reforms are planned or underway to mobilize new sources of finance, increase efficiency or enhance the impact of particular types of finance on SDG outcomes? Core questions \u2022 What opportunities exist to mobilize new finance? What opportunities exist to realign flows, increase efficiency or reduce costs? \u2022 What are the key characteristics of potential new or expanded sources of finance? What kinds of investments and services could they support? \u2022 Looking ahead, what risks or trends could significantly affect the availability or need for finance? \u2022 Looking ahead at future challenges and the types of finance that will be needed, what new capacity may be needed to access and manage these flows?13 \u2022 How have other countries in similar contexts successfully mobilized new finance flows? What examples are there of policy changes in other countries that have improved the impact of public or private finance on SDG outcomes? Optional questions Scenarios. How may current finance priorities change in the future? How may they change if current finance trends continue, and under various assumptions about the success of ongoing policy reforms or wider economic, social, demographic or environmental trends? See Annex C for methodological notes on forward- looking scenarios within the DFA.14 In answering these questions the DFA aims to identify key trends in the finance landscape, identify opportunities to mobilize new or greater volumes of finance and assess the potential to enhance the impact of finance on SDG outcomes. Mapping and analysing the finance landscape The DFA builds a uniquely holistic picture of public and private finance. One of the first steps in the analysis is to construct a dataset describing the finance landscape as comprehensively as possible before disaggregating and analysing trends within it (see Box 4 for a note on choosing data sources). Finance flows can be captured 13 For example, if private investment in infrastructure is a key future priority then capacity-building in the design and management of instruments such as PPPs and various forms of blended finance may be needed. If there are opportunities to access international climate finance there may be a need to build technical skills for the implementation of mitigation or adaptation projects. It can take a number of years to develop courses and train a body of experts in a new field, so planning ahead can pay off. 14 Note that the aim is to analyse and explore the implications of scenarios about potential future trends in financing, in order to guide dialogue about the kinds of changes that can be made in the short-term to prepare for, exploit or mitigate those future trends. The DFA does not produce forecasts about what it thinks will happen in the future. \u201cThe DFA builds a uniquely holistic picture of public and private finance\u201d 12 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Figure 6.

The flows that can be captured in this aggregate analysis are outlined in Figure 6. Once data have been compiled, it can help to build as comprehensive a picture of the finance landscape as possible.

In the first instance, they must be brought into a common format, expressed in a common currency and price basis or with a common denominator (such as proportion of GDP or per person). In most instances the oversight team is likely to want figures expressed in the local currency, though datasets should be set up in a way that allows easy conversion to US dollars (USD) to aid international comparisons. This should be discussed with the oversight team, particularly if the context is one in which there have been significant exchange rate fluctuations that could affect the analysis of historic trends. Figures should be expressed in a common, constant price basis. In most instances, this should be as recent as the data allow, though there may be instances when an older price basis is used, for example to maintain consistency with the format used in government publications. Data should be compiled covering a number of years in order to assess trends and to avoid misleading conclusions based on analysis of a single year in which there may be anomalies. Steps should be taken to avoid, as far as possible, the risk of double counting overlaps between flows (see Box 4 above). Excel templates can be made available to the technical team compiling the financing trends analysis. An example of financing trends from the Thailand DFA is presented in Figure 7.15 Beyond the aggregate mapping of the finance landscape as a whole, the DFA will analyse trends within this landscape in order to identify key challenges and opportunities. The context and trends in financing can be analysed according to the following dimensions: \u2022 Resources, flows and instruments. Aggregate resources such as international private finance can be broken down into individual flows such as foreign direct investment and remittances. These can in many instances be further broken down into specific instruments. For example, international impact investing is a subset of international private finance and itself comprises a variety of debt, equity and other modalities. Bond issuances and concessional and non-concessional debt are instruments for 15 See https://www.iatiregistry.org/ A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 13 Box 4: A methodological note on choosing data sources A range of quantitative data sources will be used in the DFA, though the exact choice of sources will depend on what data are available in the country in question. In all cases, a mixture of national and international sources will be used. The primary audience for the DFA \u2013 government officials \u2013 are more likely in many circumstances to recognize and feel ownership over national data than those from international sources. National sources of data often offer a greater degree of detail and granularity, and are usually more up to date. However international sources can often fill in gaps in national data that allow the development of a more comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the financing landscape. International data are also important for facilitating comparisons between countries. When undertaking the data analysis, it is important for the technical team to pay particular attention to data quality. Potential data challenges fall into two broad categories. Firstly, information on specific flows may be partial, based on incomplete information (such as surveys with limited coverage), or unavailable. Where comprehensive data are unavailable, the technical team should look for alternatives that can help to gauge the scale and nature of these flows. For example, activities by domestic philanthropists or NGOs are rarely captured systematically, though in many instances there will be academic studies, surveys or reporting by some NGOs to initiatives such as IATI.15 Secondly, the data used to map the financing landscape will be compiled from different sources, each with their own distinct methodologies, calculations and definitions. This creates challenges for aggregating data, as there may be overlaps between data from different sources. Loans from development partners to the government, for example, may be reported as a financing stream in the budget, as ODA in OECD data and as borrowing in the World Bank\u2019s international debt statistics. Foreign direct investment (FDI) can be funded by equity, reinvested earnings or debt. Where it is funded by debt, it may be captured in both FDI and international debt statistics. The technical team should take every step to account for such overlaps; depending on the level of detailed included in the data sources available, it may be possible to disaggregate the data and wholly or partially account for the duplication. The technical team should be aware of and clear about these potential challenges.

The technical team must therefore weigh up the trade-offs between excluding data that describes an important part of the financing landscape because of imperfect data, and including data when there is a known risk of double counting. The strength of conclusions drawn based on uncertain data should be weighted accordingly and the DFA report should discuss the coverage, quality and reliability of the data that were available for the analysis as well as further steps that could be taken to mitigate the risks of drawing conclusions based on poor data. public sector borrowing and can be disaggregated and analysed according to other key characteristics such as the degree of concessionality and term length. The varying characteristics of individual flows and instruments mean that they can contribute in different ways to sustainable development outcomes. Disaggregating by flow and instrument therefore allows the DFA to identify opportunities to scale up specific instruments or increase the efficiency of financing for SDG outcomes. \u2022 Source and point of use. As noted above, finance can be mapped from its source (where it is raised or mobilized) to the point of use (the expenditure or investment it finances). The most comprehensive data tend to be available at the source, which is why this information is used to construct the picture of the financing landscape as a whole. However, the analysis within the DFA should disaggregate the data and look at financing mechanisms at both the source and point of use. This is because the mechanisms through which financing are mobilized and invested can both have important impacts on SDG outcomes: for example, the progressiveness of the budget as well as the tax system have important effects on income distribution. \u2022 Disaggregation by sector and economic classification. The DFA should analyse financing by sector as well as capital/recurrent breakdowns where possible. Analysing the type and mix of finance at the sector or capital/recurrent level helps to connect particular types of finance with particular SDG outcomes. It can give insight into the use of operational resources as well as the investments that are being made for the future. It can help to identify priority areas for investment, for example related to capital investment in a specific sector, and prompt a search for instruments that can meet specific financing needs. This analysis is relevant both for spending and investment as well as the 14 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Figure 7.

Where possible the DFA can analyse the distribution and trends in financing within the country; this is particularly relevant in large countries or contexts in which authority over public finance or public\u2013 private engagement has been largely decentralized. There may, however, be challenges accessing the necessary data for such analysis and in many contexts it may be limited to analysis of a subset of flows. Figure 8 highlights some of the key breakdowns within these dimensions by which financing can be analysed within the DFA. It identifies common sources of data that will be available for most countries. This list is not exhaustive; for example data are often published at the regional or subregional level or by additional country- specific initiatives. It is also important to note that in many contexts the data available and the degree of disaggregation possible will vary between different types of financing. In many instances, information on domestic and international public finance will allow deeper analysis at both the source and point of use than is possible for private finance, for example. Alongside the analysis of the financing landscape itself, the DFA can also highlight what is known and unknown based on the available data.

In mapping the flows which are or which could be available, this analysis should be used to support discussion about potential financing solutions throughout the DFA process, considering the characteristics of different flows and their potential to meet identified financing needs. It will be important for the DFA to consider the opportunities that exist for new flows and financing instruments to be accessed or scaled up and the potential this could offer in terms of meeting financing needs or supporting investment in key priorities. This should connect with the analysis described in the following dimensions, considering the changes that would be needed, including any necessary regulatory changes, capacity- building or partnership development, as well as the risks associated with particular financing flows. This can build from the analysis of the current financing landscape and link into the questions examined on public finance in the integrated planning and financing dimension and on private finance in the public\u2013private collaboration dimension. 16 Note that the term \u2018social impact investment\u2019 is used here to capture a range of investment types that place varying weights on the balance between financial and social or environmental returns on investment.

This is key to setting out development aspirations that are in step with the policies designed to realize them, and to effectively addressing the challenges and opportunities that finance trends present. In recent years, many countries have increased the capabilities of the systems they use for national planning while also expanding and enhancing their financing policies. Yet in some contexts, the instruments utilized within each system have been developed independently from one another and without an overarching strategic orientation (see Figure 9). Even where progress has been made in strengthening the alignment between planning and financing, the strongest connections are often centred around public finance, development cooperation and PPPs. There may be opportunities in many contexts to deepen these connections and to broaden them to align policy towards a wider range of public and private finance to national planning objectives. This dimension of the analytical framework looks at how governments can take a more holistic approach to integrated planning and financing. It analyses the challenges and opportunities for alignment between national plans and policies related to the budget, private sector development, development cooperation and other types of finance. A key aspect of this is assessing the types of investments that would be needed to realize a national plan and understanding the costs and types of finance needed to pay for them. With a particular focus on public finance, this dimension of the DFA also looks at opportunities for strengthening the connection between the annual and/or medium-term budget process with long-term plans. This analysis links closely to the other dimensions of the framework. It builds on the analysis of financing trends, which are compared against the potential costs of national development plans articulated in this dimension. Integrated planning and financing functions within government are further seen as a foundation on which operational policies and structures regarding public\u2013private collaboration, monitoring and review, and transparency and accountability are based. Guiding questions Contextual questions \u2022 What are the government\u2019s key policies and strategies towards public and private finance? \u2022 What mechanisms are used to align the budget to national plans? How does senior leadership ensure the coherency of the planning and budgeting functions?17 \u2022 What mechanisms exist to align policies regarding finance controlled by other actors with national development objectives? \u2022 What mechanisms are in place to build coherency and avoid contradictions between policies that focus on different types of finance? \u2022 To what extent is there an understanding of the scale and types of financing that will be needed to deliver the investments and services required by the national development plan?18 Have the national development plan, or sector or thematic plans, been costed? 17 For example, the Government of the Philippines has introduced a series of reforms designed to enhance the results focus of the budget and strengthen the links between the outcomes targeted in budgetary programmes with the targets of the development plan. For more see UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 18 For example, Bangladesh has estimated the cost of achieving its national plans and in 2017 undertook an exercise to estimate the additional cost of financing the SDGs. \u201cAt the foundation of an integrated approach to financing sustainable development is the need for the planning and finance policy functions of government to be closely aligned\u201d 18 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK \u2022 Is there evidence of capacity constraints limiting efficiency in public financial management or access to particular types of finance?

Sources National plans and finance policies will be key sources of information for this foundational element of the DFA 20 For example, between objectives to develop new industries (often articulated in an industrial development plan) and sustainably manage the environment (often articulated in a climate or environmental plan). Where these types of policies are developed in isolation from one another, there may be contradictions in their targets and strategic approaches. However, if they are developed and implemented in a more integrated way, design features such as the creation of specific incentives for environmentally friendly business models can be built in to ensure compatibility.

The DFA should review long-term and medium- term national plans and any corresponding financing strategies. To assess the linkages between policy towards different types of finance and which types of finance are targeted to finance specific policy priorities, the DFA can review the overarching financing strategy, if one exists, as well as sector and thematic plans, and policies related to specific types of finance. This includes annual and medium-term budgets, budget strategy documents and revenue mobilization strategies, as well as policies related to private sector development or industrialization, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), access to finance, development cooperation and others. Costings exercises associated with these policies can also be reviewed, alongside any that have been undertaken by specialist international agencies such as UNESCO, UNICEF and others. Strategic plans for relevant specialist agencies such as the revenue authority or trade and investment promotion agency may also provide valuable information. Consultations with relevant officials will be an important source of information. The core ministries responsible for overseeing planning and finance policy functions are Ministries of Planning and Ministries of Finance, though in a number of countries the planning function has been subsumed as a division within the Ministry of Finance. It will also be important to meet with the Office of the Prime Minister or President as well as line ministries and specialist agencies that hold responsibility for key sector plans or for mobilizing particular types of finance. Many countries have established mechanisms for reviewing the budget or other key policies to ensure their alignment with longer-term plans. Representatives of such committees or mechanisms will be able to provide valuable insight into the alignment between planning and finance policies. A number of countries have also established cross-ministerial committees and/or parliamentary committees to focus on SDG implementation, as well as committees or platforms to focus on specific finance issues (such as domestic revenue mobilization or development effectiveness) or sectoral issues (such as sector-specific technical working groups) and these committees may be relevant sources of information about finance strategies. Beyond official policies and consultations with government ministries, development partners and literature from a wide range of sources can be useful for analysing this dimension of the DFA. In many contexts, IFIs and development partners work closely with the central ministries responsible for the planning and finance policy functions and can offer insights into the challenges, opportunities and ongoing reforms related to planning and financing policy. National publications such as voluntary national reviews or progress reports on the national development plan, as well as SDG progress reports, will be key sources to draw from, and national think tanks and civil society organizations that are active on financing will in many cases have published relevant analysis on planning and financing as well as long-term financing trends. A number of international financing initiatives may have analysis that can inform this component of the analytical framework. These include: IMF Article IV reports, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA), Public Expenditure Review (PER), Systematic Country Diagnostics, Fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (IMF), Budget briefs and Fiscal space studies (UNICEF), the Commonwealth PFM Self-Assessment Tool (CPFM- SAT), the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3452c69e-3684-492a-ab65-d583832f54b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3452c69e-3684-492a-ab65-d583832f54b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0eab97581118b020264756614524a34802b37ae3bec1813dc338118c239ec0c"}}, "hash": "f0eab97581118b020264756614524a34802b37ae3bec1813dc338118c239ec0c", "text": "Open Budget Index (OBI) (International Budget Partnership) \u2013 Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIFPA) and the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), and Rapid Integrated Assessments (RIA) as well as sector-specific initiatives including the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) and Climate Public Expenditure Institutional Review (CPEIR). Ideas about flows or instruments that could be mobilized to provide additional sources of finance can be collated through the consultations and literature review, as well as in discussion with the focal point from UNDP/UNCT, and the UNDP regional hub who may be able to provide relevant examples from other countries. 20 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK 3. Public\u2013private collaboration Achieving the SDGs will require investments and actions from a range of public and private actors. Mobilizing finance from actors beyond government will require a policy and enabling environment that is conducive to sustainable, inclusive development of the private sector and promotes the strategic investment of private finance. Non-governmental organizations and actors from across civil society can make valuable contributions to government-led development processes and play an important role in many contexts in service delivery and other aspects of sustainable development. It will require effective collaboration between government and private stakeholders including dialogue on policy issues and active partnerships on specific projects. It entails going beyond just stimulating growth in private investment, for example, to creating incentives that promote positive contributions to environmental sustainability and social progress. This dimension of the DFA looks at how public and private actors collaborate around the 2030 Agenda and how they act to promote not just economic gains, but also sustainable, inclusive private finance. It identifies opportunities to enhance the policy environment, strengthen incentives and deepen public\u2013private collaboration in pursuit of this objective. This dimension links closely to the others. It asks how public\u2013private collaboration draws from the strategies developed through integrated planning and financing functions and considers how monitoring frameworks, as well as transparency and collective accountability, can strengthen the role of private finance in realizing sustainable development objectives. The following section outlines guiding questions applicable to public\u2013private collaboration overall as well as questions specific to individual types of private finance. These questions focus on private finance at different levels, in some instances focusing on resource flows at a more aggregate level (e.g. private sector investment) and focusing on particular instruments (e.g. social impact investment) in others (see also Figure 8 above). This reflects the potential for changes at any of these different levels to have a positive impact on finance for the SDGs in different contexts. Depending on the country context, DFAs will not necessarily cover every type of private finance. Guiding questions General Contextual questions \u2022 What institutional mechanisms exist for dialogue between public and private actors21 and for the participation of private actors22 in the design, implementation and review of policies that aim to influence private finance? \u2022 What institutional mechanisms does government use to coordinate its policies towards different types of private finance? What role do agencies responsible for environmental protection and social development issues play within these mechanisms? \u2022 Is there evidence of capacity constraints in government agencies or among private actors that are limiting sustainable, inclusive growth in private finance? 21 For example, public\u2013private dialogue platforms or multi- stakeholder private sector advisory committees. 22 From both the private sector and civil society. In some circumstances, the undue influence of certain actors over policy design may be a consideration. \u201cEffective public-private collaboration entails going beyond stimulating growth in private investment, to creating incentives that promote positive contributions to environmental sustainability and social progress\u201d A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 21 Core questions \u2022 What do private finance actors identify as the most significant opportunities and challenges for enhanced collaboration? \u2022 What sources of finance or financing instruments have the potential to meet key financing needs for the country? \u2022 What degree of influence does government policy have over the scale and nature of investment in relation to each type of financing? \u2022 What relevant examples of promoting sustainable, inclusive growth in private finance can be identified from other countries? Private sector investment (domestic and foreign direct investment) Contextual questions \u2022 How conducive is the business climate and policy environment to private sector investment? How do key business policies and regulations promote sustainable, inclusive private sector investment? Are there barriers which are preventing private sector investment? Is government undertaking reforms to alter the business environment? \u2022 Does government actively encourage certain kinds of investment?23 How are these linked to national plans? \u2022 To what extent does private sector investment represent a mix of investment that is purely", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "733a5e16-c690-41c6-b90b-da1bab0c6e5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "733a5e16-c690-41c6-b90b-da1bab0c6e5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92b1c0aba797d5b9d995cf4ecdf168e8035c4d74bc69b0a56e532a60500c798a"}}, "hash": "92b1c0aba797d5b9d995cf4ecdf168e8035c4d74bc69b0a56e532a60500c798a", "text": "commercial and which takes social and environmental considerations into account?24 What is known about the scale and focus of these different types of investment? \u2022 To what extent do private sector representatives and government collaborate in identifying and establishing investment opportunities, including developing project pipelines? \u2022 What mechanisms \u2013 such as investment forums or participation in international trade forums \u2013 are used to promote investment opportunities? 23 For example, in priority industries, by certain types of business (e.g. foreign investors, SMEs or businesses owned by women) or in particular geographic locations. 24 For example, differentiating between finance-only, responsible, sustainable and impact investment. See UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing, for more. See also the questions on social impact investing below. Core questions \u2022 How does government aim to promote investment from private sector actors25 that contributes, directly or indirectly, to the desired outcomes of the national development plan? To what extent are government\u2019s policy objectives centred on economic gains or results related to the wider dimensions of sustainable development? Are incentives structured around inputs, outputs or outcomes (\u2018sustainability-based incentives\u201926)? \u2022 How are trade-offs between key policy priorities, e.g. to encourage investment and protect environmental or social progress, addressed by government and its partners? \u2022 Is there a history of collaboration between government and private sector actors on specific projects? If so, which private sector companies/sectors have been good examples in the country? Are PPPs or similar instruments used and how cost-effective have they proven to be in advancing SDG outcomes? Portfolio investment27 Contextual questions \u2022 What role does portfolio investment play as a source of finance in financial markets? \u2022 To what extent are ESG or sustainability principles factored into portfolio investment practices?28 Core questions \u2022 What potential is there to deepen and broaden practices that promote socially and environmentally sustainable portfolio investment? 25 Considering important distinctions between different types of actors such as SMEs and multinational enterprises (MNEs). 26 Incentives that reward contributions to sustainable development outcomes, as opposed to output or location-based incentives that reward investment in particular priority sectors or geographic locations. For more see UNCTAD (2015). Investment policy framework for sustainable development. 27 Portfolio investments are cross-border transfers involving debt or equity that are not counted as FDI (or reserve assets), i.e. they fall below the threshold of owning the right to 10 percent or more of the voting rights of the entity in which an investment is made. Portfolio investments are more liquid and often pass through financial markets or specialized service providers. Source: IMF Balance of Payments Manual, 6th edition. 28 For example, does the stock exchange promote sustainability reporting as a means for attracting ESG-conscious investment? 22 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Social impact investment (domestic and international)29 Contextual questions \u2022 Is there an active social impact investment30 sector in the country? What is known about the scale and focus of private sector investments that are not purely commercial in nature? \u2022 To what extent is the regulatory and policy context conducive to, or actively promoting, social impact investment?31 Core questions \u2022 What potential is there to encourage the development of social impact investing practices and to facilitate the transfer of principles, practices and techniques to the wider private sector? Credit (domestic and international borrowing, including access to finance issues) Contextual questions \u2022 How developed are domestic credit and bond markets? To what extent does access to credit vary between small and large firms? To what extent do domestic firms have access to international credit and bond markets? \u2022 To what extent are supply factors such as limited access to credit, or demand factors such as the lack of capacity to develop bankable proposals, a constraint to growth for private sector firms, particularly those in the sectors or areas most relevant to national objectives? Core questions \u2022 How does government promote increased access to credit, particularly for segments of the private sector that are key to SDG progress? 29 Note that social impact investment is a subset of the private commercial investment for which guiding questions are listed above.

The information for assessing this aspect of the DFA can come from a review of policies on topics such as industrial development, investment incentives, access to finance, and sector policies that include a significant role for private sector development, and importantly through consultations with relevant ministries and private sector representatives. It can also be informed by evidence from and dialogue with civil society actors who are active in monitoring private sector development and public\u2013private collaboration.

Financial System Stability Assessments from the IMF offer insight into the financial sector and the role it plays within a country. The standardized nature of these assessments as well as the narrow, specific focus of some37 means that they should be supplemented with context-specific information that can be sourced from country-specific private sector assessments38 or similar literature as well as through consultations with relevant ministries and private sector representatives such as chambers of commerce. Information on the environment for and collaboration with development partners and civil society can be gathered through international sources such as the GPEDC monitoring survey country profiles39 and the CIVICUS enabling environment index, as well as discussions with representatives of these actors. Consultations with development cooperation units within ministries of finance or planning can build on this information, along with discussions with key actors within any coordination forums or mechanisms. Information on dialogue and participatory policymaking can be sourced via consultations with relevant officials and stakeholders and literature.

Over 80 countries were covered in the 2016 survey. Some countries may 37 For example, some of these assessments may be centred around the promotion of economic growth as opposed to sustainable development progress. 38 Such as the Asian Development Bank\u2019s periodic country-level private sector assessments. 39 Available at: http://effectivecooperation.org/monitoring- country-progress/country-and-territory-monitoring-profiles/ 24 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK also have featured in case studies or synthesis reports prepared by specialist international organizations such as PublicPrivateDialogue.org.40 Information on project-level collaboration can be sought from relevant divisions within key ministries, such as a PPP unit, infrastructure division, or division responsible for other sectors in which public\u2013private collaboration is prominent.

These are articulated in the analysis where they have potential for scaling up or replication; other country examples are also brought to bear with this purpose. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 25 4. Monitoring and review Effective monitoring and review frameworks are a critical component of an integrated approach to financing. There are a number of components to effective monitoring and review systems. Finance tracking systems capture information on financing, on the resources that are being invested, by whom and how. Monitoring systems capture information on development results and the progress that is made towards the SDGs. In many contexts, these will be distinct from one another and there may be multiple systems of each kind. The quality of these public and private systems and the ability to connect information between them will determine the extent to which a clear picture can be developed of the impacts that different types of investment are having on SDG outcomes, and crucially whether those investments are also cost-effective. This dimension of the DFA looks at the quality of these systems and the ability to connect them and use this information to inform policymaking. Overall, it aims to identify steps that can be taken to strengthen finance tracking systems and monitoring systems, enhance the potential to connect the two and support more informed finance policymaking. The ability to monitor the impacts of different types of finance is key for understanding their potential contribution to the SDGs. Monitoring systems provide valuable information for decisions about how to design and adapt policy to enhance the positive contributions and mitigate the risks associated with particular forms of finance. Such monitoring can extend to all public and private finance. Most governments have monitoring frameworks associated with their national plans or medium-term budgetary frameworks and in an increasing number of contexts private sector bodies are developing their own monitoring systems. Many public aid flows are also monitored closely. There is potential to expand such initiatives and to strengthen the links between them to enable a more holistic understanding of all types of finance. At their foundation, such monitoring frameworks rely on strong systems for collecting, harmonizing and analysing public and private sector data. This dimension of the analytical framework is closely related to elements of the other dimensions. The structure and coverage of finance tracking and monitoring systems play a large role in determining the depth of understanding of financing trends and inform the strategies developed within integrated planning and financing functions in response. The information collected can inform dialogue between public and private actors and is key to accountability and scrutiny. Guiding questions Contextual questions \u2022 What is the coverage of finance tracking systems? What systems do public actors use to track their investments?

Do differences in concepts or definitions constrain the ability to connect information captured by different finance tracking systems or to connect them with monitoring systems? Core questions \u2022 Does government maintain a results framework that brings together information from finance tracking and monitoring systems? Does it cover public and private finance?41 \u2022 How is information gathered by finance tracking and monitoring systems used to inform the design and implementation of finance policies?42 Does government use results-based planning principles in policy design? Are there variations between policies focused on different aspects of public and private finance? \u2022 Do weaknesses in collection and monitoring frameworks affect the design, management or review of finance policies? \u2022 Are there particular areas of financing43 where improvements in monitoring could support increased efficiency? \u2022 What opportunities exist to strengthen tracking systems with data that are currently underutilized by policymakers? What new data could be collected? What steps could be taken to better harmonize the information produced by finance tracking and monitoring systems? \u2022 How have other countries strengthened finance tracking and monitoring systems to support more effective financing for sustainable development? In answering these questions, the DFA aims to identify ways to (i) strengthen finance tracking systems and monitoring systems, (ii) enhance the ability to connect the two and (iii) inform finance policymaking. 41 This is likely to be the case in only a minority of countries. 42 For example, what targets or objectives are set for policies related to different types of finance? Do these relate to finance inputs, outputs or outcomes? How are they monitored? How are policies adjusted over time in response to monitoring? 43 Such as particular government funds, incentive schemes or procurement processes. Sources Information on finance tracking and monitoring systems and their use can be gathered by reviewing the outputs of these systems and by speaking with the actors that manage and use them. There may be a number of tracking systems focused on financing maintained by a range of public and private actors. Ministries of finance will track public spending,44 central banks track a range of public and private flows45 and national statistics offices may also maintain systems, or undertake surveys, that track financing. Consultations with private sector representatives such as a Chamber of Commerce, private bodies such as a stock exchange, civil society organizations and development partners can give insight into monitoring systems outside government. Many stock exchanges are hubs for sustainability reporting and information on ESG frameworks among listed companies. Chambers of commerce, business associations and national chapters of the UN Global Compact may also be able to highlight any additional voluntary private-sector-led reporting initiatives. The DFA can also review the sustainability reporting practices of a selection of the largest companies in the country, or the largest companies within a particular sector of focus. Development partners often operate their own monitoring frameworks which are used to report on effectiveness within their organizations. In many countries, monitoring systems associated with a national plan, and medium-term or annual monitoring/ progress reports are maintained by a ministry of planning or finance. Line ministries commonly maintain more detailed monitoring systems focused on specific sectors or thematic areas. These can be reviewed to understand the timeliness of data and the extent to which government understands the disaggregated picture of progress beyond the national level alone. Across these consultations and reviews, it is important to build an understanding of the degree to which actors are and could potentially share and harmonize information to inform a more comprehensive understanding of financing for the SDGs. Assessing the extent to which there is a common structure to data and understanding 44 In some contexts, this will include state-owned enterprises and quasi-public institutions, in other contexts the investments made by these actors are only tracked by the institutions themselves. 45 Often using standardized international statistics standards, for example related to the balance of payments.

In addition to policy documents and consultations, a number of international assessments that touch on different aspects of monitoring can be used. The World Bank publishes country profiles of statistical capacity which may offer insights into capacity constraints in statistical authorities that could hold back effective monitoring and review of finance strategies.47 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments include a number of criteria relevant to the monitoring and review dimension of the DFA. These include assessments of how the government monitors and publishes information on funding for and performance of service delivery; monitoring of public corporations, subnational government and fiscal risks such as contingent liabilities; monitoring of public investments and alignment of strategic plans and budgets. The PEFA assessments give a score on each of these dimensions. Where available, PEFA reports provide an overview of why a country has received its score against each indicator. Where PEFA reports are not published, the score data will at least provide an indication of how systems compare internationally. IMF Article IV reports may include an assessment and recommendations about ways to improve the monitoring of particular types of finance such as public and private borrowing, bond issuances and debt stocks. GPEDC monitoring profiles provide information on monitoring with a particular focus on development cooperation, covering results frameworks, harmonization of government and development partner systems and joint evaluations of results. It includes questions about how resources for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are tracked. Over 80 countries were covered in the 2016 survey. Some countries may have featured as case studies 46 For more on this, see UNDP (2018). Making Development Finance Management Information Systems Work for the Evolving Development Cooperation Landscape.

Building on the analysis of existing frameworks and the information that is captured in them, the DFA can identify additional existing information which could further strengthen monitoring frameworks. In some contexts, sources such as the surveys that national statistics offices and central banks carry out in their statistical functions, and the administrative data that line ministries collect, could be mined for additional information or adapted to ask additional questions that feed into monitoring frameworks. For example, labour force surveys can provide insights into the scale and quality of jobs created by private investment in specific sectors or regions. Central bank surveys may capture information on access to finance relevant for objectives related to SME development and poverty reduction. Data in line ministries such as health and education may capture information on outcomes related to specific development cooperation projects or on outcomes associated with services delivered by non-state actors such as NGOs or faith-based organizations. 48 For more information see: http://www.pfde.net/ 28 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK 5. Transparency and accountability Transparency and mutual accountability between public and private actors is important for building trust that promotes collaboration and as a mechanism for boosting effectiveness. Transparency and accountability are two- way responsibilities. For government, it encompasses making information accessible on the way that finance is raised, spent and the outcomes that are generated as well as the degree of openness to scrutiny from actors including parliament, civil society, the media and others. Private actors and development partners also have a responsibility to publish information on their activities. This is a key enabler for these actors to be held to account and for the creation of an environment that enables enhanced public and private contributions to sustainable development. Mutual accountability and transparency support effective partnerships, strong monitoring and enable greater effectiveness in the impact of financing. This dimension of the DFA looks at opportunities to enhance information sharing by government and other finance actors and to strengthen mechanisms for scrutiny and accountability. In this way, this dimension is closely related to the others. The information shared and scrutinized through accountability mechanisms informs the understanding of finance trends and the design of plans and financing policies. It can be conducive to closer public\u2013private collaboration. Accountability mechanisms can be informed by the information generated through monitoring frameworks within the public and private spheres.

In answering these questions, the DFA aims to identify ways to (i) improve the way information is shared and (ii) strengthen mechanisms for scrutiny and accountability about how different types of finance are invested to advance the 2030 Agenda. Sources Information on the mechanisms for transparency and accountability that exist can often be sourced through national platforms and international assessments. Information and opinion about the functioning and effectiveness of these platforms will largely be gathered through consultations with officials and wider stakeholders. Related to government finance, open budget or open data portals have been established in a growing number of countries. The Open Budget Survey assesses the public availability of budget information, participation in the budget process and oversight over the budget by parliament and audit institutions. PEFA assessments provide information on relevant components of public finance transparency including a number of aspects of government budgeting and expenditure, procurement and auditing. The EITI Resource Governance Index covers a number of aspects of the governance of extractive industries, including transparency around finance and contracting. In countries where the stock exchange is prominent, they may be a source of information regarding private sector transparency and sustainability reporting, particularly for members of the Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative. Further information can be accessed through consultations with private sector representatives such as chambers of commerce, and their counterparts in related ministries such as commerce, trade and industry or economic development. Regarding development cooperation, the GPEDC survey and monitoring profiles56 cover aspects of transparency and accountability related to development cooperation such as on-budget reporting and whether development cooperation is subject to parliamentary scrutiny as well as inclusive mutual accountability between governments and development partners. These sources can provide contextual information about the transparency and accountability mechanisms that exist. Information, examples and opinions about their effectiveness will primarily be sourced through consultations and dialogue with a range of stakeholders. Consultations on transparency and accountability regarding different aspects of public and private financing can potentially be held with a range of actors. This can include key official mechanisms for scrutiny, such as relevant parliamentary committees and supreme audit institutions, as well as non-state actors such as civil society, the media and think tanks. Government officials, for example from ministries of finance or commerce, as well as chambers of commerce and other private sector representatives may be able to provide information on private sector transparency and its usage and impact. Officials from ministries of finance and planning, civil society and development partners can be consulted about the effectiveness of information sharing on development cooperation. Depending on the precise focus of the DFA and context, analysis of transparency and accountability mechanisms may be narrowed to focus only on transparency and accountability around particular aspects of financing. 56", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "886bd949-281a-4c03-b899-83f4127839ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "886bd949-281a-4c03-b899-83f4127839ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "275a52111e4cf4a9dd4896e4b60baf2d5b9a092ecac907be3d237783f9181a21"}}, "hash": "275a52111e4cf4a9dd4896e4b60baf2d5b9a092ecac907be3d237783f9181a21", "text": "See http://effectivecooperation.org/monitoring-country -progress/country-and-territory-monitoring-profiles/ 30 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Module: the DFA Process One of the defining characteristics of the DFA is that it is a process, led by the government, that aims to convene and engender the participation and buy-in of key decision makers and wider constituencies in a discussion on reforms that can strengthen financing for sustainable development. The analysis and report produced by the DFA informs a dialogue, but the primary outcome of the DFA overall is an agreed roadmap of actions that can be taken forward. It is critical therefore that the process is driven by government ownership and carefully designed to ensure that the necessary consultation, dialogue and discussions about next steps are completed. There are a number of unique features of the DFA process which are designed to result in tangible reforms being taken forward on conclusion of the DFA. The process is led by a government-led oversight team which determines how to adapt the core analytical framework of the DFA and prioritize the issues most relevant to the country context. In many instances, it will be incorporated into the workplan of an existing governance structure or platform. With the support of UNDP/UNCT, the process brings together key decision makers from across government, the private sector and other actors who will play a key role in implementing the SDGs. This includes, but goes well beyond, the ministries that ordinarily lead policymaking on finance and planning. The DFA analysis is designed to demystify financing and engage this wide group of stakeholders in building a set of actions that can be taken forward to strengthen holistic financing of the SDGs. Finally, the DFA is designed to produce a set of tangible recommendations about how to strengthen financing for the SDGs from all sources of finance, and the process is designed in a way to maximize the participation and buy-in of key decision makers to this roadmap. This module presents an overview of the DFA process, highlighting the core principles of the process and the steps it will entail. It is meant as a general guide as the process may differ from country to country depending on the focus of the DFA and how it supports ongoing national processes. Principles of the DFA process The key principles that characterize the DFA process are as follows: \u2022 The exercise is led by an oversight team which includes key decision makers from relevant government ministries, private sector representatives and other stakeholders. \u2022 The DFA is anchored in existing national processes or platforms \u2022 The exercise convenes and facilitates dialogue among a wide group of stakeholders. It demystifies financing and guides discussions about holistic public and private financing for the SDGs. \u2022 The process is designed to maximize the participation and buy-in of relevant decision makers and their constituencies to the roadmap, and establishes clear follow-up mechanisms to implement the recommendations made. \u201cThere are a number of unique features of the DFA process which are designed to result in tangible reforms being taken forward on conclusion of the DFA\u201d A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 31 Figure 10. Phases of the DFA process The DFA process A typical DFA process will include five distinct phases, as outlined in Figure 10 and explained in detail below. The process presented here outlines a set of generic steps for a typical DFA process. Every DFA will adapt these steps depending on the context, specific objectives and resources for the particular exercise. DFAs also vary in length depending on these factors as well as the schedule of national policy processes that it will feed into. Past DFAs have ranged from being as short as 3 months, for a light exercise with the purpose of identifying key specific areas for more in-depth follow-up, to 9 to 12 months for a more substantial exercise with DFA technical assistance embedded in the host ministry. Inception phase At the outset, a DFA will be requested by government. There are a range of reasons why governments may wish to undertake a DFA; some of the most common entry points are summarized in Box 5. The request will typically come from a Ministry of Planning or Finance, often following dialogue with a UNDP or other UN country office. The ministry which requests the DFA will often go on to chair the oversight team to provide overall guidance to the process (see Box 7 below). Following the request, an inception phase facilitated by UNDP/UNCT, under the guidance of the requesting ministry, will be undertaken. The aim of this phase is to undertake initial scoping analysis work,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b24963b7-fcef-426f-91f4-3de556edd1c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b24963b7-fcef-426f-91f4-3de556edd1c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f078f089c63c3779494e085416884d4f461776e42742d92e7d7e51d48a76155"}}, "hash": "3f078f089c63c3779494e085416884d4f461776e42742d92e7d7e51d48a76155", "text": "including the completion of a stakeholder, institutional and political economy mapping exercise, establish the necessary structures for overseeing and undertaking the DFA, make stakeholders aware of the forthcoming process and, critically, to agree the specific focus of the DFA.

It will draw together initial analysis using key available data and a selection of key literature. It will also analyse the availability of data.57 The aim of this scoping analysis is to facilitate dialogue with the oversight team about the 57 Based on the 2018 DFA lessons learned survey of UNDP country offices in 14 countries that have undertaken or are in the process of undertaking a DFA exercise.

Common entry points for a DFA \u2022 DFAs are initiated for a variety of reasons, often in relation to policy cycles within the national planning process or priorities related to specific types of financing. Common rationales include:57 \u2022 The drafting of a new long-term or medium-term national development plan \u2022 The incorporation of the SDGs and AAAA into national planning processes \u2022 A change in the development finance landscape, such as a decline or anticipated decline in the availability of a key resource \u2022 The need to address resource mobilization and identify new sources of financing \u2022 The desire to increase private sector involvement in development finance dialogue and policymaking \u2022 The desire for reform in spending or budget effectiveness in relation to national planning \u2022 A change in status in income group or from being a Least Developed Country \u2022 A desire to better understand the development finance landscape and the opportunities for financing sustainable development 32 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK specific areas and priorities that the DFA will focus on. In some cases, it may be compiled in an inception report. A stakeholder, institutional and political economy mapping exercise will also be undertaken (see Box 6). The establishment of the oversight team is a critical step and it is important to agree an appropriate structure and membership. The oversight team will not only oversee the process itself but will be key to championing the roadmap and ensuring that the recommendations are taken forward at the end of the process. Where possible, the oversight team function should be incorporated within or taken on by an existing governance structure or platform, such as an oversight committee for the national development plan, or an SDG implementation committee. Where no appropriate structures exist, a new structure may be created, bringing together appropriate representatives to oversee the DFA (see Box 7). A key aim of the inception phase is to narrow down the focus of the DFA and agree the priority issues that it will focus on. The nature of the DFA is that it can be tailored to focus on any of a wide range of issues related to different aspects of financing. It is important that decisions on how to focus are taken during the inception phase so that there are shared expectations about the types of outcomes that the process will lead to by all involved parties. Close dialogue between the oversight team and UNCT/UNDP will be vital in agreeing the scope of the DFA in this way. Another key priority of the inception phase is to initiate engagement with stakeholders beyond the oversight team who will play an important part in the DFA process. Actors identified through the stakeholder and institutional mapping should be made aware of the forthcoming process and asked for their participation and support as appropriate (e.g. for consultation or participation in key inception or validation workshops). Box 6. Stakeholder, political and institutional mapping The aim of the stakeholder mapping exercise is to identify at the outset of the process the key stakeholders that should be engaged during the DFA, in order to inform an engagement plan for the DFA process as a whole. The initial mapping exercise entails identifying all relevant stakeholders within the country context. This includes identifying relevant actors from across government, including ministries, agencies, state- owned enterprises and subnational entities, as well as representatives of the private sector (such as a chamber of commerce or industry federations), civil society and NGOs, development partners, think tanks and other relevant actors. It should also cover relevant institutional structures and platforms. This will include all relevant institutional mechanisms within government (e.g. national sustainable development committees), between government and other stakeholders (e.g. forums for public\u2013private dialogue),", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "268d1436-2c0b-48b8-916b-adfbee3d8d16": {"__data__": {"id_": "268d1436-2c0b-48b8-916b-adfbee3d8d16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abdbdb55e6efc9ef7154026fb57810730a56b862b8353f1f1b069b29160a3c45"}}, "hash": "abdbdb55e6efc9ef7154026fb57810730a56b862b8353f1f1b069b29160a3c45", "text": "or among other actors (e.g. a development partners working group). It should be grounded in an understanding of the political context and cognisant of sensitive issues as well as areas where there may be opportunity for reform. This will include identifying existing or planned policy processes that the DFA may be able to feed into. Some of these may be cyclical and structured (such as the annual budget process or renewal of a national development plan) while others may be linked to ongoing policy debates within government. The mapping exercise should also identify processes among international actors. Some DFAs may be combined in parallel with other support services such as Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS), for example.59 They may also be able to feed into UNCT processes such as the United Nations Development Assistance Framework or Common Country Analyses. Following an initial mapping of the relevant stakeholders, an engagement plan can be developed. Stakeholders can be grouped into those that should be actively involved in the DFA process, those that should be consulted at key points and those that should be kept aware of it. This will form the basis for an engagement plan which lays out who will be engaged in the process, and how they will be engaged, throughout each phase of the DFA. The mapping and development of an engagement plan should be developed through close collaboration between the oversight team and UNDP/UNCT. While there are likely to be some changes throughout any DFA process as the analysis and findings develop, it is important that the initial engagement plan is as comprehensive as possible. The earlier and more involved that key stakeholders are in the DFA, the more opportunity there is for the analysis and recommendations to be shaped by them and the greater the sense of ownership they will feel over the process. This will increase the likelihood that recommendations are taken forward in follow-up to the assessment. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 33 During the inception phase, terms of references for the oversight team, technical team and the DFA exercise as a whole will be produced. A technical team will be recruited during the inception phase. There are various models for the structure of the technical team, which will vary from country to country. It may be led by a national or international consultant, or an international consultant supported by a national consultant. Embedding a consultant in the requesting ministry has proven successful in past DFAs. Staff from the requesting ministry may also dedicate some of their 58 The aim of analysing data availability is to identify areas where access to data needs to be requested, further inquiries need to be made or where lack of data may constrain certain aspects of the analysis. Decisions on which currency or currencies to use in the analysis are particularly important where there have been significant exchange rate fluctuations that could affect the analysis of historic trends. time to be part of the technical team. A technical team for a DFA will often include two or three core members though in some cases, where the DFA is a larger exercise or where staff from the requesting ministry participate in the technical team, it may be larger. In all cases, the UNDP country office or UNCT will play an important role maintaining quality assurance over the work and providing inputs to ensure that the process, analysis and recommendations will meet the needs and request of the government oversight team. The inception phase is complete once the terms of reference for the oversight team and the DFA exercise have been finalized, the technical team has been 59 In Mongolia, for example, the MAPS process provided support on advancing the SDGs within the context of an economic downturn and the DFA supported the financing components of this process. In Egypt, MAPS supported the development of the National SDGs Action Plan with the DFA focusing on financing in two specific areas, climate change and women\u2019s empowerment, that were identified as a priority through the process. Box 7. Typical membership of the oversight team The oversight team plays a critical role in leading the DFA exercise, shaping the recommendations that are made and championing those recommendations among wider government, private sector and other stakeholders. Membership of the oversight team should be wide enough to include all actors that will be key to the implementation of the roadmap, but narrow enough to allow focused discussions.

This helps to ensure commitment to the process and can help with follow-up afterward. Where this is not possible, a new structure can be established. The list below outlines ministries that are commonly engaged as members of the oversight team. It distinguishes between those that are centrally involved in most or all oversight teams and those that may be included depending on the focus of the DFA. These lists are meant to assist thinking about which actors to involve \u2013 they are not prescriptive and should be adapted to the context in question. Core members: common to most DFAs \u2022 Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Finance, Prime Minister or President\u2019s Office (the Chair of the oversight team would typically be from one of these three ministries). \u2022 Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Ministry of Infrastructure \u2022 Private sector representatives: Chamber of Commerce or Federation of Industry \u2022 UNDP country office representative \u2022 Other representatives that may be included, depending on the focus of the DFA: \u2022 Line ministries and agencies relevant to the focus of the DFA: e.g. Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, Environment, Local Governments; Revenue Authority, Central Bank \u2022 Parliamentary representatives, for example if there is a committee that plays an important role in overseeing the implementation of the national plan or SDGs \u2022 Development partners, including International Financial Institutions and Multilateral Development Banks, particularly in contexts where development assistance is a key part of the finance landscape \u2022 Representatives of civil society, NGOs or faith-based organizations, where these either play an important role as service providers within the overall landscape Representatives from each ministry should be senior enough to be able to take decisions and shape recommendations. Often, representatives will be at the highest or second highest official level within their ministry, for example at the level of Permanent Secretary, Director-General, or equivalent. 34 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK recruited and an inception report or concept note for the DFA exercise has been produced. A draft engagement plan should also be in place. It is advisable to convene discussions with the oversight committee, DFA technical team and UNCT/UNDP at the completion of the set-up phase. This can facilitate any necessary handover of the scoping analysis to the newly established technical team. A workplan for the technical team should also be developed, including key milestones and timelines to be worked towards. Research and initial consultation The second phase is where the majority of the research and information gathering happens. During this phase, the technical team will compile a picture of finance trends and the policy and institutional landscape, using the analytical framework outlined in the previous module. They will engage in consultations with stakeholders and facilitate a consultation workshop that aims to build consensus on the key financing challenges and discuss areas in which recommendations may be developed. The research undertaken in this phase builds on the preliminary analysis undertaken in the inception phase. The first steps of research in this phase are desk-based, involving a review of key policies and literature as well as compilation and analysis of data on finance trends. As these come together, an emerging list of ideas for recommendations should be formed by the technical team for discussion with the oversight team and other stakeholders. Where the technical team is led by an international consultant, a research mission is typically undertaken part way through the research phase. These are normally a one or two-week mission or two one-week missions, though the set-up and schedule of missions is flexible and can be tailored as necessary.60 The typical aims for a research mission are to: 60 For example, in some instances a significant amount of information gathering and preliminary analysis may have been completed during the scoping mission, thereby reducing the scope of the research mission. In other instances, it may require more time and engagement to access the data and policy literature, thereby increasing the scope of the research mission(s). A schedule should be agreed as part of the workplan and defined at the end of the scoping phase. 1. Validate the desk-based data analysis, policy and literature review 2.

The consultation workshop is also important for continuing to build interest and momentum among stakeholders. The emphasis should be on facilitating a discussion, using the emerging analysis to guide a conversation about priorities and ideas for ways forward. Following the research mission, a first draft DFA report is prepared. This includes a full draft analysis of the finance and policy landscape following the analytical framework outlined above as well as a first draft roadmap of recommendations. Dialogue on the draft findings and recommendations Following completion of the draft report, the next phase involves substantive dialogue to refine and assign the recommendations of the roadmap as well as the finalization of the DFA report. The first draft report is reviewed by the oversight team with UNCT/UNDP providing quality assurance support. This will identify necessary amendments in the analysis and provide a first review of the recommendations in the draft roadmap. There is then a sequence of dialogue about the roadmap. The exact sequence will be determined by the extent of consultations needed, the nature of the recommendations and any ongoing national policy processes that the recommendations may feed into. 61 In instances where data and other information are not widely available online, there may be a need to adapt the process so that more time is spent upfront sourcing data and relevant documentation. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 35 There may be a need for a few rounds of review and dialogue with the oversight team to (i) refine the recommendations so that they are appropriate to the context and actionable and (ii) ensure there is clarity about responsibilities for taking things forward after the DFA. Some recommendations may require focused discussions with a subgroup of the oversight team and/ or stakeholders outside it. Others may involve accessing specialist services provided by UNDP or other partners and will therefore require scoping and outreach to the relevant service provider to determine feasibility and timelines. Within this sequence, two validation workshops will ordinarily be held to refine the emerging recommendations. The first is with the oversight team. It identifies and addresses any significant changes that are needed to the recommendations to make them appropriate to and actionable within the policy and political context. It also identifies responsibilities for taking forward the actions, as well as a proposed oversight structure (see the Roadmap Module for more detail). Following the workshop with the oversight team, a wider workshop is held with other stakeholders. This is used to gather final feedback for refining the recommendations, and to sensitize wider stakeholders about the actions that will be taken following the DFA. When the technical team is led by an international consultant, these workshops would ordinarily be held during a short mission (normally one week). As discussions about the recommendations come together, a series of TORs for each recommendation will be drafted to sit alongside the summary roadmap. This phase of the DFA is complete once the roadmap and DFA report have been finalized and approved by the oversight team. TORs for each recommendation within the roadmap may be finalized before the launch or according to an agreed timeline shortly thereafter. Launch The end of the DFA process itself is signalled by the formal launch of the roadmap and DFA report. This often involves an event that brings together the key stakeholders so that there is a clear public commitment to the next steps. While the technical team may be involved in the preparation for the event (e.g. in preparing presentations to support the launch), this event will be led by the oversight team with UNCT/UNDP engagement and facilitation. The report and roadmap will be published on the government\u2019s website with communications and rollout supported by UNCT/UNDP where appropriate. Follow-up Following the publication of the DFA report, the actions agreed in the roadmap will be taken forward. The timelines and sequence of these actions will be determined with a TOR for each recommendation. The oversight team may agree to continue reconvening at regular intervals to follow up, or an alternative mechanism for overseeing implementation may be agreed (such as incorporation into an ongoing governance structure). Roles and responsibilities The delivery of the DFA will involve a number of different actors. It is overseen by an oversight team comprised of government, private sector representatives and other key national actors.

This module provides key points of guidance for developing, agreeing and implementing a roadmap. It details the steps within the wider process that should be taken in developing the roadmap and outlines key points regarding ongoing oversight and follow-up on the part of governments and UN agencies. It also provides examples of the kinds of recommendations that a DFA may make. Steps for developing a roadmap The recommendations that are included in the roadmap can be developed from the early stages of the DFA process (see also DFA process module above). This is beneficial because it allows time for recommendations to develop through the analysis and be discussed and refined in collaboration with the oversight team and decision makers. Bringing stakeholders into discussions on the recommendations in the early stages and throughout the process can also build interest and retain momentum. Figure 13 highlights how the roadmap is developed within a typical wider DFA process (see Figure 10 above for an overview of the complete DFA process). Structure of a roadmap and follow-up The roadmap will outline a clear set of tangible, prioritized recommendations. While the ideas for recommendations will be drawn from the analysis, it is vital that they are refined through the process of dialogue and consultation so that by the end of the DFA process they are fully actionable. Critically, the process must work to identify and agree institutional responsibilities, timelines, resources and specific steps to be taken for each recommendation. This includes identifying any further information or work that is needed in order to take these next steps as well as links with ongoing UNDP and wider UN programming. These details can be specified in a terms of reference for each recommendation and summarized in the main roadmap. As the recommendations are finalized towards the end of the DFA process, the oversight team should agree a mechanism through which implementation of the roadmap will be overseen. As noted above, the ideal structure is for the oversight team function itself to be incorporated into the workplan of an existing governance mechanism; in these instances, implementation of the recommendations can also be incorporated. Where this is not the case, the oversight team may continue to meet or may establish an alternative structure for following up on progress in implementing the recommendations. The ongoing oversight structure should be specified in the roadmap document. Where recommendations are implemented through UNDP, UN or other development partner programming, this will involve collaboration between the oversight team and other service providers. Types and examples of recommendations This section outlines examples of the types of recommendations that may be made by DFAs, grouped according to the dimensions of the analytical framework. These examples are intended to help DFA teams think about the kinds of financing solutions they may be able to propose and develop within the country context. \u201cThe process is carefully designed to engender the participation and buy-in of key decision makers from government and wider stakeholders from the start\u201d A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 39 Figure 13.

Many recommendations will draw inspiration from, or link directly to, case studies from other countries or programming offered by UNDP and other UN agencies. In many instances, follow-up to a DFA can involve feeding into ongoing policy debates or processes. This may entail tailoring a specific aspect of the DFA analysis to feed into a given process or to support reform-minded colleagues within government in their engagement with a given process. The examples below cover potential recommendations which could be adapted and applied in a variety of different contexts. They are not exhaustive. Assessing the finance landscape The level of ambition articulated by the SDGs and in many national development plans is such that it will require mobilizing greater volumes of financing to fund the investments and services that will be required. The assessment of the finance landscape helps to identify the key gaps and opportunities in mobilizing finance for national sustainable development. Many DFAs will identify opportunities to expand or access new forms of financing that can contribute to sustainable development outcomes. Critically, this area can cover not just the mobilization of new flows but also steps to reduce costs or protect important flows that may otherwise decline. Recommendations in this part of a roadmap may cover a wide range of next steps, depending on the particular financing needs identified, but could for example include recommendations such as: Identify opportunities to boost private investment. Though private firms are not primarily motivated by sustainable development, it is a key driver of the sustainable development paths that countries will follow in practice. The scale of private investment, whether by SMEs or MNEs, is strongly influenced by the policy and business environment, as is the nature and degree of sustainability and inclusiveness of investments made (see example recommendation below). DFA roadmaps may identify steps that can be taken to stimulate greater volumes of finance for private sector development. These could, for example, relate to a range of areas including steps to improve the business environment, deploy new instruments to attract 40 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK private finance,62 establish partnerships and capacity to develop project pipelines, improve the way investment opportunities are marketed internationally and strengthen partnerships between national investment promotion agencies and outward investment agencies in key FDI source countries. In some contexts, the DFA may make recommendations about the financial sector,63 and how to stimulate greater demand for and capacity to manage credit among local MSMEs, or incentives for banks to provide credit to smaller firms. In many of these areas, there may be links to initiatives across government or programming by international development partners. The DFA may also be able to identify reforms that strengthen coordination within government and its partners for more harmonized and effective overall policy towards incentives for and partnerships with business, both in terms of stimulating private sector investment and in maximizing its impact (see more below). Establish or expand initiatives to leverage remittances. For many countries, remittances account for a significant proportion of international finance and play an important role at the community and family level, largely in supporting consumption. While a few countries have experimented with various ways of leveraging them, there may be untapped opportunities for countries undertaking a DFA. Mechanisms to mobilize greater volumes of finance from remittance flows and the diaspora take three main forms (see below for more on maximizing the sustainable development impact of remittances). Firstly, the cost of sending remittances can be reduced, leaving more money in the hands of those who send and receive them. Regulatory measures, the encouragement of competition, bilateral collaboration along the most significant remittance corridors and other measures can be deployed.64 There have been instances where remittance firms have reduced costs during and after a crisis, such as the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines. Secondly, a number 62 For a number of examples on this topic, see case studies including on PPPs and works for taxes in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 63 For example, Indonesia has developed a roadmap for sustainable finance. 64 For a number of examples of innovation in this area, see case studies on reducing the cost of sending remittances in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. of countries have experimented with issuing diaspora bonds65 and this may be a route worth exploring for countries with a large overseas diaspora that feel strong affinity with national development plans, have good governance and an investment grade credit rating.

The DFA may identify sources of domestic and international finance such as Islamic finance instruments,68 innovative financing mechanisms or climate funds that the country is eligible for. It could, for example, provide advice on the criteria that would need to be met, the capacity required to access and manage financing and the types of investments that could be funded. It can also link to service offerings that may be able to provide follow-up support in these areas (see below). Safeguarding future flows. In some countries, industries such as forestry and fishing, and cash crops provide an important source of revenue yet are characterized by unsustainable practices that threaten the future of these revenues. Similarly, important industries in many contexts may be threatened by climate change or may be susceptible to natural disasters, such as tourism. In these contexts, the DFA may be able to identify ways of mobilizing finance to support changes in business practices or investment in mitigation or prevention that can protect and/or increase future revenue sources. 65 For more on this, see the examples of India, Israel and Nepal in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 66 For more on this, see the examples of Banco do Brasil in Brazil and Fedecr\u00e9dito in El Salvador in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 67 For more on these potential financing solutions, see the remittances chapters in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing, as well as the remittances page in the Financing Solutions for Sustainable Development platform which is available at: http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/ solutions/remittances.html. 68 Indonesia, for example, has been able to scale up investments in the SDGs by leveraging Islamic finance. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 41 Integrated planning and financing The DFA can design solutions that help governments to strengthen the alignment between planning and financing; common recommendations in this area may include the following: Develop a holistic financing strategy for the national development plan. Setting out an explicit strategy for how public and private financing will be mobilized can help tie planning and finance policies closely together. This may be an appropriate recommendation for some DFAs. Often these strategies will become a chapter in the national plan. They can outline the scale and contributions that different types of financing can make as well as a strategic approach to mobilizing them. They can provide guidance on how to address the synergies, trade-offs and competing priorities that exist between different aspects of financing sustainable development. In these ways, they can aim to provide clear objectives and guidance for financing policies, and stimulate and guide prioritization or adjustments within the planning system. Recommendations to develop a financing strategy have been made in a number of DFAs and in some, this has been an explicit objective from the outset. Estimate the cost of achieving the national development plan, sectoral strategies or flagship programmes. Estimating the costs of a national development plan can strengthen the link between financing and planning by providing a stronger basis for designing financing policies (see also the next example recommendation) and as such may be an appropriate recommendation for some DFAs.69 Costings exercises are strongest when they consider the scale of investments and services that both public and private actors can make to contribute towards the various objectives of the national development plan. Given the breadth and interlinkages between different aspects of most national development plans, costings exercises are technically complex, resource-heavy exercises and rely on detailed sources of data and information on current financing and costs.70 69 For an example of this, see the Bangladesh case study in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 70 For more on costings, see the BIOFIN workbook (UNDP, 2016) or the example of the Bangladesh SDGs financing strategy in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. Strengthening results-based planning and processes to align budgets and policies to the national development plan.

In some contexts, it may be able to propose enhancements related to one or more of the following principles: broadening participation of non- state actors in reviews at key moments in the budget or policy development process; widening the coverage of the mechanism to incorporate a broader spectrum of policy areas (notably to include policies that influence private finance); or taking steps to depoliticize reviews, for example by establishing standardized criteria against which all policies will be assessed. Strengthen budgeting for the SDGs. Many countries have introduced steps to link national budgets to the 2030 Agenda and the DFA may identify areas in which innovations can be applied to the country in question. These many include shorter-term solutions such as introducing SDG monitoring frameworks, including the most directly linked and relevant SDG targets into national plans, establishing SDG committees or incorporating reviews of SDG-relevant spending and progress into budget statements. Longer-term initiatives can relate to areas such as adjusting business practices, introducing standards and adopting more sophisticated monitoring systems to track outcomes and the impact of budget expenditures. Countries including Mexico and Panama have introduced SDG budgeting processes.72 Broaden the objectives of tax collection and revenue mobilization strategies. In many countries, the sole mandate of the revenue authority is to maximize revenue collection. Yet there are a variety of ways in which revenues can be raised and different models of taxation can have vastly different impacts on equity and income distribution, including differentiated impacts across regions within a country. When developing revenue mobilization strategies, revenue authorities may face trade-offs between reforms that could boost 71 For examples of this, see the case studies on aligning the budget with the national plan in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 72 For more on potential reforms related to SDG budgeting including further examples, see UNDP (2018). Budgeting for Agenda 2030: Opting for the right model. 42 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK revenue but negatively impact income inequality. For example, indirect taxes such as income tax can be more progressive yet more challenging to establish than direct taxes such as VAT which are often simpler to administer though more regressive.73 Different types of taxation can have very different impacts on income distribution, for example, and taxes are increasingly being used to not only raise revenue but also promote behaviour change in areas such as health and the environment.74 Some countries have broadened the mandates of their revenue authorities to incorporate these factors alongside revenue maximization; others have introduced smart taxes to address specific objectives. The DFA may be able to identify opportunities to adapt revenue strategies in order to target progressive, sustainable models of tax collection. Public\u2013private collaboration The analysis of public\u2013private collaboration will highlight challenges and opportunities for enhancing the contributions that private actors make towards sustainable development. Potential recommendations may cover mobilizing greater volumes of financing (see also recommendations above) as well as boosting the direct and indirect impacts that these finance types have on development.75 Recommendations in this area may include proposals such as the following: Establish or scale-up instruments designed to mobilize private finance for strategic investments. The DFA can advise on financing instruments that could be used to mobilize private finance for strategic investments. It can offer an assessment of the instruments that could be suited to the country and governance context, based on the characteristics of those instruments and contextual factors including priority financing needs, the administrative ability of government and partners, and other issues. Instruments could be designed for different purposes, such as stimulating investment in strategic industries, or mobilizing private finance to fund key public investments. A range of instruments may be suited depending on the context, including but not limited to various types of bonds (e.g. sovereign bonds, Islamic sukuks or bonds with a narrower focus such as climate bonds or diaspora bonds), public\u2013private 73 This is a general example; design features can be built into direct and indirect taxes to enhance progressiveness, for example. 74 These include taxes on petrol, tobacco, sugar, alcohol and other goods or services that have damaging side effects. 75 For more, see UNDP (2017). Mobilizing private finance for sustainable development. partnership mechanisms,76 incentive schemes (see below) or innovative approaches such as a works for taxes scheme.77 The DFA can advise on the changes that would be needed to establish or scale up these or other relevant instruments, including any necessary regulatory changes, partnerships developed or capacity established.

It can also identify areas where additional specialist support can be offered, for example in promoting investment in renewable energy78 or mobilizing financing for biodiversity.79 Strengthen the promotion of sustainable private investment. The DFA may be able to propose ways to enhance the impact of private investment on sustainable development. In order to attract sustainable, inclusive private investment, it is important to not only improve the economic attractiveness of this environment, but to develop an environment that promotes sustainable, inclusive investment and responsible corporate governance. Depending on the context, the DFA may identify recommendations related to this challenge, including regulatory reforms,80 the development of norms, capacity development, supporting policies and coordination measures. Regulations may be developed or tightened on minimum standards, for example in undertaking environmental and social impact assessments. Norms may be established through collaboration with private sector partners in areas such as reporting on environmental, social and governance outcomes (see more below). There may be opportunities for government to strengthen policy measures that mitigate the risks of investment in particular industries or geographic areas and help draw out the wider benefits. These may include, for example, policies that help businesses manage their environmental impacts or improve transparency 76 For more on these mechanisms, see the case studies in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 77 For more on this, see the Peruvian works-for-taxes case study in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 78 For more, see Derisking Renewable Energy Investment, http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/ environment-energy/low_emission_climateresilientdevelopment/ derisking-renewable-energy-investment.html 79 For more, see BIOFIN, the Biodiversity Finance Initiative, https:// www.biodiversityfinance.net/ 80 See, for example, the case study on business regulation reforms in Rwanda in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 43 (see below), or that provide targeted support to local SMEs that have the potential to grow and deepen value chains as international investors come in, through training, enhanced access to finance or other measures. Underlying this is alignment across agencies and with private sector partners, to ensure that efforts to promote investment are effective and efficiently mitigate the risks and enhance the benefits to the environment and society. The DFA may be able to identify ways to strengthen coordination between government ministries and representatives from the private sector in the design and implementation of policy towards the private sector to this end.81 Strengthen incentives schemes for greater efficiency and effectiveness.82 One of the key measures that governments use to attract private investment is incentive schemes that offer tax or financial support for companies whose investments meet certain criteria, often linked to investment in particular industries, regions or types of business. Such schemes can be attractive for governments as they offer a way to promote specific, strategic types of investment, and as they can also be more straightforward to establish and operate than more structural reforms to business regulation or other areas of policy. However, they can often become expensive and less focused and efficient over time. The DFA may be able to identify ways to adapt and strengthen such schemes, making them more targeted, efficient and focused on the development outcomes that they are ultimately designed to promote. Incentives will be most effective, and generate more sustainable results, if they are deployed within the context of a strong business environment rather than as compensation for an environment in which it is difficult to do business. Incentives will also be most effective when they are effectively targeted and when they are temporary. The more incentives are targeted at promoting strategic investments that catalyse the specific outcomes a country wants to realize, the more effective they will be. There may be opportunities in some contexts to move towards outcome-based incentives, particularly with improvements in private sector reporting and monitoring (see below). The DFA may be able to advise on the types of incentives that government could offer, for example considering profit 81 See, for example, the case study on public\u2013private dialogue around cleaner production in Chile in UNDP (2018).

Promoting impact investment. Social impact investment offers potential to both provide sustainable models for investment and services in key areas of sustainable development, and to act as a catalyst for progress among the wider business community. Depending on the pre- existing context of impact investment in the country, the DFA may identify opportunities to promote further growth in impact investing itself, or to facilitate the transfer of key principles, practices and tools to other firms. Potential policy changes to promote growth in impact investment may relate to areas such as tax incentives, access to credit, use of payment for outcome models of procurement, and clarifying fiduciary rules on asset management.83 There may also be opportunities to facilitate the transfer of practices in areas such as outcome measurement or use of standards in fund allocation among the wider private and financial sector, through dialogue platforms and private sector forums. Policies to enhance the sustainable development benefits of remittances. Remittances are important flows in many countries\u2019 national financing landscape and constitute an often-vital flow for the families and communities that receive them from workers overseas. The DFA may identify opportunities to enhance the sustainable development benefits generated by remittances. A number of countries have experimented with schemes to increase financial literacy for recipients of remittances as a way of encouraging their use for investment rather than consumption, or have established schemes to promote home ownership through regular saving associated with remittances.84 The DFA may identify opportunities where some of these initiatives could be applied, and can highlight the lessons learnt about how to establish and administer such schemes. 83 For examples on these and other potential policy options, see the promoting social impact investment case studies in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 84 See, for example, the case study of remittances for mortgages in the Philippines in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 44 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Establish SDG platforms at the country level that include a focus on financing. Establishing a platform that brings together representatives of all sectors can stimulate dialogue and partnerships for progress across the SDGs. UNDP is supporting the establishment of such SDG platforms in many countries. These platforms can include a dedicated focus on financing that builds from and institutionalizes the dialogue undertaken during the DFA process. While there is a need to bring non- governmental stakeholders into specific policy processes (see below), there is also value in dialogue that is not tied to specific policy questions. Creating a space for more open dialogue on potential solutions can help deepen common understanding and stimulate new ideas and innovations. Monitoring and review Effective monitoring and review frameworks are critical for linking finance to results. The DFA may identify ways to establish or strengthen existing monitoring frameworks or to improve the way that the data collected is harmonized between partners and used to inform policymaking. Roadmaps may include recommendations such as: Strengthen capacity and norms for private sector reporting. Improvements in reporting by private firms in many countries highlights the potential to better understand, and respond to, the positive and negative impacts that businesses have across the dimensions of sustainable development. In many contexts, the DFA may take lessons from countries where sustainability reporting or similar initiatives are growing and adapt and apply them in the DFA country.85 Recommendations in this area may involve, for example, raising awareness of the benefits of sustainability reporting, supporting initiatives to establish tailored private sector reporting mechanisms,86 partnering with champions who can build norms and standards, and building technical capacity among firms, including through development advisory services. It may also relate to strengthening legislative and regulatory requirements for reporting, or establishing stronger reporting criteria for firms engaged in government 85 For examples of innovation in this area, see the case studies related to improving private sector reporting in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 86 See, for example, the case study on showcasing transformational business in the Philippines in UNDP (2018). Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. contracts. The DFA may also identify ways in which the information that is published can be used by government to inform and improve the targeting of relevant policies (see also the example recommendation on outcome- based incentives above). Strengthen statistical systems for collecting data on financing and outcomes. Understanding the financing landscape and the progress being made in sustainable development is a foundation for dialogue about the roles that different types of financing can play in achieving the SDGs. In analysing this picture, the DFA itself draws on a range of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35775600-d69c-46a8-beb6-01d56837e08b": {"__data__": {"id_": "35775600-d69c-46a8-beb6-01d56837e08b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31f6221f339100f4d8c3fc252cad69701f39abf1c72252ae7cef57e0d9cd1ad3"}}, "hash": "31f6221f339100f4d8c3fc252cad69701f39abf1c72252ae7cef57e0d9cd1ad3", "text": "national sources of data, drawn from different ministries and organizations and based on surveys, administrative data or accounting systems. As this analysis is compiled, the DFA technical team is likely to come up against limitations in the data. In some contexts, the DFA may identify ways to strengthen national systems for collecting data on financing and outcomes. Recommendations may for example include adapting survey questions to incorporate more detail on financing or enable clearer links between financing and outcomes, developing new surveys to cover actors such as NGOs or faith-based organizations who are often not fully covered by national statistics on financing or adapting administrative systems to incorporate tracking of expenditure on cross-cutting issues such as gender equality or climate finance. The DFA may also identify priorities for capacity-building in compiling and analysing statistics. Incorporate analysis of trends in all financing within regular national development plan progress reporting. A key objective of the DFA itself is to demystify financing for non-specialist audiences. Following the completion of the DFA, there will be a continued need to keep key constituencies informed not only of progress towards national development objectives but also of the investments and spending being made to realize them. DFAs may consider recommending the inclusion of updated financing trend analysis within official processes, such as the regular publication of a progress report, on an ongoing basis in order to meet this need. The DFA may also be able to support such initiatives by sharing the methodological approaches for gathering and analysing the data required to monitor trends in financing with the relevant officials, or by undertaking capacity-building during or in follow-up to the DFA. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 45 Transparency and accountability Transparency and collective accountability between stakeholders in financing is important for building trust that promotes collaboration between partners. It can also be a powerful mechanism for boosting the effectiveness of financing. DFAs may identify recommendations to improve transparency and accountability in areas such as: Strengthen oversight and scrutiny of the financing of the national development plan. Parliamentary committees play an important role in many countries scrutinizing the policies and programmes of governments and other actors. This function can create powerful incentives to increase effectiveness, ensure that resources are used efficiently and that strong outcomes are achieved. The scope and power that parliamentarians have varies widely between countries, as does the capacity and information they have to fulfil the oversight function. DFAs in some contexts may identify opportunities in areas such as strengthening the mandate of relevant parliamentary committees or the role of a national audit office to scrutinize public and private financing of the national development plan. It may also identify ways in which capacity-building could support these actors in fulfilling their roles. Enhance multi-stakeholder participation in budget and policy processes. Participation by the private sector, CSOs, think tanks and other actors in dialogue throughout the process of designing, implementing and reviewing policies can be a powerful mechanism for shaping policies that are more responsive, innovative and around which there is greater ownership outside government. DFAs in some contexts may identify ways in which budget and policy processes can be adapted to enhance participation as well as aspects of capacity-building for relevant ministries to strengthen the effective management of multi-stakeholder dialogue. Establish or expand tax expenditure reporting. Many governments use tax expenditure \u2013 schemes which forgo tax revenue \u2013 to promote strategic priority objectives. They can be deployed across a range of objectives, from supporting low-income families to promoting private sector development, notably through investment incentive schemes. However, while tax expenditure is widely used it is in many contexts significantly less transparent than equivalent spending in the budget. This limits the ability of the government to understand the effectiveness of its tax expenditure schemes and reduces accountability. The DFA may be able to advise on how countries can establish or expand their monitoring and reporting on tax expenditure.87 It may also be able to identify other steps such as potential evaluations of the efficiency of particular incentive schemes. Case studies and relevant service offerings The DFA places a strong emphasis on identifying and adapting successful innovations from other countries to the context in question. As such, case studies play an important role in the development of a roadmap. Case studies about how other countries have overcome similar challenges will be developed. These can promote new ideas and stimulate discussion about developing or adapting policies for the country context. In a similar way, recommendations within the roadmap will often build on and link to service offerings from UNDP or other UN", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84c3c818-c285-41e3-94fc-e9194a40749c": {"__data__": {"id_": "84c3c818-c285-41e3-94fc-e9194a40749c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1088aa0cd596f3e3da1ede4da80b25c03b5d8717951a2e5ec6f4a73bc8dab558"}}, "hash": "1088aa0cd596f3e3da1ede4da80b25c03b5d8717951a2e5ec6f4a73bc8dab558", "text": "agencies. A wide range of specialist services exist that can support a government and its partners to develop reforms or policies in specific niche areas of financing.

Country innovations for integrated SDG financing. 46 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Annexes Annex A: Key terms A central aim of the DFA is to promote dialogue among a wide constituency of stakeholders. This will typically involve specialists in finance and economics as well as non-specialists, and representatives from the public and private sectors, civil society, development partners and other communities. These stakeholders will often use terminology or related concepts in different ways. One of the jobs of a DFA is to help clarify and bring these stakeholders together around a common understanding of trends, policy challenges and opportunities for financing the 2030 Agenda. Clarity in the way terminology is used is key to achieving this. This annex presents the definitions for key terms used throughout this guidebook. In many instances, these are drawn from technical definitions from economic and financial specialisms, though in places they are adapted to facilitate a more generalist understanding. These definitions may be used and adapted as necessary as the DFA approach is applied in particular country contexts. Finance. In this guidebook, the term \u2018finance\u2019 is used as an overall term for all public and private flows. Finance policy function. Following the definition of finance used in this guidebook, capturing all public and private flows, \u2018finance policy function\u2019 refers to a government\u2019s development and implementation of policies related to these different types of finance. This is an overall term that would typically cover finance policies including, for example, the annual and/or medium- term budget (or expenditure framework), policies that aim to stimulate private sector development or mobilize investment, financial inclusion strategies, and development cooperation partnership strategies, among others. Finance strategy. This refers to the strategic approach that some countries have developed to guide their policy on how the investments and services needed to realize the national plan will be funded. This will often be articulated as a finance chapter in a national plan though is in some instances a stand-alone document. Many countries, however, do not have such a strategy and among those that do there is often a focus on public finance without full consideration of the roles that private finance can play. A key aim of the DFA is to help countries develop and take a more holistic, integrated approach to mobilizing the finance for their national plan (see the integrated planning and financing dimension of the analytical framework for more). Contributions of finance to the SDGs. The DFA focuses on how countries can finance sustainable development progress. Finance is an intermediate step to achieving outcomes as it pays for the investments and services that can deliver them. However, for shorthand, the DFA Guidebook refers to the contributions that different types of finance can make towards SDG outcomes rather than talking about the contributions that the investments and services that are funded by finance can make towards sustainable development. National plan. This refers to the long or medium-term aspirational vision that many countries have developed as a guide for the long or medium-term progress they wish to make. The terminology varies between countries \u2013 common names include national development plans, national sustainable development plans, or vision documents. For shorthand, they are referred to as the national plan in this guidebook. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 47 Planning function. This refers to the forward planning activities undertaken by national governments. Such functions are in most instances housed either in a stand-alone planning ministry or as a division within the Ministry of Finance or the Office of the Executive. The ministry or division will typically be responsible for articulating the medium to long-term aspirations of the country, often in a national plan, and may have some responsibility for development expenditure within the budget. Private sector. This refers to private businesses active in a country, covering large and small, formal and informal, domestic- and foreign-owned businesses. It is distinct from economic definitions which divide the whole economy into the public and private sectors. The private sector here is a subset of the economic definition of the private sector, which would also include other private actors such as NGOs, foundations and faith- based organizations.

Social impact investment. This term is used to capture three types of private investment that can be placed on a spectrum between philanthropy and investments that only consider the financial returns. It covers responsible investment, sustainable investment and impact investment.88 There isn\u2019t a clear consensus on this terminology in the sector so this report follows the definition used by the Social Impact Investment Taskforce established by the G8 in 2013 with the slight distinction that philanthropy is treated separately in this report. 88 For more on this, see UNDP (2018).

A DFA may include scenarios in order to explore potential future trends and identify steps that can be taken in the short-term to prepare for, exploit or mitigate these issues. The DFA does not produce forecasts of what it thinks will happen in the future. Scenarios can be used at the macro, sectoral or thematic level. The scenarios that can be developed by the DFA are straightforward projections of the volumes and mix of each flow based on assumptions about their future trajectory. The aim is to create a straightforward, accessible picture about the potential future evolution of finance flows in order to facilitate dialogue on priorities and policy options. The scenarios used in the DFA do not entail complex econometric analysis and do not offer hard predictions about future flows \u2013 rather they aim to develop \u2018broad brush\u2019 scenarios about potential future trends in order to facilitate dialogue. The scenarios build on the aggregation and disaggregation of all flows in the financing trends dimension of the analytical framework module above. They analyse potential future trajectories in the volumes of different flows and compare these volumes with the kinds of financing needs implied by a national development plan. They do not directly model the potential impact of policy changes on resource levels but allow an analysis of potential trajectories against financing needs.97 Scenarios can be presented to analyse a variety of the breakdowns described for each finance flow in the analytical framework section. In all instances, the 97 For example, one common scenario is to look at the potential impact of policies to attract FDI. The scenarios within the DFA would not model the impact that improvements in the business environment may have on future levels of FDI. But, based on assumptions about the impact of these changes on the growth in FDI, they would analyse the effect on the overall levels and mix of finance. For example, if the policy achieves an increase in FDI growth of x percent or y percent a year then the levels of FDI in 5, 10 and 20 years would reach x, y and z levels. Putting these alongside current outcome indicators, such as jobs created or taxes paid, and alongside similar scenarios for other aspects of finance policy, this can support dialogue about prioritization. scenarios should be carefully situated within a policy analysis narrative that relates volumes of finance to the potential impact that they may have on different aspects of sustainable development.

This will project forward current trends into the future, either to 2030 or in line with the time horizon for the national or sector development plan. The baseline should be a straightforward business-as-usual scenario. It should be constructed in a way that allows data to be expressed in at least three formats: aggregate volumes, volumes per person and volumes as a proportion of national income, as well as any other formats that are used in policy targets being examined (e.g. percentage of government spending or spending per student). The baseline model will require a number of assumptions about the future trajectory of key indicators. Where available, official projections or assumptions used in any models maintained by government (for example by a macroeconomic policy unit) should be used in the DFA for reasons of compatibility. Projections from other actors can be used where these are not available; for example, UNDESA produces country-level projections of population growth to 2050. The IMF publishes medium economic growth projections in Article IV reports. Where no projections are available, a continuation of existing trends should be assumed. Care should be taken to choose an appropriate time period on which to base estimates of existing trends. It should be long enough that one- off factors or events do not skew the average, but short enough to represent the current context (i.e. avoiding, if possible, data from years before a major policy change that significantly affected subsequent flows). Robustness A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 51 checks should be undertaken where the configuration of the model is altered slightly to ensure that the set-up chosen does not produce radically different results. Known future policy changes should also be built into the baseline scenario. For example, the government may be undertaking a major infrastructure project with a known end date after which capital spending will fall, or development partners may have stated that they will reduce or end support in particular sectors if a country has recently graduated from International Development Assistance eligibility or Least Developed Countries status. This guidebook is not prescriptive about the format in which the scenario model should be set up, but a spreadsheet can be a useful format. Models can be set up in a way that allows flexibility and assumptions to be easily changed and adapted. It is also a format that is readily understood by most stakeholders (as opposed to specialist statistical or econometric software that is less accessible), which can be useful when interrogating scenarios in dialogue with the oversight team.98 2. Analyse the findings of the baseline model An analysis comparing financing available under the baseline scenario in 2030 (or the end date for a national development plan) with the implied financing needs (or costs where they have been estimated) of a national development plan can be undertaken, when the latter information is available. This should be compared with the comparison described in the integrated planning and financing section above to highlight areas where differences in long-term trends alter the narrative about where the largest finance gaps exist. 98 At the time of publication, a generic template that can be adapted for country-specific DFAs is in development. 3. Use the scenarios model to assess the potential impact of future trends Once the baseline model has been established it can be adapted and used to assess the potential impacts of reforms. In the first instance, scenarios can be built around ongoing or already planned reforms. Further scenarios can be developed to explore the recommendations developed through the DFA. Additional scenarios can be modelled by adapting the configuration of the scenario. There are a number of ways in which this could be done. Certain reforms may articulate specific targets that can be included in the model, either fully or partially (under assumptions about complete or partial achievement of the objectives of the reform). For example, there may be targets to raise tax revenue mobilization from x percent of GDP to y percent of GDP by a certain date. Applying this to the scenario would allow an analysis of the fiscal space it will create and the potential impact it would have on spending in key sectors (based on assumptions about maintaining or changing sector spending patterns). Combining this with demographic projections allows an analysis of the potential impact on health spending per person or education spending per pupil, for example.

This could be compared against current data on job creation to help consider the employment outcomes that may be met if targets are achieved fully or partially. Other reforms may aim to increase efficiency or generate savings. These could be modelled by altering the trajectory of a relevant indicator, for example reducing the rate of growth in a particular aspect of government spending or increasing the rate of growth in annual tax receipts. 52 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Beyond modelling reforms alone, scenarios can be developed to assess the impact of wider issues such as commodity price changes or the impacts of a natural disaster. Commodity price changes could be analysed, for example, by adjusting the revenues received from extractive sectors (and potentially the levels of private investment in these sectors) in extractive-exporting countries or adjusting the cost of fuel subsidies in oil- importing countries. The specific reforms that are modelled, and assumptions about the kinds of outcomes they could achieve should be discussed and guided by the oversight team to ensure that they are realistic. Use of scenarios to analyse potential reforms should not be done in isolation and should always be accompanied by a policy analysis that goes beyond the data to consider the feasibility, likelihood of success and wider implications of the reforms in question. Example Timor-Leste\u2019s Petroleum Fund Timor-Leste\u2019s Petroleum Fund is a central part of the country\u2019s financing landscape. It collects the revenue earned from sales of the country\u2019s natural resources and has invested them in assets that generate a return which is used to finance much of the government\u2019s budget. An estimated sustainable income (ESI) level of 3 percent estimates the amount of the fund that could be drawn down each year sustainably, making drawdowns into perpetuity. The government however has a current policy of frontloading, whereby higher volumes are drawdown in the short-term and invested in order to generate future returns that can diversify the country\u2019s economy and government budgets. The Timor-Leste DFA has produced scenarios to explore the future of the Petroleum Fund based on different assumptions about the frontloading policy and various economic factors (Figure 14). These scenarios are being used alongside others in the DFA, which is ongoing at the time of writing, to explore various potential policy reforms and the impact they may have on the Petroleum Fund itself, on the government budget and on wider finance flows. 18 15 12 9 6 3 2010 2015 2020 2015 2030 2035 Current US$ billions Continuation of current trends Return to ESI in 2025 Slower spending growth, higher investment return Balance of Petroleum Fund Figure 14.

A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 53 Annex D: Describing and comparing implied financing needs with current financing trends This annex describes the methodology for describing the implied financing needs of a national development plan which is part of the integrated planning and financing dimension of the analytical framework. This is not a costing exercise but can be used in lieu of estimates of the costs of a national plan, which requires a detailed exercise that only a minority of countries have undertaken. A description of the implied financing needs can be compared against current financing trends to assess gaps and opportunities for financing the national plan. There are three steps to describing implied financing needs: an objective-by-objective review that is then collated across a plan as a whole and finally compared against corresponding trends in the financing landscape. Objective-by-objective review of the national development plan The first step in describing the implied financing needs of the national development plan is to review each priority, goal or objective individually. This review will look at the outcomes that are targeted within each objective as well as any guidance on the strategic approach that will be used in order to realize them. The DFA technical team, in close consultation with the oversight team and other relevant stakeholders, should infer the kinds of investments and services that will be required to realize these objectives and the corresponding types of finance that will be needed. The aim is not to undertake a costing exercise or produce precise estimates but to develop a description of the kind of finance trends that will be needed. It should articulate, for example, what kind of mix of public or private and domestic or foreign finance it requires, which specific actors will be involved, the nature of ongoing capital and recurrent financing required", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7c9f4fb-1a4c-4280-bd2f-627e04bfc47d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7c9f4fb-1a4c-4280-bd2f-627e04bfc47d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "174639f1c6cbd9189bd1611e06256dfac9e5f2a23bad0d3023c9fa2e9df2f68a"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1144b8c-9266-4145-b947-99f50b5eb532", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c7a5ac7e6c497b04e43eb68775d4db6b43f788daf674a7e3cdf74497d744033"}}, "hash": "f59b0dc8c7ecc10959fcc25b5cc7847c5d9293b75934af355c168d0c8dd2d620", "text": "as well as other pertinent characteristics such as whether financing may incur debts that will be repaid into the future. The description will be primarily qualitative but can benefit from any quantitative figures available. These may come, for example, from any specific targets that are articulated in the national development plan or a corresponding sector strategy. The DFA team can also bring in figures from international benchmarks and case studies. In many sectors and thematic areas, there has been work by specialist agencies to estimate the typical, or country-specific, costs of achieving certain SDGs.99 Case studies of other countries that have successfully achieved outcomes from a similar context can also be very valuable in helping develop rough proxies for the mix and scale of resources that may be needed to achieve a particular policy objective. Collated review of implied financing requirements Once the descriptions of the financing requirements for each objective of the national plan have been developed, these can be brought together, compared and aggregated. The descriptions about the kind of financing required to achieve each objectives will be collated in order to identify common financing needs and synergies between objectives, as well as any trade-offs between the financing requirements in different areas. The result will be a primarily qualitative description of the kind of overall financing landscape that will be required to achieve the national development plan. It will not be a precise description but should aim to articulate the broad characteristics and trends of the financing landscape overall. It can take a similar form to the narrative description of the current financing landscape, in order to aid comparison between the two. 99 For example, Chatham House has estimated that the cost of achieving universal health coverage is a minimum of US$86 per person (see https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/papers/ view/198263). The SME Finance Forum has published estimates of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance gap at the country level (see https://www.smefinanceforum.org/data- sites/msme-finance-gap). UNESCO has a model for estimating education costs in which national data can be incorporated (see the costing model on this page: https://en.unesco.org/gem- report/node/819). The Global Infrastructure Outlook project infrastructure investment needs for 50 countries is at https:// outlook.gihub.org/. The World Bank has undertaken research on the cost of meeting targets on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (see http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/publication/ the-costs-of-meeting-the-2030-sustainable-development-goal- targets-on-drinking-water-sanitation-and-hygiene). 54 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK EXAMPLES Many countries have a target to achieve universal secondary education. In the absence of estimates about how much this will cost in a particular country, the DFA can infer the types and trends in financing that will be required. For example, achieving universal secondary education will likely require a significant and predictable source of public finance which in many instances will be administered through municipal or provincial government. International benchmarks in spending per pupil or UNESCO\u2019s costing tools may be used to provide some rough quantitative benchmarks. Depending on the context, non-state providers of education, such as NGOs, donors, faith-based organizations or private providers of education, may play an important role in financing. Such a description of the resources required for education can be used as a comparison with current financing trends in education. It may provide insights into future priorities for financing nationally as well as the local or provincial level. It may also prompt and contribute to dialogue about the future role and division of labour in education between the government and the potential for financing to be raised and utilized effectively by these different actors. Economic growth, industrialization and the development of higher-value-added industries are at the core of the majority of national plans. The DFA can analyse the targets articulated in a plan to build a description of the kinds of financing that will be required at the industry level. For example, growth in a new or expanded industry would typically require significant and growing volumes of additional private commercial investment. For new industries, a significant proportion of this may be foreign direct investment by firms that are established in the sector internationally, while for the expansion of existing industries it may imply a mix of domestic and foreign investment. Where national plans articulate targets for value-chain development or wider job creation, for example, the expansion of local SMEs may be critical, implying scaled-up access to credit for small businesses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1144b8c-9266-4145-b947-99f50b5eb532": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1144b8c-9266-4145-b947-99f50b5eb532", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "174639f1c6cbd9189bd1611e06256dfac9e5f2a23bad0d3023c9fa2e9df2f68a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7c9f4fb-1a4c-4280-bd2f-627e04bfc47d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f59b0dc8c7ecc10959fcc25b5cc7847c5d9293b75934af355c168d0c8dd2d620"}}, "hash": "2c7a5ac7e6c497b04e43eb68775d4db6b43f788daf674a7e3cdf74497d744033", "text": "For most sectors, national objectives will imply ongoing volumes of investment that continue to drive industry growth into the future, though the mix of foreign and domestic, or large and small firm, investment may evolve over time.

National plans rarely specify targets for the desired volumes of investment but in some cases this can be inferred from other stated policy targets. Where growth rates or a certain contribution to total GDP is specified for a certain industry, it may be possible to infer the rough volumes of investment that this implies by using an assumed or benchmark return on investment for the industry. Case studies from other countries that have successfully established or expanded a similar industry can also provide insights into the types of financing required, the potential outcomes achieved and, critically for the roadmap, inspiration about the kinds of policy changes that may be required. Comparing current financing trends with implied financing requirements Once the description of the financing landscape overall has been compiled, it will be compared against the characteristics of current trends (and future trends if forward-looking scenarios are being used \u2013 see Annex B). While many aspects of this picture will be understood individually, bringing them together can prompt conversations among decision makers about the highest priorities for the short and longer-term. By bringing a wider body of stakeholders into the discussion, it can also provide new momentum for reform, either by strengthening the lobby for change or by breaking down barriers to collaboration between partners. The comparison will identify the areas of financing that are on track as well as the areas in which there is a need for a significant change in trajectory. It is not an econometric exercise, but a descriptive comparison between current and required trends. It is a critical step in identifying the priorities for mobilizing greater volumes of financing in relation to specific national development plan objectives.

It will be signed off before the research and consultation phases begin. The Terms of Reference (TOR) of the DFA will capture agreement on a number of factors that are important for the success of the DFA overall. These include the specific focus of the DFA, the policy issues on which the DFA should provide recommendations and the policy dialogues and institutional structures that the DFA should feed into and support. It should specify the timelines that the DFA will follow and present an overview of the composition of the oversight team. While these factors may be refined during the latter phases of the DFA process, the inception phase should aim as far as possible to scope them comprehensively and agree a specific course for the full DFA. This is important for ensuring that all participants and stakeholders have a clear, common understanding about the nature of the DFA and expectations about what it will and won\u2019t achieve. The concept note may include the following sections: Background A short background to the DFA should provide a succinct overview of the sustainable development context and policy landscape and priorities of the country. It can outline the key plans and policies that are in place and summarize progress in priority aspects of the 2030 Agenda. It can include a paragraph summarizing headlines related to the financing landscape, based on the scoping analysis undertaken in the inception phase.

Objectives and focus of the DFA The objectives of the DFA should be outlined as specifically and tangibly as possible in the concept note. This is vital for ensuring that all stakeholders move forward with a common understanding of the aims of the process and expectations about what it can achieve. This section of the concept note may, for example, identify specific areas in which recommendations will be developed, policy processes that the DFA should engage with and aim to inform or support, stakeholders that will be equipped to better engage with development finance dialogue, and other relevant objectives. The concept note should identify the specific topics that the DFA analysis will focus on. These may relate to certain sectoral or thematic priorities, particular types of financing or given geographic areas (e.g. if there is a subnational focus). The objectives section can also note any role that the DFA will play in relation to the government\u2019s international commitments and reporting against them. This will typically include commitments to the 2030 Agenda and Addis Ababa Action Agenda as well as other relevant commitments such as the Istanbul Programme of Action, the Samoa Pathway, or regional commitments, depending on the country context. Oversight team membership A summary of the oversight team will be presented in the concept note, referencing the oversight team TOR where roles and responsibilities are articulated in more detail. This section of the concept note will identify the existing governance structure that will oversee the DFA, and whether this is to be taken on by an existing structure or a new structure is to be created. Individual members of the oversight team should be listed, naming the institutions and the representatives who will participate on their behalf, as well as any specific roles that members of the oversight team will play. This includes specifying the lead or focal point for the DFA overall. It can also be helpful to outline the roles that other team members may play, for example facilitating access to stakeholders, information or data, or reviewing and championing certain aspects of the DFA. This section of the concept note can also specify the role that UNDP or UNCT will play in supporting the oversight team and technical team throughout the DFA process. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 59 Stakeholders The concept note should provide an overview of the key policy processes and stakeholders that will be engaged through the DFA, linking to the engagement plan where the objectives, roles and strategies for engaging them are articulated in more detail. This section of the concept note should provide an overview of the key institutions to be engaged, listing the key government ministries, private, non-governmental and development partner representatives that will participate as well as the institutional structures and platforms that will be consulted \u2013 e.g. working groups on specialist topics relevant to the DFA, and platforms for public\u2013private dialogue. Timelines The concept note should outline an agreed timeline for the DFA process. This will specify key milestones, notably including those that relate to other processes that the DFA will support, as well as expected dates for consultation and validation workshops, any required missions, including number of working days required, and drafts of the DFA report. A high-level overview of the workplan can also be included in the concept note. This will outline the phases that the DFA will follow (for example, using the phasing described in the process module above), with expected timelines for the completion of each phase. A more detailed workplan will be prepared separately. Technical team structure or membership The concept note will provide an overview of the structure and constitution of the technical team. This will outline the areas of specialism that will be required and list any government ministries that will lend staff to the technical team where applicable. It will reference the technical team TOR where roles and responsibilities are articulated in more detail. Funding arrangements The concept note should provide an overview of the budget for the DFA and funding breakdown. It can specify the estimated total cost of the activities required for the DFA and the proportionate split between the actors funding it. Other things that may be included depending on the nature of the DFA The concept note may include a section listing the outputs to be produced during the DFA process.

The concept note may also identify links with other international processes where relevant. For example, some DFAs may be undertaken alongside a MAPS process, or be designed to incorporate inputs into the preparation of an UNDAF or CCA or into regional UNDG processes.

Generic outline for an oversight team terms of reference The terms of reference for the oversight team outline the structure, membership and roles and responsibilities of the oversight team. The oversight team fulfils a critical function, guiding the DFA process overall to ensure its relevance and applicability to the context, and championing the recommendations during and in follow-up to the process. The more active the oversight team and the stronger ownership they feel over the process and recommendations of the DFA, the more likely it is that the DFA will achieve its objectives. It is vital therefore that the roles and responsibilities of members of the oversight team are clear to them from the outset. As such, the inception phase is a key time for discussing, refining and agreeing how the oversight team will function. These details should all be set out in the oversight team TOR. This generic TOR outlines the sections that would typically feature in an oversight team TOR and includes standard text for some sections that can be discussed and adapted as appropriate during the inception phase of a DFA. Role of the oversight team The TOR can provide an overview of the oversight team\u2019s function overall. It can refine and adapt the following standard text. The oversight team listed below will be responsible for leading, guiding and shaping the DFA process. Collaboratively they will determine the scope, focus and objectives of the DFA and oversee the process of analysis and dialogue. The aim overall is to ensure that the DFA process develops a roadmap of recommendations that can be taken forward to address key challenges for financing the SDGs. The oversight team will play a leading role in facilitating and guiding the process and in developing, championing and taking forward these recommendations. Context A short context section will briefly summarize the context in which the DFA originated and identify the institution which initiated the process. It will identify any specific policy processes that the DFA is designed to feed into or support. Objectives A short summary of the objectives (summarized from the full objectives detailed in the DFA TOR) can be included for reference. Institutional setting In many instances, the most appropriate model for an oversight team will be to house it within an existing institutional structure. Common structures include a committee responsible for overseeing a national development plan or for coordinating SDG implementation, or a working group related to a specific thematic or sectoral priority on which the DFA will focus. Where this is the case, the oversight team TOR can specify that the DFA oversight team will be housed within the relevant structure and state how that structure has incorporated the oversight function. For example, it may state that the oversight roles and responsibilities have been incorporated within the relevant committee\u2019s workplan. Membership All institutions that will participate in the oversight team should be listed in the TOR. The TOR can identify the individuals that will represent those institutions, but should specify that any individuals who are not able to take part in the process will be replaced by an alternative member of their institution, to ensure that there is full institutional participation. Membership of the oversight team should be wide enough to include all actors that will be key to the implementation of the roadmap, but narrow enough to allow focused discussions. A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 61 The TOR should specify who will take on the role of Chairperson (Chair). The Chair is the figurehead of the DFA process within government and among external stakeholders. The Chair is seen to lead the process overall and is responsible both for setting the overall objectives and direction of the process,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af7aa51a-49eb-49ec-8a62-58ed2e599d91": {"__data__": {"id_": "af7aa51a-49eb-49ec-8a62-58ed2e599d91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Development Finance Assessment Guidebook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/development-finance-assessment-guidebook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9005c3f94b5969e46270afdd0fad85487be437f29f7521dcd03066f345d6f65a"}}, "hash": "9005c3f94b5969e46270afdd0fad85487be437f29f7521dcd03066f345d6f65a", "text": "and for supervising the work of the oversight team, ensuring it fulfils its role in collectively leading and guiding the DFA. The Chair will also take a lead in securing the buy-in and participation of high-level decision makers and stakeholders across and beyond government. The Chair will typically be someone at the highest official levels within the lead ministry and may in some contexts be someone from the political level, such as a Minister or Deputy Minister. The list below outlines ministries that are commonly engaged as members of the oversight team. It distinguishes between those that are centrally involved in most or all oversight teams and those that may be included depending on the focus of the DFA. These lists are meant to assist thinking about which actors to involve \u2013 they are not prescriptive and should be adapted to the context in question. Core members: common to most DFAs \u2022 Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Finance, Prime Minister or President\u2019s Office (the Chair of the oversight team would typically be from one of these three ministries). \u2022 Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Ministry of Infrastructure \u2022 Private sector representatives, for example, a Chamber of Commerce or Federation of Industry \u2022 UNDP country office or UN country team representative Other representatives that may be included, depending on the focus of the DFA: \u2022 Line ministries and agencies relevant to the focus of the DFA: e.g. Ministries of Health, Education, Agriculture, Environment, Local Governments; Revenue authority, Central Bank \u2022 Parliamentary representatives, for example if there is a committee that plays an important role in overseeing the implementation of the national plan or SDGs \u2022 Development partners, including IFIs and MDBs, particularly in contexts where development assistance is a key part of the finance landscape \u2022 Representatives of civil society, NGOs or faith-based organizations, where these play an important role as service providers within the overall landscape Representatives from each ministry should be senior enough to be able to take decisions and shape recommendations. Often, representatives will be at the highest or second-highest official level within their ministry, for example at the level of Permanent Secretary, Director-General, or equivalent. Responsibilities The oversight team TOR can specify the main activities that the team will undertake, including specific activities to be led by individual members of the team. This may include the following: \u2022 Determine the scope and specific objectives of the DFA, including linkages with wider planned or ongoing reforms \u2022 Oversee and feed into the development of a stakeholder map and engagement strategy \u2022 Provide access to policy documents and data and convene and facilitate outreach to a broad constituency of stakeholders \u2022 Oversee the work of the technical team to provide quality assurance and ensure that it stays within the agreed parameters, with the support of UNDP/UNCT \u2022 Provide oversight and feedback on the analysis as it develops \u2022 Provide inputs and oversight to shape the recommendations in the roadmap \u2022 Facilitate discussions at the consultation and validation workshops and launch, with the support of UNDP/UNCT \u2022 Champion the roadmap among government actors and wider stakeholders \u2022 Implement and oversee the implementation of recommendations in follow-up to the DFA 62 DEVELOPMENT FINANCE ASSESSMENT GUIDEBOOK Annex I. Generic outline for a technical team terms of reference The terms of reference (TOR) for the technical team outline the structure, roles and members of the technical team. The technical team undertakes the analysis of the DFA, using the analytical framework and reporting to the oversight team and UNDP/UNCT. This generic TOR outlines the sections that would typically feature in a technical team TOR and includes standard text for some sections that can be discussed and adapted as appropriate during the inception phase of a DFA. It should be supported by and link to terms of reference for individual members of the technical team. Objectives of the DFA A short summary of the objectives (summarized from the full objectives detailed in the DFA TOR) can be included in the technical team TOR for reference. Focus of the DFA The specific analytical focus of the DFA should be outlined in the technical team TOR. This will be aligned to the corresponding section in the DFA TOR. It will identify the specific topics that the DFA analysis will focus on, for example relating to certain sectoral or thematic priorities, particular types of financing or given geographic areas (e.g. if there is a subnational focus). It should also note any other factors that should be considered in carrying out the analysis.

Skill set The technical team TOR should outline the skill set and areas of expertise that will be required to undertake the DFA analysis. In addition to the general analytical and facilitation skills required for the analysis and dialogue at the core of every DFA, this section should specify any specialist areas of expertise that will be needed to undertake analysis in relation to the focus areas of the DFA. Technical team structure The TOR will specify the organization of functions within the technical team and the profiles of individuals that will fulfil each of these functions. The technical team will typically comprise a team of consultants often including officials from the lead ministry or UNDP/UNCT experts. The technical team will be appointed by the oversight team with the guidance and support of UNDP/UNCT. A DFA lead analyst will be appointed to take overall responsibility for the analysis undertaken within the DFA. Other members of the technical team will report to the lead who will report in turn to the oversight team and UNDP/UNCT, working closely with the focal points from the oversight team and UNDP/UNCT throughout the process. Other analytical roles will be specified as appropriate. In many instances, this will include research assistants or analysts who provide general support across the DFA analysis and/or have specialist areas of expertise aligned to the focus of specific substantive topics within the DFA. These may include specialists in public financial management, private sector development, financing in specific sectoral or thematic areas, or other areas of specialism. In some instances, particularly when the lead analyst is an international consultant, an in-country team member may take responsibility for accessing data and policy materials between missions. The TOR should specify if staff from a national ministry will participate in the technical team and the roles that they will play. Oversight and support for the technical team A government focal point will oversee the day-to-day management of the DFA process, often supported by the UNDP/UNCT focal point. The government focal point reports to the Chairperson of the oversight team and provides guidance, facilitation and logistical support to the technical team, working closely with the lead analyst. The government focal point plays an active role in the inception phase, working with the oversight team and UNDP/UNCT to shape the TORs, the DFA timeline and a stakeholder map and engagement plan. The government focal point, alongside the UNDP/UNCT focal A tool for countries to finance the Sustainable Development Goals 63 point, oversees the work of the technical team, ensuring it remains on track and in line with the objectives and guidance set out by the oversight team overall. They are responsible for coordinating inputs from the oversight team into the DFA process and for facilitating access by the technical team to the stakeholders, information and data necessary for completing the DFA. This will include logistical support with arranging meetings and consultations. They take a lead role in quality assurance on behalf of the oversight team overall, with the support of UNDP/UNCT. The UNDP country office or UN country team will play an active role supporting the oversight team and government focal point in implementing the DFA process, with support and oversight provided by the UNDP regional hub. This will be overseen through a nominated UN focal point, typically with strategic inputs from a Country Director or Resident Representative at a senior level. The UN focal point will support the oversight team and technical team throughout the process, alongside the government focal point. They will often lead the organization of the inception phase and play a key role supporting the establishment of the oversight team. They will work closely with the government focal point to support the oversight team in determining the scope and specific objectives of the DFA, including linkages with CCA, UNDAF and MAPS engagement as well as ongoing initiatives supported by UN Development Systems in country; as well as the creation of a stakeholder map and engagement plan.

Forthcoming. Countries around the world are looking for ways to mobilize public and private investments in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present an ambitious vision for global and country-level progress in sustainable development. Realizing these goals will require a diverse mix of investments that meet the scale, complexity and interconnectedness of this agenda. There is growing recognition of the need for more integrated approaches to financing, where public and private sources of finance contribute to sustainable development according to their specific characteristics. This is a central feature of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), which calls for the SDGs to be implemented through nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks. It has also been the focus of many Development Finance Assessments (DFAs) which respond to demand from policymakers who are looking for new sources of finance and who wish to use their influence, policies and partnerships to promote greater sustainable development impact from existing sources of financing. This report responds to the demand for practical guidance on integrated approaches to financing that have been identified through the DFAs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdeabb5f-5666-49c1-b271-1e75e424e9a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdeabb5f-5666-49c1-b271-1e75e424e9a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca9e64e9e8e33a8a8938326a8d07b4e754cdf03f37a79d3133b95f415681c62b"}, "2": {"node_id": "aca352db-7a46-4921-9285-b44d4bc3b271", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e94e3b4cc4dae9f4f7bd2310a72eb1809d04169c39c62a354486bf89636623a5"}}, "hash": "2de068ecb1e7d9e75dcb0d683d997e47f2fbe96929514a8ec12ab176d007d5bc", "text": "It showcases innovations that countries are making as part of efforts to develop more integrated, holistic approaches to financing the SDGs.

Countries around the world are innovating in these key aspects of integration across public and private financing. The report looks at efforts to strengthen the connection between planning processes and both the budget and private sector policy. It highlights innovations related to different aspects of private finance policy, from improving business regulations and using incentives to promote strategic private investments, to collaborating with the private sector on strategic projects and promoting social impact investment. It also explores efforts to promote better corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, and to build platforms for deeper and more systematic public\u2013private dialogue. The report showcases innovations related to remittances, looking at the use of diaspora bonds and future flow securitization to raise additional development finance resources, as well as efforts to reduce the cost of sending remittances. It also highlights efforts to improve private sector reporting as well as transparency and accountability in relation to cross-cutting priorities, public\u2013private transactions and other aspects of sustainable development. This report is a living repository that will be updated and revised periodically over time. It will incorporate new case studies and respond to emerging priorities as countries continue to develop more integrated approaches to financing the SDGs. This version, version 1.0, is published alongside version 2.0 of the DFA guidebook. The report is structured as follows: \u2022 Chapter 1 discusses why countries would want to take a more integrated approach to financing the SDGs. \u2022 Chapters 2 to 5 look at case studies and key considerations for policymakers in a range of policy areas related to the two areas of integrations outlined above, following the structure of the DFA analytical framework. \u2013 Chapter 2 looks at integrated planning and financing. \u2013 Chapter 3 focuses on public\u2013private collaboration with a particular focus on private sector investment and remittances. \u2013 Chapter 4 focuses on systems for monitoring and review \u2013 Chapter 5 focuses on transparency and accountability \u2022 Each chapter introduces the topic, presents a series of case studies and closes with a brief discussion of some of the key policy considerations that policymakers may want to consider. Version 1.0 3 1 Why an integrated approach to financing the SDGs? 9 United Nations (2015). Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) presents a framework for financing the SDGs at the global level. It calls for a wide range of public and private financing to play a role in funding the investments and services that will be required to achieve the vision of the 2030 Agenda. Efforts to mobilize and invest much of this financing will be led at the national level, and the AAAA states that \u201ccohesive nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of our efforts.\u201d9 This call for integrated national financing frameworks responds to a number of characteristics of the 2030 Agenda that necessitate a more integrated approach to financing: The breadth of the 2030 Agenda The 2030 Agenda aspires to progress in sustainable development in all its dimensions \u2013 economic, social and environmental. The widely varying nature of the goals and targets in different aspects of the agenda will require very different types of investments and services. While some of these investments are suited to or can only be provided by public finance, others can be financed effectively on a commercial basis, within the right policy framework. Achieving the SDGs will therefore require investments from a diverse range of sources of financing according to their specific characteristics and the nature of the investments that need to be made. The ambition of the 2030 Agenda Estimates of the cost of achieving the SDGs, globally and at the country level, far exceed the scale of public finance and development cooperation that is available. Meeting the costs of the investments that are necessary to achieve the SDGs will require mobilizing wider forms of finance.

Progress in one area may enable or accelerate progress in another \u2013 or constrain it in yet another. Addressing these interconnections to exploit the synergies and trade-offs that exist requires an integrated, joined-up approach that builds from the type of financing and investments that will be made. The need to ground the aspirations of the 2030 Agenda within policymaking Much of the success of the 2030 Agenda will be determined by the way it is implemented at the country level. Policies implemented at the country level will drive much of the investment in the agenda. There is a need to create a strong link between aspirations about the progress that is desired and the policies that will mobilize investment in them. This will typically come via a national sustainable development plan or vision and its links to short-term and medium-term policymaking. Integrated national financing frameworks will play a critical role in mobilizing and managing finance at the country level to address these challenges and realize the vision of the 2030 Agenda. These frameworks do not represent the creation of something new, but call for more holistic, comprehensive ways of organizing the policies and institutional structures that governments use to engage with all types of public and private financing. They can help frame government efforts to invest public resources, build partnerships with other actors and influence the scale and nature of private investment. They can help governments develop a strategic framework that draws together policies across this diverse range of financing for a common purpose: advancing the 2030 Agenda. 4 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS There are many aspects to an integrated national financing framework that can fully support a cohesive sustainable development strategy in the way that the AAAA calls for. This report focuses on two important aspects of a more integrated approach to financing that can contribute towards these larger integrated national financing frameworks. Integrated planning and financing is at the foundation of efforts to mobilize the investments that will be needed to realize the 2030 Agenda. Integration between these core functions is critical for setting development aspirations that are in step with the policies designed to realize them, and conversely, to implementing policies that address the financing challenges and opportunities a country faces to mobilize the investments needed to achieve those aspirations. 10 For more on DFAs, including information on completed and ongoing assessments, see http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/ home/ourwork/democratic-governance-and-peacebuilding/ap-def.html Integrated public and private financing responds to the characteristics of the 2030 Agenda outlined above and seeks to establish a more holistic approach to public and private financing. It builds on an understanding of the investments and services that different forms of public and private finance can fund and develops policies and partnerships to mobilize and promote them. These two key \u2018integrations\u2019 are critically supported and enabled by effective monitoring and review processes as well as functioning transparency and accountability mechanisms. They are explored in this report through chapters that correspond to the dimensions of the DFA analytical framework (Figure 1). Box 2. What is a Development Finance Assessment? A Development Finance Assessment (DFA) is a country-level process10 that supports governments and their partners to identify and build consensus for policy reforms that support more integrated public and private financing of the SDGs. The DFA uses a multidisciplinary approach to analyse the financing landscape and the institutional structures and policies by which government manages its approach to public and private financing for the SDGs. It uses an analytical framework that analyses financing trends and considers four aspects of government systems for instigating an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. The DFA process brings together a wide constituency of actors at the national level to propose and build consensus around reforms for more integrated financing of sustainable development. These reforms focus particularly on ways for countries to strengthen the link between planning and financing, strengthen multi- stakeholder participation in financing dialogue, mobilize financing for the SDGs and strengthen finance policy to promote greater SDG impact.

Government\u2019s influence over financing is exerted through a complex network of financing policies, programmes and partnerships. These are managed by a wide spectrum of actors at the national, local and agency level, and through partnerships with other actors. Ensuring that these financing policies complement one another, contribute to national development objectives and effectively incentivize other flows is a significant policy challenge. At its foundation, a key part of this challenge is the alignment between financing policies and the planning system. If the sustainable development aspirations articulated through planning systems are to be realized, they must be cognisant of and supported by financing policies that can mobilize public and private investments and services to deliver them. When planning and financing systems work in harmony with one another, short-term and medium-term policies mobilize and invest the resources needed to realize long-term national development goals (Figure 2). Many countries have increased the capabilities of both their planning and financing systems in recent years. Yet the integration of these systems, particularly in a way that incorporates policies towards achieving all of the public and private resources that will be needed to realize sustainable development objectives, remains a challenge in many contexts. Inherent differences in the nature and outlook of planning and financing systems make such integration difficult. While planning processes are long-term in focus, financing policies are often more incremental in nature. Development plans focus on outcomes while many Figure 2.

Version 1.0 7 financing policies focus on outputs (though there is much innovation in this area, as is explored below). Planning processes may be aspirational in nature while financing policies are often more focused on costs. Many planning and finance policy systems, and the tools utilized within them, have developed independently from one another, without an overarching strategic direction. Processes and tools to bring the systems together may be lacking, or underutilized. For example, national development plans may have been developed without consideration of the resources required to realize the vision they present. The indicators used to design and monitor short-term and medium-term financing policies may not be clearly linked to the outcome indicators used to articulate long-term sustainable development objectives in national plans. And processes to review and align budgets and new policies to national plan objectives may be lacking. Even where strong connections between planning and financing policies do exist, they are often limited to a narrow subset of the financing landscape. This will typically be focused on public finance, sometimes incorporating public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) or development cooperation. Nevertheless many countries have developed innovations that strengthen the integration of government planning and financing functions. The examples below showcase how countries are developing more holistic financing strategies (Bangladesh), strengthening the linkages between the budget and the national plan (Cambodia, Mozambique, the Philippines and Uganda), aligning policies towards private finance to the national plan (Bangladesh, India and Indonesia) and estimating the costs associated with a sustainable development vision (Bangladesh). These represent some of the key steps that policymakers can consider to strengthen the ties between planning and financing policies. Establishing holistic public\u2013private financing strategies There is wide recognition of the need to mobilize public and private investment in the SDGs, according to their specific characteristics. Various forms of financing can 11 The author is indebted to Judith Randel of Development Initiatives for this adage. be used to support investment in different priorities and aspects of the 2030 Agenda. The appropriate mix and scale of public and private financing will look different in every country, depending on the priorities for investment, existing financing trends and the wider context. While all countries strategize, to some degree, about how they will invest their public resources to advance national objectives, an increasing number of countries are developing more holistic approaches that bring together policies towards public and private financing to ensure they are mobilizing the range of investments that will be required to realize the national plan.

It shows how a more holistic public and private financing strategy can be a foundation for stronger coherency and coordination. It can be a key link between the vision of a development plan and the policies that will mobilize the investments necessary to realize that vision, outlining the roles that different forms of financing can play and the priorities that they will be invested in. Bangladesh\u2019s Perspective Plan outlines the roles that a wide range of public and private types of finance can play and this has acted as a foundation for policy in the short- term and medium-term. Policymakers can also consider whether to estimate the costs of the investments and services required to achieve the national development plan as Bangladesh has done. The example shows how such an exercise can provide targets and strategic guidance on which operational financing policies can be based. This matches the logic of realizing a vision at any level: every vision needs a plan, every plan needs a budget, and every budget needs an estimate of costs.11 Estimating costs also creates the opportunity to link forecasting and \u2018backcasting\u2019 estimates that help ensure the feasibility of national plans. With quantified estimates for the cost of achieving a plan, the necessary policy changes and investments can be worked backwards and compared against forecasts of resource flows based on current trends and under various policy scenarios. While estimating the costs of large, complex and interconnected sustainable development plans is no small task, undertaking such an exercise can be worth it if it helps to identify priorities or strengthens the case for reform in priority areas. 8 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS CASE STUDY 1. Bangladesh: Comprehensive, costed financing strategies The Government of Bangladesh has developed a number of policies that support the alignment of planning and financing systems. The national development plan, Vision 2021, is supported by an implementation plan, the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh, that provides strategic guidance about various public and private flows that can be mobilized to realize the objectives articulated in the vision. Bangladesh is also one of the first countries in the world to have estimated the costs of achieving the SDGs. A financing strategy for the national vision The Perspective Plan articulates a strategy for how Vision 2021 can be realized and financed. It outlines the contributions that specific resources can make and identifies strategic actions to be taken to mobilize or enhance the impact of these flows. Remittances, for example, are an important resource flow for Bangladesh and are an area of focus within the Perspective Plan. The Plan assesses the contributions that remittances make to sustainable development, in supporting poverty reduction at the community level and as an important source of foreign exchange at the national level. It presents a range of ongoing initiatives and proposes further strategic actions, such as the use of technology to improve remittance transfers and building skills for potential migrants to meet future demand for labour. In a similar way, the plan highlights specific sectors in which Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is sought, and outcomes such as technology transfer that the government wishes to realize from it. Strategic actions are articulated, for example, to encourage investment in specific industries from specific source countries and further develop vehicles such as joint ventures in order to realize these objectives for attracting FDI. In this way the Perspective Plan provides a framework for the outcomes sought from a wide range of public and private finance types that can guide the design and objectives of operational financing policies. This is an important bridge between Vision 2021 and implementation through Bangladesh\u2019s five-year plans and specific financing policies that tightens the link between planning and financing processes. 12 Planning Commission, Government of Bangladesh (2017). SDGs financing strategy. Available at: http://www.plancomm.gov.bd/ sdgs-financing-strategy-final/ 13 It is based on assumptions about how responsibilities are divided among these actors in each aspect of the SDG agenda. Importantly, the strategy accounts for the interlinkages between different aspects of the agenda. The approach taken looks at SDG 8 in particular, as well as SDGs 7 and 9, on the basis that economic growth is a key driver of development. The model used accounts for overlapping between the costs associated with these three SDGs and attempts to synchronize them. It also relates estimated costs to existing finance flows in order to approximate the level of additional resources that will be needed.

The aim is to help identify key interventions and further develop a roadmap to achieve the goals of Vision 2021 and the SDGs. The exercise uses a methodology that looks at the costs related to each SDG and breaks down these costs into four types of resources \u2013 domestic public, domestic private, international public and international private.13 The strategy estimates overall that Bangladesh will need to mobilize additional costs of more than US$900 billion over the timeline of the SDGs. Annually, this rises from additional costs of US$32 billion a year between 2017 and 2020 to US$100 billion a year between 2026 and 2030. Version 1.0 9 The SDGs financing strategy provides an important link for strengthening the alignment of the planning and financing systems in Bangladesh. Cost estimates are a valuable foundation that can both ground national plans, and present targets for operational financing policies to work towards. They can prompt and help to make implicit choices about prioritization explicit. In this way, they help to bridge the aspirational nature of planning processes and the intervention-based financing processes. These innovations \u2013 the development of a financing strategy for the national vision and estimates of the costs of achieving the SDGs \u2013 have helped strengthen the connection between Bangladesh\u2019s planning and financing systems. This, in turn, has stimulated action to address some of the major priorities. For example, the Perspective Plan and five-year plans identify the significant contributions that will be needed from private sector actors. The five-year plan quantifies this, estimating that over three-quarters of the total volume of financing will need to be mobilized from domestic and international private finance. In order to boost private financing, a platform for public\u2013private dialogue on sustainable development has been established. The platform aims to build trust between leaders in the public and private sectors and create a forum for discussing policy solutions that can unlock greater and more sustainable, inclusive private commercial investment. A new agency, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, was also established for this purpose in 2016.

Effective PFM is critical for advancing national objectives and in most contexts the budget is the largest source of funding for investment designed to explicitly advance national sustainable development objectives.16 It is also critical that public finance is seen to be invested effectively in the national agenda, as it will be difficult for governments to persuade other actors to buy into and invest in a national agenda if it is not being seen to do so effectively itself. There are many aspects to PFM and numerous ways in which its alignment to the national plan can be strengthened. The examples below show how many governments have developed long-term approaches 16 Although private finance investments may be larger in volume in many contexts, they are generally not made explicitly for the purposes of advancing national sustainable development objectives. 17 UNDP (2016).

These experiences highlight the complexity of budgeting systems, the number of iterative reforms that are often implemented to cumulatively strengthen such systems overall, and the types of reforms that can build deeper alignment with national planning. The examples can prompt policymakers considering similar reforms to think about the sequence, time and capacity- building that reforms will require. CASE STUDY 2. The Philippines: Iterative PFM reforms The Government of the Philippines has introduced a series of reforms to PFM since 2007 to strengthen the way public resources are invested in advancing national objectives through the five-year medium-term plan, the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), and the long-term plan, Ambisyon 2040. In 2007, the government introduced a medium-term expenditure framework. This rolling three-year budget allocates financing to programmes which are linked to the government\u2019s strategic priorities. As part of the 2011\u20132016 PDP, the government then introduced a monitoring framework and results matrices as part of a shift towards results-based management.17 This helped to strengthen the link between headline national development objectives and sector and subsector outcomes.18 Building further on these reforms, a Programme Expenditure Classification (PREXC) tool was introduced in 2014.19 Under PREXC, the budgets of all government agencies were restructured so that recurrent activities and projects were grouped together within programmes or key strategies. This restructuring enabled the collation of information on costs and performance at the programme or strategy level, as opposed to the organizational level as had been the case previously. It enabled better management over budgets by agencies themselves, and gave more depth to oversight from the highest levels of government, as well as by Congress and non-state actors. Overall, it helped to strengthen the link between planning and budgeting by bringing a greater degree of clarity about the contributions that Version 1.0 11 individual programmes and strategies within each agency are making. When PREXC was established, it was set up so that the objectives and performance indicators for each programme within an agency were linked to the objectives and mandate of the agency overall. Agency objectives and mandates were in turn themselves linked to national development objectives. For the 2018 budget however, this link between programme objectives and outcomes has been made more direct. As part of the budget preparation process, government agencies have been recommended to link proposed programmes to the outcome indicators of the PDP results matrices, as well as to the SDG indicators.20 In this way, the government of the Philippines cumulatively strengthened its systems for managing public finance in relation to national sustainable development objectives. The stronger and more granular integration of planning and budgeting systems has allowed greater control and responsiveness in how public resources are invested in the outcomes of the country\u2019s national plan. CASE STUDY 3. Mozambique: A 15-year vision for public finance In Mozambique, the government has developed a series of long-term, medium-term and short-term instruments to guide improvements in public finance management and strengthen the way public finance is used in line with national sustainable development objectives. A 15-year public finance vision (2011\u20132025) outlines 6 strategic objectives for improving public finance management. These include modernizing the budgeting system by reorganizing it around programmes and results; improving administration of state assets and public debt, as well as the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs); strengthening financial accounting and statistical information across public institutions; and modernizing human resources. This vision aims to increase revenue in order to reduce both the deficit and reliance on development cooperation. It also aims to adjust the allocation of resources in line with the country\u2019s National Development Strategy. The 15-year vision for public finance is operationalized through a series of medium-term strategic plans for public finance (SPPFs) which are closely connected with medium-term planning instruments. The design foresees that the formulation of every SPPF 2016\u20132019 includes a detailed review of the implementation of the vision during the previous one. The review included in the current SPPF 2016\u20132019 for the first interim period of the implementation of the vision provided valuable lessons to guide the design of the actions, indicators and targets to be developed within the PFM system by the end of 2019 in a way that is consistent with the long-term goals. This vision and strategic plans for public finance are unifying instruments within the Ministry of Economy and Finance since they summarize all existing plans and programmes in the PFM area of the Ministry and its subordinated institutions. They help to strengthen public financial management in the country and build stronger connections between government spending and the longer-term vision for sustainable development. 20 UNDP (2017).

It forms part of wider efforts to integrate functions for planning, public finance management, policy and oversight led by the Sustainable Development Goals Specialized Technical Committee. The government has adapted its existing budgetary system to allow the tracking of expenditure and monitoring of outcomes related to each SDG target. Mexico has a programmatic budget where allocations are made to programmes which are grouped together according to a common purpose (as opposed to who will be spending the funds). To develop this system for the SDGs, the government first identified the links between the SDGs and its medium-term National Development Plan, around which budget allocations are structured.24 Ministries then mapped the programmes they are responsible for against individual SDG targets, distinguishing between direct and indirect contributions. This allows budget allocations to be tracked against the SDGs. The government uses a matrix of indicators for results to monitor the outcomes of programmes against their contributions to the National Development Plan. The SDG mapping therefore also creates the potential to monitor the contributions that public spending makes towards each SDG. The creation of this system has helped the government to build a clearer picture of how its resources are being invested against the long-term SDG framework, and to understand the coverage of the SDGs in its budgetary programmes.25 It will support more accurate monitoring of budget decisions against the SDGs by government as well as non-state actors.

Various flows and instruments can contribute to sustainable development in different ways according to their specific characteristics. The policies designed to engage with these resources can have a powerful influence over how this happens in practice, and a more aligned, coherent framework of financing policies will be more effective in mobilizing the required resources. Governments are increasingly realizing the need to strengthen the connection between their public and private financing policies and the objectives of the national plan.

CASE STUDY 6. Indonesia: Integrated strategy for infrastructure financing The Government of Indonesia is implementing an integrated approach to financing its infrastructure strategy. The starting point was the bold decision of the government to gradually eliminate fuel subsidies and use the fiscal space created (estimated at US$16 billion) to leverage investments to address a large infrastructure gap that was a constraint to higher growth. An ambitious Infrastructure Sector Development Plan (RPJPN) was developed for FY2015\u20132019, proposing investments totalling an estimated IDR 2,216 trillion (approximately US$187 billion) focused on national competitiveness and key SDGs. The central government is expecting to invest only about 40 percent of the total costs planned in the RPJPN. The strategy aims to mobilize a range of public and private sources of finance including private investment from national and foreign firms. A series of reforms has been undertaken to mobilize these funds. \u2022 Public investment management: To address the challenge of historic underspending on the infrastructure budget, the strategy proposed a wide array of institutional reforms and measures to improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure public spending to ensure implementation results. One of the key institutional reforms was the transfer of the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) from the supervision of the coordinating economic minister to direct presidential control. \u2022 PPP development: A key element of the strategy is the expansion of PPPs to leverage private investment, including community, private sector, and bilateral and multilateral institution financing. A new Directorate of PPP Development was created under Bappenas and received support from several development partners. 14 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS \u2022 Access to finance for Indonesian firms: In order to facilitate greater participation of national firms in the RPJPN, the government transformed the state-owned financing firm PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (SMI) into an infrastructure bank and implemented a six-fold increase in its capital, to $2.05 billion. This move turned the SMI into an institution with sovereign status, making it eligible for loans from multinational banks. Reforms also included a substantial increase of the capital of state-owned PT Bank Mandiri Tbk, Indonesia\u2019s biggest bank, to improve the lender\u2019s capacity for infrastructure financing. The strategy also focused on access to finance for local SMEs to allow them to participate in small-scale PPPs for infrastructure development. \u2022 Integrated PPP-FDI promotion: Several reforms were implemented to stimulate FDI participation in PPPs. These included increasing the limit on foreign ownership in certain sectors, deregulation packages for the main investment sectors, a one-stop integrated services centre and an online permit application system in the Investment Coordinating Board-BKPM. A selected portfolio of large-scale PPPs was also prepared to promote FDI.28 The strategy was born and directly coordinated and monitored by the President\u2019s Office and achieved radical improvements to investment plans which include the possibility of combining private and public finance. CASE STUDY 7. Solomon Islands: Community service obligations for state-owned enterprises29 As part of a state-owned enterprise reform programme that began in 2007, Solomon Islands introduced community service obligations contracting for its SOEs. This mechanism is designed to incentivize the provision of services by SOEs on non-commercial access to communities that would otherwise not have access to them. Payments under a community service obligation contract are triggered after a service has been delivered, as opposed to being provided upfront as would be under a budget arrangement. The aim is to increase access to key services provided by SOEs while ensuring efficiency and financial sustainability.30 The first community service obligations were established with the electricity authority and broadcasting corporation, but they have spread to a range of other SOEs. This innovation has helped to broaden access to key services such as electricity, water, transportation and communication and helps to advance the objectives of the country\u2019s National Development Strategy in these areas. There have been some challenges in the deployment of these contracts \u2013 their usage has fluctuated year-on-year \u2013 in part because of wider issues at play in the relationship between the central government and SOEs. Nevertheless, they have made important contributions and there are plans to scale up their use in the future", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9494e77a-2264-481a-9f60-329d50308f51": {"__data__": {"id_": "9494e77a-2264-481a-9f60-329d50308f51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adbc6ffe2b52155b327bfc65bdd2d89b0a329cd24bd704cac0443843725db0b5"}}, "hash": "adbc6ffe2b52155b327bfc65bdd2d89b0a329cd24bd704cac0443843725db0b5", "text": "\u2013 the government anticipated signing agreements with six SOEs in 2018.31 The model has also been recognized as a particularly successful approach within the wider region32 and there is the potential for it to catalyse the wider use of outcome-based contracting by government.33 28 This included Jakarta\u2019s Coastal Development, Jakarta\u2019s Mass Rapid Transportation (MRT), Sunda Strait Bridge, and other key infrastructure such as the addition of 35,000 MW to the nation\u2019s power capacity, 1,000 km of toll roads, 3,258 km of railway, 15 new airports and 24 new ports. 29 This case study is taken from the Solomon Islands Development Finance Assessment. 30 ADB (2016).

India: Reforming structures for more holistic planning India has recently implemented a significant restructuring of its planning system in order to modernize it and establish planning functions appropriate for a market-driven economy in which the private sector is a key driver of growth. In 2015, the Planning Commission, which had been responsible for the country\u2019s five-year plans, was replaced by NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India). Previously the planning system had been structured around five-year plans that guided the national development strategy with a primary focus on public finance. In place of five-year plans, NITI Aayog will guide government policy through vision, strategy and action agenda documents. Long-term development is to be guided by a Vision 2031/32 that is linked to the SDGs.34 A seven- year strategy will link long-term aspirations to medium-term policies and a three-year action agenda will outline specific policy measures. The Action Agenda aims to strengthen links between future priorities as outlined in the vision and government spending and policy. The first iteration of the Action Agenda, covering 2017/18 to 2019/20, starts to build a more holistic approach to financing development plans. It proposes reductions in non-developmental expenditure and a significant increase in public capital investment. It also proposes a number of reforms designed to reignite the use of public\u2013private partnerships as a tool for mobilizing private finance, particularly in the infrastructure sector (see Case study 14), and outlines actions related to a range of other finance flows at an aggregate level and within specific priority areas. With these changes to the planning system, the government of India is aiming to develop a longer-term vision for sustainable development and build structures that link it to a range of finance policies that go beyond public spending alone. 34 This was under development at the time of writing. 16 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS CASE STUDY 9. Bhutan: Policy screening tool The primary objective of development in Bhutan is to increase \u201cGross National Happiness\u201d. A Gross National Happiness Index was designed between 2008 and 2010, comprising 9 domains,35 33 indicators and 124 variables.36 The index forms the basis for designing and monitoring progress in the implementation of policies covering a range of areas, including many aspects of financing. The government has developed a policy screening tool that helps ensure the effective contribution of new policies towards Gross National Happiness.37 As new policies are developed, they are assessed against 22 variables that draw from the Gross National Happiness Index. The screening assesses the likely impacts of the policy against each of these variables on a four-point scale38 and policies must achieve an overall score that shows the policy is at least neutral across the 22 indicators overall.39 Screening is done in a joint exercise between the responsible ministry and a Gross National Happiness Secretariat that involves representatives from a range of professions and fields, to ensure the review takes in a wide range of perspectives on the policy. While the screening tool is not exclusively used to align financing policies, they are subject to the process alongside other policies. For example, access to finance and incentives is a key part of the cottage, small and medium industry (CSMI) policy. This is a key policy area for the country as 98 percent of firms in Bhutan fall into the CSMI category.40 The policy aims to expand credit to CSMIs through measures such as expanding access to bank finance by increasing the use of alternative credit appraisal approaches, and by expanding credit guarantee schemes. A number of financing strategies within the policy link to specific elements of the Gross National Happiness Index, for example prioritizing green and sustainable industries for incentives", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1df0fda-cc1a-4649-b3e6-5e2b7e651560": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1df0fda-cc1a-4649-b3e6-5e2b7e651560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38d20d053a940757b33f0134d23f40237a4abf822287b46948f1c7c2d1dfd5cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "47d58368-bebf-4224-a7d8-e6e088a1577b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7b81ac4a3394a70475e4aba4f9507cc2ba580d2e0c365f3e60474d5a2bdc51b"}}, "hash": "c6940f079715dbe701ba6c7db11a51fec13bc68fe70a7c4051c529a4cc4585f2", "text": "and emphasizing a focus on gender equality and rural poverty reduction in microfinance. The 2016 public\u2013private partnership (PPP) policy sets out a framework for mobilizing private sector participation in the delivery of goods and services. It also draws strong links with the Gross National Happiness Index and in addition to screening of the policy itself it establishes oversight mechanisms that tie PPP projects to Gross National Happiness objectives. The Gross National Happiness Commission plays a key role in the project approval process and in monitoring their delivery in relation to development priorities. In this way, the government has established a mechanism that helps to objectively tie the design of financing and other policies to the overriding objectives of the national development plan.

Strong connections between the aspirations of a national plan and the policies designed to invest and mobilize the investments to realize those aspirations is key to effective implementation. Ensuring that these links extend to policy towards all forms of financing is important for mobilizing the range of public and private resources that will be needed in all contexts to realize the SDGs. The examples above highlight innovations in a number of different ways that countries are strengthening the connection between planning and financing which policymakers facing similar challenges may wish to consider. In Bangladesh, the SDGs financing strategy and Perspective Plan represent significant steps towards a more holistic financing strategy. These policies are helping ground the country\u2019s development aspirations by identifying the kinds and scale of public and private investments that will be needed to realize them. These are complex exercises, in the case of Bangladesh, involving a significant costing exercise, that bring together reforms and policy across a range of financing challenges. Yet they can help government to prioritize and focus efforts in the areas that are most important for advancing the national plan. They can also provide tangible estimates for short-term and medium-term policies in different areas of financing to work towards. Many countries have taken steps to better align their budget with their national plan. The examples explored above show how this can lead to more effective use of public finance. This is critical \u2013 public resources are often the largest source of funds for direct investment in the national plan. The commitment and efficiency that government shows for investing its resources in the national plan will present a strong signal that can encourage or discourage others to buy into it too. The examples also show the complexity of reforms in this area as well as the number of cumulative steps that can be taken to enhance alignment over extended periods of time. Ongoing reforms in the Philippines began in 2007 and Mozambique and Cambodia have respectively developed 15-year and 20-year PFM reform strategies. Achieving the SDGs will require investments from a range of actors beyond the government, and government will be most effective in mobilizing these investments if its policies towards those types of financing have a strong grounding in the national plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47d58368-bebf-4224-a7d8-e6e088a1577b": {"__data__": {"id_": "47d58368-bebf-4224-a7d8-e6e088a1577b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38d20d053a940757b33f0134d23f40237a4abf822287b46948f1c7c2d1dfd5cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1df0fda-cc1a-4649-b3e6-5e2b7e651560", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6940f079715dbe701ba6c7db11a51fec13bc68fe70a7c4051c529a4cc4585f2"}}, "hash": "a7b81ac4a3394a70475e4aba4f9507cc2ba580d2e0c365f3e60474d5a2bdc51b", "text": "The examples discussed above show a range of steps that countries are taking to align wider financing policies to the national plan, from building integrated public and private finance strategies around specific priorities, to creating stronger", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "695dd7b9-d250-43cf-a017-af53c0c4e8be": {"__data__": {"id_": "695dd7b9-d250-43cf-a017-af53c0c4e8be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a22954780bcc554b75112e776f582614a3cbe53a1fccb19e83b5104fd773ce9"}}, "hash": "1a22954780bcc554b75112e776f582614a3cbe53a1fccb19e83b5104fd773ce9", "text": "incentives for SOEs to invest in the national plan, reorienting planning structures and strengthening policy development and review processes. Assessing the integration of planning and financing functions is a core part of the DFA and many assessments will identify ways in which linkages between them can be deepened and strengthened. Supporting innovations in these areas is a common part of the follow-up to many Development Finance Assessments. In Solomon Islands, for example, the DFA has supported the creation of a Solomon Islands Integrated Financing Framework. It will be used by the committee that oversees the country\u2019s national development strategy to manage reforms related to public and private financing being undertaken across government and with partners. In Samoa, the DFA has led to tailored support for the consolidation of planning and budgeting systems as well as capacity- building for staff in the Ministry of Finance. In Mongolia, recommendations from the DFA have supported the development of SDG criteria to inform the allocation of the health sector budget in a pilot before a potential wider rollout across other sector budgets. It has also fed into the formulation of implementation guidelines under Mongolia\u2019s Law on Development Planning and Policy. 18 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS 3 Public\u2013private collaboration Achieving the SDGs will require a diverse range of public and private investments, as the varying nature of different aspects of the 2030 Agenda demands diverse investments and services. Many of these can be financed by private actors, whether commercially or social enterprises, NGOs or other private actors. Private actors control significant volumes of resources that have the potential to help meet the gap between the costs of the SDGs and the public finance available. Mobilizing private finance that contributes towards the 2030 Agenda requires policies that promote and are conducive to sustainable, inclusive development of the private sector and participation of non-state actors. Dialogue between government and the private sector, as well as active partnerships on strategic projects, are also key parts of efforts to promote private investment that contributes positively to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the 2030 Agenda. The examples in this chapter look at how countries are innovating to enhance public\u2013private collaboration and promote greater impact from private finance on SDG outcomes. The chapter looks in particular at two aspects of private finance: private sector investment and remittances. These represent two of the largest private flows and are areas that policymakers in many contexts are grappling with. Public reforms to mobilize private investment Private investment can be a key driver of progress in many aspects of the 2030 Agenda. Policymakers are keen to mobilize greater volumes of private sector investment and to enhance the contributions that the private sector at large can make towards sustainable development. Private sector investment is a key driver of economic growth and is important for job creation, technological innovation and skills development. It has an important direct and indirect influence over a range of social and environmental outcomes. Policymakers are looking for ways to create a business environment and opportunities that are attractive to businesses, and which encourage better private sector management of social and environmental outcomes. This is a multifaceted area of policy as there are many components of a business environment that can encourage or constrain the kind of investment that countries desire. This section looks at some of the key challenges of policymaking around private sector investment highlighted by DFAs. It considers efforts to improve business regulations and to offer financial or fiscal incentives for sustainable, inclusive investment. It looks at collaboration between governments and private sector actors on specific projects through PPPs and other instruments, as well as initiatives to promote social impact investment, a small but growing proportion of the private sector that balances financial and other considerations for investing. It looks at efforts to enhance corporate governance and to promote corporate social responsibility. Finally it looks at efforts to enhance public\u2013 private dialogue which can strengthen and enhance efforts across all areas. Improving business regulations Implementing business regulations that make it easy to do business while promoting sustainable development impact is key to realizing the potential of private investment to contribute towards the SDGs. With an emphasis on the three dimensions of the 2030 Agenda, it is important for countries to consider how to develop regulations that do not solely promote economic gain, but consider how to promote social and environmental outcomes. A wide range of regulations, managed and enforced by a spectrum of actors across government, affect the setup and ongoing operations of all businesses.

CASE STUDY 10. Rwanda: Improving business regulations to attract FDI Strengthening regulations to make it easier to do business is a key part of developing a business environment that promotes sustainable, inclusive investment. Regulatory reform can be a powerful signal to investors, particularly when a country shows sustained commitment and progress over time in key international indices such as the Doing Business rankings. Rwanda has implemented a significant number of reforms over recent years as part of a sustained effort to attract new and growing investment. In 2000, the country introduced its Vision 2020 document, which sets the ambitions for national development for the following two decades. The overarching objectives of Vision 2020 are to attain per capita income of a middle-income country in an equitable way and to become a modern, strong and united nation without discrimination between its citizens. Vision 2020 is structured around six pillars and three cross-cutting themes that are designed to advance the long-term transitions necessary to achieve these objectives. Private sector-led development is one of the six pillars. Vision 2020 aims to develop the formal and informal sectors with a focus on job creation, particularly outside the agriculture sector. The country aims to create around 150,000 off-farm jobs a year. Private sector-led development has been prioritized by the highest levels of government. In 2008, the government created the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to oversee efforts to improve regulation and the wider business environment. Its creation involved the merger of eight institutions with responsibility across a wide range of areas, including investment promotion, support for SMEs, IT and others.44 A Doing Business Steering Committee was created at the Cabinet level to coordinate reforms across different ministries.45 A technical task force comprising six working groups was created to report to the Steering Committee. These working groups focus on key areas of regulation \u2013 business entry, licensing reform, legislative changes, taxes and trade logistics, construction permits and property registration. Critically, they include private sector representatives who can both share their experiences and opinions to help shape the design of new reforms, and will engender greater buy-in to the reform process from the business community. A Doing Business Unit was also established to drive forward implementation of reforms. This unit links the working groups with the steering committee and identifies opportunities for reform that the task force can develop. It coordinates 20 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS with development partners to promote targeted technical suppor and other efforts to improve the business environment. And it monitors the implementation of reforms and reports to the steering committee.46 These structures have enabled Rwanda to develop and implement a wide range of reforms, including the establishment of a one-stop centre for investors, streamlined and simplified processes for permits and property registration, reforms to customs including the implementation of risk-based inspections and the provision of post-investment support through the Rwanda Development Board.47 The country has rapidly climbed up the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business rankings, something that the task force specifically targeted. By 2012, the number of procedures required to start a business was cut from 9 to 2 and the time required was cut from 18 days to 3. The time required to register property was cut from 371 days in 2004 to 25 in 2012,48 and the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfa4f654-7c04-4f16-b56d-dd7bf5e59e56": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfa4f654-7c04-4f16-b56d-dd7bf5e59e56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53e6a7c7eead6b953f55a10a87bf5effd4cb8d595e01d352c4b1d00d88c62e92"}, "3": {"node_id": "6757dacb-74aa-4c33-b603-af80f781bec7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8fc203b49cd44679b55a472b5a3b7bb83cbd9e8f5010f7bfa9faac55660ce66"}}, "hash": "bd4f83fa863ee095b06bd047e0bc39b24248b0e0c8f18d10855ce3777f37bbcf", "text": "country ranks second in the world in this aspect of the global Doing Business rankings.49 Overall the country rose from 143rd in the 2008 Doing Business rankings to 41st in 2018.

Investment incentives can be attractive for governments as they offer a way to promote specific strategic types of investment, and can also be more straightforward to establish and operate than more structural reforms in regulation and other areas. Incentives come in two broad types: financial incentives offer a payment or financial contribution when certain criteria are met while fiscal incentives reduce the tax burden that a company faces. As the examples below show, incentives can be an important part of a private sector development strategy and are commonly used to promote different types of strategic investment \u2013 for example in priority industries, specific geographic regions, or particular types of business. Incentives will be most effective, and generate more sustainable results, if they are deployed within the context of a strong business environment rather than as compensation for an environment in which it is difficult Version 1.0 21 to do business.53 Research by the World Bank has found that using incentives to halve companies\u2019 effective tax rate raises FDI by 8 percent of GDP in countries with a stronger investment climate, compared to 1 percent of GDP in those where the investment climate is less attractive.54 Incentives will also be most effective when they are effectively targeted and when they are temporary. The more incentives are targeted at promoting strategic investments that catalyse a country\u2019s intended specific outcomes, the more effective they will be. There may be opportunities in some contexts to move towards outcome-based incentives, particularly with improvements in private sector reporting and monitoring (see Box 3, as well as Chapter 4 on monitoring and review). It is also important for the timeline and nature of future support from public finance to be clear and limited, in order to create businesses and industries that are fully commercially viable and sustainable in their own right, without being reliant on public subsidies. Policymakers should carefully consider the types of incentives to be offered. Incentive schemes can be very expensive55 and there are many examples of countries struggling to remove costly incentive programmes 53 IISD (2014). Rethinking investment incentives. 54 The comparison is between countries in the top and bottom half when ranked by the quality of their investment climate. James, S. (2010).

Profit-based incentives can also attract more mobile investments and may favour the most profitable businesses, which are also those that need least assistance from government.56 However cost- based incentives are more administratively demanding and therefore require stronger capacity to establish and manage. While the examples below show how investment incentives can be used to actively promote strategic investments, in many instances they are deployed responsively, to keep up with the competition. Regional cooperation is necessary to address these challenges. 22 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS CASE STUDY 11. South Africa: Promoting priority industries with financial incentives Financial incentives involve a payment from government to a private business once a certain set of criteria have been established. These criteria are typically designed to promote investments that can catalyse progress towards national objectives, or to promote investments that incorporate certain strategic considerations. South Africa offers a series of grant incentives have been designed to stimulate private investment in key industries. These are managed through the industrial policy action plan (IPAP)57 which links to the long-term National Development Plan 2030. It offers grants in five targeted industries,58 one of which is the film incentive, which offers three distinct grants for film and TV productions.59 The aim of the film incentive is to create jobs, develop skills and a technical knowledge base, and attract foreign exchange by promoting South Africa as an attractive destination for international filmmaking and stimulating growth in the local industry. These objectives link to the long-term aims of the national development plan, which addresses core challenges including low employment and the need for skills development.60 The film incentive was established in 2004 and has expanded over time. It is a grant paid at key milestones to applicants whose projects meet certain conditions, including minimum spending levels and broad-based black economic empowerment criteria. Since 2011/12, it has paid out over R2.1 billion in support of 574 productions that spent over R13 billion.61 The incentive scheme has helped to stimulate private investment in the industry. There has been an increase in production in the country and industry experts note that the incentives are one factor which has made South Africa an attractive destination for international productions in a competitive market.62 However, its competitiveness depends on a wider range of factors; incentives have helped the country build on its natural advantages63 and favourable business climate to gain a competitive edge. And while the scheme has been successful in attracting major productions, it has been less successful in supporting smaller productions.64 In relation to contributions towards key national development objectives, the incentive scheme is estimated to have supported the creation of around 5,700 direct full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs a year over 2009\u20132011 as well as a further 10,000 indirect FTE jobs.65 There is evidence of skills development and knowledge spillover from foreign productions. However, it has struggled to promote repeated investments over time. Promoting the participation of disadvantaged communities in the industry has also been challenging;66 and led to the creation of a dedicated emerging black filmmakers incentive. 57 Department of Trade and Industry South Africa, Industrial Policy Action Plan 2018/19 \u2013 2020/21. 58 The others are aquaculture, critical infrastructure, business process services and the automotive industry. 59 These are the foreign film and TV production and post-production incentive; the South African film and TV production and co-production incentive; and the South African emerging black filmmakers incentive. 60 National Planning Commission, National Development Plan 2030: Our future \u2013 make it work. 61 Department of Trade and Industry South Africa, Industrial Policy Action Plan 2018/19 \u2013 2020/21. 62 Collins, A. and Snowball, J., Economic Research Southern Africa (2013).

The rationale behind the use of incentives is that, by providing a payment or service, or forgoing revenue that would otherwise be collected, government can influence private actors to make strategically important investments that can catalyse larger returns or impact on key national objectives in the long term. Often, governments use incentives as part of a strategy in areas such as growing new industries or providing jobs in deprived regions. Most incentives are structured to indirectly promote strategic objectives. For example, if the policy objective is to stimulate growth in a new industry, an incentive may be provided to support an investment in that industry, regardless of whether the investment contributes to growth. If the policy objective is job creation in a deprived area, an incentive may be provided for locating an industry in that area. These are input-based or output-based incentives, where the support is provided for the outputs that firms make. 24 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS With improvements in outcome monitoring, there may be potential in many contexts to focus incentives more directly on the outcomes that governments are ultimately targeting.

The international nature of such competition demands an international response and countries in some regions are cooperating to address the issue.74 The EU has established a code of conduct for business taxation that both recognizes the benefits of tax competition and establishes a framework for removing harmful practices.75 The criteria for potentially harmful tax competition measures include: effective levels of taxation which are significantly lower", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08d1170d-14f5-4b0f-82c4-cc2d6a0d710e": {"__data__": {"id_": "08d1170d-14f5-4b0f-82c4-cc2d6a0d710e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76e21cd9ac38687209e9f40e91947ad21c5e6605ea52f6b5322448bc81434c57"}}, "hash": "76e21cd9ac38687209e9f40e91947ad21c5e6605ea52f6b5322448bc81434c57", "text": "than the general level in the country concerned; tax benefits reserved for non-residents; tax incentives for activities which are isolated from the domestic economy and therefore have no impact on the national tax base; granting of tax advantages even in the absence of any real economic activity; the basis of profit determination for companies in a multinational group departing from internationally accepted rules, in particular those approved by the OECD; and lack of transparency. More recently, the East African Community has developed a draft code of conduct against harmful tax competition that will freeze the current provision of harmful tax incentives so new ones are not introduced. The ASEAN bloc is also in the process of developing a regional approach to addressing this challenge.76 Collaborating with the private sector on strategic projects Alongside efforts to promote private investment in general or in strategic priorities, governments in many contexts promote investment in specific strategic projects. Various instruments can be deployed in order to mobilize private investment in projects, often to meet financing gaps in areas such as the provision of public infrastructure. These instruments can include various types of public\u2013private partnership, models of blended finance as well as guarantees and other innovative mechanisms. This section does not go through examples in all of these modalities, but explores a small selection of case studies to highlight some key considerations for Version 1.0 25 policymakers. It looks at PPPs in particular, reviewing the ups and downs of PPPs in India, as well as the experience and lessons from a controversial PPP initiative in Lesotho. These experiences highlight both the potential, the complexity and the risks of PPPs, with lessons that may be applicable to other similar instruments, such as guarantees or blended finance mechanisms. The potential of these mechanisms is clear, highlighted by the scale of private investment mobilized by India at the peak of the PPP programme. Yet the level of investment declined as challenges managing and delivering such a complex, multifaceted programme grew. The experience of Lesotho will further highlight many of the risks associated with PPPs as well as considerations for other countries, particularly those with limited oversight capacity or limited data in the area in which 77 NITI Aayog (2017).

It shows the challenge of negotiating a contract that fairly balances responsibilities and risks between actors, particularly where one side has stronger negotiating capacity, as well as the difficulty of determining demand and cost scenarios when there are little data on which to base projections. It can also prompt consideration of the capacity needed to manage such instruments \u2013 PPPs do not eliminate the need for active government involvement in service delivery, but demand a different set of functions and skills to oversee it. The section also explores an innovative \u2018works for taxes\u2019 approach developed in Peru that showcases an alternative model for mobilizing private finance. This approach has inspired the recent creation of a similar scheme in Colombia and may be attractive to policymakers in a range of other contexts. CASE STUDY 14. India: Revitalizing its PPP programme Public\u2013Private Partnerships have been an important tool for mobilizing investment in infrastructure in India. The country is in the process of revitalizing its PPP programme as part of a restructured approach to planning (see Chapter 2 on integrated planning and financing above).77 During the 1990s and early 2000s, India used PPPs to finance key projects, before the use of the instrument was rapidly scaled up from 2004 to 2011. This phase of PPP use saw a significant increase in private participation in infrastructure investments. During the 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012), private contributions exceeded expectations, accounting for some 36.6 percent of total infrastructure investment. This helped to increase investment in infrastructure from 5 percent to 7 percent of GDP.78 At its peak in 2011, India accounted for almost half of private participation in infrastructure projects in all developing countries combined.79 There were a range of factors behind the rapid increase in PPP use over 2004 to 2011. Political drive at the highest levels meant that PPPs were high on the government\u2019s agenda and a Committee on Infrastructure chaired by the Prime Minister was established to ensure engagement and coordination across government. Various appraisal and approval processes were simplified and initiatives, such the Viability Gap Funding Scheme, India Infrastructure Project Development Fund and India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, as well as sector-focused initiatives,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5be861f1-b3ac-4028-8857-f272831672b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "5be861f1-b3ac-4028-8857-f272831672b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ccdf4e5ed9dd1e4252f895ca3bb6be5d83dde72407b206550cb0d450993c2be"}}, "hash": "0ccdf4e5ed9dd1e4252f895ca3bb6be5d83dde72407b206550cb0d450993c2be", "text": "were created to address various challenges and obstacles in different aspects of the PPP process. 26 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS Since the peak in 2011, there has been a slowdown in the use of PPPs. This has been driven by a range of factors including public sector issues such as delays in aspects of the PPP process related to land acquisition or utilities, and private sector issues such as a rise in non-performing assets and, relatedly, common challenges with inadequate due diligence.80 Investment was also affected by global economic trends. India plans to revitalize the use of PPPs for infrastructure as a key tool in its economic transformation strategy. The country\u2019s three-year action agenda highlights PPPs as a key instrument alongside other sources of funding such as equity markets and debt financing. It calls for a rapid rescaling up of PPPs in sectors such as highways, power, ports and airports across Central and State governments. To achieve this, the government is planning and implementing a range of initiatives. This includes enhancing coordination across ministries with a process for unblocking stalled projects. Systems for monitoring and dispute resolution will be strengthened as will processes to mitigate the challenges of aggressive bidding. A number of steps will also be taken to address the constraints in the financial capacity of domestic lenders, including creating incentives for them to take on debt with longer maturity periods that better match infrastructure project timelines and reorienting the focus of the India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd. A national investment infrastructure fund will be operationalized and a range of new sector-specific initiatives will be launched.81 CASE STUDY 15. Lesotho: A controversial health PPP While the example from India shows a large PPP programme, Lesotho\u2019s experience with its health PPP highlights some of the challenges with individual PPPs, and issues that smaller countries without the need or capacity to implement a full programme of PPPs may face. In 2005, the government established a PPP initiative to replace a hospital and build and upgrade four primary care clinics. Lesotho faces formidable challenges in health. It has the second highest prevalence of HIV in the world and the highest of tuberculosis. Nearly one in nine children die before their fifth birthday.82 The PPP was the first of its kind in Africa and was structured with the support of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). A private partner would build and operate the facilities under an 18-year contract before they were transferred back to the government. Over the life of the contract, the government will pay a lump sum to the private partner for treatment up to a fixed number of patients, to be supplemented by additional payments if excess numbers were treated above the maximum. The World Bank also provided a bridging grant upfront to support the initial design and operation of the clinics. Following the signing of the contract in 2008, the primary care clinics opened in 2010 and the new hospital and field clinic in 2011. The facilities have contributed to significant improvements in health outcomes. A study in 2012 found death rates had fallen significantly, patient numbers had increased and there were significant improvements in indicators related to issues such as waiting times, equipment quality and cleanliness. Yet the PPP has become a highly controversial issue due to escalating costs. There is disagreement about the exact extent and implication of these rising costs, but it is clear the government has had to spend more than anticipated and that this has diverted funds from elsewhere. There are a range of reasons for the rising costs. 80 World Bank (2017). PPPs in India \u2013 will they regain their former glory?

Version 1.0 27 Patient numbers have been much higher than anticipated, due to higher overall demand than predicted as well as diversion of patients from other facilities. Contractual ambiguities in how certain aspects of health care, such as referrals for treatment in South Africa and the provision of \u2018variation orders,\u2019 would be approved between the government and private partner, have also contributed,83 as have interest and late payment charges.84 These and other factors have led to overpayments from government and have also caused disputes between the public and private partners to the contract. The experience in Lesotho highlights a range of challenges that can be faced in establishing and managing a PPP programme, from the difficulty of balancing risks between parties and predicting demand and costs to the kinds of capacity required to negotiate a robust contract and oversee its delivery.

The scheme was established in 2008 and allows private companies to \u2018pay\u2019 tax in advance by delivering public works projects. The innovation arose within a context of booming revenues, driven largely by rising commodity prices, but low budget execution rates, due to insufficient public sector capacity to deliver public works, particularly at the regional and local government level. There were tensions between local communities, who witnessed the boom in commodities but saw little improvement in public infrastructure and services, and the extractive companies. The works for taxes scheme was created to address some of Peru\u2019s infrastructure gaps by overcoming some of the constraints to public infrastructure development. Technical capacity in public institutions was low, the quality of pre-investment and investment studies was often poor, and many projects were characterized by high costs and timeline overruns. To be approved for the scheme, projects must address an existing infrastructure or service gap. Project proposals can originate either from a pipeline of projects in the public investment system or be proposed by the private actors interested in financing them, so long as they address an identified priority. Most public entities have the authority to agree on projects, including regional and local governments as well as actors such as public universities.86 Upon agreement and receipt of a declaration of feasibility from the national public investment system, the private company or companies finance the public works. Following completion of the project and an audit to verify the amount invested,87 the companies\u2019 costs are offset against their future tax payments, up to a limit of 50 percent of their annual income tax balance. The value is also deducted from future transfers to the public entity. 83 World Bank (2016). Lesotho health network PPP.

There have also been no documented cases of poor execution \u2013 the reputation of the private firms involved provides an incentive for quality investment and tight oversight of the construction firms that deliver the investments. Improved relations with local communities has been one motive for private participation and, given that many projects are located in the areas in which the firms operate, in many instances firms themselves stand to benefit. Nevertheless, there are limitations and challenges with the scheme.

There is a significant amount of innovation in environmentally and socially responsible approaches to investing among certain segments of the private sector. Models of responsible, sustainable and impact investing (see Box 4) account for a small but growing proportion of investment. Box 4. What is social impact investing? Between traditional investing that focuses solely on financial returns and philanthropy that focuses solely on outcomes, there exists a spectrum of investment models. These range from those that place an emphasis on financial returns to those that emphasize social or environmental outcomes and place a secondary weight on generating financial returns. Figure 2.1 summarizes the spectrum of investment models, distinguishing between responsible, sustainable and impact investment. For simplicity, this chapter uses the term \u2018social impact investment\u2019 as a catch-all term encompassing these three types of an investment model. Social impact investing offers a range of direct and indirect benefits. It can develop sustainable new models for funding services in key areas of sustainable development. Globally it has been applied to a range of issues, from recidivism to early childhood development, youth unemployment and various aspects of health care. It can catalyse additional financing for these challenges, stimulate private sector development and foster closer public\u2013private collaboration. It can also have powerful indirect effects as its principles, practices and tools are adopted and adapted in the wider private sector. For these reasons, social impact investing offers significant potential to contribute towards the challenge of stimulating more sustainable, inclusive private investment. Figure 2.1.

It can also be a powerful catalyst for progress among the wider business community. Countries around the world are aiming to establish or develop social impact investments as an alternative, sustainable model of funding services that does not draw on public funds and which can catalyse change among the wider private sector. The examples presented below show how governments can play a role supporting the development of social impact investing. Growing a social impact investment industry requires developments in three aspects of the market in parallel: a growing body of social impact businesses that demand capital, a growing supply of capital willing to balance financial, social and environmental objectives, and intermediaries that can effectively link the two. The examples presented below highlight some of the ways to address these challenges. The United Kingdom provided grant financing for nascent firms who struggle to access other sources of capital, and used funds raised from new banking legislation to capitalize a wholesaler that could provide sustainable financing as an intermediary. India is one of many countries in which impact bonds are being trialled to bring private capital into the delivery of services on a payment-for-outcomes basis. Social and development impact bonds are an important innovation in this space, providing a model for sharing risks, and that addresses the challenge for government to pay for an outcome once it has been verified, rather than once the outputs have been delivered. Social impact investment offers considerable potential to bring private finance into key investments in sustainable development, and as part of a wider private sector development strategy. However, the instruments are often complex and require advanced capacity to manage and, as the examples show, it can take a significant amount of time before fully sustainable models are established. Version 1.0 31 CASE STUDY 17. The United Kingdom: Early-stage grant financing and supporting financial intermediaries Access to appropriate forms of capital can be critical to the development of any business through various phases of growth, from the early stages to the establishment of a mature business. This is true for social impact investment businesses, whose balance of financial and sustainable development concerns can require access to specialized sources of finance. The United Kingdom was an early leader in social impact investing and has developed policies and measures to support and promote a number of aspects of the development of a social impact investing \u2018sector\u2019. One important lesson from the experience of the United Kingdom is that social impact businesses often require some grant funding blended with investments that expect a return. Taking on too much debt can burden early- stage social impact businesses, alter incentives for innovation and bring a high risk of collapse, particularly given the higher rates that are charged on debt to newer organizations. 97 In the United Kingdom, a non-profit organization, UnLtd, was established in 2001 with a \u00a3100 million endowment funded publicly from resources raised through the national lottery to help address the challenge of early-stage financing. It supports 1,000 entrepreneurs every year with small grants alongside support such as practical advice and networking opportunities.98 Well-structured grant programmes like UnLtd can help firms to become established and create the space to experiment and test which models work and can be taken to scale. The central challenge, however, is to find the right balance: supporting the establishment of firms in a nascent sector before moving them onto blended and then fully debt-based funding streams.99 As social impact firms develop, they will reach a stage where they are able to take on debt which will enable them to continue to grow and offer services. Ensuring there are intermediaries that can provide access to this funding is key to supporting the continued growth of a social impact investment sector. Intermediaries play an essential role in matching the demand for financing with the supply of capital seeking financial, social and environmental returns. The UK government played a key role in establishing two intermediaries \u2013 Big Society Capital and Bridges Ventures \u2013 that have been central to the growth of the social impact business sector. In 2008, legislation100 was passed to allow the government to collect and redistribute the money from unclaimed bank accounts. These funds were tied to the creation of a social investment wholesaler, which led to the creation of Big Society Capital by the Cabinet Office in 2012.101 Big Society Capital was also funded from a levy that was part of an agreement with major", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "780a12cd-6b78-4059-88e3-807c13bb0ce5": {"__data__": {"id_": "780a12cd-6b78-4059-88e3-807c13bb0ce5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fbb309f974f8b4f063f5cbc1fabac71572f0e81dc532dd051bd2e8bcf2af266"}}, "hash": "7fbb309f974f8b4f063f5cbc1fabac71572f0e81dc532dd051bd2e8bcf2af266", "text": "banks following the financial crisis.

CASE STUDY 18. Rajasthan: The Utkrisht impact bond Beyond supporting the provision of appropriate finance for social impact investment, there is growing use of social or development impact bonds for mobilizing outcome-focused investment in sustainable development (see Box 5). In India, the Utkrisht impact bond was launched in 2017 to support improved maternal and newborn mortality in the state of Rajasthan. This example highlights some of the potential of social impact bonds, as well as the complexities involved in their establishment. The Utkrisht bond funds a large programme of support for health care facilities in Rajasthan. It aims to support a targeted 360 facilities to reach accreditation by a new standard under the Manyat initiative (though this can rise as high as 444 facilities). While the ultimate aim of the intervention is to support improved maternal and newborn health outcomes, challenges in the measurement of these outcomes104 meant that the payment metrics around which the impact bond was finally structured related to accreditation of health facilities. Accreditation involves certification against two standards, for patient care and hospital management, and related to specific practices regarding quality maternal and newborn health care. This provided a simpler focus for the initiative, yet retains a strong link with the ultimate desired outcome. It is estimated that the initiative could support up to 600,000 pregnant women with improved health care facilities, potentially saving up to 10,000 lives over a five-year period. The intervention built on previous collaboration between service providers, though has a complex structure and took close to two years to move from conception to launch. It involves seven core contracting partners, with a further four organizations involved in an advisory capacity alongside programmatic oversight from the government of Rajasthan. The outcome funders pledged up to a total of US$9 million for the initiative, of which up to US$8 million can be returned to investors on the delivery of results, with up to US$1 million set aside for outcome verification. The expected return for investors is 7.1 percent, with a cap of 8 percent. While the outcome buyers for the Utkrisht impact bond are a development partner (USAID) and a foundation (Merck for Mothers), it explicitly aims to prove the concept in order for the State of Rajasthan to ultimately become an outcome buyer. Across the impact bond sector as a whole, development partners have been key drivers in establishing and spreading the use of impact bonds. There have now been more than 100 social or development105 impact bonds launched worldwide.106 103 UK National Advisory Board Report to the Social Impact Investment Taskforce (2014).

Social impact bonds typically involve a payment for outcomes contract between government and an intermediary who commits to achieving specified social or environmental outcomes. Once these outcomes have been achieved and are verified, pre-agreed payment is received from the government. The bond component of a typical structure comes from the intermediary issuing a bond against the value of the future payment from government. This bond may be taken up by commercial or philanthropic actors and provides the upfront capital that funds the implementation of the project (which is often contracted by the intermediary to a service provider).107 In this way, the upfront costs of a project are financed by third parties and government spending occurs only once results have been achieved. This mitigates the challenge of committing upfront public funding for projects with uncertain long-term outcomes. It also means risks are shared between government, the intermediary and the purchasers of the bond. 107 There have been initial discussions in some countries to consider using diaspora bonds in this role within a typical social impact bond structure. See later in Chapter 3 for more on diaspora bonds. 108 Business call to action, 2016, Measuring impact: How business accelerates SDGs.

What is impact measurement? Impact measurement has developed through the social impact investing sector and is designed to track the effectiveness of investments and to demonstrate and communicate their impact. It focuses on the outputs that companies produce and increasingly on the medium-term to long- term effects of their goods and services. Its origins drew from rigorous applied economics techniques designed for evaluation purposes, although leaner approaches have been developed to reduce the time and cost of implementation.108 While there are many similarities with sustainability reporting (see Box 9), impact measurement differs in purpose and in the types of firms that use it. Sustainability reporting is driven primarily by transparency and accountability objectives and is mainly used by larger or listed firms.

Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices and processes by which a company is directed and controlled. Businesses with weak corporate governance may offer poor quality products and services, treat their employees unfairly, avoid investing in beneficial value chains or cause environmental damage. Stronger governance avoids or improves these and other aspects of business, supporting greater contributions to the SDGs. Many countries are establishing mechanisms to promote stronger corporate governance, with innovations led by both public and private actors.

This is important because in contexts where the fiduciary duties require, or are interpreted to require, a focus on maximizing financial returns, it can limit the extent to which asset managers can make investments that are perceived to balance financial with other concerns. This is particularly important for mobilizing investment in responsible, sustainable and impact investment businesses (see also the social impact investing section above). Revising or clarifying regulations regarding fiduciary duty can unlock capital for firms that give greater weight to economic, social and governance (ESG) considerations while still meeting the financial interests of the asset managers\u2019 own investors. South Africa was one of the first countries to formally encourage investors to integrate ESG considerations into their investment decisions.112 In 2011, the government amended the regulation under its Pension Funds Act to state that prudent investing should consider all factors that could materially affect an investment, including factors of an environmental, social and governance character.113 At the same time, they launched the voluntary Code for Responsible Investing in South Africa (CRISA) that encouraged institutional investors to adopt an \u201capply or explain\u201d approach to the key principles of the code. These included, among other principles, incorporating sustainability concerns including ESG factors into investment analysis and decisions. In this way, the government aimed to clarify fiduciary duties so that more capital would be released into responsible, sustainable and impact investments. The impact of these changes in South Africa has been mixed, with increased awareness of responsible investing principles and some slow progress in altering the way investments are made. Awareness of sustainability issues among investors has risen greatly. Between 2007 and 2013, awareness of international standards for responsible Version 1.0 35 investment114 rose from one-third of institutional investors to 94 percent.115 Yet there is mixed evidence on the extent to which this has changed behaviours. The incentives for change in the way assets are invested in practice have been weaker than expected. 116 Progress has been slow, with challenges around the adaptation of pension fund mandates to respond to fiduciary rule changes, incompatibility in reporting standards and information disclosure, and little impact on overall incentives for fund performance to be in line with industry benchmarks. However, there are some signs of increased consideration of ESG factors in investments, albeit over a longer time horizon than envisaged when the changes were designed.117 For example, a 2017 global survey found that sustainable investing has become more important to 89 percent of investors in South Africa over the previous 5 years, one of the most rapid changes among countries surveyed.118 While some of this may be driven by wider trends, regulatory changes have probably been a contributing factor. CASE STUDY 20. Thailand: The corporate governance fund Changes to regulation offer one route for altering investor behaviour with regard to corporate governance. In Thailand, investors keen on promoting stronger governance have developed a softer approach to incentivize changes in business practice. The Corporate Governance Fund (CG fund) was launched in 2017. This equity fund is a collaborative effort between a number of asset management firms, supported by the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). The asset management firms involved in the CG fund collectively account for 90 percent of assets under management in the country. The CG fund aims to promote good corporate governance and transparency among companies and to encourage responsible investment practices by asset management firms. It has been capitalized to a value of US$125 million.119 The CG fund will invest in companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand or the market for alternative investments,120 that have demonstrated good corporate governance. To be eligible for investment, companies must pass two criteria. Firstly, they must achieve at least a four-star rating in the Thai Institute of Directors\u2019 corporate governance report. This annual report assesses the structures and policies that companies have in place across five aspects of corporate governance.121 It includes assessment of financial and non-financial disclosure as well as sustainability reporting practices (see Case study 32. Thailand: Sustainability reporting example in Chapter 4 on monitoring and review below). Secondly, they must be certified by the Private Sector Collective Action Coalition Against Corruption, an initiative which verifies that companies have put in place anti-corruption policies and follow high compliance standards. 114 Specifically the principles for responsible investment. 115 EY (2013).

CASE STUDY 21. India and Indonesia: Mandatory CSR In 2014, India introduced legislation that requires all companies that satisfy certain profitability and other criteria to spend at least 2 percent of their net income on corporate social responsibility. Official data estimate that this generated around US$1.5 billion of CSR spending in 2015\u201316.124 While the legislation in India goes further than other countries in obligating CSR spending, some countries have legislation or policy that mandates CSR spending for certain types of organizations. Indonesia, for example, passed legislation in 2003 that requires state-owned enterprises to allocate 2 percent of their net profit to CSR.125 And a 2007 law obligates companies working in the natural resources or related sectors to allocate funds for CSR.126 However, regulations are yet to be introduced so this is not being enforced.127 122 CG Fund (2018).

Promoting corporate social responsibility Corporate social responsibility (CSR) captures business approaches which aim to give something back to society through mechanisms such as philanthropy or staff volunteering, or which promote more ethical business practices. CSR can, but does not always, involve adaptations to a business\u2019s core operations \u2013 and as such is generally treated separately from corporate governance. Nevertheless, CSR can make important contributions to the 2030 Agenda and act as a meaningful route to stronger engagement with businesses on sustainable development issues. The examples from India and Indonesia below highlight a regulatory approach to encouraging the spread of corporate social responsibility practices. Building platforms for public\u2013private dialogue Underpinning the success of any of the policy tools discussed above is the need to ensure that they are Version 1.0 37 appropriate for the context and have, to the extent possible, the buy-in and ownership of the private sector actors whose decisions they aim to influence.

It operates as a space for dialogue and joint action between the public and private sectors, with the mission of articulating, improving and promoting initiatives to facilitate the development and impact of clean production in Chilean productive sectors. It started in 1997 following the recommendations of the Agenda 21 agreed upon at the Rio Earth Summit and dialogue at Chile\u2019s annual Productive Development Forums. The search for effective ways to organize the dialogue and development of institutional solutions required several improvements over the past two decades. The private sector initially regarded the idea with scepticism and complained about the costs involved in the introduction of this concept in the production process, translated into investments of capital and technology that, they understood, would imply a re-engineering of processes and management. However, over time and as the mechanism has evolved, the partnership between public and private actors has strengthened. The governance structure is now such that the Board of Directors is chaired by the Minister of Economy and composed of five government representatives alongside five from the corporate sector, trade unions and the small and medium enterprise sector. It operates with an Executive Director and Regional Secretariats for all geographic regions. The initiative has focused on using public\u2013private dialogue to develop a clear, shared strategic vision about clean production and has developed a number of concepts and tools to promote it. The public and private actors involved have defined key concepts including clean production actions128 and best available techniques (BATs).129 The initiative has also informed the design of clean production agreements (CPAs). These are formal, voluntary agreements between a whole business sector and the state that aim to apply clean production techniques through specific goals and actions, often using BATs. All firms participating in CPAs have access to a range of government-supported financial support for services including sectoral diagnostics, specialized technical assistance, disseminating good practices and technology, and supporting investment in equipment and technology. CPAs have been agreed for a wide range of productive sectors in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, construction, transportation and commerce, and were also reached in the public administration and 38 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS education sectors. They are credited with contributing to a reduction in emissions across a range of industries.130 The success of these agreements is that in October 2012, the UN internationally validated all CPAs as the first NAMA (Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action). This example highlights both the potential and some of the challenges associated with building strong dialogue. It took time and various adjustments in structure before the CCP was brought from a place of private sector scepticism to one of effective public\u2013private dialogue and collaboration. The initiative invested considerable time in defining key terms and concepts \u2013 something that can otherwise be a challenge to effective communication and partnerships between public and private actors. Building on these foundations has led to innovative solutions that have advanced strategic cleaner production reforms across a number of industries.

The scale and nature of private sector development has powerful direct and indirect influences over many aspects of the SDGs, from job creation and patterns of production and consumption to environmental management and the revenues available to fund public services. For this reason, one of the key challenges governments in many contexts are grappling with is how to stimulate a growing volume of sustainable, inclusive private sector investment that can advance progress towards the SDGs. Promoting private sector investment is a complex, multifaceted policy area. The business environment includes a wide range of factors that can each promote or constrain private sector investment, and each promote or ignore enhanced management of social and environmental outcomes. The examples above highlight innovations in a number of different areas of private sector investment policy and collaboration.
