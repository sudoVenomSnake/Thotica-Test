The initial draft was submitted to the Expert meeting on LDC\u2019s in Asia- Pacific which took place in October 2003 in Bangkok. The author would like to thank those who provided comments on the initial draft, in particular: Robert England (UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Thailand), Gita Welch (Team Leader of the Democratic Governance Practice \u2013 UNDP-BDP), Aynul Hassan (Chief LDC Coordination Unit, ESCAP), Hirohito Toda (LDC Coordination Unit, ESCAP), Evan Due (Senior Regional Economist, International Development Research Centre - Singapore), Suchitra Punyaratabandhu (National Institute of Development Administration - Thailand) and Johan Arvling and Nils Taxell (Bangkok SURF).The views presented in this paper are those of the author. They do not necessarily represent the views of the United Nations Development Programme. The fact that 10% of the world population living in the 49 Least Developed Countries located in four continents contribute only 0.5 % of the world\u2019s GDP remains, by any measure, one of the greatest inequities on the planet \u00bb (James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank1). \u201cRemoving barriers to trade from these countries poses no serious threat to anyone, but it does provide some of the poorest people on earth with the gift of opportunity that is vital to their future growth and development\u201d (Mike Moore, Secretary General of the World Trade Organisation) I. Introduction Globalisation has manifested itself as a process of growing inequality and social disparity in the world, both between North and South and between the rich and the poor. The latest HDR (2003) points out that in spite of real global economic growth, worldwide, human suffering is growing. More than one third of developing countries have seen their average per capita income fall, leaving 1.2 billion people in poverty, living on less than 1 US dollar per day. Nearly 60 countries are far off track from achieving the MDGs (UNDP HDR 2003). The countries in the Asia Pacific region have performed relatively well and some of them even achieved the largest decreases in poverty in human history2.

In light of this, the Brussels Plan of Action (PoA) 2001-2010, adopted in June 2001 at the 3th UN Conference on LDCs, singles out a number of cross- cutting priority issues and demands an increased focus on good governance at national and international levels.

Globalization has further deepened their vulnerability. Since the Millennium Summit, these countries have become the target recipients of a new wave of promises for ODA and pro-poor trade agreements. The 3rd UN Conference on LDCs held in Brussels in May 2001 provided an opportunity to turn the ambitious MDGs and global consensus into concrete action. But despite many initiatives taken in favour of LDCs, results so far have been below expectations; the previous PoA for the 1990\u2019s remained basically unattained5. The number of LDCs rose from the original 24 to 506 and only one of the original members was able to graduate (Botswana - 1984). The development prospects of many LDCs have even diminished 1.

China (from 33% to 10%); Indonesia (from 60% to 15%); Malaysia (from 18% to 6 %); Pakistan (from 54% to 26%); Korea (from 23% to 8%); Thailand (from 26% to 18%). 3. The list of countries defined as \"least developed\" is established by the UN General Assembly on the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Timor-Leste has just joined the ranks. 4. The current criteria for achieving LDC status are the following: (1) low national income; (2) weak human assets and (3) high economic vulnerability. 5. The first UN Conference on LDCs was in Paris in 1981, the second one in Paris in 1990. 6. Thirty-five of these are in Africa, 14 are in Asia and the Pacific, and one in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Of the 50 LDCs, 16 are landlocked countries and 11 are mall island development states (SIDS). 1 during the last decade7, mainly because of declining financial aid, increasing debt burden8 and persisting trade barriers. Both Seattle and Cancun confirmed the state of indecisiveness and tempered the enthusiasm that generated out of the New York and Monterey conferences. The pessimists among us will conclude that the quickening pace of globalisation and the increasing digital divide between developed countries and LDCs has left the latter increasingly marginalized. Although the proportion of people living on less that 1 US$ a day decreased from 30% to 23%, when excluding the China figures the number of people living in extreme poverty actually increased by 28 million (Choices September 2003, 6). For the pessimists, most of the LDCs are to be seen as an ill-fated group of countries that have little prospect for elevation. The optimists among us will note that pro-poor development is back on the global agenda. \u201cFifty years ago still more than half the world\u2019s population lived on less than 1 US$ per day. Today, despite a much larger population, the portion of poor people has more than halved (1.2 billion people in a world of more than 6 billion). Accelerating progress in poverty reduction is a challenge, but a world free of extreme poverty is now in our reach\u201d9. Despite the disappointments of Seattle and Cancun, the multilateral trading system has changed dramatically since the Uruguay Round, with four out of five WTO members now from the developing world and demanding radical reforms. As mentioned by many observers, \u201cthe united position of the developing countries was probably the only positive outcome of Cancun\u201d. New trade agreements and increased ODA in favour of the LDCs is important, but so is political commitment for good governance on the domestic front. Despite economic growth in a number of LDCs, the incidence of poverty remains high (Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Kiribati, Vanuatu\u2026). This stems basically from inequity in the distribution of resources and opportunities and disparities in the ownership of and access to productive resources10. If not complemented by domestic policies to improve governance, pro-LDC trade and aid policies will not necessarily benefit the poor. Monitoring of and reporting on progress is also a shared responsibility between donors and recipient countries.

But since the tangible impact of such complex reforms on poverty eradication is not easy to measure, practitioners continue to debate on the prioritisation and sequencing of governance reforms. 7.

The share of the private sector in non-agricultural GDP rose to 69.7% in 1998-1999. But progress does not seem to benefit the poor and marginalized communities, as the government fails to promote trade for the small and medium-sized producers. 11. Four were from the Asia Pacific Region (Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos and Samoa). 2 Elaborated research confirms the linkages between good governance and economic performance, and between institutional quality and aid effectiveness and investment levels (Linder & Santiso, 6). III.2. Impediments to economic growth in the LDCs and importance of governance Economic growth, which is one of the vehicles to poverty reduction, is usually associated with the development of manufacturing exports (UN MDP). LDCs however face a number of impediments that obstruct such a growth scenario, or even prevent the likelihood of developing a competitive manufacturing sector12. Some are inherent to their specific location or biophysical conditions, others such as the quality of governance and economic institutions are influenced by political or economic decision-making and are thus much more subject to possible change. Key impediments/risk factors that influence the prospects of growth and development in a given LDC can be summarised as follows: Internal impediments 1. Weak governance (e.g. lack of transparency and respect for human rights, lack of participation, inefficient and ineffective public administration, corruption). 2. Human capacity deficits (in the public as well as in the private sector) 3. Gender discrimination 4. Internal and external human conflicts 5. Deficiencies in communication and infrastructure 6. Environmental degradation External impediments 7. Low population density and thus limited internal markets 8. Protectionism and reduced trade opportunities 9. Landlockedness13 and physical isolation 10. Biophysical barriers (e.g. soil infertility, HIV-AIDS, tropical diseases and other challenges) 11. External debt crisis The Pacific and South Asian LDCs are considered high riks countries as they face many of these impediments. East Asia is a lower risk region, because of its heavily coastal orientation, larger poplulations, and less adverse ecological conditions (Millennium Development Project). Weak governance is generally considered a major constraint to economic development and hence poverty alleviation. But as highlighted in the Millennium Development Project, not all economies are equally well placed to achieve the breakthrough to modern economic growth ; in contrast to their system of governance, they also face many impediments that are not the product of their own choices. For these, a focus on good governance will not be sufficient; a multi-dimensional approach that allows to address the particular local stresses on each economy is required. Consequently, the Millennium Development Compact proposes six policy clusters that are crucial for LDCs to break out of the poverty trap. 1. Investing in human development (health, education, sanitation) 2. Investing in agricultural productivity (to help famers break out of subsistence farming) 3. Investing in infrastructure 4. Investing in industrial development (support the emergence of a competitive and diversified manufacturing sector - small and medium enterprises) 5. Emphasizing human rights and social equity to ensure that all people have the freedom and voice to influence decisions that affect their life. 6.

Other actors also took explicit policy stands on governance issues: \ufffd At the Brussels Conference, governance was singled out as one of the key cross-cutting priorities. The program identifed seven areas of action of which four were directly related to governance : (1) fostering people-centred action ; (2) promoting good governance at national and international level ; (3) building human and institutional capacities and (4) mobilising financial resources, including ODA. \ufffd According to ESCAP, four governance attributes are vital for the achievement of the MDGs: (ESCAP 2003): (1) Efficient and effective administration; (2) Control of corruption; (3) Scrutiny of public sector management by an empowered civil society; (4) Decentralization. \ufffd All multilateral development organisations have stressed the importance of governance15. Around the world, discussions on development are thus placing more and more emphasis on accountable institutions and governance16. The UNDP HDR 2002 (Deepening Democracy in a Fragmented World) added that \u201cadvancing human development requires governance that is democratic both in form and substance\u201d But the HDR also highlighted the difficulties in conceptualizing unambiguous, uncontroversial indicators for measuring the quality of democratic governance in a given context. IV. Measuring the quality of governance: governance indicators IV.1. LDCs in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 divergence The Asia-Pacific region is the most diverse region in the world, with huge variations in levels of development (see table hereafter). The region also hosts both the most populous (China - 1 billion people) and the least populous country in the world (Tuvalu - 10,500 people). The region currently has 14 of the 50 LDCs ; 4 among these are landlocked countries and 6 are small islands states17. Together, they account for 37% of the population and 46% of GNP of all LDCs. Timor Leste, the 14th LDC in Asia-Pacific Timor Leste is Asia's poorest, 85 to 90 percent of urban adults have no jobs, up to half of East Timorese are illiterate and 40% live below the poverty line; small-scale coffee production is virtually the only export industry. Even after revenues from offshore oil and gas production (worth $6 billion over 20 years) come on stream in 2005, the Southeast Asian country is likely to remain heavily dependent on foreign aid. Foreign donors, meanwhile, pledged $440 million to East Timor through 2005. The Asia-Pacific LDCs show considerable divergence in terms of social, economic and cultural conditions and natural resources, institutional capacity and geography. Afghanistan, Bhutan, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Nepal are landlocked while Kiribati, Maldives, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu are SIDS. Cambodia and Laos are in economic transition. Some, like Bangladesh, are relatively large and densely populated, while others, like the Pacific Islands are small and remote. Some of them are emerging from or are still facing domestic security issues (Afghanistan, Nepal, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste). A number of them are also classified among the new or restored democracies and are in the difficult process 14. E.g. The Agreement on Trade related aspects of property rights (WTO) stipulates that developed country Members shall provide incentives to enterprises and institutions in their territories for the purpose of promoting and encouraging technology transfer to LDC Members. 15. \u201cThe MDGs are still achievable but we will only succeed in meeting them if national and global leaders have the vision and courage to first confront the critical issues of Democratic Governance\u201d (Mark M. Brown, HDR 2002). \u201cWhich path the international community and emerging countries embark on in the coming years on governance may prove critical for success or failure in providing an appropriate climate for renewed investment and private sector growth in emerging markets, for poverty reduction and, related, for progress towards the MDGs (Daniel Kaufmann, 2002, 3).

But except for Myanmar and Solomon Islands, ODA decreased in most countries in the period 1996-200119. Several LDCs in the region achieved average GDP per capita increases for 1990-2001 of more than 4% (Laos, Bangladesh, Bhutan) 20. Others, in particular the SIDS, were less well performing21. Between 1990 and 2000, export of goods and services as a percentage of GDP increased in almost all LDCs. Exports have doubled in Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia. But despite significant economic and social progress, the levels of absolute poverty remain high, indicating that the benefits of such growth are distributed unevenly among the population. Special attention needs to be given to SIDS. Although these islands states have among the highest GDP per capita and PPP gross national income amongst the Asian LDCs, and the highest life expectancy at birth (from 67.4 in the Maldives to 70 in Samoa), most of them (except Maldives and Samoa) show slow progress on the MDGs22. A number of them have also suffered from widespread political unrest and civil disturbances. Poverty levels (in terms of access to basic services and employment opportunities) are particularly high in Kiribati, Vanuatu and Timor Leste. Debt ratios as a percentage of GDP in Maldives and Samoa are among the highest (3.7% and 2.9% respectively). Some of them face very high population growth ratios (3% in the Maldives and 3.3% in Solomon Islands). III.2. Governance indicators for the Asia Pacific LDCs. The Asia Pacific region has many diverse forms of governance. The region historically had strong governments that have steered development from the top down (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South-Korea, China). These centralised bureaucracies delivered many of the economic rights and achieved a notable reduction in poverty, manily due to the quality of service delivery, the building up of human resources and professionalism of the public service. In the 1990\u2019s a number of LDCs have been exposed to a crisis in governance manifested by the persistence of corruption, poorly conceived and weakly implemented policies, erosion of social norms and accumulation of political and social conflict. While macro-economic and fiscal performance was strengthened after the Asian crisis, governance and institutional performance remain issues of concern in most of the Asia-Pacific LDCs. The search for adequate indicators of governance performance has attracted condiderable interest from a variety of sources. There exists now a wide variety of country risk ratings and indicators for governance performance23, exposing the myth that governance is too hard to define or measure. While most of these indicators do not allow assessing longer-term trends, they all reflect an important shift from the \u201cnature of governing systems\u201d to the \u201cquality of governance\u201d (Linder & Santiso, 17). The quality of governance in a given country reflects a complex array of factors. Consequently, trying to aggregate a variety of more narrowly focused governance factors into one single indicator for assessing the quality of governance in a country would not be appropriate.

It can also help donors in indentifying key entry points that can operate as true champions for the reforms25.But in general, the use of objective and subjective indicators that aim to show the extent of democracy or political and civil rights in countries remains controversial. Objective indicators (e.g. existence of competitive elections) fail to capture all aspects of democracy. Subjective indicators (e.g. Transparency International, Freedom House26 or the World Bank) allow capturing more what is meant by the concept of democracy, but because they are subjective, they are open to disagreements and perception biases (HDR 2002, 36). Nonetheless, in order to summarise trends and provide inputs to the debate on the quality of governance, this chapter analyses the 14 Asia Pacific LDCs on the basis of six governance Indicators developed by the World Bank Institute27 (see table below).

Analysis of the ratings and conclusion a) Analysis of ratings As shown in the table below, for each of the 6 indicators there are two SIDS in the top three performers. On Voice and Accountabiliy, four SIDS countries score highest (Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Kiribati and Samoa). Maldives leads on \u201cpolitical stability29\u201d followed by Samoa and Bhutan. 24. A country may score high on control of corruption yet score very low on political freedom and vice-versa. 25. USAID uses a combination of two types of indicators (World Bank and Freedom House) for the purpose of selecting recipient countries for the US Millennium Account. 26. Since 1972, Freedom House has published an annual assessment of the state of freedom (political rights and civil liberties) in 192 countries (www.freedomhouse.org). Its surveys rely on a wide range of sources \u2013 including foreign and domestic news reports, publications by NGOs, think tanks and academic analyses etc. 27. The indicators are based on 25 separate data sources at 18 different organizations, including the World Bank itself. The database covers the period 1996-2002 and will be updated regularly (www.info.worldbank.org). 28. E.g. this indicator combines several indicators of the political process (free and fair elections, freedom of the press, civil liberties, political rights, military in politics, change in government, transparency, information to businesses) with indicators on civil liberties and political rights, and press freedom and independence. 29. The Maldives are currently facing political turbulence. A country with large number of young people and an employment market that is highly infiltrated by foreign workers, coupled with extremely high population increases (3%) and high population density in the capital Male only, is at risk of explosion. The challenge for the leadership is to decide on the kind of political reforms that will ease these tensions. 6 \u201cGovernment effectiveness\u201d is highest in Bhutan and Maldives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01d78dad-d198-4551-b181-5b9db19061aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "01d78dad-d198-4551-b181-5b9db19061aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58af31f94a9701f4918916fdc6dbc04453492ba95f3685f3432b12cecddcb57e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6a77c8b-9dcd-4366-89da-345a9d71a454", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eeb4efa88878f93afe0c935cd153972103070f70216682f426845058b044d248"}}, "hash": "ef9f7e5da2692a12ed4c85237a4e10547529c3af3e8f616dbced7294d90343d7", "text": "6 \u201cGovernment effectiveness\u201d is highest in Bhutan and Maldives.

Bhutan is ranked among the top three with regard to governance indicators, yet has a much lower human development ranking (lower than Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos). The governance indicators on which both Samoa and Maldives score highest are (a) political stability, (b) rule of law, (c) government effectiveness, (d) regulatory quality and (e) control of corruption. But the country that has the higesht level of human development (Samoa) also scores high on \u201cvoice and accountability\u2019. The table allows to draw come preliminary conclusions. First, for some of the governance indicators, the link to poverty seems to be more obvious than for others. Corruption has a negative impact on development, whether it occurs in a post-conflict situation or in politically stable country. Measures to control corruption therefore benefit development and poverty reduction. Yet for other indicators, the link is less clear. Regulatory quality is important, so is adherence to the rule of law (rights-based approach with particular attention to disadvantaged groups) and the functionning of an effective government apparatus. But the immediate correlation may be less obvious when analysing these general indicators more in detail. Government effectiveness is key, but depending on local circumstances, an effective government can be highly centralised or decentralised; it can be lean or heavily bureaucratic; it 7 can rely heavily on ICT applications; it can be very participative or it can be more autocratic30. Trying to seek a positive correlation between decentralised governance (or fiscal decentralisation) and poverty reduction is more difficult. Second, as witnessed in other countries, \u201cvoice and accountability\u201d, may not be the key determinator for massive poverty reduction (eg China, Vietnam) , but if cultivated in a climat of political stability31, it has an impact on the level of human development.Third, \u201cpolitical stability\u201d appears to be a key condition for reaching certain development goals. This seems to indicate the need for an incremental process when deciding on the implementation of democratic reforms. There is a consensus in the international community that democracy is a universal value shared by all peoples and that good governance is essential to poverty reduction and sustainable development in any country. But a number of studies and international conferences have confirmed that democratic governance is not sustainable, unless (1) there is empowerment of people leading to the sharing of democratic values among a broad segment of the population, (2) there are economic and social underpinnings to sustain and spread the benefits of democratic values, (3) there is a solid partnership and solidarity among different actors of society both at the local and national levels to promote democratic values and institutions and (4) policies, programmes and projects in support of democratic governance both at central and local levels are not imposed by the donor community. Without these conditions in place, the benefits of democratic governance may not reach the poor and voiceless. Consequently, there is a need for pragmatism, flexibility and caution when measuring the quality of governance in a diverse group of LDCs. Democratic governance relies on strong foundations (economic, social and political) which require time to anchor in society. Building, strengthening and consolidating the economic foundations for democratisation includes promoting sustainable growth, employment expansion, skill development, poverty reduction and income distribution. Building, strengthening and consolidating the social foundations for democratisation include educating children and adults on democratic values, tolerance for different opinions, a culture of trust and solidarity within the community and adherence to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f44ab433-787e-4719-a53c-0a38c5efc186": {"__data__": {"id_": "f44ab433-787e-4719-a53c-0a38c5efc186", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6f873e09336f3eedca88c9e50189aa8f8383936495e373d91efd9e7b6029e78"}}, "hash": "e6f873e09336f3eedca88c9e50189aa8f8383936495e373d91efd9e7b6029e78", "text": "cultural and spiritual values. Building, strengthening and consolidating the political foundations for democratization will include the protection of child and human rights, freedom of beliefs and creed, freedom of association and press, parliamentary representation and fair election32. Based on the above, care should be given not to rush straight to prioritising political reforms without due regard to the political, social and economic foundations for democratisation. The relative weight that is given to various governance components, depends on a country\u2019s economic, political, institutional financial, social and physical environment, in a particular period of time. In practice this means that, in a specific LDC, it may be much more important to focus on health and education, even through a top-down bureaucratic approach that promotes efficient allocation of resources and transparent and accountable resources management. In other countries, the key issue may involve access to justice and human rights or the key issue could be civil service and financial reforms. Depending upon different stages of economic, social and political development of the countries concerned, there exist a diversity of approaches and routes to democratisation, and time may be required to build and consolidate all three foundations. The challenge is to maintain political stability while ensuring an incremental path towards further reforms, tailored to the local context. UNDP\u2019s definitions of governance and democracy allow enough space to accommodate such a variety of models.33. 30. As mentioned above, there have been other countries in the Asia-Pacific region that achieved high performance in many areas under a more centralised and relatively authoritarian regime. 31. Although autocratic polities appear to have had twice the incidence of violent conflict as democratic polities over the past 100 years, transitional polities had twice the incidence of violent conflict as autocratic polities over the same period. Rapid transition from one political state to another tends to increase the level of stress and thus increase the likelihood of instability (UNDP Licus, 3). 32. UNDP, Promoting Democratic Governance in East Asia, Project Document (draft) 33. UNDP defines governance as \u201cthe exercise of economic political and administrative authority to manage a country\u2019s affairs at all levels and comprising the mechanisms, processes and institutions through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, exercise their rights, meet their obligations and mediate their differences\u201d\u201d. Democracy is defined as \u201ca set of principles and core values that allow poor people to gain power through participation while protecting them from arbitrary, unaccountable actions in their lives by governments, multinational corporations and other forces (HDR 2002). 8 While acknowledging the importance of good governance for economic development34, the preliminary conclusion is that democratic governance is a complex and multifaceted process the sequencing of which needs to be adapted to the local circumstances. Most importantly, while there are core principles inherent to a good governance programme (transparency, accountability, predictability; equity, rule of law, participation, etc.) their application in a given economic, social and political context requires careful analysis of the environment and adaptation. It may thus be more correct to say that \u201cdepending on the political, economic and social context, some dimensions of governance will stand out to be more important than others for the eradication of poverty\u201d. Although a possible correlation between good governance indicators and poverty alleviation remains hard to prove35 from the table above it would seem that all six governance indicators carry an important weight in furthering human development and in the fight against poverty in LDCs, yet their respective value in a given context will depend on other variables. Hence the call for caution when trying to make comparisons between different countries on the basis of such governance indicators. Another interesting conclusion is on cultural diversity. The three countries that scored highest on all governance indicators are Maldives, Bhutan and Samoa. Maldives is a Muslim island state. Bhutan is a Budist landlocked country and Samoa is a Catholic Pacific Island. All top performers have different social and religious structures and also substantively different governance systems. This would debunk the myth that development successes and failures are driven by culture or religion. It also points to the need for a good understanding of the cultural and social values that inform policy choices for development36. The following chapter will analyse some governance indicators more in detail, through the lens of two of UNDP\u2019s core practices namely \u201cDemocratic Governance\u201d and \u201cConflict Prevention and Recovery\u201d. This additional analysis wil allow to deepen the reflection on the kind of governance reforms that would be critical for further development in the LDCs of the Asia-Pacific region.

Gender is thus no longer a stand-alone indicator but a cross-cuting issue that needs to be mainstreamed through all the different service lines of the governance and conflict prevention practices. V. Analsis of some key governance dimensions V.1. Parliamentary development and Electoral reforms Sustained poverty reduction requires equitable economic growth \u2013 but it also requires that poor people have political power. And the best way to achieve that is by building strong and deep forms of democratic governance. We have to recognise that democracy is not an event. It\u2019s not just an election, but a long-term process. \u2026 What is now needed \u2026is to deepen democratic culture in states that struggle to make it work (Mark Malloch Brown \u2013 UNDP Administrator). Today, the number of people living in free countries has grown to 2.7 billion people or almost 44% of the global population. But while 121 countries are now considered electoral democracies, only 89 out of these have an environment in which there is broad respect for human rights and a stable rule of law. 32 electoral democracies fail to provide systematic protection for basic civil liberties (Karatnicky, 7). The status of democracy in the 14 LDCs of the 34. In countroes with high levels of transparency, effective parliamentary oversight and high standards of corporate ethics, there was a higher rate of GDP growth than in countries with lower levels (Kaufmann 2002, 19). 35. Vietnam and China are not model democratic countries (according to Western standards), yet they achieved high GDP growth and were very successful in their poverty alleviation policies. Gambia and Tunisia have the same score on the governance index (0.47) yet Gambia\u2019s GDP shrunk by 0.2% per year while Tunisia with its proximity to European markets saw an average growth of 2.8%. Thus countries with similar governance scores often witness serious discrepancies in economic performance (McArthur & Sacks, 22). 36 Bhutan\u2019s concept of Gross National Happiness places the individual at the centre of development, recognising that he/she has material but also spiritual and emotional needs. It asserts that national development can not exclusively be defined in terms of increased consumption of goods & services (HDR Bhutan 2000, 19). The pursuit of GNH calls for a multi-dimensional approach to development that seeks to maintain harmony between four constituents of happiness: economic development, environmental preservation, cultural and spiritual values and good governance 9 Asia Pacific region also remains fragile37. There are different reasons for this: (1) corruption (Cambodia, Nepal and Bangladesh), (2) religious and ethnic tensions, civil war and insurgencies (Nepal), (3) post-conflict (Timor Leste38), (4) powerful interest groups and wide discrepancies in income (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos) and (5) distance between politicians and their constituencies (Solomon Islands39). The importance of regular and transparent elections and of a well-functioning parliament lies in its role in controlling the effectiveness of government and its contribution to combatting corruption. But in many LDCs, the legislature is either powerless, or disconnected and unaccountable to the poor. UNDP\u2019s support includes building the capacities of parliaments and legislators to ensure effective oversight over the government\u2019s operations. A more recent approach is to focus interventions on promoting a more \u201cissue-based\u201d engagement of Parliamentarians in areas that have a direct impact on achieving the MDGs: trade, ICT for development, human rights, gender, environmental management and anti-corruption (e.g. Cambodia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Laos). Increasingly also, governments are requesting UNDP to go beyond the pre-election coordinating and support role, and to engage in post-election support also at the local levels40 (e.. Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cambodia). People\u2019s participation should also materialize through the existence of a more vibrant civil society, enabled to monitor government\u2019s actions41. Indeed, in many LDCs in the region, participative governance remains very weak. So far, the focus of the governance-poverty debate has been largely on the supply side, less attention is paid to the \u2018demand\u2019 for good governance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "048324f6-b370-4805-9490-5456bd46de4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "048324f6-b370-4805-9490-5456bd46de4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4dfcaad5dcd2514cb079a79cd7dd7714eabb42932276efeae03a673d33e79886"}, "2": {"node_id": "80b0c79e-ed96-4839-839c-9d03baba3ea9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "551c99db553c378649ba4e674593dcae8efa21ff71d7e77d6a414b68ae7e0a6c"}}, "hash": "a0424ffe94a0d3d8a70f81ac4f599ae50b7aadfdbdae3363698a752ef84e5485", "text": "\u201cDemand\u201d for good governance is hampered by lack of involvement of civil society and weak social mobilisaton, often caused by lack of education and lack of information and by the fact that the poor are usually represented by others (political parties and interest groups), each with different agendas and priorities.

But there is also the example of Timor-Leste, where political reforms have been launched early in the process. In contrast to Burundi, Afghanistan and Iraq, the relative (albeit still fragile) success of the democratisation process in Timor is probably due to the strong social cohesion and the legacy of broad popular support for the revolutionary movement that now controls the political scene. Nonetheless, such social cohesion may wane rapidly if the new government cannot deliver on its promises for more employment, especially for the younger generation. 37. In Cambodia, between January 2001 and January 2002, 15 opposition members and candidates were killed (Human Rights Watch). The National Assembly does not provide a significant check to executive power. Bangladesh remained plagued by lawlessness, corruption, and violent political turbulence during 2002. 140 people were killed during the 2001 elections. In the Maldives political parties are officially discouraged, and candidates run as individuals. In 2001, Amnesty International reported that 42 people, including 3 parliamentarians filed a petition for permission to set up the Maldivian Democratic Party. The president decided against the petition. (www.freedomhouse.org) 38. Direct elections in Timor-Leste led to the country joining the ranks of electoral democracies. But a strong parliamentary opposition and vibrant media and CSOs are still not sufficiently developed (Karatnycky, 10). 39. In the Solomon Islands, the national legislature is located in the capital, and is out of direct reach of most of the rural population, except during times of national elections. The Solomon Islanders are now considering moves towards a federal system of government. 40. In Bangladesh, UNDP trained a large number of election officials and law enforcement officers and helped to computerise the voter roll and carry out voter education, focusing on women and marginalized groups. 41. In Nepal, a nascent democracy, relations between the government and the citizens are crucial as they will help the national government to gain and sustain its legitimacy. But even in one-party regimes, improving people\u2019s participation is not impossible, as witnessed recently in Laos during the preparation of the NGPES. 42 . E.g. the recent UN mission to Baghdad (February 2004) to advise the Secretary General on the right timing for Parliamentary elections in Iraq. 43 . In November 2001, Bhutan began the process of drafting a constitution for the country. The Bhutanese are trying to develop a unique political system that draws upon the strengths of Bhutan\u2019s ancient culture and traditions while incorporating useful elements of western democracy. 10 To conclude, evidence would suggest that countries that improve their rule of law, control corruption and promote voice and accountability can expect about a four-fold increase in incomes per capita in the long term, and major improvement in literacy and in child mortality (World Bank). However, the hypotheses that economic growth accelerates in an environment of political freedom is conditioned by the presence of a climate of relative political stability, and the presence of certain economic, social and political foundations that allow for some form of democracy to consolidate44. Democratic governance is not a discipline that can be lectured and then adopted rapidly; for it to become effective, it requires a societal transformation and the development of a new political culture that, depending on local context and history, often takes a few generations to consolidate. IV.4.. Improving public sector performance \u201cAn efficient, accountable, effective and transparent public administration, at both the national and international levels, has a key role to play in the implementation of internationally agreed goals, including the MDGs\u201d (Resolution 57/277 of the General Assembly on Public Administration and Development). The relatively underdeveloped private sector in many of the LDCs requires governments to play a major role in the delivery of services and the provision of much needed economic infrastructure. Yet, apart from Bhutan, Maldives, Samoa and Kiribati all other LDCs in the region score low on \u201cgovernment effectiveness\u201d. On \u00ab regulatory quality \u00bb also all LDCs, except Samoa and Maldives, score below the regional average. Apart from corruption problems, the lack of fiscal discipline and sound expenditure management and deficient service delivery appear to be the main problems. Public sector reforms, which are among the cornerstones of government effectiveness, have been undertaken in nearly all the 14 LDCs in the Asia Pacific region. But despite a substantive amount of resources allocated to this sector, results over the years remain mixed, with slow pace of implementation45. Lack of political commitment and insufficient acknowledgment, on behalf of the donors, of the highly politcal nature of civil service reforms are among the main reasons. But still insuficient research is done on how to achieve high", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3f8d43c-f896-40bb-ab45-40b221c95ce4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3f8d43c-f896-40bb-ab45-40b221c95ce4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "231de0d5d63da6100ff44206164ce07e574e3371815904c1633a132a33f03d6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c40a5a13-a182-4c58-84e7-2972ef9319b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d5a255bd61ed6db2cf4565736e21450b6f5c54fc40b30956aa4f273c44acde3"}}, "hash": "b7998abad708de58de0d0faf9d31e52fe0f454a662f4725cbb4640440d16e4c0", "text": "performance in government organisations, and even less on how this relates to successes in poverty reduction. While so far, the universal model of civil-service reform espoused the implementation of a depoliticized, merit-based system and discounting political appointments and promotions, increasingly donors now acknowledge the reality that most elected governments tend to secure the services of a cadre of trusted senior personnel. Therefore, merit-based human resource management also needs to ensure that political appointments are linked to merit selections and counterbalanced by an effective system of checks and balances. In many LDCs however, traditional patronage systems remain, checks and balances are weak and politicians maintain important discretionary powers over recruitments and promotions. Overall, we see three types of public sector reforms in the LDCs in the region. The first one is adjusted to the countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy (Laos and Cambodia). In these countries, public sector improvement is tackled through incremental reforms, that feature flexibility and pragmatism46. The second one applies to countries that are emerging from a crisis or war and that face the massive task of nation building often on the ruins of a devastated public administration (Afghanistan47 and East 44 . Several LDCs in the region are slowly moving ahead with various forms of democratic reforms. Late 2003, the Lao Government presented its Policy Paper on Governance \u201cPublic Sector reforms, People\u2019s participation, Rule of Law and Sound Financial Management to the Donor Community. The overriding theme of Bhutan\u2019s modernization process today is People\u2019s Participation and Decentralization. 45. E.g. In Bangladesh, the Public Administration Reform Commission was established in 1996. Its recommendations are still under consideration (Keuleers, PAR in Bangladesh, Mission Report, 5). 46. Both the Governance and Public Administration Reform Program (Laos) and the Partnership for Local Governance and the Support to the Committee for Administrative Reform (Cambodia) tackle central government reforms, decentralisation, deconcentration and the modernization of civil service personnel management. 47. Key elements of the public administration reform sub- component of the UNDP program include civil service legal framework, personnel management, institutional and functional streamlining, financial management and accountability, policy management and machinery of government and physical infrastructure. The program will further support in- 11 Timor). Rehabilitating basic social services and restoring law and order are part of the priorities. In the third category of LDCs management has deteriorated so badly that crisis- management requires an almost exclusive focus on restoring fiscal and monetary discipline, and measures to restore civil service performance and cost-effectiveness. This situation prevailed in several of the Pacific Islands48. Most of the reforms focused on redressing maco- economic stability through the introduction of output-based budgeting, public sector downsizing49, performance accountability, improved revenue collection, privatisation of SOE, regulatory reforms and the strengthening of parliamentary oversight. But despite massive support, government effectiveness and regulatory quality in most of these Pacific Islands remains weak. The main reason is probably the lack of national ownership over the reforms, that essentially mirrored the New Zealand model (featuring extensive privatization, output based budgeting and the introduction of private sector management approaches)50. Overall, there has been a bias towards the macro-economic aspects of reforms and reducing public expenditures, sometimes even at the expense of public sector effectiveness (ADB 1999). Questions related to equitable service delivery, mechanisms for client feedback and clear and transparent regulations seems to have been less prioritised. Cultural aspects also seem to have been overlooked51. Caution with privatization in LDCs, with small internal markets, distant external markets and high vulnerability to economic and natural risks is thus required52. \u201cWhat matters is not so much who delivers, but whether the mechanism that delivers key services also strengthens poor people\u2019s ability to monitor and discipline providers, raises their voice in policy making and gets them the effective services they need for their families\u201d (WDR 2004). The problem in many LDCs is that, whatever the delivery mechanism chosen, funds for service delivery and poverty reduction often fail to reach the poor53. Therefore, while tax reforms and expenditure management reforms are important, it is equally important to get in place internal and external systems for control and monitoring, including, where feasible, mechanisms for public participation in monitoring the quality of service delivery54 and \u201cPublic Expenditure Tracking Systems (PETS)\u201d55.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c40a5a13-a182-4c58-84e7-2972ef9319b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c40a5a13-a182-4c58-84e7-2972ef9319b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "231de0d5d63da6100ff44206164ce07e574e3371815904c1633a132a33f03d6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3f8d43c-f896-40bb-ab45-40b221c95ce4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7998abad708de58de0d0faf9d31e52fe0f454a662f4725cbb4640440d16e4c0"}}, "hash": "9d5a255bd61ed6db2cf4565736e21450b6f5c54fc40b30956aa4f273c44acde3", "text": "No size fits all and the type of service delivery mechanism needs to be tailored to the characteristics of the service and circumstances of the country.

In the Solomon Islands in the 1980\u2019s government expenditures as a percentage of GDP grew to one of the highest in the world. A ballooning public sector (consuming up to 90% of the total recurrent revenue \u2013 NHDR 2000) led to unsustainable budget deficits funded by domestic and external borrowing that led to unmanageable debt burdens. In Vanuatu also, external debt grew rapidly between the mid 1980\u2019s and mid 1990\u2019s. Samoa is an exception. In Samoa, reforms were largely local initiatives, undertaken out of conviction of their appropriateness and formulated through a broad consultative and participative process 49. In The Solomon Islands the payroll was reduced by 9% between 1998-2000, in Vanuatu the government workforce was reduced by 10% in 1996. 50. The cost of introducing the new system has not been explicitly weighed against the purported benefits (ADB, Tuvalu, p. 60). \u201cTo attempt output based budgeting was to strain administrative and technical capacities further\u2026 Introducing these new and over-ambitious systems may have been counterproductive \u2026 and may even have crowded out existing good practice\u201d (ADB, 2002, Tuvalu, p. 61). 51. It is not clear how departmental autonomy on hiring and wages combined with fixed-term contracts would work in practice in a small society (Samoa) where family and kinship ties are particularly strong (ADB 1999, 120). 52. \u201cWhile there are frequent problems with public services, it would be wrong to conclude that government should give up and leave everything to the private sector. No country has achieved significant improvement in child mortality and primary education without government involvement\u201d. (WDR, 2004). 53. Nepal saw only small increase in primary enrolment and completion rates despite the fact that expenditure on education had increased. The Middle East and North Africa region spend more on public education than any other developing region, yet it has some of the highest rates of youth illiteracy in the world (WDR 2004). 54. Participatory budgeting and gender-responsive budgeting have helped to reallocate spending to HD priorities and led to the inclusion of gender-sensitive analysis in policy making. Gender sensitive budgeting helps to ensure consistency between social commitments to achieve gender equality goals, and the resources being allocated. 55. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based NGO, has adopted the fiscal transparency code to review budget transparency in a number of countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh. The centre aims to increase civil participation in the budget process with a pro-poor and pro-environment focus (www.internationalbudget.org). 56. In Bangldaesh, UNDP will focus its support on recruitment practices and training of civil servants, including the mainstreaming of ethics in civil service training programs. 12 To conclude, where there is a need to restore greater efficiency in resource management, the quality of service delivery should not be overlooked. In other LDCs where the bureaucracy is characterized by red tape and inertia the focus has to be much more on changing attitudes, aiming to create a transparent, accountable and more client-oriented public service. Strengthening control mechanisms is imperative before one can move on to fiscal decentralisation. More ambitious reforms aiming for the development of a democratic culture, will require more time to develop. But democracy has many faces and even a one-party state can find innovative ways to boost participative governance, beyond the traditional mass organisations. Finally, while reforms have been slow, donors need to understand that PAR is a long-term political process. Increasing the speed of the reforms risks jeopardizing national ownership and long-term sustainability. IV.5. Controlling corruption - Accountability, transparency and ethics in governance Corruption remains a serious problem worldwide and in the Asia-Pacific region. LDCs seem to be particularly affected. The most recent TI Corruption Perceptions Index 200357 highlights that nine out of ten developing countries urgently need support to fight corruption.

Combatting corruption is thus one of the key governance indicators that has a direct impact on poverty. Anti-corruption measures, including aspects of accountability, transparency and ethics and integrity cut across all other dimensions of any governance and economic reform program and affect all other measures and institutions of good governance62. A free independent media is another pillar of accountability. Unfortunately, the transparency record of the LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region is not encouraging (see next section). Most LDCs in the region also face serious contraints related to the quality of social indicators and economic and financial data63. While lack of capacity is one of the reasons, deliberate 57. The TI Index 2003 ranks 133 countries in terms of the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians. It is based on surveys carried out among business people, academics and analysts. 58 If Bangladesh were able to reduce corruption levels, average annual growth rates would most probably increase by more than 2 percentage points. An extra 2-3 % increase in economic growth could cut the incidence of extreme poverty from the current 36% to 11% by the year 2020. (in Raghav, p. 39). 59. Bangladesh is a democratic country that scores very poorly on the corruption index. In contrast, Cuba scores relatively high on the TI Index (43). Authoritarian rule does not curb corruption either. Myanmar is only 4 places behind Bangladesh on the TI Index. 60. In Bangladesh, a survey of primary health care facilities found the absenteeism rate among doctors to be 74%. In random visits to 200 primary schools in India, investigators found no teaching activity in half of them (WDR 2004). 61. 88% of the countries surveyed have inactive and/or ineffective internal audit systems. 88% also are not capable to produce timely, functionally-based expenditure reports from core accounting data (IMF, March 2002, 13). 62. Several toolkits to support accountability and transparency assessments are currently available. UNDP has the CONTACT manual (Country Assessment in Accountability and Transparency); the World Bank and the EU have recently launched a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Program; the IMF uses its \u00ab Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes \u2013 ROSCs\u201d which aim to examine the clarity of fiscal management; the ADB carries out governance assessments, which also cover some of the same ground as the other instruments. 63. Using data from the IMF Kaufmann was able to identify only 13 out of the 74 potential candidates for support under the US Millennium Challenge Account that had complete budget deficit data for 1998-2000. 13 information hoarding by governments is also frequent. For this reason, the Brussels PoA stressed the need to support the LDCs in creating and promoting a comprehensive and integrated information base. While there is no single model to fight corruption, and the traditional approach of establishing anti-corruption agencies and voting anti-corruption laws may not yield the desired outcome in countries where institutional charisma is weak, the following are some suggestions for supporting LDCs in anti-corruption campaigns: \ufffd A four pronged approach to fighting corruption is usually suggested covering: prevention, enforcement, public awareness and coalition building. \ufffd Identification of key champions within government, civil society and the private sector and creation of a coailition of stakeholders who would lead anti-corruption efforts (also at the local level). \ufffd An in-depth assessment of the governance institutions, systems and processes is needed to determine areas and target groups most vulnerable to corruption. \u00ab Irrespective of what the data collection may reveal, the very fact and process of embarking on these diagnostics is in itself an important pro-governance and pro-transparency move \u00bb. (Kaufmann & Kaay, 14). \ufffd Continue to seek coalition with the leadership (elected officials as well as the traditional chiefs). \ufffd Building checks and balances within the reform process that span government as well as non- government actors: e.g. monitoring by independent think tanks and advocacy groups (e.g. report cards); social audits performed by CSOs; Public Expenditure Tracking Systems (PETS64). \ufffd Focus attention on the political aspects of the reform (transparency and access to information, diminishing of discretion, clarity regarding lines of accountability and space for citizens to hold officials and service providers accountable) and strengthen prevention within institutions.

The UNCAC provides a comprehensive framework for dealing with international and domestic corruption in the public and private sectors.

The most challenging phase will be to transform treaty provisions into action programs. IV.6. Access to information Freedom of the Press in Asia and the Pacific In Cambodia, a press law from 1995 permits the Information Ministry to suspend newspapers and broadly prohibits publishing articles that affect national security or political stability. In Bangladesh, journalists face considerable pressure from organized-crime groups, political parties, etc. A report published by Reporters Sans Frontieres in June 2003 alleged that Bangladesh had the highest incidence worldwide of violence against members of the press. In Bhutan criticism of the political system is not tolerated. In Myanmar, the junta sharply restricts press freedom, owning or tightly controlling all daily newspapers and radio and television stations and jailing dissident journalists. In the Maldives the law allows authorities to shut newspapers and sanction journalists for articles containing unfounded criticism of the government. In Nepal, conditions for journalists deteriorated sharply in 2002, due to emergency regulations that restricted press and publication rights as well as free access to information. In Laos, all newspapers are state controlled. The Anti-corruption decree stipulates that journalist, prior to reporting on corrupt practices, must first seek authorisation from relevant organisations. (Freedom House). In many developing countries, restrictions remain on basic civil liberties \u2013 the rights to free speech, assembly and information. Access to information (one of UNDP\u2019s new service lines) and freedom of expression are basic human rights which are considered prerequisites for ensuring voice and participation and thus a key weapon in the fight against poverty and corruption. A healthy democratic culture, whatever its form, depends on an open society. Access to information laws are critical tools but these also require certain foundations to be meaningful and applicable. Although the Constitutions of many LDCs guarantee the right to information, the denial of such right remains widespread. Recent health concerns (such as HIV- AIDS and SARS) as well as environmental degradation have somewhat fueled the demand for 64. In Uganda, the first PETS (early 90\u2019s) indicated that 90% of funds intended for primary schools were diverted before they reached the schools. Ten years later that figure was reduced to only 10%. All transfers of funds are now advertised and school committees have been trained on how to use that information and take action if necessary. 14 access to information but in traditionnaly secretive bureaucracies information itself remains a source of power which people do not want to share. Certain foundations need to be in place (appeals mechanisms, an information-sharing culture, whistleblower protection etc.) many of which are still lacking in LDCs. Freedom of Information laws may be premature for certain countries, but a more vigurous culture of openess, a strong civil society and government supported public information campaigns can produce real advances even without a law being in place. Also important is the training of media personnel and increasing the number of female media professionals. The internet offers many new opportunities to facilitate government\u2019s interaction with citizens and the private sector. Internet users are rapidly increasing in many LDCs, especially in the urban centers. The majority of the 14 governments have seased the opportunities and now have websites with official information. But most of these technologies are inaccessible to the poor In several countrries, UNDP therefore supports efforts to make media outlets freely available to the poor. Budget hearings, PETS as well as \u201cone-stop-shops\u201d65 also offer a valid mechanism for facilitating access to information on government services and benefits. IV.7. Decentralisation and local governance66 In line with the democratization wave of the past 15 years, an increasing number of countries, including LDCs are narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas and between central government and local communities through the implementation of various decentralisation policies67. This explains the steep rise in local governance issues in many LDCs. Because decentralisation and good local governance increase the possibility of people\u2019s participation in the development process, it is generally assumed that there is a positive correlation between decentralization and poverty reduction. But despite considerable decentralization in the Asian region over the past decade, the benefits of development still haven\u2019t been distributed equitably for the benefit of the poor. While links between decentralization and poverty reduction have been noted68, a serious debate continues on whether the two are necessarily mutually supportive69.

In many LDCs, such favorable conditions are not in place71. To limit the risks, the Brussels Programme of Action proposes to \u00ab promote broad based popular participation in development, inter alia through decentralization, where appropriate\u201d. For example, devolution seems to increase the risks of local misuse of funds or corruption as more funds and more powers are devolved to a new untrained local leadership and local administration (Fjeldstad 20). Capacity demands and constraints72, especially for financial 65. Learning from Vietnam where the one-stop-shop concept was piloted in Ho Chi Minh City and then replicated throughout the country, Laos is now also starting to test the one-stop-shop idea in two pilot provinces. 66. Decentralisation usually falls into two main categories : (1) deconcentration or administrative decentralisation and (2) devolution or political decentralisation. Local governance comprises \u201ca set of institutions, mechanisms and processes through which citizens and their groups can articulate their interests and needs, mediate their differences and exercise their rights and obligations, at the local level\u201d. 67. Most LDCs in the region are involved in some form of decentralisation. Tuvalu has a population of some 10,000 people but there is strong popular pressure to transfer powers and resources from the capital to the outer islands. 68. The ESCAP Report (2003) also mentions \u00ab decentralisation \u00bb as vital for the achievement of the MDGs. 69. To feed this debate, UNDP\u2019s Regional Governance Programme for Asia in 2003 launched a project \u00ab Decentralised Governance and Poverty Reduction in Asia \u00bb. 70. E.g. although both countries were centralised, South Korea achieved far better service delivery at the local level than India, because of the existence of stronger communication and monitoring mechanisms (Fjeldstad 2003, 11). 71. In Bhutan there is a need to clarify service delivery responsibilities before one can decide on the amount of funding required to execute those functions (Larsen p. 5). In Cambodia, an important gap in the decentralisation process is the absence of a strategy for implementing the deconcentration policies. In Laos, the decentralisation policy launched in the 1980's failed for two reasons: (1) key macro-economic functions such had also been devolved to or shared with the local authorities; (2) no control systems had been put in place to ensure the safeguarding of national interests. Since 2000, the government launched a policy of improved deconcentration (Laos NHDR 2000). 72. The constraints that hamper the embryonic decentralised system in Cambodia include tight budgets, limited financial autonomy, over-reliance on external funds, bureaucratic resistance, a lack of social cohesion, limited community involvement in decision-making and the prevailing power structure in the villages. The benefits to the poor from decentralised initiatives in the short term are likely to be limited 15 management are also much more stringent73. Based on cross-country data of 78 countries, de Melo & Barenstein concluded that the higher the share of grants from central (or provincial) government, the stronger the correlation between decentralisation and good governance (de Mello & Barenstein, 14). Crook adds that locally raised revenues in LDCs are almost by definition inadequate (Crook, 10). But most interesting, research reveals that \u201cgovernments of countries that are administratively decentralized (deconcentration) tend to spend a higher proportion of their revenues on pro-poor social spending while politically decentralized states spend little on social sectors. The research concludes that \u201cthere is no consistent, significant statistical association between the degree of fiscal decentralization and pro-poor public spending\u201d 74. Another problem is the over-reliance on donor funding to support the decentralization and local governance programs75. Also important is to carefully study the political context76 as well as social implications of poverty such as migration to the urban areas to escape rural poverty, creating additional urban poverty problems77 (social exclusion, unemployment and lack of social networks, childlabour, environmental and sanitary degradation, violence and juvenal crime, prostitution and HIV-AIDS exposure). It is also common for local self-governing institutions to be captured by the local elites, so that little or no redistribution in favor of the poor takes place78.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "941307b2-1e56-4a3a-9935-b33a39debf98": {"__data__": {"id_": "941307b2-1e56-4a3a-9935-b33a39debf98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "326cb1d8cab1e695627d02c15f4997e87ca1bace7c055b78229d1df21c2f4e66"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2d04af0-fdf0-40d5-b876-d24e569d1667", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "512c8919c5ce12eadf015f4ee0c54bd3c7b8b830de33036b2bdb9eb00cc9e04a"}}, "hash": "aeab5eedd33689ad4e7e59218d4193015cf02c00fc4c8107fff9457b16725cb0", "text": "The extent of capture depends on the level of social inequality, regularity and fairness of elections79, transparency in decision making and media attention.

In addition to the \u201cformal\u2019 institutions involved in local governance, special attention also needs to be paid to the effective participation of the local communities, through social mobilization, taking into account local culture and social fabric81. Even the poorest communities are capable of organising themselves to improve their well-being82. Opponents will argue that many LDCs do not have the resources required to support such empowerment policies. However, case studies described in Rhagav\u2019s study \u00ab Decentralisation and Poverty Alleviation in Asia \u00bb all suggest 73. Of the 24 HIPCs, half are actively pursuing decentralisation strategies (IMF, March 2002), but the IMF acknowledges that capacities for public expenditure management at those levels are very weak. 74. Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex: www.id21.org/society/s8aas1g1.html 75. In Cambodia it is unclear how the capacity and functions currently performed by the multi-donor Partnership for Local Governance Project can be internalised at the provincial and national levels. With a Provincial Investment Fund entirely funded by donors, it remains to be seen whether in the absence of the PIF the provincial administration would be able to respond to commune and inter-commune priorities. In Bhutan, capital development expenditures are funded solely by donor agencies and even recurrent costs are partly covered from external sources. Plans to allocate block grants to the Dzongkhags and Geogs will depend on donor commitment. 76. In Solomon Islands the history of political movements seeking greater devolution and decentralisation has continued into the independence area. It explains the current debate on a federal form of government. 77. Urban population growth has been high in a number of LDCs in the Asia-Pacific region. In Myanmar 28% of the population lives in the city. In Bangladesh 25.5%. The SIDS also face problems due to urban migration : Maldives (28%), Samoa and Vanuatu (22%) and Solomon Islands (20%). Source : HDR 2003. The population of Bhutan\u2019s capital Thimpu is growing at an alarming annual rate of 10% (NHDR Bhutan 2000). 78. Different scenarios are possible. If the central authority seeks to build its power base in the country side through an alliance with the local elite, then devolution of power and allocation of resources will occur, but pro-poor outcomes are very unlikely. If the central authority challenges or circumvents powerful local groups, then this may result in a centrally- funded poverty reduction strategy, implemented through decentralised bodies in a tightly controlled framework. The third scenario is where local elites exert no significant autonomous power. Decentralisation then primarily takes the form of deconcentration, but pro-poor outcomes can be achieved (Crook, 6). 79. The ability to sustain a system of fair and competitive elections emerges a key factor in the most successful cases of decentralisation (Crook, 31). 80. The Nepalese society comprises of many castes and ethnic groups. Strong patrimonial and patriarchal systems have long existed to perpetuate the dominance of the elite. (NHDR Nepal). In Bangladesh, rural works programs serve the interests of a narrow elite (Turner (Ed.), p.27). 81. In Papua New Guinea, social mobilization failed because of significant ethnic diversity and weak civil society groups. Social mobilisation was more successful in Bougainville where communities are much smaller. In Cambodia, as a consequence of the Khmer Rouge\u2019s disastrous experiment in mass mobilisation, there is a general lack of cohesion, trust and solidarity, which impacts on the level of community participation (Raghav, 17). In Laos, where villages are small and homogenous, the demonstrated success of village forestry committees in managing forest resources show that poor communities are capable to take a more long-term view on the use of their environment. 82. In Afghanistan, during the years of severe national upheaval, social mobilization helped many communities organise themselves into informal structures of local governance, at various levels of the Afghan society. 16 that resources are actually less important than attitudes and accountability of those who are to deliver the services, whether they are teachers, nurses or tax collectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16d7e127-a0e3-4542-a9f8-2717f040aaa5": {"__data__": {"id_": "16d7e127-a0e3-4542-a9f8-2717f040aaa5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d088713fcfef853fc034ccddc491a09453a705c4369da2dc995ea4f3adf8ebc1"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0eb0ead-1ceb-4b34-b6d3-14b5512b796a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31dc218349a40df78537d7c648af9a94028f9feddb66029c3dfe2061befd0c0e"}}, "hash": "fef0d9c50f2a51ece35eaa051d8002ed251f3664b5ae40b5ca64fa0f0f8e219d", "text": "\u201cOver time, the greater transparency offered by increased participation of poorer groups, and their developing skills at influencing decision-making at the local levels may well assist them in curbing the power of rural elites to appropriate benefits (Manor, 1999).

To conclude, while decentralization can contribute significantly to governance effectiveness, political stability and voice and accountability, the links between policy changes for decentralisation and impact are yet to be fully captured. In the meantime, the following conclusions can be drawn on decentralization as a possible enabling factor for poverty eradication and achieving the MDGs: o Decentralization is not a technically neutral device that can be implemented regardless of social and political context. Decentralisation is a political processes that deals essentially with the distribution of power and resources. There is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution for the region83. o Decentralisation is not a quick-fix. It is a long-term process of transformation that requires long-term strategies and a coordinated approach84. o The pace of decentralisation should be incremental and care should be given not to rush into fiscal devolution without having all conditions in place. o Concepts of fiscal, administrative and political decentralization are distinct in practice; it is thus appropriate to design decentralization policies that combine different degrees of centralization/decentralization. o Capacity development of central and local levels, and civil society is important . IV.8. Human rights and access to justice a) Human rights and Access to Justice in Asia Pacific Poverty cannot be simply measured in terms of per capita income; it is a multidimensional concept that also includes deprivations in access to basic services and knowledge. Poverty is thus the most crucial denial of human rights as it implies discrimination and injustice and destroys human dignity. This explains why an increased emphasis on human rights (especially for women and excluded groups) is key in the strategy to achieve the MDGs (HDR 2003)85. Human rights provide a framework for equality and non-discrimination. Until recently, UNDP\u2019s support to justice programmes focused mainly on building institutional capacities. Insufficient attention was paid to facilitating access to justice and promoting human rights as a means to protect the freedom of choices, combat poverty and prevent conflicts86. The rights-based approach to development is radically changing the way UNDP is designing its legal reform programmes. Except for Samoa, Maldives, Bhutan, Vanuatu and Kiribati, all LDCs score below the regional average on the \u00ab rule of law \u00bb indicator87. Countries like Afghanistan, Laos, Myanmar and 83. Study of the South Pacific shows that demands for decentralisation are not related simply to the size of a country. Even the smallest country can be perceived as being too centralised (Turner (Ed.), 163). 84. With regard to a number of LDCs in the region who only recently embarked on decentralisation, it is simply too soon to evaluated the impact of these policies on the lives of the poor. 85. At the Millennium Summit the world leaders resolved to spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law as well as respect for all internationally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development. 86. Jointly with OHCHR, UNDP has created a special program to support the implementation of a human rights policy (HURIST \u2013 Human Rights Strengthening). In partnership with the NGO network \u201cthe People\u2019s Movement for Human Rights Education\u201d, UNDP also undertook a global program for Human Rights Cities. 87. But a strong legal system does not necessarily imply tolerance of political freedoms and civic rights. An autocratic regime can adhere strictly to a consistent legal system that is anti-democratic in its foundations. 17 Cambodia score particularly low. As to the respect for human rights in the LDCs in the region, an analysis of the reports of the UNHCHR and other documents point to the following problems: weak justice sectors and related problems of impunity (Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Afghanistan, Timor-Leste); widespread corruption of judges and the police (Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar88, Bangladesh); weak access to justice and lack of legal support systems (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Pacific Islands, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste); trafficking of women and children and related problems of child prostitution, child labour and HIV-AIDS exposure89 (Cambodia, Bangladesh, Laos, Nepal) ; access to land90 and related human rights abuses (Cambodia, Afghanistan, some Pacific Islands, Timor-Leste) ; gender discrimination and sexual abuse of women and girls (Afghanistan91, Cambodia).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "837707af-4032-408b-bada-fdb7303327eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "837707af-4032-408b-bada-fdb7303327eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a80ca4ce7d7cc2cabee34398f61ebe500ddaa1d9dc82171019375b14966c52e"}, "2": {"node_id": "317c8e30-5550-4d10-9b57-0f8c8a5c328b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7475b65aa2be5807f4d138c428951d5daee0e2a3344e98cedbceaf698306ba75"}}, "hash": "8d4e2f73fbee0c52897fcf314311d5e11b9b7144adb2cfec19a75d3ce372e0af", "text": "b) The rights-based approach to development and to access to justice Upholding human rights is crucial for securing a humane and non-discriminatory society, and hence, for eradicating poverty.

The rights-based approach puts the poor and the marginalized groups at the core of policy and at the focus of development strategies. A rights-based approach to access to justice thus concentrates on the rights of disadvantaged groups (women, minorities, persons with HIV/AIDS etc.), ensuring that their rights are safeguarded and respected. Therefore, it also focuses on the capacities and accountability of duty bearers (police, judges etc.) to fulfil human rights obligations. Access to justice and justice sector reform priorities will obviously vary in different country contexts. In countries where there is already a functioning, judicial system (e.g. Samoa) access to justice provides an entry point to further justice sector reform. In countries that are undergoing reconstruction after conflicts and crises92, access to justice is essential to eliminate impunity and ensure accountability. Here the promotion of democracy requires first the putting in place of laws, policies and institutions that guarantee respect for al human rights and fundamental freedoms. But in many of the other LDC countries, where the justice sector still lacks integrity, focusing on access for the poor to a corrupt and/or poorly trusted justice system may not be the appropriate starting point. Problems related to access to justice in the LDCs in the region include the following: \ufffd Lack of understanding of the rule of law Rule of law refers to the foundation of a legal system where (1) no person can be above the law, (2) all persons are equally protected under the law and (3) justice is secured for all through access to effective remedies. Rule of law is not synonymous with \u201crule by law\u201d. It is also more than the sum of laws, courts and other formal institutions. It is a normative system that resides 88. In April 2003, a UNCHR Resolution accused Myanmar of \"a continuing pattern of gross and systematic violations of human rights\" including extra judicial or arbitrary executions, enforced disappearances; rape, torture, inhuman treatment, forced labour; forced relocation and the denial of freedom of assembly, association, expression and religion, the lack of an independent judiciary; and delaying the process of national reconciliation and democratisation. 89. Many of Cambodia's estimated 80,000 to 100,000 prostitutes, 1/3 of whom are under 18, are trafficking victims. According to ILO, organized gangs in Nepal traffic some 5,000 to 7,000 women and girls per year to work in Indian brothels. The majority of prostitutes who return to Nepal are HIV-positive. 90. According to Cambodian human rights groups, military and civilian officials have in recent years forcibly evicted several thousand families from their land. The dispute resolution procedures set up to settle land disputes are plagued by inconsistency, a lack of transparency, and conflicts of interest among committee members. 91. In Afghanistan, improvements in human rights, particularly in the areas of media freedom, were tempered by reports of continuing violations of women's rights andviolence against ethnic minorities (Freedom House). 92. In Afghanistan UNDP established the Law and Order Trust Fund, which accords first priority to covering police salaries. Further, UNDP will promote introduction of human rights into Afghan law and strengthening of judicial institutions. It will also help the HR Commission to implement a program of public education on HR, and build its capacity to process complaints and petitions to solve conflicts. In Timor-Leste, there is dissatisfaction with the functioning of the justice system, pointing to a mounting backlog of cases, inconsistent ruling and illegal orders as proof. UNDP\u2019s support program to the Justice Sector aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the justice system including the use of technology. A project to support capacity building in the Police Institution is also in the pipeline. 18 in the members of a society (Carothers, 8). But despite common use of the term worldwide, its content remains abstract, and little concrete knowledge is available on how rule of law actually develops in a society (Carothers, 6). Links between the predictability of the legal system and levels of investment, or quality of democracy, appear less evident than commonly thought93 and too often, a one-size-fits-all solution to affect the rule of law in a country seems to be applied. \ufffd Corruption and abuse of power The reports of the HR Commissioner point to serious problems of corruption in the judiciary (Cambodia, Bangladesh, Laos, Myanmar), directly affecting the institutions that are to provide legal protection for all other human rights, in particular the right to a fair trial and to protection from discrimination. \ufffd Distance In a number of LDCs access to the court system and to the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0d0c8ef-15c1-442f-9c84-6c0163537c29": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0d0c8ef-15c1-442f-9c84-6c0163537c29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d535441b5ad2755f1a505b41262a182de856d7b399d1f653918f9e6498dbdac"}, "3": {"node_id": "198a9ac6-16a8-4043-8fe6-d771aacb24be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1b90646338f814c1e8833eb0c030df3cab93ade3b2b51994486784ab0ac612c"}}, "hash": "af41ae1fcf232e689492c225f1dd40d67a667a0a085c036ad2d62ceef8729425", "text": "formal institutions for the protection of human rights is difficult, simply because they are miles away from the local communities (South Pacific, Laos, Afghanistan, Nepal, Maldives). Similar problems apply to legal enforcement agencies, adding to the climate of impunity94. \ufffd Lack of capacities Newly created institutions often find themselves with insufficient resources to operate95. Special Human Rights Institutions or Ombudsmen are not yet available in some LDCs (e.g. Laos, Myanmar). Because of the paucity of locally trained manpower a number of judges sitting in the High/Supreme Court or Court of Appeal of South Pacific Island states are expatriate judges96. \ufffd Lack of legal aid facilities In a number of LDCs, legal aid services are rare and where they exist they are often weak97. CSOs working on access to justice promote awareness of rights and remedies; they may be equipped to provide legal aid, or otherwise facilitate access to the institutions of the justice system. But in a number of LDCs such NGOs are either not available or there is no legal framework that allows them to operate (e.g. Laos). The barefoot lawyers from South Africa are lawyers who have not completed their degrees. They run advice offices in areas that are inaccessible. They educate poor people about their rights, help them access state services, act as a conduit for access to free legal services, and provide mediation services and lobbying for people\u2019s rights. The government took them seriously. There are now some 400 active members but after 15 years they still remain dependent on donors (Carothers, 39). \ufffd Conflict between the formal law system and the customary law system Focusing technical assistance mainly on Institutional capacity building and support to legislative drafting is being questioned (Hugh, 6). The problem seems to be particularly stringent in the South Pacific, where formal laws are misunderstood or ignored by the local population98. As a result, formal legal systems operate side by side with customary tribunals99, formal legislation 93. China, the largest recipient of FDI in the developing world is a country known for its lack of Western-style rule of law (Carothers, 6). In some established Western democracies, there are shortcomings in the rule of law also. (id. 7). 94. The local court of Isabel province in the Solomon Islands only sat once throughout the year 2002. The police is not operational due to lack of fuel for their boats (UNDP Fiji, 2002, 7) and also because of severe understaffing. 95. E.g. the Afghan Human Rights Commission established after the Bonn agreements does not yet have sufficient resources to effectively carry out its mandate. Judges in Isabel province in the Solomon Islands have no legal training and key government officials, judges, police officers and prison staff lack understanding of HR concepts. 96. Numerous countries have employed expatriate Judges at one point or another in their histories. usually for reasons of legitimacy, because of the lack of local capacity or both (the Seychelles, Hong Kong, Macau, Namibia, etc.). The general trend in all of these countries has been to phase out the services of expatriate Judges and prescribe the requirement of citizenship for appointment to judicial office (Bangkok SURF, 2002). 97. In Vanuatu the office of the Public Solicitor has two staff to serve the whole country (Hugh, 23). In Laos, the Ministry of Justice issued licenses to 19 BAR members. 17 members are currently under probation for one year. 98. Many law practitioners in the South Pacific were trained in Australia, New Zealand and the USA. Only in 1994 a Bachelor of Law programme was established in the University of South Pacific. 99. In some islands these indigenous courts (such as customary land tribunals) have been institutionalised (Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu) and appeals against traditional court verdicts can be lodged with the formal courts. In Vanuatu, customary land tribunals are supervised by the Supreme Court. 19 and international treaties exist alongside customary traditions and universal human rights compete with local values and customs100 (Hugh, 6).

The approach to promote rule of law should be comprehensive and inclusive aiming at incorporating socio-cultural norms and traditional systems. Under the new rights-based approach, donor support to increase human rights education for both duty holders and duty bearers will be an important trend in the near future. Since violence and crime have a negative impact on poverty, special attention needs to be paid to strengthening security while applying a rights-based approach to capacity development programs for security forces. But while substantive progress was made over the past years, the security dilemnas that countries around the globe are facing since September 11, the growth of international terrorist networks and the risk of nuclear proliferation have now triggered the debate on the danger of compromising the rule of law and human rights for national security reasons. Measures taken in response to these security threats risk violating human rights such as the presumption of innocence, prohibition of torture, the right to a fair trial and rights to freedom of expression and association (HDR 2002, 99)104. IV.9. LDCs in conflict and post-conflict situations a) Crisis in the Asia-Pacific region In the 1990\u2019s a number of LDCs have been exposed to a crisis in governance manifested by the persistence of corruption, poorly conceived and weakly implemented policies, erosion of social norms and accumulation of political and social conflict. Today, out of the 14 LDCs, at least 4 are in a conflict-post-conflict situation (Afghanistan, Nepal, Solomon Islands and Timor- Leste) and no less than 9 of them have been defined by the World Bank as being Low Income Countries under Stress (LICUS). Armed conflict and terrorism often have deep developmental roots in human poverty issues. Given that the Asia Pacific region contains the largest number of people living in income poverty and that 36% of the world\u2019s poor reside in South Asia, it is not surprising that both intra- nation and inter-nation conflict is growing in this sub-region. Equally disrupting is the growing incidence of HIV/AIDS making the South Asian region the second highest infected after South Africa. The burden of achieving humane security in all corners of the Asia Pacific region thus represents a very heavy challenge for the coming ten years. Consequently, the Brussels Plan of Action contains the goal of pursuing national policies and strategies to promote confidence 100. In Vanuatu, traditional courts lack independence in decision-making and there is confusion as to the basis upon which the traditional courts exercise their jurisdiction (Hugh, 33). The extended family system and other societal obligations also tend to influence the administration of justice. 101. The customary law system is often seen to be more accessible at the grassroots level, and it can bring disputes to a rapid close (Hugh, 37). But while in some islands these tribunals operate fairly well, in others they are very weak as the chiefs lack experience, knowledge of the law and of human rights (Vanuatu, Solomon Islands). 102. In Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu human rights education and awareness-raising with respect to formal and informal systems is undertaken by governmental bodies (human rights commissions and ombudsmen). 103. Except for Vanuatu ,where the Civil Procedure Rules make it part of the adjudication system in the country, other countries in the region have left it to individual discretion to decide on whether or not to go to arbitration. But in the Pacific, chiefs play an important arbitration role especially when land issues are involved. 104. Torture is prohibited under all circumstances by international human right law. But some governments have suggested that exceptional measures can be necessary in the public interest to obtain information from alleged terrorists. There are also concerns about governments taking advantage of the war against terrorism to constrain liberties, suppress political criticism or ill-treat those in retention (Global Governance Initiative, 2004 Report). 20 building and conflict prevention in countries affected by conflict, to promote peaceful settlement of disputes, reconciliation105 and post-conflict peace building106. With its focus on democratic governance for poverty reduction, UNDP is clearly at the centre of United Nations conflict prevention and peace building activities and plays a central role in UN peace building efforts in the region107. b) Challenges in post-conflict countries Experiences in conflict and post conflict countries in the region and beyond indicate the following key areas of intervention (the relative importance of different factors varies considerably between countries, so targeted responses will need to be tailored to the specific needs and context of the country): o Rule of law and access to justice: including security", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba3c86d3-7111-41f7-ae29-485f26cc7271": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba3c86d3-7111-41f7-ae29-485f26cc7271", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecfddc5ab1c6d662165c2148f455837e325b421ace254ecaffc5acfa8aa663fe"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ead4912-0447-4a2b-8295-f0f76c0f92af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b9bc9f30d2f4b6a0ab518f0bcb8dfd1d0d5981eae77180545074c1496a63bb7"}}, "hash": "3bd6f4e2614b7978c106f73c563f486cdc71c59f5f6d91db877313aa95aa4639", "text": "sector reforms108, collection of small arms, establishment of courts and key human rights institutions; o Strengthening mechanisms at the local level that empower local communities109; o Effective delivery of services in an inclusive manner; o Creation of new economic opportunities for manufacturing leading to economic diversification beyond the traditional agricultural production base; o Creation of employment opportunities (and special attention to youth110); o Strengthening of key public sector institutions111 at the local and national level (for HR management/pay-roll and sound financial management systems112). Decentralisation policies may seem easier to implement in post conflict countries than in established centralised bureaucracies, because of the pressure for change and possible \u201coverload\u201d at the centre, pushing for local communities to get involved in the nation-building process. In some cases, decentralisation is seen as a possible solution to the conflict situation113. In the case of Afghanistan, extending authority and accountability beyond the centre remains one barrier to overcome to achieve sustainable peace (UNDP Democratic Governance Network Discussion, June 2003). But the challenges are daunting, because of security threats, a weak resource base and lack of capacity114. Programs in post conflict countries always include a risk that too many efforts are directed to institutions and reconstruction processes without sufficient attention to reconciliation and political consensus building. To avoid this, the following actions need to be taken (ibid.): 105. UNDP Nepal established a Trust Fund project \u201cSupport for Peace and Development Initiative\u201d that supports innovative local initiatives envisioned by civil society organizations in addressing the various causes of social unrest and violence through community mobilization. All activities must be initiated and carried out by Nepali actors, they must be non-political in nature and they must encourage collaboration of two or more civil society organizations. 106. Initially conceived as a post-conflict activity, the definition of peace building was expanded by the Security Council (February 2001) to encompass \u201cpreventing the outbreak, the recurrence or continuation of armed conflict.\u201d It was further noted that peace building efforts should \u201cfocus on fostering sustainable institutions and processes to support the eradication of poverty and inequalities, governance, the promotion of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law and the promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence.\u201d 107. In 2001, the Emergency Response Division became the \u201cBureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR)\u201d. 108.Priority in Afghanistan is the creation of a well-trained, well-equipped and regularly paid national police service, with a genuinely integrated ethnic composition and a solid understanding of human rights principles. 109. The challenge, where state institutions are weak, is to carry out rapid community support projects without further undermining existing state institutions. Authorities at central and local level must be engaged in these programmes. 110. The Brussels PoA pointed to a further need to engage the energies of the young people who currently form more than 50% of the population of the LDCs. The higher the proportion of young men in a society, the higher the risk of conflict. However, each year of education reduces this risk by around 20%. (UNDP, Licus Position paper,3). Youth and Governance projects, such as the one piloted by UNDP with the Thai Ministry of Education merit attention. 111. UNDP assisted the Afghan Interim Authority with the establishment of a payroll system for the 240,000 civil servants in 32 provinces, basic repairs for government buildings and the establishment of national commissions as mandated by the Bonn Agreements (Constitutional commission, Judicial Reform Commission, Civil Service Commission, Human Rights Commission). (Note of the Administrator on Afghanistan) 112. More centralised/controlled financial management is required during the initial years of post-conflict process. 113. The Solomon Islands are currently exploring the possibility of a Constitutional change in favour of a Federal system. The process is risky as it is generally acknowledged that the capacity for governance at the sub-national levels is highly deficient. Also, the situation in the Pacific has highlighted that a devolved system is as open to conflict as a deconcentrated one (Turner (ed), 158). 114. In Nepal, security threats from the Maoist insurgency has disrupted the decentralisation process seriously forcing a number of local government representatives to resign and close their offices. In more than 10 districts, parallel district and village governments have been declared and in at least 7 the government introduced the Security Act, which shifts all development initiatives away from the DCCs (NHDR 2002). 21 o Consultations with broadest possible community of stakeholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ead4912-0447-4a2b-8295-f0f76c0f92af": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ead4912-0447-4a2b-8295-f0f76c0f92af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecfddc5ab1c6d662165c2148f455837e325b421ace254ecaffc5acfa8aa663fe"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba3c86d3-7111-41f7-ae29-485f26cc7271", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bd6f4e2614b7978c106f73c563f486cdc71c59f5f6d91db877313aa95aa4639"}}, "hash": "6b9bc9f30d2f4b6a0ab518f0bcb8dfd1d0d5981eae77180545074c1496a63bb7", "text": "21 o Consultations with broadest possible community of stakeholders. o A careful study of power sharing (looking also at cultural and traditional patterns of decision- making and land issues115) o Options should be provided rather than predefined/imported solutions116. o Create a transitional government that appreciates", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6935e15-c5a3-48d9-9563-2ac14aeeb2d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6935e15-c5a3-48d9-9563-2ac14aeeb2d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa0e657556af3ce980c6911f2811ff871dc412905190b8206f8dd45d2b8eac81"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ce6e0cd-26ed-4b89-b3e0-924592d37391", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "904ed39017c84d8921253c50bbabd356a51f55481ce7dc6d2e2ed3f98e926cd1"}}, "hash": "fad81b269a7be822bdd9c5dc87093e3935cb7927d110c3a6707ff60afb711898", "text": "ethnic and regional balance. o Justice building needs to be addressed early in the process. o The process of establishing a Constitution is a powerful opportunity for nation building linking local communities with political leaders.

But actual aid disbursements to post-conflict countries don\u2019t seem to reflect these needs and absorptive capacity. \u201cAid flows are too small and arrive in a rush in the first few years of peace, tapering out just as they should be accelerating\u201d (Licus, p. 6)117. The following are some lessons learned from activities in conflict and post-conflict countries118: \u2022 National ownership: Ownership needs to be addressed in any capacity building activity, and should be sought as early as possible, including information to the larger public. Building consensus around the diversity of concepts and ideas is one of the most important challenges when developing the governance system in a post-conflict country. \u2022 Simplicity: First world solutions cannot be imposed on third world conditions. \u2022 Flexibility and adaptation: because of frequent changes in political, economic and social environment, there is a need for flexibility in programme management. \u2022 Stability and security is a constant concern. The early years of building a democratic state tend to be most perilous (HDR 2000, p. 85). Rapid transition from one political state to another tends to increase the level of stress and thus increase the likelihood of tension119. Priority is thus to set up institutions of government that will contribute to national stability. Traditional structures can play a key role in conflict management and resolution. Adequate attention needs to be paid to political realities120. \u2022 Strong field presence with sufficient decentralised decision-making powers is required121. \u2022 Tangible results: comprehensive reforms are usually not well understood by the population. While there are no quick fixes, early visible successes, well communicated to all stakeholders, can sustain popular support for the long and difficult change process. \u2022 Timeliness: delivering timely assistance is one of the most critical elements of success. The initial years of post-conflict offer opportunities that need to be acted upon rapidly. \u2022 Increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in institutions and mechanisms for preventing, managing and resolving conflict122. d) Licus and difficult partnership Lack of progress made over the years, and the perpetuating decline of governance in a number of countries raised questions among donors as to whether they should disengage totally from these countries or, if not, how then to better ensure the effectiveness of their assistance. LICUS and the Difficult Partnership Policy are donor responses to these questions. 115. In the Solomon Islands ownership of land is vested in the clan. It is a source of political and economic power and fundamental for an islander\u2019s identity. This explains the influence of land tenure on social conflict. 116. E.g. UNDP & Ireland Aid, Timor-Leste, Local Government Options Study, Final Report, June 2003. 117 Mozambique received massive aid after the civil war along with policy reform and institutional reform; this has led to a high rate of economic growth. 118 .

Over the past 100 years, transitional polities had twice more violent conflicts than did autocratic polities (Freedom House Annual Report 2003). 120. In Cambodia, the WB pushed for downsizing the civil service even though the political coalition created by the peace accords was partly based on expanding the civil service to absorb a large number of functionaries from incoming parties (WB Operations Evaluation Department 1998 \u2013 Prem Notes, Oct. 2003, nr 79). 121. Many of the donor agency staff in post-conflict countries are volunteers and junior officers, often with limited experience in the area of conflict and post conflict management. 122. In October 2000 the UN Security Council adopted a Resolution in this regard. In Afghanistan, women were included in the Bonn talks in December 2001 and two women serve on the interim government.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ce6e0cd-26ed-4b89-b3e0-924592d37391": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ce6e0cd-26ed-4b89-b3e0-924592d37391", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa0e657556af3ce980c6911f2811ff871dc412905190b8206f8dd45d2b8eac81"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6935e15-c5a3-48d9-9563-2ac14aeeb2d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fad81b269a7be822bdd9c5dc87093e3935cb7927d110c3a6707ff60afb711898"}}, "hash": "904ed39017c84d8921253c50bbabd356a51f55481ce7dc6d2e2ed3f98e926cd1", "text": "22 The LICUS group has been defined as countries that feature an unfriendly environment for private sector activity, have exclusive rather than inclusive policies, have high levels of corruption and arbitrariness in public sector decision-making123 (WB, Licus, 3).

According to the WDR 2004, the following LDCs from the region are identified as LICUS countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. The strategy adopted towards these countries goes along two lines: (1) Sustained improvement in policies, institutions and governance (seeking reforms that are likely to result in a rapid and substantial payoff, and (2) Improvement in the provision of basic social services. The focus is on service delivery, but given the high risk of corruption and opportunism, the LICUS taskforce had proposed the use of \u201cIndependent Service Authorities124\u201d, transitional bodies with special incentives that would be largely autonomous from government and accountable for performance to a board with strong donor presence (Ibid, 8). Another key feature in the LICUS is the need for stronger partnerships and donor coordination. An agreement has already been reached with UNDP for joint piloting of the LICUS approach in a few countries. The DAC/OECD approaches this group as the \u201cDifficult partnerships\u201d. The DAC approach to these fragile countries points to the importance of governance, political development and institution building. Strategies to address the problem of difficult partnerships are comparable to the LICUS initiative125. From the above, it appears that the task is daunting with much more attention to be paid to the political aspects of anti-corruption strategies, introduction of methods for people\u2019s participation and related training, training of parliamentarians on topics that have a direct impact on achieving the MDGs, improving professionalism in the civil service and increasing responsiveness of social services, improving access to justice and training of the media, introducing E-government where possible, sensitisation to the rights-based approach to development etc. This requires efforts and resources which are beyond the LDCs' capacities. Therefore, the Brussels Conference had identified the promotion of good governance at the international level and the mobilisation of financial resources (including ODA) among the key components of the PoA. Section 5 will address issues of intenational governance and look at the status of international commitments to support the LDCs. V. Good governance at the international level: commitments to support LDCs A World Bank study indicates \u201cthat the 49 poorest countries could boost their exports by about 11 % if the USA, Canada and Japan followed the EU in granting them exemption from customs duties. That would mean extra earnings for the LDCs in the order of US$ 3 billion per year\u201d. 126 The post-cold-war world was a globalised and interdependent one, yet one of the key dimensions of globalization had been overlooked, namely that of shared responsibility. That shared responsibility was consolidated in the Millennium Declaration and reiterated at the International Conference on Financing for Development (Monterrey March 2002) where, in exchange for the developing countries\u2019 commitments to governance improvements, the developed nations committed themselves to reverse the declining trends of ODA. 123. Some of these countries are resource-rich put policy-poor; they are clearly in need of public resource management. Other countries have exceptionally weak government capacity. In these countries capacities for basic service delivery need to be strengthened, if needed by NGOs. Other LICUS have just recently emerged from conflict. 124. There is a risk that such bypassing may undermine the legitimacy and effectiveness of the designated state (central or local) institutions, and making it harder for mechanisms of local accountability to come into play. 125. The DAC/OECD approach focuses on support for social services through both state and non-state entities - recognizing their comparative advantages and their complementary role, enhancing effective donor coordination, development of early warning indicators for deteriorating governance and failed states). 126. Success for Least Developed Countries, Development and Cooperation (No. 5, Sept./Oct. 2001, p. 27-28) 23 Unfortunately, the number of commitments made at international conferences stands in sharp contrast with the figures provided by Vandemoortele and Tostensen in \u00ab Progress on Doha, Monterrey and HIPC - A review \u00bb. According to this paper, aid as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 1/3 in the 1990\u2019s from an average of 0.33% in 1990 to 0.23% in 2002-2003 (V&T, 5) 127.

This section summarises some of the main Initiatives taken by the bilateral and multilateral donors in favour of the LDCs. \ufffd Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)131 The initiative covers those (42) poorest countries132 which are already entitled to concessional assistance from the World Bank and the IMF, and whose debt burdens are deemed to be unsustainable. The total cost of the initiative is now estimated at US $34 billion. To qualify for relief, HIPC candidates must adopt adjustment programmes supported by the IMF/World Bank, including PRSPs (demonstrating their intention to use the freed resources for poverty-reduction purposes). Only two Asia Pacific LDCs (Laos and Myanmar) are being considered. It was estimated that social expenditure in the HIPC countries would increase by 2 billion in the period 2001-2002. But the results of the HIPC initiative remain contested (V&T, 9), also because of similarities with the previous Structural Adjustment Programs. Many countries are unable to meet the conditions or to handle the social conflicts related to the reform programs. But the quality is improving; the PRSP process is a step in the right direction of seeking greater involvement of recipient countries (Radelet, 4). However, as the HIPC initiative progresses, new loans are being signed throughout the developing world133 even in areas that were previously not considered typical loan areas134. Some governments need to consider whether they need to borrow as much as they currently do (UN Secretary General\u2019s Report on LDCs). \ufffd The European Union\u2019s \u00ab All but arms program \u00bb In February 2001 the EU launched the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, granting the LDCs full access to the EU market by abolishing restrictive duties and quotas for all but arms. The \u201cAll but 127. Except for South Asia, net ODA flows were lower in 2001 than in 1995 for all developing regions. Most notable is the low and deteriorating ratio of the G7 members \u2013 from 0.31% in 1990 to 0.18 % in 2002. Italy and the US have the lowest ratio among the DAC countries \u2013 0.2 and 0.12 % respectively (V&T, 5). 128. World development help is running at about 56 billion US$ per year, while military expenditures are almost 20 times higher at more than 900 billion US$. Agricultural subsidies and tariff protections reach about 350 billion per year (WB President Wolfensohn, quoted in Global Development Briefing, March 11 2004). 129. The executive directors representing France, UK, USA, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Russia account for 46% of the voting rights in the WB and 48% in the IMF. 130. Their economic advice and policy has been criticized because based too much on a narrow world view that reflects the interests of the most powerful members. Since 1993, the WB publishes its Annual Review of Development Effectiveness. The IMF also created a semi-independent Office of Independent Evaluation (HDR, 2002, 113). 131. The HIPC Initiative (known sinds 1999 as the 'Enhanced HIPC Initiative') is an international debt relief mechanism that provides special assistance to the world\u2019s poorest countries. It was launched in 1996 at the G7 summit, following a proposal from the World Bank and the IMF. It is fully supported by the European Union and its Member States. 132. In 2000, developing countries spent nearly 400 billion US$ in debt servicing, or about 6% of their GDP. Sub- Saharan countries spend about twice as much to comply with their financial commitments vis-\u00e0-vis external creditors than to comply with their social obligations vis-\u00e0-vis their population (V&T, 8). 133. International donors resumed aid to Cambodia in 1999, and their grants and soft loans now make up more than half of the government's annual budget. Government debt reached USD 558 million, or 17% of GDP, by the end of 2001. Most of the debt is from loans from the WB and the ADB. Nepal: from 1975-1976 through 1996-1997 the share of external loans in total aid expanded about 71 times. During 1997-1998 it reached 62.2% of total aid flow.

A pilot phase was launched in three countries, which included Bangladesh. \ufffd The US Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) The Millennium Challenge Account aims at increasingly raising aid levels from 5 billion US$ per year to 15 billion US$ by 2006. The allocation rule for funds is designed to ensure selection of low-income countries with relatively sound policies and institutions. Countries will be rated according to three performance dimensions: (1) governing justly, (2) investing in people and (3) promoting economic freedom. The selection criteria include 5 of the 6 World Bank indicators for good governance and two indicators from Freedom House (political rights and civil liberties). \ufffd The United Nations Millennium Project136 The Millennium Project was commissioned by the UN Secretary General and is supported by the UN Development Group (UN agencies and Breton Woods Institutions). Its mandate is to recommend operational frameworks that will allow countries to accelerate their poverty reduction strategies by aligning them with needs assessments to achieve the MDGs. Pilot countries include Cambodia. In each of these countries the project will identify the detailed input targets needed for the country to achieve the MDGs by 2015, including domestic and external resources required. The report to the UN Secretary General is due for June 2005. \ufffd The OECD-DAC \u00ab Tied versus Untied aid \u00bb agreement137 Bilateral aid to LDCs stands at around 8 billion US$ or 17% of total bilateral aid138. About half of this is to be considered tied aid139. In April 2001, the DAC adopted a Recommendation to untie aid to LDCs (except for food and technical assistance) 140. Sound procurement in LDCs and a competitive private sector are important criteria. The latest report from the Secretary General on the Implementation of the Brussels PoA confirms that the majority of DAC members have untied all categories of ODA to the LDCs. Savings by the LDCs are put at 20-25 per cent141. \ufffd CDI (Commitment to development Index)142 This is a recent initiative that ranks the 21 richest countries according to how much their policies help or hinder the economic and social development of poor countries. The CDI looks 135 . UNCTAD has a Special Programme for Least Developed, Landlocked and Island Developing Countries, which promotes the socioeconomic development of these countries through research, policy analysis and technical assistance. The Special Programme is striving to serve as the main source of statistical information on the LDCs. 136. Http://www.unmillenniumproject.org 137. Untying aid would remove a distortion to world commerce and enhance the dignity of the aid process that has been sullied by the mercantilist attitudes of some in the developed world \u00bb (SG Donald Johnston, OECD 2001, 2). 138. Currently, ODA stands at 58.3 billion US$ annually compared to 52.3 billion in 2001. Part of this increase is however due to the weakening of the dollar and inflation and from US aid to allies in the war on terror. But in real terms, this represents a 7.2% increase bringing ODA back to the nominal level of 1991-1992 (Radelet, 2) 139. There are a variety of reasons why donors prefer tied aid packages: it increases exports and thus impacts on the balance of payments; it provides employment and contracts to domestic companies in the donor country; it helps strengthening domestic support for the aid effort, it contributes to making bilateral aid more visible (OECD 2001, 2). E.g. in the late 1990\u2019s, USAID reassured the US Congress that almost 80% of the Agency\u2019s resources went to purchasing goods and services from the US. 140.

Apart from the administrative burden it creates on donors and recipients, it is estimated that tied aid raises the cost of goods and services by 15 to 30%.

The CDI confirms the inadequate state of affairs on the MDG-8. Despite some criticism, the CDI also rectifies the mental construct according to which the shortfalls in achieving the MDGs are attributed solely to ineffective aid, poor governance and weak policies in developing countries. \ufffd Global Governance Initiative \u2013 First Annual Report 2004 The report is an initiative of the World Economic Forum148 and its Global Institute for Partnership and Governance. The initiative brought together some of the world\u2019s leading experts on the most pertinent issues of global governance: security, human right, environment, poverty, hunger health and education, to assess the level of effort that humanity is putting into achieving the MDGs. The assessments take the form of a numerical score on a zero to ten scale. The scores are relatively low: peace and security (3), poverty149 (4), hunger (3), education150 (3) health (4), environment (3) and human rights (3). The warning is thus clear151: the world community is devoting less than half the effort necessary to meet any of the goals. To conclude, strong advocacy and lobbying directed at donor countries will be required to increase the current levels of ODA to the amount needed to achieve the MDGs152. Fulfilling previous promises made by the economic giants alone would raise ODA by 31% (OECD). But the ongoing war on terror and the reconstruction of Iraq are likely to deprive the LDCs once again from long promised aid packages153. These trends and recent events highlight once again that governance has also profound international dimensions. While there is certainly a renewal of interest in providing assistance to the LDCs154, there is clearly a need for an international monitoring mechanism to clarify aid policies and attract public attention on global development issues. The patterns are certainly shifting. Many of the faster growing developing countries are receiving substantial quantities of FDI and so have less need for ODA. More aid could thus be directed towards the LDCs. Middle income countries in the region need to build up their 143. Future versions of the CDI should also take into account intellectual property polices in particular the degree to which developed countries contribute to the transfer of science, technology and knowledge (Global policy project). 144. This component only takes into account legal migration. Countries like France and the US would display higher CDI ratings if the migration component would also take into account illegal migration, which represents about a third of total migration from developing countries. 145.This component of the scorecard has been contested because of the massive arms trade flows originating in the same countries that contribute to the peacekeeping operations. Insufficient attention is also paid to the enormous waste of resources associated with military expenditures. E.g. In 2001, global military expenditures amounted to US$ 839 billion (the UN budget is US$ 10 billion). The US defence budget alone amounts to 300 billion US$. 146. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and members of their families which entered into force on 1 July 2003 after a 12-year ratification process protects many of the rights of migrants. Not one single industrialized country has ratified it yet. 147. The US is now the only OECD country with ODA disbursements less than 0.20% of GDP (0.13% of GDP). 148.

The EU as the biggest market for LDCs exports is extending duty-free access to those countries which were previously not eligible. The USA has added more than 1.700 duty-free tariff lines under its generalized system of preferences. Morocco, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and Egypt also announced LDCs preferential access to their markets. Germany had increased the LDCs' share of its bilateral cooperation from 25 percent (DM 603 million) in 2000 to about 30 percent (DM 744 million) for 2001. The countries covered included Cambodia, Nepal and Bangladesh. To balance these extra inputs, funds for countries like Malaysia, Argentina and Venezuela were reduced. 26 capacities to help the LDCs increase their gains from trade155. Other donors should also be encouraged to support middle-income countries in expanding their role as knowledge providers in the field of development policies. As these middle-income countries become more and more engaged in providing ODA, the CDI should gradually be adapted to include also non-OECD countries and to become a global instrument for monitoring aid commitments and ODA. At the same time, the idea of a \u201cdevelopment dividend\u201d (Kaufman) needs to be further examined: LDCs that have shown serious efforts to improve their system of governance should be granted special incentives. VI. Conclusion There are alarming signs from various corners that, unless there is a dramatic change in attitudes and approaches, the MDGs will not be met. Many LDCs have undertaken wide- ranging reform policies and measures to improve their economic situation, but without increased support, LDCs will become further marginalized as the process of globalization gains further momentum. There is a broad consensus in the international community that good governance is essential to achieve sustainable development and poverty reduction and that better policies and institutions can double aid effectiveness. But societal transformation to improve governance in conditions of widespread poverty is a major challenge. While there are indicators to measure the status of education and health in a given country or region, there exist today no \u201cobjective\u201d standards to decide, in a given political and socio-economic context, exactly what types of governance efforts will bring about the kind of progress needed towards the achievement of the MDGs. It is equally difficult to decide on the kind of reform approaches and instruments that are most effective in instilling and propagating democratic values under different economic, social and political conditions and environments. In addition, while the concept of \u201cgood\u201d governance has now been accepted as a model for adjusting state-society relations, a number of countries still do not acknowledge the concept of \u201cdemocratic\u201d governance. Analysing the impact of governance policies on poverty alleviation remains thus a very difficult task, which this paper does not claim to have completed156. Nonetheless, the general assessment on the status of governance in LDCs in Asia-Pacific is certainly useful and allows to make certain conclusions. First, while democratic governance can play a critical role in achieving the MDGs, the links between the two are neither automatic nor unidirectional. The examples of Vietnam and China provide evidence that massive reductions in poverty can be achieved under a single-party people\u2019s democracy. In the past, countries like Malaysia, South-Korea and Singapore have shown the diverse approaches and routes to democratisation, depending upon different stages of economic, social and political development of the countries concerned. Second, all governance indicators analysed in this paper carry an important weight in furthering human development and poverty reduction in LDCs, yet context and other variables will influence the sequencing of opportunities for reforms in each of the governance dimensions. The MDGs are outcomes to be aimed at, not a prescription of how to get there. It requires choices and tradeoffs to be made, and the design of development strategies that will help to achieve those goals. There is thus no clear and universal answer to the question on the kind of governance efforts all LDCs should focus on to make progress. The concept of governance is simply too broad and too grey, thus requiring greater precision in terms of its use in a given context. Different countries have different needs and therefore use different entry points to promote and support good governance. Nonetheless, in line with Maslow\u2019s theory, people\u2019s aspirations tend to increase as basic needs become more and more satisfied. The demand for democratic governance will thus gradually intensify in most LDCs, as basic social services improve, employment rates go up, security improves and overall poverty and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "359c817a-860a-42b6-9e3f-f638bf7a6d1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "359c817a-860a-42b6-9e3f-f638bf7a6d1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ee568fd4d28de7a7dab26c33504448eaa18137cc843bccdae5fe0673fdd2705"}}, "hash": "1ee568fd4d28de7a7dab26c33504448eaa18137cc843bccdae5fe0673fdd2705", "text": "hunger are being addressed. Third, reforms to instil democratic governance in LDCs are not sustainable, unless (1) these reforms are thoroughly owned by the people themselves and not imposed upon them by the 155. E.g. the new partnership between UNDP and Thailand aims at promoting Thailand\u2019s expertise to other countries in the South, as Thailand\u2019s contribution to the 8 th MDG. Priority countries are Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka & Afghanistan. 156. The Global Governance Initiative Report 2004 also concluded that there are currently no objective standards to measure exactly what types of efforts will bring about exactly what degree of progress towards the MDGs. 27 donor community; (2) there are political, legislative and administrative institutions and processes ensuring that democratic governance is based on a solid partnership and solidarity among different actors of society both at the local and national levels, (3) democratic values (transparency, accountability, participation and respect for human rights) are ensured and shared among a broad segment of the population, (4) there are economic and social underpinnings to sustain and spread the benefits of democratic values to reach the poor. Fourth, rushing straight to prioritising political reforms without due regard to the social, economic and political foundations for democratisation may be risky as it could spawn a chain of events that could compromise achievement of poverty reduction goals. Enjoying political freedom is a fundamental human right, but so is the right to a secure environment, emphasized as a crucial condition for achieving the MDGs (Global Governance Initiative, 2004). A democratic culture guarantees political and civil freedoms, but throughout history, people have paid a high cost to gain that freedom. Democracy is not a panasea and elections alone will not ensure automatic success in development. Just like privatisation requires certain prerequisites so does democracy also need certain conditions to be in place. Fifth, a new trend now seems to be the selection of countries on the basis of governance indicators, allowing to shift the allocation of aid resources over time to countries with greater improvements in governance. But while these efforts to utilise governance indicators for more transparent eligibility criteria for aid assistance ought to be welcomed157, caution is needed as many of them still rely on subjective data with certain margins of error, and sovereign countries continue to reject measurement of their performance in securing political freedoms and civil rights. This explains why progress towards the development of unambiguous, un-controversial and widely accepted governance indicators for measuring the quality of democratic governance has been slow158. Several international institutions and civil society actors are now in the process of developing new governance indicators (World Bank, DFID, CIDA, SIDA, CIVICUS and others)159. UNDP\u2019s Centre on Governance in Oslo is also undertaking research to create governance indicators from a pro-poor and gender sensitive perspective, reflecting the particularities of developing countries. Given the considerable interest from developing countries in cooperating for the publication of governance indicators, there is prospect that some governance indicators will ultimately join the MDGs. But until such indicators are available, specific country-focused surveys are required to provide more insights on the governance context in each country and to measure possible trends that may give rise to additional incentives for further reforms. These insights will also help donors to gain a better understanding of the various positions on governance and prevent them from penalising LDCs for impediments that lie outside their control. With 1.8 billion people living in Asia and the Pacific, what happens in the region will matter greatly for the eradication of poverty and global prosperity. The implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action in favour of the Least Developed Countries is one of the many steps on that long and difficult journey. 157. Setting clear criteria for selection or membership can speed up t he process of reform. E.g. the leading candidates for European Union Accession have all been relatively successful in clarifying the role of government and improving transparency. In most cases, more rapidly than other transition economies (IMF, March 2003, 7). 158. Since the early 90\u2019s, the OECD/DAC has been working on indicators to measure progress in meeting major UN conference goals, but no consensus was reached so far on a meaningful set of indicators of participatory democracy and good governance that are politically acceptable to governments. 159. With funding from DFID, and with the support of the OECD DAC secretariat, work on identifying meaningful and acceptable indicators, that can be linked to valued outcomes, has now continued under the \u201csecond generation indicators\u201d project, led by the World Bank (http://www1.oecd.org/dac/indicators). 28 Annex 1: List of Acronyms ADB Asian Development Bank BCPR Bureau", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e97b01af-f310-46e2-9280-77cb2dee7114": {"__data__": {"id_": "e97b01af-f310-46e2-9280-77cb2dee7114", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance in the Least Developed Countries in Asia and Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7cc544d60d3b3b1e702fe972caa6b9714320e2ec351b830edd56d179449a811"}, "3": {"node_id": "c518627b-5147-4f12-b33a-74379819d903", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/governance-least-developed-countries-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49fd7bb1c5c5170f274f93925e96848f0a3d8b97a7f3b9b500d46d46f54108e7"}}, "hash": "56d1380abe195fe864494a39d58064a304bb1b25daed152c8d464a6e7bc63b0d", "text": "for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (UNDP) BDP Bureau for Development Policy (UNDP) CDI Commitment to Development Index CSO Civil Society Organisation DAC Development Assistance Committee of the OECD ECOSOC Economic and Social Council ESCAP Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific EU European Union FDI Foreign Direct Investment GDP Gross Domestic Product GNH Gross National Happiness GNP Gross National Product HDR Human Development Report HIPC High Indebted Poor Countries HR Human Rights ICT Information and Communication Technology IMF International Monetary Fund LDC Least Developed Countries LICUS Low Income Countries under Stress MCA Millennium Challenge Account MDGs Millennium Development Goals MDS Millennium Development Strategy MYFF Multi Year Funding Framework NGO Non Governmental Organisation NGPES National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy OECD Organisation for Economic Development ODA Official Development Assistance PAR Public Administration Reform PETS Public Expenditure Tracking System PoA Plan of Action PPP Purchasing Power Parity PRSP Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ROCs Reports on Observance of Standards and Codes SIDS Small Island Development States SOE State Owned Enterprises SURF Sub-Regional Resource Facility (UNDP) TI Transparency International UN United Nations UNCAC United Nations Convention against Corruption UNCTAD United Nations Commission fro Trade and Development UNDP United Nations Development Program UNHCHR United Nations High Commission for Human Right USAID United States Agency for International Development WB World Bank WDR World Development Report WTO World Trade Organisation 29 Annex 2: References \ufffd ADB, Tuvalu, 2002 Economic and Public Sector Review (http://www.adb.org/documents/books/tuvalu_2002_Economic_PSR) \ufffd ADB (1999), Reforms in the Pacific, An Assessment of ADB Assistance for Reform programs in the Pacific,1999.

Data from nine countries \u2014 China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam\u2014have been used in the exercise. ICT indicators relevant for human development in the Asian context were first identified.The avail- ability of comparable data of acceptable quality determined the final choice of indicators.The indi- cators were classified into five categories: two categories of availability-linked indicators \u2014 skill independent and skill-dependent, indicators of efficiency and speed, indicators of targeting social sectors and indicators of targeting vulnerable groups.Indicators from each of these categories were combined to formulate five component indices which were finally aggregated into a composite aggregate ICTforHD index.Two methods were used in the indexing process.The Range Equalisation method used in the calculation of HDI in the Human Development Reports was first employed in the index calculations. An alternate method based on Division by Mean was then used providing interesting comparisons.The value of the aggregate ICTforHD index for each country revealed the inter-country rankings. While the top and bottom countries remain unchanged across the two methods, some changes in the relative positions were observed for countries in between. The study concludes that while availability or supply-side indicators of ICT are undoubtedly impor- tant from the human development perspective, more information needs to be gathered on access, types of applications, characteristics of users, content, etc. Thus the demand side needs to be brought in much more strongly to capture the spread of technology across social and economic classes,regions,sexes,etc.Data on ICT availability and use across rural-urban,male-female and other categories could help in quantifying digital divides.

Many consider ICT to be the only possible means of achieving the above-mentioned goals within a reasonable time frame, through techno- logical leapfrogging. An equally vociferous view, on the other hand, is that ICT is of no great value and could even be detrimental to the less- developed world,particularly for populations that are economically and socially underprivileged. Notwithstanding the controversy, most policy statements, research reports and overview docu- ments at both international and national levels, have regarded positive impact of ICT on socio- economic development to be self-evident.1These have applied standard measures like the share of ICT in income or investment and the number of consumer units relative to population, for cross- country comparisons.Such measures would hard- ly reveal whether or how the growth of ICTs or their diffusion in different countries lead to reduc- tion in poverty or to other socio-economic goals. Understandably, opinions of planners and researchers on choice of indicators vary widely, often depending on their own experience. Indeed, the impact of ICT in a country or a region depends on its nature, the purpose of its deploy- ment and its spatial spread, besides the econom- ic,administrative and social environment backing up the strategy of its diffusion. In this context, assembling empirical evidence on the impact of ICT on human development is of key importance. It would,therefore,be useful to begin by analysing the nature of interdependencies between the indicators of ICT development and those reflect- ing human development concerns for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),that were adopted by 191 countries at the historic UN Millennium Summit in September 2000.2 This should be done separately for the developed and less-developed countries. In the present report, an attempt is made to map the pace and pattern of development of ICT in less-developed countries, based on in-depth empirical studies conducted in recent years, focusing on the Asian region. A critical review of the UNDP-sponsored country studies on the pro- motion of ICT towards achieving the MDGs is extremely useful in this regard, as these studies specifically look into the growth of ICT in the con- text of attainment of the MDGs. This will help in the identification of indicators that reflect the lev- els of development of ICT in terms of the capacity of the countries to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14b52790-7ae2-4fdd-8a53-25ef314d7534": {"__data__": {"id_": "14b52790-7ae2-4fdd-8a53-25ef314d7534", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56c4c77ea8cb087310603970ac11c3eca4f20691114a66ac3f29e00507e00c11"}, "3": {"node_id": "683b8c0d-1149-419d-98b2-9c3e95a5afe4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f247fab2cd85e22e830f9b17e3f866f360494fe86b6397323e52ae22753c38b6"}}, "hash": "011d8e34aacebb34810e9296c2dcaab1af26e568d7ea8b8a06af50ac61068024", "text": "promote economic and social well-being of the people.

Eight specific goals have been set, clearly structured into 18 spe- cific targets which are to be monitored through 48 specific indicators.The base year for these goals is 1990. 2 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia 3 The correlation matrices are available at the UNDP website:http://hdrc.undp.org.in/initiatives/apri/ict.html 4 It may be mentioned that this categorisation is in line with the UNDP scheme of grouping the less-developed coun- tries and,further,identifying two specific categories (c & d) with regard to their progress towards attainment of MDGs (UNDP 2003, pp 1-13). It also suggests that the impact of ICT differs across different regions. 5 The OECD countries with low or middle per capita income, i.e., Korea,Turkey and Mexico, have not been included in this category, following the UNDP classification in HDR for the year 2003. MDGs. The study focuses on nine countries in Asia: China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. The broad objectives of the study are as follows: i. Examining the interdependency between ICT and human development; ii. Identifying ICT indicators reflecting human development concerns in achieving the eight MDGs; iii. Construction of composite indices for capturing the ICT-linked progress in above-mentioned nine countries, in the context of attainment of the MDGs. At the outset, the present paper provides an overview of the controversy concerning the meas- urement of development of ICT across countries and identification of major components and objec- tives of the analysis.The second section examines the pattern of interrelationship between the ICT indicators and those of human development and MDGs. This has been done at two points of time and for the changes registered in between. The empirical analyses and country studies conducted in less-developed countries, pertaining to the role of the ICT sector in national or regional develop- ment, are the subject of the third section, with special emphasis on the experiences of Asian coun- tries.The fourth section makes an attempt to devel- op a framework for identification of appropriate indicators and their composition, on the basis of initiatives launched by various UN and intergovern- mental organisations. Further, it presents a list of indicators and provides the rationale for their inclu- sion in the present study covering nine Asian coun- tries. The next section presents the methodology for composition and gives the ranking of the coun- tries, using the data for the latest year. The last section summarises the conclusions and provides a perspective for future exercises in assessing the development of the ICT sector in Asia. Pattern of interdependence between development of ICT and attainment of the MDGs: A cross-country analysis In the present study, the impact of the develop- ment of ICT on human development for achieving 2 the MDGs has been examined by constructing cor- relation matrices3 between the indicators of ICT and those of the MDGs across 175 countries at two points of time, viz., years 1991 and 2001. A set of indicators (See Appendix I) pertaining to the eight MDGs are taken from the Human Development Report (HDR) for the year 2003 (UNDP 2003). A few additional indicators such as level and growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, flow of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), flow of Overseas Develop- ment Assistance (ODA), number of radios and televisions in use have been compiled from World Development Reports (WDRs) for the years 1990 and 2000.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "683b8c0d-1149-419d-98b2-9c3e95a5afe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "683b8c0d-1149-419d-98b2-9c3e95a5afe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56c4c77ea8cb087310603970ac11c3eca4f20691114a66ac3f29e00507e00c11"}, "2": {"node_id": "14b52790-7ae2-4fdd-8a53-25ef314d7534", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "011d8e34aacebb34810e9296c2dcaab1af26e568d7ea8b8a06af50ac61068024"}}, "hash": "f247fab2cd85e22e830f9b17e3f866f360494fe86b6397323e52ae22753c38b6", "text": "All the indicators could not be obtained for these two specific years and a few pertain to either the previous or sub- sequent year.

(See Appendix I for complete list of indicators). In view of the wide disparity in terms of levels of economic growth as well as progress towards MDGs,besides other factors,the countries of the world have been grouped into four regions.4 These are (a) Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), (henceforth referred to as Europe), (b) Arab and Latin America (henceforth referred to as ALA), (c) Sub-Saharan Africa (henceforth referred to as Africa) and (d) the Asia-Pacific region (henceforth referred to as Asia). This grouping has been obtained by combining the categories reported in HDR 2003, for the pur- pose of the present study. Most of the countries in the Europe group (52 in all) have high levels of income as well as human development.5 The other three regions (comprising 51, 44 and 28 countries in ALA, Africa and Asia, respectively) are differentiated,in terms of both level and pat- 3 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia 6 The correlations discussed in the text are those that are significant at 5 percent level. tern of economic and human development.The analysis in this study is focused on Asia, in order to assess whether the pattern of interdepen- dencies here is different from that noticed in the other regions or in the world as a whole. In addition to the two-point analysis (1991 and 2001), a study of changes in ICT indicators dur- ing the intervening period and their relation to changes in MDG indicators has also been attempted to understand the dynamics of inter- relationships exhibited in the process of devel- opment. This would be necessary, as ICT is a recent phenomenon and one has to examine the impact on the process of development,of its growth rather than of the levels it has reached. Correlation coefficients6 between indicators, at the two points of time studied, as well as those reflecting change during the study period, therefore, provide interesting insights into the pattern of interdependency between ICT and development, in terms of attaining the MDGs, across the countries of the world. 2.1. Relationships between ICT and MDG- linked indicators: 175 countries of the world 2.1.1.Interrelationships in the early 1990s For the year 1991, the indicators of ICT show positive and strong relationship with per capita income and Human Development Index (HDI). Most of the indicators pertaining to the attain- ment of different MDGs too have significant and desired patterns of interdependency with ICT indicators. For example, the correlations between ICT indicators and the indicators relat- ed to universal primary education, such as net primary school enrollment ratio, children reach- ing grade 5 and youth literacy rate, are all posi- tive and statistically significant. The same is the case with the indicators reflecting empower- ment of women.There also appears to be signif- icant reduction in child mortality and improve- ment in maternal health with the development of ICT, across the countries of the world. This is evident from the strong negative correlation between television users,telephone and cellular mobile subscribers, etc. and rates of infant mor- tality, child mortality and maternal mortality. Further, percentages of people with sustainable access to water sources and urbanites having improved sanitation facilities show strong posi- tive correlation with all the ICT indicators, the coefficients being statistically significant. 2.1.2.Interrelationships in the early years of the 21st century The pattern of relationship between ICT indica- tors and indicators pertaining to income and HDI values has strengthened during the early years of 21st century, as may be inferred from the correlations in 2001.Of particular note is the impressive increase in the value of correlation coefficients between the use of personal com- puters and per capita income and HDI.The same is the case with respect to MDG indicators.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40103954-4d00-426a-9869-399d42919206": {"__data__": {"id_": "40103954-4d00-426a-9869-399d42919206", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34b3f8dfd9c5b65290d1a2df5a0812e6f0f53ceab7c0eb730c175b6d7dde166e"}, "2": {"node_id": "35935159-b724-4cab-b027-546f03ee95c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f84d8fbbfb82e43e55cbdcb25b27db2425bc641cb13b1e6f2e605a05a8baed40"}}, "hash": "07c515a6e957163252efc2637a151de764d9f68dba723e4f32e96447c8e0cfa3", "text": "The relationship of ICT indicators with the percent- age of the non-poor is positive and improved over the years.It may not be possible to suggest a unidirectional causality and argue that eradi- cation of poverty has been possible due to the development of ICT, since the impact could be the other way round.

The only two indicators that report weaker correlations in 2001 than in 1991 are access to improved sanitation and water in urban areas. This implies that ICT has not been used as a tool in improving urban facilities. The role of ICT in attracting foreign direct investment and over- seas development assistance appears to be inconsequential as the correlation in the case of the former has become weaker,while that of the latter has turned negative. Understandably, mere increase in ICT is unlikely to improve the foreign investment situation as other socio- political factors play an important role here. 2.1.3.Changes in indicators during the 1990s and their interrelations For the purpose of understanding the dynamics of the relationship of ICT indicators with MDGs and human development indicators, a correla- tion matrix has been constructed, based on the differences between the values of the indicators in years 2001 and 1991. It has been observed 4 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia that the progress in ICT contributes to the enhancement of human development across the countries of the world, as the correlation between them turns out to be highly significant. Interestingly, such correlation does not exist between the growth of ICT and income growth, which could be due to the fact that break- through in ICT is a recent phenomenon and has not yet made an impact on the economic growth in all the countries of the world. Especially in the case of the developing coun- tries,there is a time lag between the adoption of ICT and registering the growth in income. Further, progress in ICT does not seem to make a significant impact in the progress towards achievement of universal primary education or reducing infant/child mortality. 2.2. Interrelationships between ICT and MDG-linked indicators across the four regions of the world 2.2.1.Interrelationships in the early 1990s The analysis of interdependencies across coun- tries belonging to the four categories (Europe, ALA, Asia and Africa) brings out certain striking features. In Europe, ICT made an impact on the process of economic development even in the early 1990s.This is evident from the highly posi- tive correlation between the indicators of ICT and the indicators of per capita income and HDI. In the case of less-developed countries belong- ing to the ALA, Asia and Africa regions, ICT is mostly restricted to the use of radios, televisions and telephones. The diffusion of new forms of ICT took off since the mid-1990s only. Notwithstanding the time lag factor, the pattern of relationship of ICT indicators with those of per capita income and HDI work out to be similar to those noted in Europe.The coefficients obtained for the Asian region seem to be stronger than those obtained for the other categories. The strong pattern observed here implies that many low-income countries within Asia have not got very far in developing ICT;on the other hand,ICT initiatives are well taken by the high income countries. One may also note the presence of various socio-cultural factors inhibiting technol- ogy diffusion across countries in Asia. The relationships between indicators of ICT and those of education-linked MDGs reveal contrast- ing patterns across the four categories of coun- tries. Primary school enrollment ratio shows sig- nificant positive correlation with the develop- ment of ICT in Europe and Africa, but not in ALA and Asia.Further,there exists a strong correlation between indicators of ICT and children reaching grade 5 in the African countries, which is not there in any other region. Furthermore, there seems to be no interrelationship between ICT and youth literacy, as the correlation coefficients turn out statistically insignificant across all the regions. Given this pattern, one would infer that the impact of ICT in achieving universal literacy is not very significant. Indicators pertaining to gender equality articu- lated through the enrollment ratio of girls to boys in primary schools and female to male ratio among literates have weak correlations with indicators of ICT in European countries dur- ing the early 1990s as there is no gender-based discrimination in accessing the technology. But in Africa, the relationship appears to be strong. On the other hand, the coefficients are weak in the case of Asia, possibly because of low levels of ICT in many of these countries. An inverse relationship between ICT and child/ maternal mortality rate is observed in all the four categories of countries in the early 1990s. Indeed, infant mortality rate shows strong and negative correlation with ICT in Asia", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "132a11ed-6dfb-40c0-9deb-772adc02336b": {"__data__": {"id_": "132a11ed-6dfb-40c0-9deb-772adc02336b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e34ce5781c4ad33a17147836ec4abe04b51c13ed78b473c487f5ac613b87afb2"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e289a7e-821f-452d-9f53-980dc46977d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "502160fca94523070633a92e719585f02249e8c0fbcfd70ae6af6f0635c58e6a"}}, "hash": "c82b7c27d023209fd9faac9dccb17d732582e38a8bdf0e1cf2432d3de54b4d78", "text": "as well as ALA and Africa. One would infer that the devel- opment of ICT provides better access to health facilities. In contrast, the indicators of environ- mental sustainability, such as access to improved water sources and sanitation facilities, particularly in urban areas, do not exhibit corre- lation with ICT in all four regions. 2.2.2.Interrelationships in the early years of 21st century The relationships of ICT indicators with those of the MDGs have not, unfortunately, improved significantly across the regions in 2001, except in the case of per capita income and HDI. In the case of indicators linked with eradication of poverty and hunger, such as percentage of undernourished people and of underweight children aged below 5, the correlations turn out to be high and statistically significant only for ALA and Africa. In Asia, the interdependencies are insignificant.One would,therefore,infer that deployment of ICT in improving agriculture and food distribution systems and thereby impact- ing poverty and malnutrition, is not significant in Asia in 2001.

It is only in the case of the youth literacy rate that the relationship with ICT has improved and become significant. One would, therefore, argue that the progress of ICT may not have had a sig- nificant impact on the level of primary educa- tion across Asian countries. Regarding the environmental sustainability indicators in terms of per capita emissions of carbon dioxide and CFC consumption,the trend unfortunately is of secular increase and shows strong positive relationship with economic development in all the four regions. Growth of ICT does not seem to help reduce air pollution. However,it has impacted positively on availabil- ity of drinking water and sanitation facilities in Europe, and to some extent in ALA as well as Africa.This unfortunately is not the case in Asia. Further, the correlations between indicators of ICT and flow of FDI are weak and have gone down over the years in Asia. The correlation of the flow of ODA (as percent of GNP) has remained negative and statistically insignificant in 2001, which confirms the marginal role played by ICT in development of a global part- nership in this region. 2.2.3.Changes in indicators during the 1990s and their interrelations The \u2018change indicators\u2019built by taking the differ- ence in the values of ICT and MDG indicators and HDI reveal an interesting pattern of interde- pendency. Highly significant correlations are observed between HDI and ICT indicators in all the regions, excepting Asia. Apart from indica- tors of ICT pertaining to use of television and telephones, no indicator is significantly correlat- ed with HDI in Asia. The growth in per capita income shows strong correlation with growth of ICT only in Europe. These correlations are insignificant for ALA, Asia and Africa. Further, progress in ICT bears no relationship with changes in primary enrollment rate, gender dis- parity in education or representation in parlia- ment.This is observed in Asia as well as ALA and Africa. However, it is encouraging that correla- tions between progress in ICT and improvement in life expectancy rate and maternal mortality rate are significant in Europe, ALA and Africa. Further, the indicators of child mortality, mater- nal mortality,incidence of malaria and other dis- eases exhibit strong negative relations with ICT indicators and this, in general, has strengthened over time. Unfortunately, this is not the case in Asia, as the relevant correlations are statistically insignificant and have not improved over the decade. Here, infant mortality rate and urban households with no access to drinking water and sanitation, exhibit no decline with progress in ICT. The incidence of HIV/AIDS, too, does not seem to decrease with the development of ICT, contrary to the pattern observed in other regions.

The impact, however, remains at that level and does not go beyond.The share of females in non-agricultural wage employment has remained low and its correlation with ICT has weakened over the decade. Furthermore, no positive correlation exists between ICT and the share of seats held by women in the parliament. Impact of ICT on socio- economic development as observed in developing countries The literature on the role of ICT in promoting socio-economic development is rich in terms of empirical rigour and diversity of opinions, despite having a short history. Most of the studies [Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1996; Lehr and Lichtenberg 1999; Oliner and Sichel 2000; Jalava and Pohjola 2002; and Dewan and Kraemer (in press)]pertain to developed coun- 3 6 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia 8 The first few rigorously empirical studies on this subject are those undertaken in the United States using firm level data on ICT investment and economic performance. 9 The study has generated valuable information on digital literacy and use of ICT for various social and economic pur- poses for different OECD countries, using survey data. tries8 and suggested the positive impact of ICT on income and employment growth. However, it has been noted that this relationship is absent in several OECD countries. Also, in developing countries where non-ICT invest- ments tend to have a higher payoff than ICT investments, a positive relationship is either weak or absent. In view of this, scholars have argued that growth of ICT should not become a \u2018techno-quick-fix\u2019 for solving development problems. It has unacceptable tradeoffs with MDGs in less-developed countries (Wilde 2003). These scholars believe that we are only beginning to understand how the application of ICT relates to the achievement of social goals and economic growth and there are seri- ous doubts whether the benefits truly out- weigh the costs (Kenny 2003,Wilde 2003). The most powerful argument made against ICT is that it has resulted in sharp differentiation not only among countries but across groups of pop- ulations, and such differentiation is likely to be further accentuated.Existing inequalities,partic- ularly in less-developed countries, in terms of access of households to natural and capital resources,have intensified with the launching of the programme of liberalisation. The legal and administrative structures that are considered important for providing equitable access to all sections of the population are yet to be institu- tionalised (de Soto 2000). Given these factors, it is understandable that introduction of a new technology strengthens the position of eco- nomic and political elites vis-a-vis others. They have larger resources at their command to own or access the technology,can acquire the neces- sary skills easily due to their higher levels of education and can establish links with other production and social sectors through ICT, for appropriating new facilities and opportunities. ICT has a requirement of specific skill and that comes in the way of its adoption by underprivi- leged groups/regions, even with general improvement of literacy in a country. This proposition finds empirical substantiation in a study sponsored by the European Commission under its \u2018Information Society Program\u2019 (SIBIS Report 2001).9 It identifies the absence of appropriate skills as a critical factor, constraining the access to ICT and resulting in a digital divide.What is more disturbing is that the divide has sharpened over the 1990s. Income emerges as yet another important factor responsible for the divide. It is only with regard to gender that the gap seems to be declining over the years. Although similar data have not been generated for Asian countries, impact of education and income disparity on access to information technology is likely to be equally, if not more, serious. Scholars have also demonstrated empirically that diffusion of ICT in developing countries do not benefit the social sector in the same way as in industrial countries. This is because of the existence of barriers to knowledge and informa- tion asymmetry in the former. The absence of skilled human capital,lack of funds for moderni- sation, etc. in the social sectors becomes an impediment to the adoption of ICT and the dis- semination of benefits throughout the country. These factors pose a serious question mark on the role of ICT in achieving the MDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee42fc33-c377-4018-b03b-750b3bef5ade": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee42fc33-c377-4018-b03b-750b3bef5ade", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65536c76b4076994f01d35a06732c29de541c391cd742b8cad90678a52e8a263"}, "2": {"node_id": "5054d07f-35ad-43f0-85c2-9aaf8fbb03cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dbcec44b8c0b7baef7eed1c046c7dbf703c61f389f3f579cfd8f28aacffe2ee"}}, "hash": "38ad97ae0c3c8f130d5578e3d639ae40e5e2fa0176712d349a202ae0755258f1", "text": "These factors pose a serious question mark on the role of ICT in achieving the MDGs.

An overview of recent experience in Asian countries, however, reveals that the state has found it more convenient to deny access to information to people than provide them with wrong information.Once the channels of communication are opened, ensuring selectivity in information has generally been beyond the control of the public machinery. access the technology as costs are relatively lower than those for accessing quality knowledge and formal information.Understandably,ICT has led to reduction in information asymmetry between the rich and the poor and between the educated and the uneducated.Indeed,people located in a given geographical area can access the technology (available as public facilities or in commercial joints) and benefit through spillover effects, irre- spective of their socio-economic status.10 There is no reason why ICT in Asian countries cannot reduce the existing barriers to knowledge and bring down the inequality in accessing the infor- mation base,which currently is extremely high as it is linked to income inequality. For assessing the progress of Asian countries towards different MDGs, the country studies sponsored by UNDP are particularly useful. Nonetheless, quantitative assessment of the multiplier effect of ICT diffusion on poverty, illit- eracy, ailment, gender divide, environmental degradation, etc. is extremely difficult and has not been attempted in any study. The difficulty lies in the multifarious and informal nature of linkages of ICT with the rest of the economy on which no data can be obtained from official sources. The most important goal is poverty reduction, the impact of ICT in this context has generally been taken as positive because of its capacity to generate employment at a reasonable level of productivity and its growing share in incremen- tal GDP.Although the volume of employment in the sector is not very high in most Asian coun- tries, its growth rate over the past decade holds forth a promise. Despite occasional slumps in the market and pessimistic projections of growth within the formal sector,the expectation is that ICT will reduce poverty by creating numerous informal jobs. It is the semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the assembly lines (producing computers and linked gadgets),data processors,and operators in call centres,not the engineers and software programmers despite a likely increase in their number,who hold the key to poverty alleviation. Despite the difficulties of capturing the direct and indirect impact of ICT,there is no doubt that it has given a boost to income and employment growth at macro level by improving productivi- ty and competitiveness in non-ICT sectors as well. The resultant reduction in cost of produc- tion in the latter has resulted in higher demand for the products and services in the domestic as well as international markets, giving an impetus to growth and leading to substantial poverty reduction. Indeed, the jobs created directly in the ICT sector are of less significance (since com- puters to some extent are replacing labour) as compared to the multiplier effect created by it, through up-scaling activity levels in user sector pushing up the earnings of workers. Taking all the direct and indirect impacts into considera- tion, it can be assumed that ICT has a positive effect on poverty reduction in Asian countries. ICT is expected to contribute towards the objec- tive of poverty alleviation through appropriate designing,management and implementation of anti-poverty programmes. Irrespective of the composition, there is little doubt that growth and spread of ICT sector has increased the level of awareness about rights and responsibilities and also enhanced \u2018information\u2019 availability among the masses. As a consequence, the level of ICT can be taken as an indicator of progress towards poverty alleviation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90fad8bb-5af7-4e2c-ad6d-e9e27d52777e": {"__data__": {"id_": "90fad8bb-5af7-4e2c-ad6d-e9e27d52777e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88db540db57cee59817f787c3e7f4f59ce632116bc636bb7a48fb3d767145493"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7f5393e-2021-4170-8627-eac92abda00b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34c59f20684157b54ca886228ebd04887c9eded9bcacee16d79f3fdf1bf0271d"}}, "hash": "454547e52f89a944f7b8f21407b56307594fc30987f3f75778b94716f73b9c21", "text": "In the context of universal primary education, a few studies reveal that introduction of comput- ers may not help improve the school system or reduce illiteracy in a country (Schware and Jaramillo 1998).11 The country", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5468f2d3-af64-4537-bb65-897cf8472c5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5468f2d3-af64-4537-bb65-897cf8472c5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a35bc58f29266e305b4ca03a101bcc46d8aa4384338ead628f804f44a0d4dcb6"}}, "hash": "a35bc58f29266e305b4ca03a101bcc46d8aa4384338ead628f804f44a0d4dcb6", "text": "study for India shows that introduction of computers in schools has resulted in misallocation of resources and neglect of infrastructural facilities which should be a higher priority. Not- withstanding the specific examples, the total impact of ICT in eradicating illiteracy is signifi- cantly positive, as has been argued in the case of poverty alleviation. This is particularly so when its impact on non-formal education, like creating the awareness among people about society, government, market, etc., is taken into consideration.12 Asian countries with low levels 8 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia of literacy and awareness of rights and respon- sibilities have certainly benefited through increasing use of radio, television, internet, etc., which have helped in awareness building and strengthening the formal education system. Of course, the impact would be higher if certain kinds of ICT application or their use by certain target groups in the population are encouraged, but it is hard to get reliable information on this subject. Regarding the MDGs pertaining to the improve- ment in health situation, identification of indi- cators is extremely difficult because there are many factors other than communication tech- nology that are relevant. Although temporal data on child mortality, maternal health and diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other major diseases are available, it is diffi- cult to apportion a part of the improvement observed during a certain period,to ICT.In com- bating HIV/AIDS and eradicating malaria and other diseases,however,most of the countries in Asia are in what may be termed as the first stage application of ICT. What is important at this stage is dissemination of information about the seriousness of the problem, causes, preventive measures and facilities for treatment. This is valid in the context of the programmes for reduction in child mortality or improving mater- nal health.With levels of literacy being very low in the region, ICT has a major role to play in the dissemination of information. While creating awareness in rural areas and distant towns should be a priority, the growth of media and communication systems at the national level is desirable,as awareness level is low even in large urban centers. The role of ICT in promoting gender equality is perceived as positive through deductive rea- soning as empirical data on this are not avail- able at the national level (UNDP 2003a). Given the fact that women in Asia continue to be linked to family and household activities and face numerous social and cultural constraints restricting their mobility, their access to public places is limited as compared to men. Not only are cultural barriers far more binding on women in accessing health and education facilities, even geographical distance is rela- tively more restrictive. The ability to access a facility without being physically present at a fixed location would, therefore, be a big advan- tage for them.The studies reveal that the tech- nology has indeed enabled women to access education and medical facilities much more effectively than before.Further,they are able to take up contract job work out of factory or office premises, sitting at their homes through this technology. It may be argued that adopting ICT would be useful in monitoring the natural resources and handling of the stress and strain generated through the development process. The new technology is of help in adopting modern meth- ods of environmental sanitation, and pollution control,etc. Unfortunately,data on these indica- tors are not available for Asian countries. A strong relationship has been noted between ICT investment and the degree of openness to the world market. Scholars have argued that countries having an open-trade policy benefit more from development of ICT than those with a closed-door policy. Higher levels of ICT lead to greater international linkage and higher trade. However, there is not enough empirical evi- dence to confirm or to indicate how the ICT investment will help the less-developed coun- tries achieve the MDG related to global partner- ship. Consequently, this aspect has not been brought within the framework for identification of the indicators. This overview of the earlier studies suggests that determination of the impact of ICT in terms of MDGs is extremely difficult. The direction of relationship stipulated in these studies is often based on deductive reasoning, observance of such a pattern in some developed countries, or the stated objectives or claims made by certain ICT projects. The other point emerging from the overview is that spatial inequality is a constraint in achiev- ing social goals in Asian countries, as ICT is con- centrated in a few large cities and regions.

Overview of recent initiatives and limita- tions of existing data sources TheemergingneedtoassesstheprogressofICTin achieving a set of socio-economic goals for the purpose of policy formulation has prompted a number of regional and international organisa- tions to undertake studies and propose frame- works,despite serious methodological difficulties. These studies have the basic objective to opera- tionalise a mechanism to monitor the progress of ICT and propose broad policy guidelines as and when required. An important contribution in this context is Orbicom\u2019s \u2018Monitoring the Digital Divide,13whichassessesthemagnitudeofthedig- ital divide,or more specifically,the progress of dif- ferent countries toward the\u2018infostate\u2019by building thematic clusters of indicators related to info- density and info-use.The other important study is \u2018Global Information Technology Report\u2019 brought out by the Global Economic Forum (2001), which again gives a framework for monitoring the progress of countries in adoption of ICT.This pro- vides an index which comprises three elements: (a) environment for ICT;(b) readiness of stakehold- ers;and(c)usageofICTamongstthestakeholders. But,they are not of great help in developing coun- tries despite their claims to the contrary, due to enormous data requirements and the huge costs involvedinbridgingthedatagapsthroughsurvey. In education, progress in the development of indicators for cross-country comparison seems promising. The World Bank Institute together with the Educational Development Centre (EDC), Information Technologies Group at Harvard University has developed a survey- based information system. This will help deter- mine the progress of developing countries in the integration of ICT into their education sys- tem. Further, \u2018Global Survey and Guide to ICT 4 Planning in Education\u2019 is an important instru- ment in assessing ICT progress in the field of education.14 Similarly, the World Health Organisation is working on a set of ICT-related indicators for the health sector.15 Data on Asian countries from this source have not yet become available to researchers and policy makers. The study by the European Commission dis- cussed in the previous section has built Statistical Indicators Benchmarking the Information Society (SIBIS) for a large number of OECD countries. It provides the information on access of ICT by households for various purposes like business, education, health-care and the location of such access. Unfortunately, a similar exercise has not been carried out for Asian countries. Scan-ICT project by Internation Development Research Centre (IDRC), Canada16 gives, besides the supply indicators,the information on users and usages. The country reports brought out under this project provide user-based information con- tent disseminated through ICT.They provide statis- tics on telemedicine, research, information systems, software application, distance learning, health promotion,etc. These statistics are very use- ful for building up indicators for cross-country comparison of the role of ICT in promoting human development for the achievement of the MDGs.

The Task Force has come up with a matrix that maps ICT with MDGs in eight key spheres. This matrix basically suggests a path, translating the MDGs into a set of indicators and then working out corresponding ICT goals. It then proposes construction of a set of compatible ICT indicators. Following the guidelines proposed by the Task Force, a list of the indicators under different MDGs has been worked out (Appendix II). The Task Force suggests that the views expressed and experiences documented in various international reports such as the UN Millennium Project and WSIS (World Summit on Information Society) should be taken into consideration in opera- tionalisation of the indicators. Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain information about Asian countries for many of these indicators,from inter- national websites.Besides,fulfilling the data defi- ciencies through cross-country surveys, as proposed by the Task Force, would be highly expensive. 4.2. A framework for identification of indica- tors for construction of a composite index The critical problem in anchoring ICT within MDGs is the choice of appropriate indicators and assigning weightages to these for composition. The earlier studies on this subject are largely restricted to industrialised countries. Since the problems involved in diffusion of technology across sectors, regions and populations are less serious here, there was not much of controversy. The indicators selected were mostly on the sup- ply side,pertaining to usage of personal comput- ers, internet facility, density of telephones, use of electronic goods, ratios of enrollment in, or of passing out from,technical institutions and so on. These data are easy to obtain and, in fact, are available for all the countries in international publications and worldwide websites.These indi- cators can, therefore, be easily constructed for Asian countries,although there are problems17 of comparability of data in case of a few of them. However,the above overview of interdependen- cies and country studies makes it amply clear that there is a strong case to go beyond supply- linked indicators in order to assess whether the technology is promoting the development process in the desired direction. One would have to collect information on ICT application, purpose of use, agencies involved and legal framework regarding adoption of ICT. It is only through such user-specific indicators that it is possible to assess whether the development of ICT is in harmony with promoting human devel- opment for achieving the eight MDGs. In the case of Asian countries, the existing data sources do not permit building up of user-specific indicators for cross-country comparison. Further, generation of fresh data on ICT,classified by users and applications, would make difficult financial and administrative demands on the international statistical system. In addition, one can put for- ward analytical reasoning against use of extremely specific indicators.These countries are so very diverse in terms of levels of economic development, degrees of openness to the world market and socio-cultural specificities that it is difficult to draw generalisations and reach con- sensus on user-specific indicators.18 Further, one may argue that a review of literature and analysis of interdependencies of ICT indicators in devel- oping countries,are not enough for taking a posi- tion with regard to its role in future, particularly because ICT is still in its infancy.19 4.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7680fe98-3511-4775-8f61-d5ce726a28c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7680fe98-3511-4775-8f61-d5ce726a28c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cd7da4b36e23facb0469702c488d56b7cd71ca23c1c6a588caf14218fdce44d"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e2b15ad-3a00-4fb9-8bfd-6165daa80dd6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2666525867d2351287ec40be756193a4911002d44d4aca7df2951819d9d014c"}}, "hash": "4602b8ecd7725b65ad8af06c6031148ad7bbf46136035d1e3f0689ed5dcdde99", "text": "Identification of different dimensions of deve- lopment and their constituent ICT indicators In view of the difficulties in reaching general agreement on user/sector/region specific indi- cators,20 one is constrained to use straight for- 11 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia 21 Given the absence of a clear policy perspective in many Asian countries, it may be proposed that each country designs a system", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "582f3275-3d46-4989-beb1-99cfe9e3990a": {"__data__": {"id_": "582f3275-3d46-4989-beb1-99cfe9e3990a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "466ce019774a5a7a5c728a107044b2be7d1bc621d7eb55aaaa522ac81cde33e6"}, "3": {"node_id": "21d8d1ec-3329-48c8-a3a4-620c11029634", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "334deb88adbf80db562696a376083e6a716b6cec79cefb15962cb05913bb78fe"}}, "hash": "80111daa3f229a0deb30d232df955469d8587985e955200b03dbcca4491f97c9", "text": "of incentives and controls that would lead to the desired social outcome. 22 The institution of hosts has not developed due to different organisational structures and does not affect growth of these technologies.

The first includes popular ICT tools such as (i) telephone mainline connections, (ii) cellular subscribers, (iii) television sets, and (iv) radio sets, all being presented per 1,000 people. Under skill- dependent ICT category22 the indicators iden- tified are (i) internet users per 100 persons, (ii) personal computers per 100 persons, and (iii) per capita ICT expenditure. Higher expendi- tures would imply greater use of the technolo- gy by larger sections of the population as they cover purchase of ICT products for business, households, governments and educational institutions, including telecommunication facilities. Two separate categories have been kept on the supply side so as to increase the importance of availability-linked indicators in the overall aggregation scheme. Skill- independent ICTs require no or very low level of skills to use while using or adopting the skill- dependent ICTs call for certain skills. 4.3.2.Indicators of efficiency and speed It has been possible to build up the following efficiency indicators,using available official data sources: (i) internet service provider charges; (ii) telephone usage charge for internet; (iii) cost of peak rate local call per three minutes from the fixed line; (iv) cost of peak rate call to the United States per three minutes; (v) internet speed and access; and (vi) IT training and education. Information on these indicators are compiled from the World Bank website on data and statis- tics23 and the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR), 2001-02 (World Economic Forum 2001). Internet service provider charge is the monthly dial-up access charge for 20 hours of use and telephone usage charge is the telephone call charge for 20 hours of access. Understandably, higher costs would imply lower efficiency and less access.The last two are positive indicators of efficiency as they assign higher values to coun- tries where ICT facilities are relatively more effi- cient,as manifest in greater speed of access and higher expenditures incurred in training of per- sonnel. 4.3.3.Indicators of targeting social sectors Indicators capturing coverage of social sectors through ICT (or sectoral diversification of ICT) comprise (i) internet access in schools, (ii) computers in educational institutions per 1,000 students, (iii) prioritisation of ICT by the government, and (iv) government online serv- ices availability. In view of the importance of universal literacy among the MDGs, one can justify inclusion of two educational indicators. Similarly, two government-linked indicators have been included, as the state continues to play a major role in promoting social develop- ment in Asian countries.

Data on women professionals and technical workers have been taken from Human Development Report, 2003 and the information on other indi- cators, showing the \u2018rating\u2019 of the countries, is from GCR 2001-02. Public access to internet facilities and high competition among service providers are expected to lead to greater diffu- sion of technology, lowering of the price and improvement in accessibility, resulting ulti- mately in the increased access by the poor. Further,greater competition is likely to generate greater employment in the informal sector, which again would benefit the poor and vulner- able groups like women. Government\u2019s success in ICT promotion as also the greater sensitivity in the legal system to e-commerce, consumer protection, etc., would reflect the outreach of technology.This too,one may argue, will benefit the vulnerable sections of the population that tend to get marginalised under the free func- tioning of the market,without adequate protec- tion from state or legal institutions. 4.4 Rationale for selection of indicators It is important to discuss the extent to which selected indicators can map the attainment of MDGs. In the context of goals like eradication of poverty, the important question is whether the income and employment effect of ICT has a bias in favour of the poor that could help them rise above the poverty line. Despite opinions on the matter being equivocal, there is adequate empirical evidence to suggest that the overall impact of the availability of ICT has been posi- tive for the poor. This would justify inclusion of availability-linked and efficiency indicators of ICT development. Besides, the state playing a role in providing public access to internet and in ensuring competition among service providers, and the legal system promoting ICT develop- ment will contribute to better penetration of technology among the masses26 and lead to a reduction in poverty. It would be useful to con- struct other indicators articulating whether i) the technology being adopted is poor-friendly or accessible to the poor; ii) it is reaching the backward areas and economically underprivi- leged groups. But this is not possible using the existing official as well as non-official data sets. The role of ICT in improving education has been noted as positive and justifies inclusion of the availability-linked and efficiency indicators, in the context of meeting the education-related MDG. In addition, internet access in schools and computer use in educational institutions have been considered as extremely useful sectoral indicators in articulating the progress of coun- tries in achieving universal primary education. Statistics on women\u2019s access and usage of ICT relative to that of men are useful in under- standing the gender divide. These are available in \u2018The World\u2019s Women 2000\u2019, by United Nations with citations from Cyber Atlas.27 Unfortunately, there are serious information gaps and prob- lems of reliability, as the data sources are of dif- ferent quality for Asian countries (UNIFEM 2000).There are also anomalies and inconsisten- cies with regard to data collection procedures adopted by different countries, particularly for temporal comparison (Hafkin, 2003). One alter- native is to take percentage of women with ter- tiary level of education like university degree, teachers\u2019training, professional degree, or enroll- ment of women in science and engineering,28 as the indicators, but this would be a bit remote for capturing gender sensitivity in ICT.It is,there- fore, proposed to capture this dimension through the percentage of females among pro- fessionals and technical workers. In the context of maternal and child health, access to basic amenities including sanitation facilities and other social sectors, indicators per- taining to the role of government, such as pub- lic access to internet, success of the state in internet promotion and efficacy of laws in ICT use, etc., have been considered useful as the state plays a key role in social development in Asian countries. These indicators may be included here to indirectly reflect the coverage of social sectors, as disaggregated data on use 13 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia 29 The role of the government is likely to be significant in the context of achieving other MDGs as well.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc91dc7d-a153-443c-8886-5c10c0d53310": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc91dc7d-a153-443c-8886-5c10c0d53310", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5dad5901f66fe0d2ca473c19c44e905e11f97979df20b4a90a38a1e5c7d46fce"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d560c97-3743-49cb-aa31-f151c7adc630", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa60dfa6b76471e284686439ad149e7e01bbf08e0d83677fc205cde956ccf428"}}, "hash": "e084aa05e9894911bc51341b3a9f5a097b2473b56d84fa431cf63a30a95c7ade", "text": "30 It is hoped that the Theory of Large Numbers will tend to minimise the bias implicit in the methodology, over a large number of such applications. of ICT in these sectors are not available.29 Besides,one would have to depend on availability- linked indicators since the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d51f796-7d17-4eb1-a3bd-b67ad2b561ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d51f796-7d17-4eb1-a3bd-b67ad2b561ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1009364d2ee9a28dad8fa79cbf8d30a612f51e0b78795d0d62387d2012debdb"}}, "hash": "b1009364d2ee9a28dad8fa79cbf8d30a612f51e0b78795d0d62387d2012debdb", "text": "growth of ICT per se can help in achieving these goals through the functioning of the market. This indeed is possi- ble if countries follow certain kinds of ICT policy which as our overview suggests, is still in the formative stage in most of the Asian countries. It may be pointed out that the Task Force con- cedes the point that selection of indicators at any point of time would be guided by availabili- ty of data. It argues in favour of maintaining a certain amount of flexibility in the methodology so that experiences gained over the years can be brought in to improve and refine indicators over time. Further, it recognises its own limita- tion of not being able to put together hard empirical evidence to justify the selection of indicators or determine their relative impor- tance.It,therefore,argues that assembling anec- dotal evidence and success stories would be useful and complementary in the direction of developing an analytical framework for the exercise.It is in line with this perspective that an attempt has been made in the following section to work out a few composite indices reflecting various dimensions of ICT development as well as its overall progress. Working out component indices pertaining to different aspects of ICT development and the aggregate index 5.1.The methodology In view of the growing popularity of composite indices and the possible usage of ranking of countries in national and international policy debates, it is proposed not to use complex mul- tivariate tools in the composition exercise. The methodology attempts aggregation of the indi- cators at several stages, as has been done by UNDP in working out the Human Development Index (HDI). The method of assigning weigh- tages on the basis of a correlation matrix, such as Principal Component Analysis, has not been considered appropriate here since the pattern of interdependencies is likely to change as the technology takes firm root in the region. As one 5 has no other empirical basis to work out the rel- ative importance of indicators, it has been decided to assign the equal weights to all the indicators. 30 The other important problem to be sorted out is the elimination of the bias of scale that charac- terises each indicator. In computing HDI, UNDP adopts the Range Equalisation (RE) method wherein each indicator is divided by the range (after subtraction of the lowest value) so that scale-free values vary between 0 and 1.In recent years UNDP has changed its methodology slightly as it uses a fixed range computed on the basis of predetermined \u2018goalposts\u2019reflecting the feasible upper and lower limits to the values. This enables one to make temporal compar- isons, not only of the rank scores of countries but also of their HDIs. The disadvantage in this method is that the three constituent indices pertaining to life expectancy, education and GDP have lost the feature of having a fixed range of unity. The highest value in each index falls short of unity as the value for the top- ranking country is below the goalpost.The same explanation holds for the minimum value being higher than zero. In view of the familiarity and popularity of this method among practitioners and policy makers,it has been the first choice for constructing composite indices in the present analysis. It may nonetheless be pointed out that fixing the range of the constituent indices through division by range discriminates against indica- tors that have greater disparity. Moreover, as inequalities in different indicators show differ- ent trends, it would be inappropriate to force these to have uniform and constant range over time. Indeed, with the introduction of the con- cept of goalposts to compute the range, the (scale-free) values of the indices no longer have the constant range of unity (and thereby have lost their unique property). However, the maxi- mum and minimum values have been specified, based on the possible values over recent years and division by range is expected to ensure that the difference in disparity of the constituent indicators does not get reflected in HDI. Furthermore, there can be disagreements in fix- ing the goalposts for indicators like GDP per 14 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia 31 The mean for each indicator has been obtained by adding up the values of all the countries and dividing the total by nine.The new or scale-free value of each country, obtained through the division by mean, shows its relative posi- tion vis-\u00e0-vis the average of the nine countries, on that indicator.

Notably, the RE methodology treats the two types of indices in an identical manner.The pop- ularity and acceptability of the HDI among poli- cy makers seems to have come in the way of these issues being investigated adequately in the literature. It is therefore proposed to use an alternate method that permits the coefficients of variation of different indicators to remain dif- ferent even after making them scale free, and lets these differences be reflected in the com- posite index and ranking. To achieve this, all the indicators have been made scale free (See Appendix IV) through division by their own mean which may be called the Division by Mean (DM) method.31 The coefficients of variation of the original indicators, thus, become the stan- dard deviations of the scale-free indicators, which then are carried into the composite indices. Another important point is temporal compara- bility of the indices. As the present exercise is undertaken to make comparison only across countries, elimination of scale effect has been done by dividing each indicator by range or mean, computed for the chosen year. In case such comparisons are to be made over time, it would be necessary to fix the values of the divi- sors, as is now being done in computing HDI in Human Development Reports. Indeed for com- puting ICT composite indices for any future year, it would make sense to use the same means as in the base year in the denominator for each indicator. However, in case the base year is not considered representative of the early years of the 21st century, it should be pos- sible to work out the mean of the first three years, say 2001, 2002 and 2003, and fix these as the denominators for eliminating the scale bias for all subsequent exercises. Five component indices have been constructed by the RE method as well as the DM method of indexing, in the first stage. These pertain to the five sets of indicators discussed above: (i) skill- independent ICT;(ii) skill-dependent ICT;(iii) effi- ciency and speed of ICT (iv) social sector target- ing; and (v) vulnerable group targeting. Before composition, all the indicators need to be made uni-directional within each category.Indeed,the indicators reflecting the costs of communica- tion, such as internet service provider charges, telephone usage charge for internet, cost of local call and cost of call to U.S., cannot be com- bined with those articulating internet speed or IT training. It has, therefore, been considered proper to reciprocate these cost figures so that efficiency indicators get defined as (i) internet time available per dollar, (ii) telephone time for internet usage per dollar, (iii) local telephone time (at peak period) available per dollar, and (iv) US telephone time per dollar. This has been done on the basis of the understanding that the higher the accessibility of ICT time per unit of money, the greater is the efficiency of the sys- tem. This problem does not exist in case of any other category of indicators. Lastly, the aggre- gate index of development of ICT in the context of MDGs has been obtained by combining the five composite indices. 5.2 Indices obtained through range equalisation method Following the RE method, the component index for a category has been obtained by first making each indicator scale free by subtracting its mini- mum value from each observation and then dividing it by its range.The average of these val- ues across the indicators (within the category) for each country then becomes the value of its com- ponent index. If a country has maximum values for all the indicators in a category, it will score an index value of 1. Similarly, a country will obtain a component score of zero only when it has the minimum value for all the indicators. The larger the value of group-specific or aggregate index, the higher the role played by ICT towards attain- ment of MDGs in the country. Furthermore, an aggregate index for ICT development has been computed with the same methodologies used for computing the category-specific indices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85a7c40d-cb3d-4b60-9f5f-05fd03804d1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "85a7c40d-cb3d-4b60-9f5f-05fd03804d1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06e7f723c763ec2375e3ae507883e8b9f0308cffe68548da53008ebbe10508b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2f59e16-7494-4b57-8c82-47edadcce9fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0f118d1a77fb82584cb1e8e2e01c9e5ec30f049e14b131fe89128c25f9f7e63"}}, "hash": "711b832a66f511e47442e6caf5889758700d07efed2db1687b968a40cd95f242", "text": "The indices of skill-dependent and skill- independent ICT availability measure the rela- 15 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia tive position of the countries pertaining to the availability of different types of facilities.

More importantly, Thailand and China, which follow Malaysia,are way behind.The value of the skill-independent ICT index for Malaysia is also very high,but the gap with the second and third position countries is less than in the previous case. The availability of ICT across countries, therefore, exhibits wide inter-country variation, as evident from Figure 1. The efficiency index depicts the positions of the country\u2019s ability in providing access to high- speed ICT at low costs.Here,too,Malaysia obtains the highest position (Figure 2). However, its rela- tive position vis-a-vis other countries is not as high as in the case of ICT-availability indices due to (i) the high cost of providing internet facilities and (ii) a call to the US being more expensive as compared to other countries (the two indicators belonging to this category). Interestingly, Sri Lanka,India and Pakistan report high values (fair- ly close to Malaysia), although these have very low levels of ICT availability. The index of social sector targeting reflects the performance of countries in promoting ICT in certain specific direction for the well-being of people.The idea is to assess whether benefits of technology have remained restricted to a few or have percolated down to several sectors, that is, to reach larger sections of the population. Interestingly, China obtains the highest position here, followed by India and Malaysia. The high value obtained by China is largely due to the indicators pertaining to the deployment of computers in the field of education and to the government giving ICT a high priority (Figure 3).

India is placed in the top position here,followed by Malaysia,and this is due to the high values report- ed in (i) public access to internet,(ii) government\u2019s success in ICT promotion, (iii) competition among internet service providers, and (iv) a developed legal system concerning ICT use (Figure 4). The aggregate index is a summary measure of the five composite indices, discussed above.

Interestingly Sri Lanka,which secures modest values in availability- linked indicators, attaining the top position in terms of efficiency. This index does not show much variation across the countries (Figure 7), as costs are becoming similar around the world, under the impact of globalisation of the technol- ogy. In targeting social sectors, China secures the highest value and this is basically because of ICT being used in a big way in educational institutions and government assigning it a high priority, as noted earlier.It is only in this category that we see Malaysia sinking very low (Figure 8), going below the average of the series while India and Thailand notch significantly higher positions. In targeting vulnerable sections of the population, India and Malaysia seem to be doing well (Figure 9).In both countries,the state seems to be playing an impor- tant role in prioritising ICT as also creating a fair competitive environment among the service providers.Here again,inter-country disparity does not show any alarming proportions because of the nature of the indicators. Understandably, Malaysia has the highest value in the aggregate composite index,followed by China and Thailand,the countries that have been a part of the globally linked rapid development process, at least for some time during the past two decades. India and Sri Lanka come next (Figure 10).They are at about the same level but the latter gets past the former by reporting significantly higher values in availability and efficiency linked indicators.

Comparison of the alternate sets of indices A quick comparison of the rankings obtained from the aggregate indices arrived at, by two different methods suggests that the results are not very different. The top three positions are occupied by Malaysia, China, and Thailand and the bottom by Viet Nam in both methods.There are a few changes in the ranking of the middle order countries that may be considered margin- al. One may, therefore, argue that since the pro- posed method gives similar results as that of the RE method, the credentials of this alternative need to be noted in the literature of aggregate indices.The objective of comparing the two sets of results obtained through different methods, however, is quite different. It is to identify and focus on the differences that have emerged from the two exercises, and analyse the reasons in the context of the dynamics of ICT develop- ment in Asian countries. The first major difference noted is that despite the ranks of the countries being similar, the gaps in the values of the indices are quite dif- ferent. One may, for example, consider the dif- ferences between China, Thailand and India, obtained by the RE method, to be insignificant and treat them at par.

Similarly, Mongolia and Viet Nam score very low values in the aggregate index by the RE method, which is not the case with the alterna- tive. This again is because the availability indi- cators,in which these two countries record rea- sonably high values, receive implicitly low weightage in the RE method of aggregation used in HDI calculations. Another major difference is in the ranking of Pakistan vis-a-vis Sri Lanka in the aggregate index by the two methods.The higher scores of the latter on availability get reflected in the aggregate index by the DM method,with a rela- tively higher weight, giving it a higher rank. In the RE method, however, the importance of the availability indices (with high disparities) are implicitly reduced, which is responsible for reversal in ranking. As noted above, division by mean gets rid of scale bias but not disparity.One may note here that Sri Lanka has higher scores than Pakistan in a larger number of indicators and by a huge margin in absolute as well as rel- ative terms. 19 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia The difference in ranking occurs even in category- specific component indices.Sri Lanka and China get top positions in terms of efficiency and tar- geting social sectors respectively by the DM method, leaving behind Malaysia (which is placed at number one position in both, by the RE method).It may be observed that most of the indicators in the two categories have low inter- country variation. All the countries have similar values except for telephone charge for internet services and computers installed in educational institutions. Both the indicators are important within their respective categories and are responsible for much of the variation among countries. The advantage of Sri Lanka lies in charging a low price for internet services while that of China is in promoting computer educa- tion in schools. The DM method, by implicitly giving higher weightage to these indicators,has placed the two countries above all the others in the categories mentioned above. Similarly, Malaysia is able to get past India in terms of tar- geting vulnerable group index (the latter having the top position by RE method) as it has a high- er percentage of female professionals among workers and the method implicitly gives a high- er weightage to the indicator because of its higher disparity. It is not the purpose of the statistical exercise attempted here to establish the superiority of one method to the other as their suitability would very much depend on the objectives of the exercise and the empirical regularities observed in the region under investigation.The above discussion makes it clear that change in the methodology of composition can and does bring about significant changes in the values of component indices and alters even the ranking of the countries. Issues of value judgment, implicit in the methodology cannot, therefore, be dismissed. It has been demonstrated that the RE method implicitly gives lower weightages to indicators pertaining to availability and a few other aspects of ICT development that are observed to have high disparity.The disparity,in the coun- tries under consideration, has been caused through the process of development, mediated largely through the market, with limited control being exercised by the government.In the earli- er sections on the process of development, it has been argued that ICT here is still in the initial stages of development and consequently, increase in its availability itself could prompt socio-economic development. Several econom- ic, social and cultural factors are currently inhibiting the process of growth and an increase in the availability of this technology would help in giving exposure to policy makers, administra- tors and common people to the global informa- tion system. Further, this would lead to the establishment of better communication net- works even within countries and facilitate deci- sion making of public and private agencies. Importantly, supply of ICT has been strongly linked with economic affordability of the coun- tries, resulting in high disparity in the former. In future, economic factors affecting affordability would also be important for the development of ICT. This is a fact which cannot be denied at the present time. In view of all this, giving high importance to availability indicators does not appear to be misplaced. It is indeed true that national governments in the Asian region have tried to give a direction to the development of ICT by intervening in the market, controlling prices, introducing it in social sectors, fixing priorities, strengthening the legal structure for ensuring access to all, etc.The cross-country differences in the indica- tors are not very high, as may be inferred", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8159f699-362c-4ad0-8098-e1e62b5ed638": {"__data__": {"id_": "8159f699-362c-4ad0-8098-e1e62b5ed638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edaac76337e98bb2517434548551aa2c163745b74737edc422df5bd103cb4fd2"}, "3": {"node_id": "106a24d1-385d-4f42-883f-9a86ce2ac491", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9ed2b2e80a490657feb1eff9fa8cd0c1b4a5a1e6277ed8d54f3378b3719005f"}}, "hash": "0ec2a0e97bc0c727f339a8297bda514ec0ad376a814c41293c403501ab6ea49d", "text": "from the low coefficients of variation of the indica- tors (Appendix V) belonging to the third,fourth and fifth categories. Irrespective of socio-polit- ical structures, each country has taken meas- ures to give a push to the dissemination of technology in the desired direction. Indeed, there are specific measures adopted by indi- vidual governments to direct ICT towards MDG objectives but it is impossible to generate comparable cross-sectional data on this aspect. Also, the success of such measures has been limited and uneven across countries, due to the overwhelming nature of the market which has proved formidable. This is reflected in unbalanced sectoral and spatial growth of ICT, evident from the high disparity in the first and second categories of the indicators of availability. In view of the above observations, maintaining the inter-country variation of indicators (by making the standard deviation of the original indicator the coefficient of the scale-free indica- tor) and then giving equal weightage to their variations in the aggregation scheme appears to be more appropriate. Studies have shown 20 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia that the indicators that play a significant role in the development dynamics of less-developed countries like India exhibit high disparity in space (Kundu 1984). Undoubtedly, this kind of regularity observed in certain contexts cannot become an axiom as it cannot claim universality. However, given the pattern of development noted through correlation analysis and review of literature pertaining to the Asian region, one can, with some degree of confidence, justify retention of the variation in availability indica- tors in the process of composition. Understandably, this implies giving implicitly higher weightage to availability-linked indica- tors, the rationale for which has been discussed while analysing the development dynamics in the region. In brief ICT indicators have shown strong positive rela- tionships with per capita income and HDI across the countries of the world in 1991. The MDG indicators related to health and education, such as net primary school enrollment ratio, children reaching grade 5, youth literacy rate, reduction in child mortality and improvement in maternal health, have also shown a significant and desired pattern of interdependency with ICT indicators. Similarly, the percentage of people with sustainable access to water and sanitation facilities (in urban areas) is highly correlated with ICT indicators. In 2001, the pattern of relationships between ICT indicators and those of income and HDI across countries, has strengthened. Further, the correlations between ICT and MDG indicators related to health and education have improved over time. Importantly, the positive relationship between ICT indicators and the percentage of the non-poor, has improved significantly. The correlation of ICT with MDG indicators related to environmental sustainability, particularly to water and sanitation in urban areas has, howev- er, weakened over the decade. For indicators of growth or change in the level of ICT and progress towards MDGs during the 1990s, no regular pattern of relationship is dis- cernible. One may argue that diffusion of ICT to different social spheres is a recent phenomenon and its manifestations would be visible only with a certain time lag. In any case, the positive impact of growth in ICT on the process of socio- 6 economic development has not yet become statistically visible. Classifying the countries of the world into four categories such as Europe and OECD, Arab and Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Africa, an attempt is made to examine the the nature of interrelationships between ICT indicators and MDGs across regions. Expectedly, one notices high correlations of ICT indicators with per capi- ta income and other manifestations of econom- ic development in Europe, even in the early 1990s. This is true in the other three less- developed regions as well, although ICT here was restricted to use of radios, televisions and telephones. Importantly, the interdependency of ICT indicators with MDGs emerges as positive in the case of Europe. This, however, is not the case in the less-developed regions of Arab and Latin America, Africa and Asia. MDG indicators pertaining to primary education, health, gender equality and environmental sustainability, for example, have shown strong interdependency with ICT in Europe. These are either weak or do not exhibit any pattern in the other three regions of the world in 1991. The relationships of ICT indicators with those of MDGs, in 2001, are similar to or stronger than those of 1991 in Europe. In the less-developed regions, this is not the case.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "106a24d1-385d-4f42-883f-9a86ce2ac491": {"__data__": {"id_": "106a24d1-385d-4f42-883f-9a86ce2ac491", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edaac76337e98bb2517434548551aa2c163745b74737edc422df5bd103cb4fd2"}, "2": {"node_id": "8159f699-362c-4ad0-8098-e1e62b5ed638", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-and-human-development-towards-building-composite-index-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ec2a0e97bc0c727f339a8297bda514ec0ad376a814c41293c403501ab6ea49d"}}, "hash": "e9ed2b2e80a490657feb1eff9fa8cd0c1b4a5a1e6277ed8d54f3378b3719005f", "text": "In the less-developed regions, this is not the case.

This is not so in Asia as most of such interdependencies have been estimated to be insignificant, includ- ing those between ICT and education-linked MDGs. Furthermore, ICT is strongly correlated with the availability of drinking water and sani- tation facilities in Europe in 2001. This, to some extent,is the case in Arab and Latin America and Africa as well. However, the same, is not observed in Asia. The indicators articulating change or growth in the level of ICT or progress towards MDGs, over the decade from 1991 to 2001, exhibit no dis- cernible pattern of interdependency.The indica- tors of change in the level of ICT show no posi- tive correlation with change in primary school enrollment rate or gender disparity in education in any of the four regions. Importantly, the cor- relations between progress in ICT and that in 21 ICT and Human Development: Towards Building a Composite Index for Asia MDGs related to child and maternal health have the desired signs and are significant in the case of Europe, Arab and Latin America and Africa. Unfortunately, this is not so in Asia. Further, the infant mortality rate,urban households not having access to drinking water and sanitation here, exhibit no decline with progress in ICT.One would, therefore, infer that growth of ICT in Asia has not been the critical factor in progress towards the attainment of MDGs in the recent past. In order to assess the impact of ICT develop- ment on progress towards the achievement of MDGs, 22 indicators have been identified under five dimensions or broad categories of ICT development. Component indices have then been worked out for each of the categories by aggregating the constituent indicators after eliminating the scale bias. This has been done with the range equalisation method used by UNDP in computing HDI and also by the division by mean method.In each method,an aggregate index has been computed on the basis of cate- gory-specific component indices. A comparison of indices represents the relative positions of countries in the development of ICT in the con- text of the attainment of MDGs. Malaysia presents the highest values for most of the category-specific component indices as also for the aggregate composite index, followed by China and Thailand.Malaysia\u2019s unique position is because of its high values on availability indica- tors pertaining to both skill-independent and skill-dependent ICT. Closely following it in most of the individual indicators as well as in the com- ponent indices are China and Thailand. However, in social sector targeting, China goes past Malaysia and occupies the top position by both the methods, due to its emphasis on the use of ICT in education. Thailand is at par with China and Malaysia but gets a lower aggregate value due to deficiencies in availability indices. At the lower end are Mongolia and Viet Nam, although they are fairly high in terms of avail- ability indicators - way ahead of India or Pakistan.These two countries, however, have an advantage in terms of efficiency and targeting social sectors and vulnerable groups. The third South Asian country, Sri Lanka, has fairly high values for availability and most significantly, occupies the top position in terms of ICT effi- ciency, as revealed by the division by mean method. Indonesia has middle level values in almost all the indicators and figures at the mid- dle level in category-specific as well as aggre- gate composite indices. An important point emerging from the analysis is that in assessing the progress of ICT in the context of achieving any set of socio-economic goals, there would have to be an emphasis on availability indicators. In addition, several effi- ciency-linked and user-specific indicators would have been included in the analysis. For that, information must be gathered covering aspects of affordability, access and utilisation of ICT. These indicators should bring in the demand side and reflect the spread of technology, not only across economic and social classes but also regions, sectors and gender categories. Indicators, for example, may be built to articu- late what percentage of households in certain social, economic or regional group are able to make use of ICT. They should also reflect the percentages of people using ICT for a socially more desirable purpose.

Despite years of indigenous advocacy \u2013 with many positive outcomes \u2013 this situation continues to worsen in many countries. Strong economic growth in the majority of Asian countries has failed to bring significant benefits for indigenous peoples, and indeed levels of poverty and dispossession from lands and resources are rising. Development has further exacerbated this situation in many countries, with the appropriation of indigenous lands for development purposes, and large-scale plantation and forestry projects a major contributor. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has responded to the challenges facing indigenous peoples in the Asia Pacific region with the establishment of a regional initiative on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development. The aim of the programme is to facilitate dialogue and strengthen the framework for regional cooperation. To this end, this initiative, the Regional Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Programme (RIPP), works with a range of sectors to promote the recognition and protection of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. UNDP has a unique role in assisting indigenous peoples, as recognized by the Policy of Engagement, UNDP\u2019s policy statement on indigenous peoples: UNDP\u2019s coordinating role at the country level, its human development paradigm, advocacy of democratic governance, and policy of mainstreaming human rights positions makes it a key partner for pursuing a more holistic approach to development. Moreover, UNDP\u2019s country presence and the relationship of trust it has with governments and civil society partners enable UNDP to play a unique role in bringing together different stakeholders in development processes. UNDP Policy of Engagement with Indigenous Peoples, 2001 The fundamental link between human rights and development implicit in this policy of engagement was also affirmed in 2000 in the Millennium Declaration and the associated Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Declaration states: \u201cWe will spare no effort to promote democracy and strengthen the rule of law, as well as respect for all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development.\u201d This link between human rights and development articulated in the Millennium Declaration underpins and frames all development work undertaken by the United Nations. UNDP, in collaboration with other UN agencies, seeks to meet this challenge though advocating and using a human rights-based approach to development. Simply put, this entails the promotion and protection of human rights not only in the outcome of projects and programmes, but in the methods through which projects and programmes are implemented. The right to participation, the right to self-determination and the right to development are implicit in this approach. This publication reflects this approach to development, seeking to examine the development policies of agencies and organizations from a human rights-based perspective. It represents a step in a dialogue process in which key development financing institutions are engaging with indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations and representatives to better enable rights-based design and implementation of development initiatives. UNDP would like to thank the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Legal Centre (DINTEG) in the Philippines for taking the lead in making this process of dialogue a reality. We would also like to thank all the authors who have contributed to the analysis in this publication. We hope that this publication assists international development financing institutions in their engagement with indigenous peoples on national, regional and global levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9899fa24-9a9d-46f8-b284-6849d52839a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "9899fa24-9a9d-46f8-b284-6849d52839a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29eac221ebf4ba7c0c8ce8e82596fdf2a0899a2b1460cb5547ba7c2720317f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "3203a68d-2890-4e22-af9f-9f384f8a288d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d9c004b962196937945acb8aad14d1d8b5913f2fce1ffcd0f5ef118793bc46e"}}, "hash": "b2d5e936f6b824ddd7c39a648c0b7cca9a18657572977e7dd95fafec1a7a3ca6", "text": "It is also hoped that this publication will serve as a tool for indigenous peoples in advocating for their rights in development processes that impact them.

Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 2 1 I. Introduction The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the United Nation\u2019s global development network, advocating for change and connecting countries to knowledge, experience and resources to help people build better lives. The UNDP corporate mandate, development cooperation processes and agreements, and the aspirations of indigenous peoples guide UNDP engagement with indigenous peoples and their organizations. In the context of the International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People (1995-2004), and building on previous initiatives, UNDP issued a policy guidance note in August 2001 entitled: UNDP and Indigenous Peoples: A Policy of Engagement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa9ef4a8-5d46-43eb-9dc4-6236f3c71461": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa9ef4a8-5d46-43eb-9dc4-6236f3c71461", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24295efb9bbede600072969a22ff49c81c94048565e6726761bb7b9a8c1c0516"}, "2": {"node_id": "c7ee3603-75e9-443e-a4af-076d68f4c275", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59f362d3402bc3c8749f897347e131e3b79dc0af05825ebaff2d666db5fc0f9a"}}, "hash": "a0fbae57d7d791528fedc352bb72cfd10d022a23b1e4f439539cc9e141ba122f", "text": "In the Asia-Pacific region, in recognition of the large number of indigenous peoples in the region and UNDP\u2019s mandate to promote democratic governance, UNDP initiated a new programme for indigenous peoples \u2013 the Regional Initiative on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development (RIPP). The aim of the regional programme is to provide a space at the regional level for dialogue and cooperation amongst and between the national governments, donors, development agencies and indigenous peoples in the region. RIPP works in close cooperation with its partners to ensure a participatory and rights-based approach to development.

In response to a request from indigenous peoples \u2013 a direct reflection of UNDP\u2019s position of trust and neutrality \u2013 RIPP is engaged in establishing a process of dialogue between IFIs, key development financing agencies and indigenous peoples through advocacy and training. The most relevant IFIs in Asia are the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank (WB). Projects developed and implemented by these institutions have significant impacts on the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples throughout the region. In recognition of this, WB and ADB have developed indigenous peoples\u2019 policies to guide project development and funding \u2013 or are in the process of reviewing and/or adopting new ones. Indigenous peoples have voiced significant concerns regarding these policies and their implementation. In response, some of these institutions have indicated their willingness to engage with indigenous peoples in the review and consultation regarding these policies. There is thus an opportunity to initiate a process of dialogue and engagement between indigenous peoples and IFIs in order to develop more responsive adaptation and implementation of indigenous-related programmes through the policy framework. However, there is a lack of awareness among many indigenous peoples regarding the policies of IFIs. For them to engage in an effective and constructive manner in the policy dialogue with the major financial institutions, there is an urgent need for indigenous peoples to be better informed on the role, mandate, policies and programs of the IFIs. Concurrently, it is also imperative to provide a space for dialogue between indigenous peoples and international financial institutions to ensure indigenous peoples\u2019 voices are heard and heeded, especially during policy review processes. International Financial Institutions 3 1 The general framework used in the analysis is based largely on the principles and approaches enshrined in the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development and international instruments and jurisprudence which are minimum standards in evaluating the policies and practices as they relate with indigenous peoples. The international instruments most relevant to indigenous peoples include the following: \u25a0 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 \u25a0 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 1951 \u25a0 International Labour Organization Convention No. 107 on Indigenous and Tribal Populations, 1957 \u25a0 The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 \u25a0 The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 1966 \u25a0 The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), 1966 and Recommendation XXIII (51) of the ICERD Committee on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (18 August 1997) \u25a0 Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, 1979 \u25a0 International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989 \u25a0 Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1990 \u25a0 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and Agenda 21, 1992 \u25a0 Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992 \u25a0 Framework Convention on Climate Change, 1992 \u25a0 Convention to Combat Desertification, 1994 \u25a0 African Charter of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, 1981 \u25a0 European Council Resolution on Indigenous Peoples within the Framework of the Development Cooperation of the Community and Member States, 1998 \u25a0 Durban Declaration and Program of Action, 2001 \u25a0 Vienna Declaration and Programme Action, 1993 \u25a0 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (draft) \u25a0 Organization of American States Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 1997 (draft) The paper is a consolidated digest of three case studies pertaining to the World Bank Group (WBG), prepared by Fergus Mackay; ADB, prepared by Devasish Roy; and the JBIC, prepared by Joan Carling and Friends of the Earth Japan.

Background of major international financial institutions World Bank Group The World Bank (WB) was founded in 1944, along with its sister organization the International Monetary Fund (IMF), following the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference hosted by the US Treasury Department at Bretton Woods, USA. Thus they are also known as the Bretton Woods Institutions.1 The WB was established as an intergovernmental organization with the primary mandate of financing reconstruction and facilitating economic development post World War II.2 After the war, the industrialized countries wanted to ensure that the capitalist economy would be strengthened and expanded worldwide. International institutions that could guarantee this had to be set up, thus the creation of the WB and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff3a1b62-bd96-47b9-8118-5e676ed8ede8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff3a1b62-bd96-47b9-8118-5e676ed8ede8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f9f7a80d1f31705f58e02c85f8935eca14822a9a8a451d33444866060435b45"}, "3": {"node_id": "58fcd50e-0f52-4790-9d9c-6190c884c0de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9e952c1f0a9889051d9f5f4cf03b2df6fe33dd5e0844222fb78075a83cac32f"}}, "hash": "741a24b851c177e23fc2c3afaffb5c35be442013b543cc92207f2fce97332a39", "text": "IMF.

The Group of Seven \u2013 United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy \u2013 hold 40 to 45 percent of the votes by virtue of their contributions; the United States alone holds 16.5 percent of the voting power. It has also become a tradition to have an American as the WB president. The WBG\u2019s mandate and stated objective is \u201cto help reduce poverty and finance investments that contribute to economic growth.\u201d Its main activities are to provide loans or guarantee credit for projects such as roads, bridges, power plants, transport, schools, and other infrastructure that will support the operations of governments and private corporations. Its primary lending instruments are: \u25a0 Project investment loans to fund dams, irrigation projects, schools, hospitals, mining, etc.; \u25a0 Structural adjustment loans and sectoral adjustment loans; \u25a0 Hybrid loans which combine elements of adjustment and project investment components. This can include funding for policy or legal reforms like changing Mining Acts, Forestry Laws, etc.5 The WBG is one of the largest financers of development projects and activities in the world. In 1999-2000, the Bank\u2019s cumulative lending alone was US$162,789 million.6 The Bank has also played a fundamental role in the globalization of extractive industries (EI), both by financing specific projects and by providing investment and insurance guarantees, and, more importantly, through structural and sectoral adjustment loans and technical assistance projects designed to revise legislation and reform government institutions.7 Asian Development Bank The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is an international financial institution that was established on 19 December 1966. It has 61 member countries, consisting of 44 regional and 17 non-regional members. Its mission is to help its developing country members (DCMs) reduce poverty and improve their living conditions through its \u201cstrategic agenda\u201d of sustainable economic growth, inclusive social development and governance with effective policies. It has three cross-cutting themes: \u25a0 Private sector development, \u25a0 Regional cooperation and integration for development, and \u25a0 Environmental sustainability.8 5 Tauli-Corpuz. \u201cErosion of Indigenous Economic Systems.\u201d pp. 12-14.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58fcd50e-0f52-4790-9d9c-6190c884c0de": {"__data__": {"id_": "58fcd50e-0f52-4790-9d9c-6190c884c0de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f9f7a80d1f31705f58e02c85f8935eca14822a9a8a451d33444866060435b45"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff3a1b62-bd96-47b9-8118-5e676ed8ede8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "741a24b851c177e23fc2c3afaffb5c35be442013b543cc92207f2fce97332a39"}}, "hash": "f9e952c1f0a9889051d9f5f4cf03b2df6fe33dd5e0844222fb78075a83cac32f", "text": "\u201cErosion of Indigenous Economic Systems.\u201d pp. 12-14. 6 Fergus MacKay, \u201cMaking Molehills out of Mountains: Indigenous Peoples, the World Bank and Extractive Industries Review.\u201d 2005. 7 MacKay, \u201cIndigenous Peoples and the World Bank Group.\u201d 8 Ibon Foundation, \u201cInternational Financial Institutions.\u201d Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 6 1 The ADB\u2019s principal functions are to grant loans and equity investments for its DCMs and to provide technical assistance in development projects.

The Board of Directors has the sole authority to decide on the Bank\u2019s loans, guarantees, borrowings, technical assistance, equity investments and other activities. The Bank President handles the day-to-day operations.9 Although developing countries dominate the membership of the ADB, the real power rests in the member-countries who have the highest capital stock or shareholding, which determines their voting power. Traditionally these large shareholders have been members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of 21 First World donor countries including Japan, US, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Of these countries, Japan and the US have the highest combined shareholdings of almost 32 percent of total subscribed capital, and thus, account for 13 percent each of the total voting power. The combined voting power of the OECD countries has resulted in a shift of ADB\u2019s loan operations. In the first 20 years of its existence, the ADB emphasized project financing \u2013 mainly loans to agriculture and large-scale infrastructure projects, such as roads and hydropower dams \u2013 and the encouragement of export-oriented industries and a strong regulatory role for the state. However, in the wake of the founding of the World Trade Organization (WTO), with the push for greater liberalization of developing countries, the ADB stressed the central importance of private sector development and foreign capital, with a reduced role for the state and lending for structural adjustment and policy objectives as opposed to individual projects.10 Japan Bank for International Cooperation The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the second largest development bank in the world. It was established in 1999 when two large Japanese financial institutions, namely the Japan Export-Import Bank (JEXIM) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), merged.11 9 Ibid. 10 Ibid. 11 Joan Carling and Friends of the Earth-Japan. \u201cJapan Bank for International Cooperation Guidelines for Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations: Its implications to Indigenous Peoples\u201d.

A final version of this paper is also included as Chapter 3 in this publication. International Financial Institutions 7 1 OECF was mainly responsible for providing Yen Loans, one type of official development assistance (ODA). According to the Japanese Government, the purpose of Yen Loans is to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. JEXIM did other kinds of international financial operations (IFOs) that were not ODA loans, such as export loans, import loans, investment loans, and untied loans. The purpose of IFOs is to support Japanese companies\u2019 exports and investments.12 JBIC, as it combined these two institutions together, is responsible for both Yen Loans as well as the IFOs. Therefore, JBIC lends to governments of developing countries, and to Japanese and foreign companies. Currently, it finances projects all around the world, but most of the projects JBIC finances are in Asia (approximately 80 percent in 2002).13 Much of Japanese ODA is used to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, power generation projects, water facilities, airports, flood control projects and construction of ports. The majority is in the form of loans, rather than grants, leading to increased indebtedness of borrowing countries. Another important issue is the nature of ODA as \u2018tied aid\u2019 or aid given on the condition that it can be spent only on goods and services from the donor country. Although aid from Japan is today generally \u2018untied\u2019, allowing associated goods and services to be acquired from any country, there are pressures from the Japanese business community to re-tie ODA in order to create profit-generating opportunities for Japanese corporations. A 2003 revision to the ODA Charter puts explicit stress on Japan\u2019s national interest, with the objective \u201cto contribute to the peace and development of the international community, and thereby to help ensure Japan\u2019s own security and prosperity\u201d, as opposed to the more \u2018humanitarian viewpoint\u2019 in the previous Charter.14 III.

The IFC consultant claimed that the acceptance by the host community of the development plan represented the \u2018best case\u2019 of prior informed consent he had ever witnessed. The CAMC set up the Didipio Gold/Copper Project after being granted a Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) by the Philippine Government in 1994 covering 37,000 hectares for mining exploration and development activities. The community protested the mining activities, and soldiers were assigned to the area to secure CAMC operations. There were also reports of harassment and other abuses committed by the soldiers and para-military forces.16 A JBIC-funded extractive industry project is the Sakhalin II Oil Development Project in Russia to develop oil and natural gas reserves for export to Japan, Korea and other countries, which will cause serious damage to the indigenous peoples of the North Sakhalin Region as well as to the fisheries and ecosystems in the Sea of Okhotsk.17 Participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making A potentially positive example of ADB involvement in indigenous peoples\u2019 area is the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) Rural Development Project in Bangladesh. The project was initiated with the support of the indigenous peoples in the CHT region, particularly the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council, an apex body formed as a result of a peace accord agreed in 1997. The indigenous chairperson of the Regional Council is the ex-officio chairperson of the project\u2019s Regional Coordination Committee, with three indigenous district council chairpersons and three traditional paramount chiefs as members.18 The project\u2019s primary focus is to reduce \u2018absolute poverty in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and to provide a confidence-building environment for the Peace Accord of 1997.\u2019 The project also includes a Community Development component with a programme on Legal Literacy, Training and Gender. The loan agreement between the ADB and the Government of Bangladesh refers to the monitoring and implementation of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan by the project-monitoring unit. The involvement of indigenous peoples\u2019 institutions in decision-making and project implementation is a desirable development. However, the potentially positive impact of the project is at risk because of certain features that have been included without the knowledge and consent of the people concerned, in particular, the inclusion of a micro-credit component.19 Another illustration is the WB-funded Conservation of Priority Protected Areas Project (CPPAP 1994-2001), a seven-year, $20-million grant to conserve the Philippines\u2019 mega-diversity of flora and fauna \u2013 under the WB\u2019s Global Environment Facility. The project\u2019s goals are to provide support for conservation, management and development of protected areas and to involve local indigenous communities in the management of protected areas through their representation in Protected Area Management Boards. 16 Ibon Foundation, \u201cInternational Financial Institutions.\u201d 17 Carling and Friends of the Earth-Japan. \u201cJBIC Guidelines: Implications to Indigenous Peoples.\u201d 18 Raja Devasish Roy. \u201cThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy and its Impact upon Indigenous Peoples of Asia.\u201d Case Study Paper prepared for the workshop on Indigenous Peoples and Rights Based Development: Engaging in Dialogue, sponsored by UNDP-RIPP, 4-6 November 2005, Baguio City, Philippines.

Studies by Malaysian non-government organizations (NGOs) show that the current water supply system in Selangor State is wasteful and beset with inefficiencies.

Although the project proponents claim that the people are agreeable to the project, the Centre for Orang Asli Concerns (COAC) found that the affected Temuan families did not give their free, prior and informed consent to the relocation.21 Another example is the ADB-funded Community Forestry Program in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh implemented during the 1980s. The programme called \u2018joutha khamar\u2019 or \u2018collective farming\u2019 was intended to end shifting cultivation by the Jummas by forcibly relocating them to settled farms. The project resulted in the forced evacuation and dispossession of the indigenous Jumma peoples of their land in favour of Bengali settlers. It also allowed unhindered and accelerated exploitation of the forest and its resources, pushed the Jumma people into a state of constant debt and created dependence of Jumma people on the Bengali moneylenders and traders.22 Privatization and transnational corporations The privatization of industries, services and natural resources by transnational corporations is based on the rationale that most state corporations are inefficiently run mainly as a result of corruption. Therefore, if these are transferred to the private sector, they can be run more 20 Ibon Foundation, \u201cInternational Financial Institutions.\u201d 21 Carling and Friends of the Earth-Japan. \u201cJBIC Guidelines: Implications to Indigenous Peoples.\u201c 22 Suhas Chakma. \u201cADB Programs in Bangladesh: Identifying Critical Issues.\u201d Indigenous Perspectives Vol. 3, No. 1: 140-150 (June 2000).

However, privatization schemes under structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank have brought tragic results for the indigenous peoples and the environment.23 A case in Orissa, a northeast state of India, as cited by Corpuz, makes this clear. As part of the scheme to transfer energy-intensive industries to the south, fossil fuel-powered plants were needed. Privatization of the energy sector was seen as the best option, and, therefore, the power sector was privatized through the structural adjustment programme of the World Bank. The coal-powered plants, which the state operated, were sold to the private sector. WB provided only 3 percent of the needed investment, the private sector and ODA provided the rest. As a result, various transnational corporations from the United States, France, Canada and Japan earned $290 billion in combined total sales from procurement contracts in Orissa\u2019s power sector. The State of Orissa got $2.85 billion in various loans and financial assistance. Meanwhile, the indigenous peoples, who make up 25 percent of Orissa\u2019s population, along with people from other marginalized sectors such as the farmers and fishers, got the worst deal. After this energy-intensive, toxic, industrial development, their lives worsened: their subsistence economies were destroyed, health problems increased, communities were displaced, power costs increased beyond the reach of the majority population and human rights violations were committed against workers and tribal populations.24 Impact on culture and standards of living Some of the development projects funded by IFIs are insensitive to local indigenous cultures and have caused a decline in their living standards. The Koto Panjang Dam in West Sumatra, Indonesia, built with loans from JBIC in the 1990s, relocated some 4,886 households of the Minagkabau ethnic group. The project\u2019s feasibility study failed to take into account the characteristics of Minagkabau society. The villagers were resettled in a place that had no communal land (ulayat) or building (rumah gadang).

The San Roque Multi-purpose Project, funded by JBIC, displaced more than 4,400 people in the Philippines, and threatens the livelihood of thousands of indigenous Ibaloi people living along the Agno River upstream of the dam. Approximately 20,000 residents of Itogon, Benguet, will be affected by the sediment that is expected to accumulate behind the reservoir over the course of the dam\u2019s life. This sediment will eventually submerge homes, rice terraces, orchards, pasturelands, gardens and burial grounds of the Ibaloi living close to the Agno River. The fertile lands along the river and the gold ore found in the mountains have sustained Ibaloi communities engaged in agriculture, fishing and small-scale gold panning for generations. Project proponents did not obtain the free and prior informed consent of affected indigenous communities. Consultations were conducted only after the project was already underway. The energy project was completed and commercial operation began in March 2003.27 Another case is the proposed Laiban dam project in Quezon Province, Philippines, which is part of an ADB-funded programme to develop new water sources for Metro Manila. The project will direct 2,400 million litres of water daily to Metro Manila. A $3.26 million technical assistance loan was given by the ADB to the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System to implement the project together with private concessionaires Manila Water and Maynilad Water Services. The dam will directly affect around 20,000 hectares of land, deplete the irrigation supply of lowland farmers in Quezon province, and displace some 10,000 indigenous peoples, and upland settlers. Negotiations for resettlement are ongoing, with the indigenous Dumagat people reluctant to leave their ancestral territory as they fear this will result in the loss of their traditional culture. There are also reports of increasing militarization in the affected areas and recruitment of paramilitary CAFGU members among the Dumagat and Remontado tribes.28 IV. Lessons learned and recommendations for strategic engagement From the above-mentioned examples, some key lessons and recommendations can be drawn that can help improve the implementation of development projects and the relations between IFIs and affected indigenous peoples. 26 Ibon Foundation, \u201dInternational Financial Institutions.\u201d 27 Carling and Friends of the Earth Japan. \u201cJBIC Guidelines: Implications to Indigenous Peoples.\u201d 28 Ibon Foundation, \u201cInternational Financial Institutions.\u201d Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 12 1 Need to properly assess social and environmental impacts prior to approval There is a need to adequately assess the all projects social and environmental impacts, with the participation of the peoples concerned, prior to project approval. While WB, in principle, does undertake environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) prior to project approval, the more relevant issue is to ensure indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in and free prior and informed consent to ESIAs. Failure to do so could result in impacts far beyond what was originally predicted. Need to provide adequate information to ensure free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples IFIs and project developers need to provide adequate information to communities that may be affected by a project and to the public, especially critical documents such as a clear explanation of what the project is, and the following environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans. Adequate monitoring and evaluation during and after project implementation Better monitoring and evaluation procedures need to be established, with the IFIs taking more responsibility for implementing, monitoring and evaluating projects, instead of leaving these activities entirely in the hands of government or private sector partners. Affected communities should be provided with access and recourse to the IFIs as project funders, especially in those situations where compensation payments are not honoured. The IFIs have the ultimate responsibility to ensure that the projects are undertaken in accordance with their own policies and international human rights standards. Need to establish mechanisms to deal with outstanding problems Many projects have resulted in communities being worse off than they were before. Yet no mechanism is available for dealing with the serious environmental and social problems that may be created by projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8492fd2-6e67-4476-886f-26458fe8dc65": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8492fd2-6e67-4476-886f-26458fe8dc65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00af38510a10c3b9fdcf29bd719ca5d377462eb6777595115ae1632b34d64ee6"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc1cdb1c-a03a-40ee-9a2b-26f0c62ad7b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2e7e96df3cee933cda49a9e80287d5f1cf9ff066321f8e6efdda82071dc6342"}}, "hash": "97b65891e5cea50ca878d9bf358bd42b16062f37095b6a585f02182d2891c023", "text": "There is a growing demand for IFIs to take responsibility for repairing damage caused by its previously funded projects by allocating resources for retroactive compensation, mitigation and rehabilitation measures.

Such consultations may need to be preceded by an in-depth evaluation of the diverse impacts upon indigenous peoples of IFI-funded projects, which can feed into a future revision process. Regarding the review process of the WB\u2019s OP 4.10, Mackay suggests establishing national and regional working groups to systematically identify and track WB projects applying OP International Financial Institutions 13 1 4.10, with the aim of providing well-documented inputs to the three-year review of the OP agreed to by the Board. These groups could advocate, together with indigenous peoples from other regions, for full indigenous participation in the three-year review of the WB policy. It is also recommended that WB cooperate with or establish mechanisms to guarantee the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in defining the meaning and application of free, prior and informed consultation and ascertaining broad community support. One such mechanism is the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, in which WB itself participates through the Inter-Agency Support Group. Furthermore, it is important for indigenous peoples to proactively seek to define free, prior and informed consultation and broad community support in ways that are consistent with indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional or accepted methods of collective decision-making. Likewise, the policy formulation of JBIC on indigenous peoples must ensure the direct engagement of indigenous peoples and their participation in the process in order to ensure that their views, concerns and issues are taken into account and integrated in the finalization of the policy. Dissemination of information Dissemination of data and information, in a manner and form understandable by indigenous peoples, is crucial to ensuring transparency and accountability on the part of the IFIs. For WB, it is necessary that concerned indigenous organizations, peoples and communities affected by WB projects are well-informed about the requirements of OP 4.10 and other related OPs and can thus advocate for greater conformity with WB\u2019s own policies on indigenous peoples. Environmental and social impact studies to consider particular impacts on indigenous peoples Environmental and social impact studies should take full account of the specificities of indigenous peoples, and include socio-cultural impacts, intergenerational livelihood activities, and the views of affected indigenous peoples on compensation or non- compensation of losses, which are beyond material measures. These studies should ensure a process of transparency and validation of affected communities, prior to consideration for project funding. Monitoring evaluation of project impact on indigenous peoples The experience of the European Commission (EC) in having some of its projects evaluated by indigenous experts, and the findings shared among indigenous peoples and EC project staff and policy-level officials, can provide ideas for similar evaluation exercises for WB, ADB and JBIC-funded projects in indigenous peoples\u2019 areas in future. Indigenous peoples have demanded that WB involve local, national and regional indigenous organizations in actively tracking and monitoring WB operations throughout the whole project cycle. Such needs are equally relevant in the case of ADB and JBIC. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 14 1 Influencing policy reforms and decision-making by member country Governments The implementation of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is affected by relevant policies of the borrower governments. Thus, the positive impact of the ADB\u2019s policy could be watered down or countered in the absence of adequate national laws and policies recognizing indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. It is recommended that the ADB engage the concerned national governments to initiate policy reforms in their countries in order to effectively implement the ADB\u2019s policy on Indigenous Peoples. It is important in this respect to encourage ADB member governments to consult indigenous peoples in their countries, using participatory methods of consultation. In principle, WB-funded projects have to respect national laws. In cases when national laws contain higher levels of protection for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights than WB Operational Policy (OP) 4.10, as in the case of the Philippines\u2019 Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act, it is necessary to assess projects in relation to higher national legal standards in addition to OP 4.10. It is also important to identify those in government with primary responsibility for IFI projects and policy in order to understand their thinking. In some cases, this may be helped by also involving national agencies responsible for indigenous issues, legislative committees and other concerned bodies in the dialogue. It could also be useful to develop working relations with the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Unit in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4b2a9ef-7347-41a4-8aa6-34e0a64ebe1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4b2a9ef-7347-41a4-8aa6-34e0a64ebe1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9fdc93919c9ebb85a4ade92b0dc998891ef340b64e5b8b5165b4a6c83561ff2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "45afbda2-e363-468d-b5ad-e0ad5345d624", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d225bb127971d9d21d794cf535b188457aef6d315de6d5511c3d4097623f95c1"}}, "hash": "6d99fb2ecdcc117e57d89617f8e838f0975d4851a4973cb7a9feb58f7b74df53", "text": "ADB. Including indigenous peoples in bank-member country negotiations The ADB policy clearly declares that \u2018the fundamental relationship between ADB and governments remains the basis for country-specific operations\u2019. Indigenous peoples, however, are unaware of the contractual relationship between the bank and borrower governments. This needs to be corrected by indigenous participation both in the deliberations of ADB, and in policy dialogues with concerned governments. From as early as possible in the project cycle, it is necessary to identify, inform and advise affected indigenous communities and monitor ADB-financed projects. Identifying projects early in the cycle is critical in influencing project design and subsequent implementation. Consultants are usually employed by IFIs in the design of projects. It is therefore important to identify and communicate with consultants, particularly those addressing indigenous peoples\u2019 issues and legal issues. It is also important to identify the whole range of financiers in any IFI-funded project and to communicate indigenous peoples\u2019 concerns to all donors involved. It is not uncommon for certain donors to take on more supportive positions in relation to indigenous peoples\u2019 rights than WB. Accountability measures and litigation for violations of own policies and guidelines It is recommended to institute accountability measures on the part of IFIs in relation to violations of their own policies and guidelines. These should include measures on International Financial Institutions 15 1 compensation of affected communities, mitigation and rehabilitation of damaged environment and providing resources for people\u2019s livelihood. Another avenue is the Inspection Panel of the World Bank but this is limited to non-compliance of WB with its internal policies and procedures.29 V. Conclusions A review of the policies, programmes, projects and impacts of IFI-funded development on indigenous peoples in Asia underscores the need to ensure that the benefits of development do not just \u2018trickle down\u2019 to the poor and marginalized sectors, including indigenous peoples, but rather fully address their needs and improve their conditions. At this point, there is a need for indigenous peoples to actively participate in policy review, reform and advocacy in relation to development programmes that may be planned for implementation within their communities. Indigenous peoples\u2019 engagement with IFIs and other development actors is necessary in order to ensure that indigenous peoples\u2019 rights are respected and promoted in any development endeavour. Advocacy efforts of indigenous peoples could be directed at achieving reforms of existing policies of IFI through a participatory process of review and consultation. These reforms could also cover national policies of member country governments so that these are consistent with IFI policies and international human rights standards on indigenous peoples. Including indigenous peoples\u2019 perspectives in loan negotiations between IFIs and borrower countries is also another way forward. Another area for advocacy is to push for the conduct of environmental assessment and social impact studies that consider particular impacts on indigenous peoples. It is also necessary to work for more effective monitoring and evaluation of development project\u2019s impact on indigenous peoples, such as soliciting case studies and reviews by indigenous experts, and to put into place measures that will hold IFIs accountable for violations of their own policies and guidelines. In engaging with IFIs, it is crucial to challenge their policies and practices pertaining to indigenous peoples by weighing these against international standards as the minimum. It is also necessary to assert the indigenous peoples\u2019 inherent right to land, territories, resources and self-determination as the fundamental yardstick. It is only in the context of fundamental reforms and a shift towards a rights-based approach that development aid can truly be said to contribute to the genuine development of indigenous peoples. 29 See MacKay, \u201cIndigenous Peoples and the World Bank Group\u201d for more details.

The Asian Development Bank and Indigenous Peoples in Asia Raja Devasish Roy 2 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 18 2 I. Scope of the policy The Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is triggered when negative impacts of an ADB-supported project are anticipated.1 In such a situation, \u201cadequate measures must be taken to mitigate the negative impact, or make certain that a compensation plan ensuring that project-affected people are as well off with the project as without it\u201d.2 The policy applies to both public and private sector operations.3 It defines or identifies indigenous peoples in a broad manner and includes one or more of the following: \u25a0 Descent from pre-state population groups; \u25a0 Maintenance of cultural and other identities, institutions, etc. that are distinct from mainstream society; \u25a0 Self-identification, identification by others and desire to maintain its cultural identity; \u25a0 Distinct linguistic identity; \u25a0 Orientation towards traditional economic systems; and \u25a0 Attachment to traditional habitats and territories.4 In addition, a working definition is employed as an operational tool, which reads: \u201cIndigenous peoples should be regarded as those with a social or cultural identity distinct from the dominant or mainstream society, which makes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the process of development.\u201d 5 The ambit or scope of the application of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is clarified in the document itself, which states: \u201cThe policy, together with practices addressing indigenous peoples, applies in parallel with and does not replace or supersede other ADB policies and practices. Each of the elements of the policy and practice addressing indigenous peoples are considered within the context of national development policies and approaches, and the fundamental relationship between ADB and governments remains the basis for country-specific operations (emphasis added).\u201d 6 To rephrase the above, the policy itself advises us that in order to understand the full implications of ADB-funded projects upon indigenous peoples, we must look, in addition to the specific policy itself, into the following: 1 Asian Development Bank, Policy on Indigenous Peoples, pp. 2, 9. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. p. 17. 4 Ibid. p. 6. 5 Ibid. Case-specific identification may also be addressed at the stage of Initial Social Assessment. See also, pp. 6, 7 and Appendix. 6 Ibid. p. 25. The same paragraph further provides the following (at p. 25): \u201cThe strategies and approaches employed by ADB in relation to indigenous peoples build on the existing strategic framework and operational experience. The policy addressing indigenous peoples complements and supports, and is complemented and supported by other ADB policies. Compliance with the policy on indigenous peoples does not obviate the requirement of compliance with other ADB policies.\u201d The Asian Development Bank and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 19 2 (a) Other relevant ADB policies; (b) Relevant ADB practices; (c) Development policies and approaches of the borrower government; and (d) Nature of the relationship between the ADB and the concerned borrower government.

Basic elements of the policy One of the salient elements of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is to \u201cavoid negatively impacting indigenous peoples\u201d through ADB operations. Where that is not possible, the policy is to provide \u201cadequate and appropriate compensation\u201d.7 When substantial negative impacts on indigenous peoples are anticipated, the first step is to conduct an initial social", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f509837-0b7b-4dc4-9376-383654715873": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f509837-0b7b-4dc4-9376-383654715873", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5656ad5e69b4bcc13915bd3df496a5ff4608d7760121d9b98da62088e232df0d"}, "3": {"node_id": "431da95a-5fd7-43ed-94a5-7cf652624e94", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c31206b7ed619e3eed235a68136881962016610b471ec8009bc659653cba399"}}, "hash": "4ff22fb496d6a51b5749ae93b925d8402bf73d659715435c757612bbe1d854de", "text": "assessment or ISA, which is mandatory for all ADB projects.8 The policy recommends that an ISA be initiated in the early stages of a project.9 The ISA addresses the key social dimensions of the project, as well as the needs, demands and capacities of the people concerned.10 It also identifies the project beneficiaries and the people that are likely to be adversely affected by the concerned project.11 If the ISA determines that indigenous peoples are likely to be adversely impacted, or that indigenous peoples suffer from disadvantage or are otherwise vulnerable in the project intervention process, an Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plan must be prepared by the borrower government or other project sponsor to address the relevant needs or disadvantages, as the case may be.12 Where appropriate, the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plan is expected to be used to redesign a project in order to decrease or mitigate negative impacts, or to provide adequate compensation, in addition to mitigating harm or damage.13 The policy recognizes that consultation with indigenous peoples\u2019 groups 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. p. 18.

Consequently, it appears to consider consultation with affected peoples as mandatory.14 The elaborate provisions on the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan include suggestions to consider the wishes of the affected indigenous peoples and their social and cultural patterns; capacity building of the concerned communities, organizations and institutions; and the use of specialists to help formulate such plans.15 III. Negative and positive features of the policy and its application As is the case with various other instruments dealing with indigenous peoples\u2019 issues, the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples contains positive features or strengths, as well as weaknesses and gaps that could be regarded as the policy\u2019s \u201cnegative\u201d features. Weaknesses and negative features One of the most serious gaps or weaknesses in the policy is the general treatment of the Policy on Indigenous Peoples at par with other policies of the ADB, since it \u201capplies in parallel with and does not replace or supersede other ADB policies and practices\u201d.16 Therefore, theoretically, if there is a contradiction between the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, another ADB policy or practice, the former (the Policy on Indigenous Peoples) will not necessarily prevail, and this can work to the detriment of indigenous peoples. This was the case, for example, with the ADB\u2019s forestry sector support to the Government of Bangladesh, in which the provisions of the ADB\u2019s forestry policy prevailed over its Policy on Indigenous Peoples.17 In addition, the ADB\u2019s other relevant policies and practices must be considered \u201cwithin the context of national development policies and approaches\u201d, since \u201cthe fundamental relationship between ADB and governments remains the basis for country-specific operations\u201d.18 In other words, despite provisions in the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples respecting indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, needs and concerns, if national development policies and approaches of the borrower country run counter to these, the latter could well defeat, or water down, the impact of the positive aspects of the policy. In fact, this is quite a common occurrence across Asia. For instance, indigenous peoples on the ground rejected a number of forestry sector legal reforms in Bangladesh because these denied the people\u2019s land and resource rights.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "431da95a-5fd7-43ed-94a5-7cf652624e94": {"__data__": {"id_": "431da95a-5fd7-43ed-94a5-7cf652624e94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5656ad5e69b4bcc13915bd3df496a5ff4608d7760121d9b98da62088e232df0d"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f509837-0b7b-4dc4-9376-383654715873", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ff22fb496d6a51b5749ae93b925d8402bf73d659715435c757612bbe1d854de"}}, "hash": "1c31206b7ed619e3eed235a68136881962016610b471ec8009bc659653cba399", "text": "The The Asian Development Bank and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 21 2 19 Raja Devasish Roy and Sadeka Halim, \u201cA Critique to the Forest (Amendment) Act of 2000 and the (draft) Social Forestry Rules of 2000\u201d, published by the Society for Environment and Human Development (SEHD), Dhaka, Bangladesh, May 2001.

Many of the provisions of the national forestry policy of Bangladesh were in conflict with the positive aspects of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.19 Similarly, another ADB-funded social forestry project in Bangladesh, which also affected indigenous peoples, was deemed to have paid little heed to the rights of women.20 These examples from Bangladesh illustrate how the differing nature and level of protection provided by the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples and other policies and practices of the ADB can lead to minimal protection of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. Such protection could even verge towards a lowest common denominator situation, rather than strongly and unequivocally upholding the rights of indigenous peoples. In contrast, the policies addressing indigenous peoples of some non-lending donor institutions, such as the Government of Denmark and the European Commission, provide a far higher status to the rights of indigenous peoples.21 Of course, one should bear in mind that the Danish government and the European Commission are non-profit institutions. The ADB, although an inter-governmental agency, is managed as a profit-making corporation. Its major decision-making processes are dominated by the strong corporate shareholdings of the different national governments in Asia and other continents. Strengths and positive features Despite the weaknesses and gaps of the ADB Indigenous Peoples policy, as mentioned above, a number of other provisions are respectful of the rights of indigenous peoples. These positive provisions have the potential to secure the rights and interests of indigenous peoples, at least in the limited circumstance where the bank and the loanee government are in agreement. The policy states the following: \u201c\u2026initiatives should be compatible in substance and structure with the affected peoples\u2019 culture and social and economic institutions, and commensurate with the needs, aspirations, and demands of affected peoples. Initiatives should be conceived, planned and implemented, to the maximum extent possible, with the informed consent of affected communities, and include respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 dignity, human rights and cultural uniqueness.\u201d 22 Another positive feature of the policy is the acknowledgment of the disadvantaged situation of indigenous peoples. It also refers to international instruments on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and recommends involving and strengthening indigenous peoples\u2019 institutions in the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan.23 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 22 2 24 See, for example, statement of representative of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Organizations participating at the Round Table meeting on the World Bank\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy in Washington, D.C., USA on 17 October 2002. 25 See, e.g., (i) Philip Gain, The Last Forests of Bangladesh, Society for Environment and Human Development, Dhaka, February 1998 (esp. pp. 151-174) and (ii) Suhas Chakma, \u201cADB Programs in Bangladesh: Identifying the Critical Issues\u201d, in Indigenous Perspectives: A Journal of the Tebtebba Foundation, Vol. III, Number 1, Baguio City, Philippines, 2000, pp. 140-150. 26 This project was initiated through ADB Loan No. 1771-BAN (SF).

Difficulties, however, lie in the process of implementation. The ADB does not provide parallel mechanisms to ensure that the previously mentioned positive provisions are regarded as mandatory. A similar situation prevails in the case of the World Bank\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples, which bears striking similarities with the ADB\u2019s. Recent reforms to the World Bank\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples \u2013 the replacement of OD 4.20 by OP 4.10/BP 4.10 \u2013 include many desirable provisions that respect indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. However, these appear to be merely recommendatory, rather than mandatory.24 Well-researched and objective findings on the positive impacts of ADB-funded development programmes on indigenous peoples are hard to find.

In Bangladesh, for example, ADB-funded projects are generally regarded as harmful rather than beneficial to indigenous peoples.25 Nevertheless, the possibility of positive and creative use of the policy to safeguard indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and interests should not be ruled out. IV. Case study: ADB project intervention for indigenous people, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project A potentially positive example of ADB intervention, with support from the indigenous people of the area concerned, is the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project in Bangladesh.26 The project was initiated with the consent of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council, the premier indigenous-majority semi-autonomous institution of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region. The project includes the indigenous chairperson of this council as the ex-officio chairperson of the project\u2019s Regional Coordination Committee, with three indigenous district council chairpersons and the three traditional paramount chiefs as members.27 The project\u2019s primary focus is to reduce \u201cabsolute poverty\u201d in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region and to provide a confidence-building environment to underpin the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord of 1997. The project also includes a Community Development component with programmes on legal literacy, training and gender.28 The The Asian Development Bank and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 23 2 loan agreement between the ADB and the Government of Bangladesh refers to the monitoring and implementation of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan by the project-monitoring unit.29 The involvement of representative institutions of indigenous peoples in decision-making and project implementation is no doubt a desirable development, if that has happened with the prior, informed consent of the peoples concerned. However, the potentially positive impact of the project is at risk of being diluted, or even undone, by certain features of the project that have been included without the knowledge and consent of the peoples concerned. In particular, the inclusion into the project of micro-credit disbursement by local NGOs was apparently done at the behest of the ADB\u2019s president rather than by the wishes of the indigenous peoples of the region.30 At a recent meeting of the Regional Coordination Committee, serious concerns were raised by the chairperson and other indigenous members regarding the proposed loan disbursement, which is in violation of regional laws, practices and interests of local indigenous people.31 V. Monitoring, evaluation and policy review An important factor in ensuring the implementation of the positive features of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is effective monitoring. This, in turn, is dependent on the ADB\u2019s internal mechanisms and processes of monitoring and evaluation, as well as on the external processes of monitoring and evaluation by indigenous peoples, governments and NGOs. With regard to internal monitoring, the ADB\u2019s most important agencies are the Office of Environment and Social Development, the Programmes Department (in relation to country programming), the resident missions in the countries, and the Operations Evaluation Office, the last-named being involved predominantly in \u201cpost-evaluation\u201d functions.32 However, it appears that these agencies do not have much influence on the ADB\u2019s operations in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples, except in limited circumstances such as the project in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in Bangladesh. In the case of the Office of Environment and Social Development, individual employees may have the required attitude and respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, aspirations and perspectives.

This writer concluded, therefore, that this was substantively an orchestrated meeting that consciously excluded critical voices. This is also the opinion of Chris Lang in \u201cADB\u2019s Draft Forest Policy: The Politics of Participation\u201d, published in WRM Bulletin 74, September 2003. 39 See, for example, the statement of representative of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Organizations participating at the Round Table meeting on the World Bank\u2019s Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy held in Washington, D.C., USA on 17 October 2002 (attended by this writer). departments and agencies within the ADB. The situation is best illustrated by a comment made informally by a World Bank employee. He lamented, \u201cWhat can we, a dozen or so sociologists and anthropologists, do in the wake of contrary views of our more influential economist colleagues, whose numbers run into the hundreds, and whose primary concerns have little to do with the welfare of indigenous peoples or other such groups\u2026\u201d33 In any future revision of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, the findings of the ADB Operations Evaluation Office, if obtained in an accurate and objective manner, would be of great assistance. In the case of the World Bank, the ADB ignored or missed a similar opportunity to disseminate and utilize the findings of its corresponding agency, the Operations Evaluation Department, during appropriate stages of its Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Policy revision process.34 Therefore, a crucial factor in determining proper implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and consequent revision, is the question of how participatory the ADB\u2019s approach is in involving indigenous peoples in the relevant processes. Opportunities can always be created to open the necessary space for indigenous perspectives, if the ADB\u2019s high-level decision-makers can muster the will to do so. The ADB has formally consulted indigenous peoples and other \u201cstakeholders\u201d in the process of policy-formulation,35 and policy-review in certain cases.36 However, these processes are generally inadequate in terms of time and opportunity given to indigenous peoples and other stakeholders to provide their inputs.37 Only a few of these processes were sufficiently inclusive or transparent.38 Unless such trends are corrected, indigenous peoples will remain substantively deprived of their rights in ADB-financed projects and interventions in their areas. The example of the World Bank\u2019s consultation process for its recently reformed indigenous peoples\u2019 policy was one of inadequate consultation and sensitivity.39 The experience suggests that indigenous peoples need to strengthen their lobbying efforts if they are to influence reforms in policy and practice of multilateral development banks in the right direction. It would do well to remember that, ultimately, institutions such as the ADB and the World Bank are primarily oriented towards profit. Their perspective of economic growth through \u201cpoverty reduction\u201d is insufficiently receptive of indigenous perspectives on rights and development. The Asian Development Bank and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 25 2 Despite such limitations, indigenous peoples can strengthen their networking and organizational skills and help steer policy reforms in their hoped-for direction through advocacy, lobbying and policy dialogue.

More importantly, the policy does not provide adequate mechanisms to adhere to such rights. The basic rights of indigenous peoples, including their right to self-determination, their rights over their lands and territories, and their right to prior and informed consent40 concerning development interventions in their areas are now part of customary international law. These need to be unequivocally acknowledged as part of mandatory guidelines in any policy revision. Process of review and reform Although the ADB did consult a limited number of indigenous peoples\u2019 representatives prior to the adoption of its current Policy on Indigenous Peoples, such consultations were regarded by indigenous peoples as inadequate.41 The process of reforming the ADB\u2019s Forestry policy, for example, was seriously flawed by being insufficiently open, transparent or inclusive.42 Similarly to be avoided is the manner in which the World Bank held formal consultations with indigenous peoples\u2019 representatives, including legal experts, between 2002-2005.43 The modalities for a future review process of the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples need to be agreed upon, with input from indigenous peoples. Such consultations need to be preceded by an in-depth evaluation of the diverse impacts of ADB-funded projects on indigenous peoples. 40 In its new policy on indigenous peoples (OP 4.10), the World Bank mentioned the requirement of Prior Informed Consultation, which has been rejected by indigenous peoples since it falls short of the principle of Prior Informed Consent. 41 This writer was among the participants at a formal consultation on the policy held at Punta Baluarte, Philippines, in 1995. Many of the participants at the meeting felt that the process of consultations was not participatory enough and therefore advised the ADB\u2019s representatives to hold further formal consultations with indigenous peoples\u2019 representatives. This advice does not seem to have been accepted or acted upon by the ADB. 42 See for example, Chris Lang in \u201cADB\u2019s Draft Forest Policy: The Politics of Participation\u201d, published in WRM Bulletin 74, September 2003. 43 This is noted in a letter written by representatives of indigenous peoples to the Vice Chairman of the World Bank, on 24 March 2004, expressing concern over the process of consultations.

Monitoring and evaluation of project impact upon indigenous peoples The experience of the European Commission (EC) in having some of its projects evaluated by indigenous experts, and the findings shared among indigenous peoples and EC project staff and policy-level officials, can provide ideas for similar evaluation exercises of ADB-funded projects. Indigenous peoples have demanded that the World Bank involve local, national and regional indigenous organizations in actively tracking and monitoring its operations throughout the whole project cycle.44 Such needs are equally relevant in the case of the ADB. Influencing policy reforms by ADB member country governments Since the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is affected by the relevant policies of the borrower governments, the positive impact of the ADB\u2019s policy would be watered down or countered in the absence of adequate acknowledgement of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights in national laws and policies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "982256b6-273a-4fe3-821d-9205c1ca826f": {"__data__": {"id_": "982256b6-273a-4fe3-821d-9205c1ca826f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e5bf9ddcbd8e3d63e61aaf153ec16feeab3ca610f8cd81a8ee8a99c26c7bbbe"}, "2": {"node_id": "03836d69-bb22-48c2-8a3f-9f387b96fd33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "649a2a77af179a8246fe8c81e0f4d41d81491053424904f61a815ceb76a96b84"}}, "hash": "5eed15cdc7335d41a1176d92d63d6190eea1a34ef89ccddb118829fd84f81bf4", "text": "Some have advocated that the ADB engage the concerned national governments to initiate policy reforms in their countries and to effectively implement the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.45 It is important in this respect to encourage ADB country member governments to not only consult indigenous peoples, but to institutionalize appropriate methods of consultation.46 Disseminating data and information Dissemination of data and information (in appropriate forms) is crucial to ensuring that the necessary implementation and reform process is in accordance with the rights of indigenous peoples.

OECF was mainly responsible for providing Yen Loans, one type of Official Development Assistance (ODA).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b80e2ef-b7b7-4ddd-8c2a-df87090d0fce": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b80e2ef-b7b7-4ddd-8c2a-df87090d0fce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d78355b3b3f06f1de29fc1dec505b727fba78db46e0625c801ea5299201a1e6"}, "2": {"node_id": "26df7c7c-5e51-4d17-865c-fe344b8ef328", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abd6305eded884f0ec5423d085a4a6ff7c0f39892198a23e9b120494dec1738e"}}, "hash": "d490a152b1e0f3082203d9dc6a176f6ebca1ecdfc6466bbd5fb2ffb2cf22e3bb", "text": "According to the Japanese Government, the purpose of Yen Loans is to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries.

The purpose of IFOs is to support Japanese companies\u2019 exports and investments. Because JBIC was established by putting these two institutions together, it now is responsible for both Yen Loans as well as the IFOs. JBIC therefore lends to governments of developing countries and also to Japanese and foreign companies. JBIC finances projects worldwide. Most of the projects it finances, however, are in Asia. Of all Yen Loans, approximately 80 percent are given to countries in Asia. About 7 percent of Yen Loans are to countries in Africa, 6.5 percent to Latin and South America, 4.3 percent to the Middle East and 0.8 percent elsewhere (based on the data of FY 2002).

While some of these projects have contributed to the development of certain areas, a very significant number of its funded projects, particularly large infrastructure projects, have caused a lot of damage to the environment. These include air and water pollution, damaged ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity in many parts of the world. Affected people have also suffered significantly due to projects financed by JBIC. This has been due to involuntary resettlements, loss of livelihood and negative consequences on the socio-cultural life of the people. Destruction of ecosystems has also made living a traditional lifestyle impossible. It has divided communities and destroyed cultures. Compensation for damages to those adversely affected has not been sufficient and their lives have further deteriorated. Those who have suffered most from ill-conceived projects funded by JBIC are the poor, women, children, the elderly and indigenous peoples. JBIC is largely funding projects in Asia where most indigenous peoples are found, thus, more and more indigenous peoples are adversely affected by JBIC-funded projects. Experience has shown the dire consequences of JBIC-funded projects on the recognition of the collective rights, interest and welfare of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples are time and again made to sacrifice for \u201cdevelopment,\u201d as though their existence could be traded with modernity and progress usually associated with the expropriation, exploitation and destruction of their land and resources.

II. JBIC environmental and social guidelines JBIC established a new set of environmental and social guidelines in April 2002, entitled \u201cJBIC Guidelines for Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations (the Guidelines).\u201d The new guidelines were the result of extensive lobby work done by Japanese NGOs, in partnership with NGOs in developing countries, including organizations of indigenous peoples. Substantial recommendations pertaining to social issues and human rights, drawn from community lessons and experiences with JBIC-funded projects, were submitted to JBIC for incorporation in the new guidelines. However, these recommendations were not reflected in the new set of guidelines. Nevertheless, the new Guidelines are much better and more encompassing than the old ones. The new Guidelines put more emphasis on environment protection and procedures on environmental and social considerations for project funding and monitoring. The preface of the Guidelines states that: Japan Bank for International Cooperation (hereafter referred to as \u201cJBIC\u201d) establishes and makes public \u201cJBIC Guidelines for Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations\u201d (hereafter referred to as the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) with the objective of contributing to efforts by the international community, particularly developing regions, towards sustainable development, through consideration of the environmental and social aspects in all projects (hereafter referred to as \u201cprojects\u201d) subject to lending or other financial operations (hereafter referred to as \u201cfunding\u201d) by JBIC. Environmental and social considerations refer not only to the natural environment, but also to social issues such as involuntary resettlement and respect for human rights of indigenous peoples (hereafter collectively referred to as \u201cenvironment\u201d). The guidelines apply commonly to JBIC\u2019s International Financial Operations and Overseas Economic Cooperation Operations.1 The first part of the Guidelines2 contains basic policies, principles and procedures and disclosure of information for confirmation of environmental and social considerations. It also includes environmental reviews for decision-making and loan agreements, as well as compliance with guidelines and implementation and review of guidelines. The second part3 deals with environmental and social considerations required for funding projects, categorization of projects, information required for the screening process, and items requiring monitoring. The section on environmental and social considerations for funding contains provisions on compliance with laws, standards and plans; social acceptability and social impacts; involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples and monitoring. Because the Guidelines are new, its implementation is only for new projects for which funds were requested on or after 1 October 2003, which was when its effectively commenced.

Some of the other provisions are also relevant to indigenous peoples as enumerated below: The Guidelines: Part 2.1 Environmental and Social Considerations Required for Funded Projects (Indigenous Peoples) \u25a0 When a project may have adverse impact on indigenous peoples, all of their rights in relation to land and resources must be respected in accordance with the spirit of the relevant international declarations and treaties. Efforts must be made to obtain the consent of indigenous peoples after they have been fully informed.5 (Involuntary Resettlement) \u25a0 Involuntary resettlement and loss of means of livelihood are to be avoided where feasible, exploring all viable alternatives. When after such examination, it is proved unfeasible, effective measures to minimize impact and to compensate for losses must be agreed upon with people who will be affected; \u25a0 People who must be resettled involuntarily and people whose means of livelihood will be hindered or lost must be sufficiently compensated and supported by project proponents, etc. in a timely manner. The project proponents, etc. must make efforts to enable people affected by the project to improve their standard of living, income opportunities and production levels. Measures to achieve this may include: providing land and monetary compensation of losses (to cover land and property losses), supporting the means for alternative sustainable livelihood and providing the expenses necessary for relocation and the re-establishment of a community at relocation sites; and \u25a0 Appropriate participation by the people affected and their communities must be promoted in planning, implementation and monitoring of involuntary resettlement, loss of their means of livelihood, plans and measures against it.6 Japan Bank for International Cooperation 33 3 7 Ibid. pp. 14, 15. 8 Ibid. p. 16. 9 Ibid. p. 15. (Social Acceptability and Social Impacts) \u25a0 Projects must be adequately coordinated so that they are accepted in a manner that is socially appropriate to the country and locality in which the project is planned. For projects with potentially large environmental impacts, sufficient consultations with stakeholders, such as local residents, must be conducted vis disclosure of information from an early stage where alternative proposals for the project plan may be examined. The outcome of such consultations must be incorporated into the contents of the project; and \u25a0 Appropriate consideration must be given to vulnerable social groups, such as women, children, the elderly, the poor, and ethnic minorities, all of whom are susceptible to environmental and social impacts and who may have little access to the decision- making process within society.7 (Monitoring) \u25a0 When third parties point out, in concrete terms, that environmental and social considerations are not being fully undertaken, it is desirable that a forum for discussion and examination of countermeasures can be established based on sufficient information disclosure and include the participation of stakeholders in the relevant project. It is also desirable that an agreement be reached on procedures to be adopted with a view to resolving the problem.8 III. How do the new guidelines relate to collective rights of indigenous peoples and to social issues? While there are positive provisions of the JBIC Guidelines relating to indigenous peoples and to social considerations, these are by far very inadequate in ensuring the respect and recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and fundamental human rights pertaining to development concerns. The provision on indigenous peoples, which mentions the respect of IP rights in relation to land and resources in accordance with the spirit of relevant international declarations and treaties, does not provide the substance and mechanisms to ensure the implementation of this provision. Provision on indigenous peoples The single provision addressing the collective rights of indigenous peoples9 does not comprehensively capture the particularities of indigenous peoples as one of the groups most vulnerable to development interventions with long-term adverse impacts. It does not account for the interrelationship of land and resources to the indigenous peoples\u2019 distinct ways of life, identity and culture, and indigenous socio-political systems. Further, it does not recognize the indigenous peoples\u2019 collective views and concept on the use and Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 34 3 management of land and resources, commonly targeted for \u201cdevelopment\u201d. Thus, the provision for the respect of the rights of indigenous peoples in relation to land and resources becomes shallow as there is no further elaboration of this right. Protecting the distinct ways of life of indigenous peoples, their culture and identity as well as their collective integrity, should be part of their sustainable development, as a matter of their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ade757cc-57cd-4c5b-b50b-ce2be543bbb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ade757cc-57cd-4c5b-b50b-ce2be543bbb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "229abf69357516fb60865bbf62a32e581f4f3d3ac0bd9763171d984cd6dc01f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "18ee6fe3-e062-4e3b-9171-09b7a672f251", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cc27021c538b189e2811a94918fc0f8b58911e70c2df5c99dcb33d8dda61d50"}}, "hash": "60b5ae68ba2851fec0df45ec66ed9266f7b9bfd5c58995ae7d088a4c266f1a52", "text": "right to self- determination. The provision that \u201cefforts must be made to obtain the consent of the indigenous peoples after they have been fully informed\u201d10 is too weak, as it does not require \u201cconsent\u201d of affected indigenous peoples for projects applied for funding by JBIC. This is contrary to existing international standards on the recognition of the right to \u201cFree Prior and Informed Consent\u201d or \u201cFPIC\u201d, in relation to indigenous peoples. \u201cObserving that indigenous peoples have suffered and continue to suffer from discrimination\u201d, and, \u201cin particular that they have lost their land and resources to colonists, commercial companies and State enterprises,\u201d the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called upon states-parties to \u201censure that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent.\u201d[i] The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2001, noted \u201cwith regret that the traditional lands of indigenous peoples have been reduced or occupied, without their consent, by timber, mining and oil companies, at the expense of the exercise of their culture and the equilibrium of the ecosystem.\u201d It then recommended that the state \u201censure the participation of indigenous peoples in decisions affecting their lives. The Committee particularly urges the State party to consult and seek the consent of the indigenous peoples concerned\u2026\u201d[ii] Other international bodies that have accepted the right of indigenous peoples to FPIC include the following: \u25a0 UN Sub-Commission on Promotion and Protection of Human Rights \u25a0 UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues \u25a0 UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations \u25a0 UN Development Programme \u25a0 UN Centre for Transnational Corporations \u25a0 Convention on Biological Diversity \u25a0 Convention to Combat Desertification, particularly in Africa \u25a0 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights \u25a0 Inter-American Development Bank \u25a0 Andean Community \u25a0 European Council of Ministers 10 Ibid. p. 15.

The fear that FPIC gives \u201cveto rights\u201d to indigenous peoples overshadows the fundamental premise that the participation of indigenous peoples in the decision-making process is within the framework of their right to self- determination. Other provisions of the Guidelines on requirements for project funding, such as social acceptability and social impacts,11 resettlement12 and project monitoring,13 contain positive measures that could be useful for indigenous peoples. These are the requirements on disclosure of information, sufficient consultation and alternative proposals with less environment impacts, sufficient compensation for resettled people, and appropriate participation by affected people in the planning, implementation and monitoring of involuntary resettlement plans. However, there are major loopholes in these provisions in relation to the concrete measures and mechanisms that could ensure the exercise of the rights of affected communities, including indigenous peoples. Information disclosure On the provision for information disclosure,14 this will be mainly done through the website of JBIC15, and some documents will only be in Japanese. Therefore, there are serious problems in terms of access to information by affected communities, especially remote communities. Understanding these documents is another problem because documents for disclosure are either in Japanese and English only, and not in a language affected communities are familiar with. Likewise, JBIC upholds the confidentiality of certain information in relation to commercial and other matters. Some of this information is also important for the affected communities and the public to know, especially if it pertains to the terms of agreement which may be disadvantageous to the borrower and the public. The positive aspect of JBIC\u2019s information disclosure guideline is the right of affected communities and other stakeholders to inform JBIC of their views, concerns and position in relation to a project under application to JBIC for their consideration. However, it does not mention how this information will be considered in the decision-making process of JBIC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18ee6fe3-e062-4e3b-9171-09b7a672f251": {"__data__": {"id_": "18ee6fe3-e062-4e3b-9171-09b7a672f251", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "229abf69357516fb60865bbf62a32e581f4f3d3ac0bd9763171d984cd6dc01f5"}, "2": {"node_id": "ade757cc-57cd-4c5b-b50b-ce2be543bbb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60b5ae68ba2851fec0df45ec66ed9266f7b9bfd5c58995ae7d088a4c266f1a52"}}, "hash": "0cc27021c538b189e2811a94918fc0f8b58911e70c2df5c99dcb33d8dda61d50", "text": "Involuntary resettlement While the JBIC Guidelines provide for \u2018alternative options\u2019 to avoid involuntary resettlement if possible,16 the bank still considers funding projects which will lead to involuntary Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 36 3 17 Ibid. p. 15. 18 Ibid. p. 15. 19 Ibid. pp. 14, 15. 20 Ibid. p. 16.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d3ea2c8-bfa5-4109-a17f-22b1f5e27eeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d3ea2c8-bfa5-4109-a17f-22b1f5e27eeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f71ed5bde265be7dc920b233d07192347717da8f6d16a805209f6d514e740e3a"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ada0606-7011-4e96-a5fb-893b1136bd08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fee826a59a65d75eb5d9e7d8bd65b1167e396a48b0017f658bd010d3245eb64"}}, "hash": "c32e5d1d89a9c45970769924e48ec387ca2af3afdbafde94aa9dae0df63f1f2e", "text": "resettlement. One of the most critical, irreversible, long-lasting and adverse impacts of development projects on indigenous peoples is involuntary resettlement. Indigenous peoples\u2019 culture, identity, survival and development are very much tied up with their land and resources. Thus, the displacement of indigenous peoples from their land and resources does not only imply economic dislocation but also disruption of the socio-cultural dimension of their survival as indigenous peoples. For indigenous peoples, \u201cLand is life.\u201d Thus, involuntary resettlement, as provided in the JBIC Guidelines, is a direct violation of indigenous peoples\u2019 right to land and resources. This provision for involuntary resettlement is contradictory to the other provision of the JBIC Guidelines pertaining to the \u201crespect for the right of indigenous peoples in relation to their land and resources.\u201d 17 On the provision for compensation for the loss of land and property, to include monetary compensation, land and livelihood18, these compensation measures cannot replace the loss of indigenous peoples in terms of the socio-cultural impacts of displacement. These impacts are beyond material compensation thereby requiring more thorough social impact studies that must be taken into account in the decision-making process of JBIC. Social acceptability and impacts The JBIC guidelines on social acceptability and social impacts mention the positive requirement for sufficient consultation and information disclosure.19 However, these fall short of the right to FPIC of affected indigenous communities as already mentioned above. The right to FPIC is by far the most appropriate mechanism for social acceptability of projects by indigenous peoples. The substance and mechanism of FPIC does not only relate to information disclosure, but also provides for the right of communities to receive information in a language understood by them, and to request other related and relevant information from other sources. Likewise, the right to FPIC does not only provide for consultations, but rather, consent that is freely given, not under coercion, bribery or duress. Also under FPIC, indigenous systems of decision-making are recognized. The FPIC provision is by far the most appropriate mechanism for social acceptability of projects by indigenous peoples. Monitoring While JBIC allows the formation of a forum to include stakeholders in addressing environmental and social impacts of projects under implementation,20 it fails to provide for a clear mechanism of accountability by project proponents and funders. Experience has shown that outstanding issues in relation to environmental and social impacts of JBIC-funded projects remain unresolved. Objection Procedure While the Objection Procedure is a positive step in addressing possible violations by JBIC of its own Guidelines, there is no clear mechanism on how these violations will be addressed Japan Bank for International Cooperation 37 3 21 Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Summary of Procedures to Submit Objections Concerning JBIC Guidelines for Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations, p.4. 22 Ibid. pp. 9-14. by JBIC and what affected communities can expect in terms of compensation and redress of grievances. The only defined process in the Objection Procedure is the appointment of an independent/neutral Examiner21 who will receive the complaint, evaluate it, conduct his/her own independent investigation and submit a report and recommendation to the Governor.22 It is then up to the Governor to decide what to do with the report and recommendation. Thus, there still is no clear accountability on the part of JBIC for proven violations of its own Guidelines. IV. Brief history of indigenous engagement with or opposition to JBIC Koto Panjang Dam, Indonesia (1992\u201396) The Koto Panjang Dam on the Kampar Kanan and Mahat Rivers in West Sumatra, Indonesia, was built with loans from what is now the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). The feasibility study for the project was funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and carried out by the Tokyo Electric Power Services Co., Ltd (TEPSCO). Japanese and Indonesian companies were awarded the construction contracts for the main part of the dam. At least 4,886 households, representing between 17,000 and 23,000 people, were relocated in the early 1990s to make way for the dam. Those displaced by the dam were Minagkabau, who lived according to their traditional customs and culture. The Minagkabau are an ethnic group living mainly in West Sumatra province, in the midwestern part of the island of Sumatra. The Minagkabau consist of village communities based on customary law.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ada0606-7011-4e96-a5fb-893b1136bd08": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ada0606-7011-4e96-a5fb-893b1136bd08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f71ed5bde265be7dc920b233d07192347717da8f6d16a805209f6d514e740e3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d3ea2c8-bfa5-4109-a17f-22b1f5e27eeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c32e5d1d89a9c45970769924e48ec387ca2af3afdbafde94aa9dae0df63f1f2e"}}, "hash": "6fee826a59a65d75eb5d9e7d8bd65b1167e396a48b0017f658bd010d3245eb64", "text": "The Minagkabau consist of village communities based on customary law.

The project\u2019s feasibility study failed to take into account any of these characteristics of Minagkabau society. The evictees mounted a strong resistance to the treatment they were receiving, but the Suharto regime stationed military in the area and suppressed the opposition. Thus, with the social and cultural identity of Minagkabau society ignored, the villagers were resettled in a place that had neither ulayat nor a rumah gadang. In addition, housing provided by the government was not the traditional Minagkabau style on stilts, but rather poorly-built wooden houses situated directly on the ground. Problems arose with the newly built mosques as well, with some were facing the wrong direction and others too small for everyone to enter, so that the people had to build their own mosques. Besides these problems, existing relationships in society were ruined when people lost respect for some village leaders who had difficulty coping with resettlement and accepted bribes.

Besides these problems, existing relationships in society were ruined when people lost respect for some village leaders who had difficulty coping with resettlement and accepted bribes. The Minagkabau traditional lifestyle and culture has been destroyed and their living standards have declined considerably. The local people had demanded a halt to the dam construction and Japanese funding from the time that work started in 1992. However, their pleas were ignored and the project was completed in 1996. Nevertheless, the voices of opposition have continued to this day. In September 2002, 3,861 people from the project area filed a lawsuit in the Tokyo District Court demanding that the Japanese government, JBIC, JICA and TEPSCO take measures to restore the affected rivers, and that they pay compensation of 5 million yen (about $42,000) per person. San Roque Dam, Philippines (1998\u20132003) The San Roque Multi-purpose Project has been one of the most controversial projects funded by JBIC to date. The dam has displaced more than 4,400 people, and threatens the livelihood of thousands of indigenous Ibaloi people living upstream of the dam. The Agno River is known as the cultural heartland of the Ibaloi people. The fertile lands along the river and the gold ore found in the mountains have sustained several distinct Ibaloi communities engaged in agriculture, fishing and small-scale gold panning for generations. For the Ibaloi, land and water are resources to be used and shared with their kin, ancestors and gods. These very resources are under threat because of the San Roque Dam project. The Cordillera People\u2019s Alliance estimates that approximately 20,000 residents of Itogon, Benguet, will be affected by sediment that will accumulate behind the reservoir over the course of the dam\u2019s life. This sediment will eventually submerge the homes, rice terraces, orchards, pasture lands, gardens and burial grounds of the Ibaloi living close to the Agno River. This is not the first time the Ibaloi have experienced the negative impacts of hydroelectric dams. The Ambuklao and Binga dams were constructed upstream along the Agno River in the 1950s. During that time, the Ibaloi were called upon to sacrifice their lands and their lives for the sake of \u201cnational development\u201d. Though both dams were for electric power, nearby communities have seen few benefits and most still have no electricity. Many of those relocated were never compensated for the loss of their homes, lands and livelihoods, and more than 70 Ibaloi families lost their land and houses to sedimentation that has backed up behind the Ambuklao Dam. At present, Ambuklao Dam is non-functional as a result of the serious sedimentation problem. Binga Dam is also heavily silted and its partial operation is maintained by the water coming from Ambuklao Dam. Because of this experience, the Ibaloi have been opposed to the San Roque Dam project even before its inception in 1998. The Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act (IPRA) of the Philippines requires the free and prior informed consent of indigenous peoples for projects that impact their ancestral lands. When the affected Ibaloi communities learned of the San Roque Dam project, they immediately raised their concerns about the adverse impacts of this project.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cade50f1-b7b7-4bcb-a583-41e09f655659": {"__data__": {"id_": "cade50f1-b7b7-4bcb-a583-41e09f655659", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cce9192ab16e6c539418780d7ad89592ccb19b69b6dcdb860e524b775ef341c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e03d73a-e1f7-4819-91ab-2ddcfa02127d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a05e486a6c9f955973d19f304833190c58bad165b8dc8169707503c6edee513"}}, "hash": "167e66e0d8b9d7a9fbbdfecdc2efe3243cc7edeff3b3d988222ba70563b65291", "text": "A report released in 2001 by the Office of the Presidential Assistant on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Affairs validated claims that project proponents did not obtain the free and prior informed consent of affected Japan Bank for International Cooperation 39 3 indigenous communities and that consultations were conducted only after the project was already underway.

At present, there remain serious outstanding economic and social issues, which need to be addressed by project proponents and JBIC. These include the worsening siltation build-up in the upstream of the dam project, affecting the indigenous peoples in the area. Kelau Dam, Malaysia (2005\u2013) The Kelau Dam was proposed to meet the water demands of Selangor State and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The project plans to transfer around 1.5 billion litres of water per day from the Kelau River in Pahang State to the Langat River in Selangor State. JBIC approved the 82.04 billion yen loan to the Malaysian government for the Kelau dam on 31 March 2005. The dam will have serious impacts on the Kelau River ecosystem and will require the resettlement of 325 Orang Asli (indigenous people) and 120 Malay farmers, thereby seriously affecting their lives and livelihoods. Yet there is no clear need for the water: studies by Malaysian NGOs show that the current water supply system in Selangor State is wasteful and beset with inefficiencies. Investment in water conservation measures and reduction in system losses could result in water savings that would make the construction of the Kelau Dam unnecessary. Although the project proponents claim that the people are agreeable to the project, the Centre for Orang Asli Concerns (COAC) found that the affected Temuan families did not give their free, prior and informed consent to the relocation. According to the village chief, It\u2019s true I say I support (the project). Because we Orang Asli have been weakened. Others weaken us. They say resettle, we have to resettle. \u2026Officers come in and say, \u201cTok Batin, resettle\u201d and we are forced to resettle. They pressure us until we cannot think anymore. If we have a choice, we want to stay where we are. The land is our ancestors\u2019 land. We have been there for a long time. But what can we do? The Government wants to give water to Selangor.23 Furthermore, the Government of Malaysia has reported to the JBIC that the Orang Asli houses of Sungai Temir will not be inundated and the people can choose either to stay or to move from the current village to a new settlement in Sungai Bilut. This decision, however, has not been conveyed to the Temuan families at all.24 Sakhalin II Oil Development Project, Russia The Sakhalin II Project in Russia is developing oil and natural gas reserves that will be exported to Japan, Korea and other countries.

The Sakhalin II Project started to cause many problems for indigenous peoples (including damage to fish resources) in 1998 when the Molikpaq platform was installed. In spite of this, the proponent, Sakhalin Energy, and its shareholders (Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mitsui and Mitsubishi) did not pay an appropriate compensation directly to indigenous peoples\u2019 communities. Another concern is that the project will cause the reduction of fish stocks through the construction of a pipeline trench across the salmon spawning rivers. Reindeer pastures and the number of forest animals will also be cut down by the building of onshore pipelines that will pollute the environment. The harm done to the animal and plant world in traditional land-use areas takes a direct toll on the vital activities of indigenous peoples.

JBIC established the \u201cEnvironmental Forum on Sakhalin II\u201d in order to ensure transparency and equity in its review process. Japanese fisher folk, experts and NGOs are concerned about the significant impacts of the project on Japan itself. Sessions of the environmental forum took place nine times from October 2004 till May 2005 in Tokyo and Sapporo. This forum for the specific programme was epoch-making under the new JBIC Guidelines. It is still a question, however, how the forum will address the problems caused by the project. JBIC has failed to propose any concrete measures to address the issues raised by the participants in the forum. In addition, the agenda of the forum was limited to issues related to the impacts in Japan, while issues related to the Sakhalin indigenous peoples were excluded from the agenda. V. Experiences and lessons learned using the JBIC Guidelines Failure to properly assess social and environmental impacts prior to approval JBIC\u2019s project appraisal process is seriously deficient and needs radical improvement. JBIC failed to adequately assess the projects\u2019 social and environmental impacts prior to project approvals. Instead, JBIC relied on information provided by the governments and/or the project developers. Such failure has resulted in impacts far beyond what was originally predicted, destroying the lives and livelihoods of many thousands of people. In particular, the assessment of social impacts on affected indigenous communities was minimal, if not under-estimated, such that it was not able to capture and bridge a better appreciation of Japan Bank for International Cooperation 41 3 the particularities of indigenous communities. Likewise, there is a tendency to measure social and cultural impacts in economic and material terms, while these concerns are more intergenerational. Indigenous communities commonly argue that these impacts cannot be mitigated by money or projects. Failure to ensure proper consultation and release of information JBIC and the project developers failed to release adequate information to affected communities and the public. In many cases, JBIC simply refused to release critical documents such as environmental impact assessments and resettlement plans, citing lack of government approval. While JBIC\u2019s new Environmental Guidelines mandate a higher standard of information disclosure than previously, JBIC is still refusing to release important documents for projects already funded or in the pipeline. Furthermore, steps have not been taken to ensure access to information by affected communities. Additionally, JBIC has failed to involve affected communities in meaningful decision- making, with respect for the right of indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent. This has resulted in projects being implemented without the involvement or participation of affected communities. Too often, indigenous communities are offered funds and projects, instead of having a substantial and meaningful dialogue with the necessary and important information provided to affected communities. Likewise, functional structures of traditional leadership are not acknowledged or recognized. There have even been attempts to bribe local leaders to support and endorse the project. Inadequate monitoring and evaluation during and after project construction JBIC\u2019s monitoring and evaluation procedures are clearly inadequate. The modus operandi for JBIC in the past has been to disburse funds and then leave the project to the governments to implement. As a result, communities are left to suffer impacts, without any recourse or access to the project funders. In many cases, promises of compensation are not honoured by the government or implementing agency. Yet, JBIC refused to discuss these issues with the affected communities and directed the people to talk to the government instead. Since many of these projects would not have been pushed through without JBIC funding, JBIC has a responsibility to ensure that the projects are implemented in accordance with JBIC guidelines and international human rights standards. In some cases, such as the San Roque Dam Project, JBIC did undertake regular monitoring missions as a result of pressure from affected communities and International NGOs. However, there was minimal follow-up to these missions and no means of ensuring that the JBIC recommendations were adhered to by project developers and the government. No mechanism to deal with outstanding problems Many projects have resulted in communities being worse off than they were before. Yet JBIC has no mechanism for dealing with the serious environmental and social problems created by its projects.

As demonstrated by the experiences of indigenous communities with JBIC-funded projects, and based on an analysis of the present guidelines and its use, there is an urgent need to engage with JBIC on policy reforms to include the following: 1. For JBIC to formulate a specific guideline for Indigenous Peoples such as that of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. This Policy formulation must take into account existing international laws and instruments pertaining to indigenous peoples such as the ILO 169, the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent or \u201cFPIC\u201d, among others. It should also take into account the \u201cRights-Based Approach to Development\u201d as its over-all framework. Likewise, the policy formulation of JBIC on Indigenous Peoples must ensure the direct involvement of indigenous peoples and their active participation in the process in order to ensure that their views, concerns and issues are taken into account and integrated in the finalization of the Policy. 2. In the absence of a separate Policy on Indigenous Peoples, the present JBIC Guidelines must ensure the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples in relation to their land and resources. Likewise, the existing internationally-accepted right to FPIC must be operationalized in \u201caccordance with the spirit of the relevant international declarations and treaties\u201d. 3. Environmental and social impact studies should fully account for the specificities of indigenous peoples, to include socio-cultural impacts, intergenerational livelihood activities and views of affected indigenous peoples on compensation or non- compensation of losses which are beyond material measurement. These studies must ensure a process of transparency and validation by affected communities, prior to consideration by JBIC for project funding. 4. To recommend accountability measures on the part of JBIC to address violations on its own Guidelines through the Objection Procedure. This shall include measures on just compensation of affected communities, mitigation and rehabilitation of damaged environments and sources of people\u2019s livelihood. 25 Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia Fergus MacKay 4 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 44 4 I. Introduction The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (\u201cthe World Bank\u201d or \u201cthe Bank\u201d) was established as an intergovernmental organization in 1944 with the primary mandate of financing reconstruction and facilitating economic development post World War II. This mandate has been reinterpreted a number of times over the years culminating with a professed focus on poverty alleviation today.1 While not true for all of its activities, poverty alleviation has largely been equated with economic growth and heavily influenced by neo-liberal economic principles. This is particularly the case for the Bank\u2019s structural adjustment programmes and other non-project based interventions, such as technical assistance loans aimed at revising legislation and government policy. As of May 2001, 184 countries were members of the Bank. By virtue of the Bank\u2019s Articles of Agreement, an international treaty that acts as the constitution of the organization, and as a precondition to membership in the Bank, these countries must also be members of the International Monetary Fund. The Articles of Agreement vests ultimate decision-making power in a Board of Governors and a Board of Executive Directors, including the authority to interpret the scope and meaning of the Articles.2 There are presently 24 Executive Directors, five of which are appointed by the United States, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, being the countries holding the largest capital shares in the Bank, while the remainder are elected by the Governors representing the other 179 member states. Voting rights in the Bank are weighted according to the amount of capital shares held by each country. The United States by itself, as the largest donor, initially held over 37 percent of the voting power and today holds 16.50 percent. A number of other institutions have been created and today form what is known as the World Bank Group (\u201cthe WBG\u201d). These include the International Finance Corporation (\u201cthe IFC\u201d), which was established in 1956 to provide financing for private sector entities working in developing countries rather than governments;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "813007d2-5888-4f9a-9fc7-ffa5ec44fb84": {"__data__": {"id_": "813007d2-5888-4f9a-9fc7-ffa5ec44fb84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91b6984af79dd1c8c1917c5209ab6659636e6c5140b4abe251e07883e313e5c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "cf62f554-e74c-4e98-9352-cb51ec7d1b88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5933f6efcf02684107897f782a3ae2b1c99b13c009d0c3efd27690f3477b75e5"}}, "hash": "ff9f254b53f015974f90eae559cfa384e099587ca88bae03421937dcc7295149", "text": "the International Development Association, established in 1960 to provide grants to some governments rather than loans; and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (\u201cMIGA\u201d), which provides investment guarantees including political risk insurance to private sector bodies working in developing countries.

World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 45 4 The WBG is one of the largest financers of development projects and activities in the world. In 1999-2000, for instance, the Bank\u2019s cumulative lending alone was US$162,789 million. The WBG also styles itself as, and is perceived by some to be, the world\u2019s pre-eminent development institution. Therefore, in addition to the amount of funds lent or granted, it also wields substantial influence over other actors in terms of policies and ideas. This applies to both governments and private sector entities alike. With regard to governments, for instance, the Bank has supported the revision of mining and petroleum related laws and institutions in over 100 countries in the period 1990-2003.3 These revisions almost always focus in liberalizing the sector and creating incentives for foreign investment, while at the same time often reducing the regulatory powers of the state. In the private sector, more than 29 of the world\u2019s largest commercial banks have adopted the IFC\u2019s policies on environmental and social issues and apply these to the projects they finance. Industry groups or specific companies also often reference and apply WBG standards to their activities and projects. Given the global reach of its activities and its influence on other actors, it is not surprising that the WBG often affects indigenous peoples, both directly and indirectly. In some cases, indigenous peoples are affected by a specific project financed by the WBG, in others they are affected by programmatic lending, such as structural adjustment or technical assistance loans. Most attention has focused on project lending as it affects indigenous peoples while the impact of programmatic lending has not been sufficiently critiqued. This is a serious omission given that until recently World Bank programmatic lending comprised around one half of the total amount of financing provided by the Bank and has a much greater impact that specific projects. This paper focuses on the impact of WBG activities on indigenous peoples with a particular focus on the policies adopted by the WBG to mitigate adverse impacts on indigenous peoples. Section II addresses the World Bank and its policies that deal directly with or affect indigenous peoples. Section III focuses on the IFC\u2019s draft policy on indigenous peoples. Section IV provides a brief overview of the nature and extent of indigenous peoples\u2019 engagement with the WBG. Finally, Section V identifies and discusses a number of issues concerning future strategic engagement.

Although OMS 2.34 was adopted in response to \u201cinternal and external condemnation of the disastrous experiences of indigenous groups in Bank-financed projects in the Amazon region,\u201d6 it failed to incorporate many of the protections proposed in the 1981 study. Moreover, an internal implementation review conducted in 1986-87 found that only two out of 33 Bank projects substantially complied with the policy.7 Implementation failures and sustained criticism of Bank projects by indigenous peoples, NGOs and others,8 led the Bank to revise and update OMS 2.34, concluding in 1991 with the adoption of Operational Directive 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples (\u201cOD 4.20\u201d).9 OD 4.20 strengthened Bank policy on indigenous peoples by requiring indigenous peoples\u2019 informed participation; accounting for indigenous preferences in project design; strengthening domestic legislation on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights; paying special attention to securing indigenous land and resource rights; and developing specialized Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Development Plans to provide for culturally appropriate benefits and mitigation plans in all projects affecting indigenous peoples.10 While OD 4.20 was an improvement over its predecessor, it did not assuage critics of Bank projects, especially since compliance with the policy was inconsistent at best.11 OD 4.20 was the subject of a protracted and contentious revision process and was replaced in May 2005 by Operational Policy 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples (\u201cOP 4.10\u201d or \u201cthe OP\u201d).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a44a99ea-3fbe-4138-bc70-6eb55473c88d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a44a99ea-3fbe-4138-bc70-6eb55473c88d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33cc195867832dd7bcc800543a5eed905e959e5e9bb09f515835b085ca93a816"}, "2": {"node_id": "2537cda0-3a34-4d5f-ae45-8a004b8fbacc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec382b17faba0b259f7e54441a6d05d621d019ab0274a985929903a413f53a06"}}, "hash": "09e0d9a4d88a478e8a89583d24ca11185901f245abc457535d02961035f9057b", "text": "This new policy, which now only applies to the public sector arm of the WBG, is technically a World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 47 4 12 The International Finance Corporation is presently adopting its own safeguard policies.

The IFC will continue to use OD 4.20 until it adopts its new standards in early 2006. Indigenous peoples have consistently demanded that WBG safeguard policies must, at a minimum, provide for their right to free, prior and informed consent, recognition and protection of territorial rights, self-identification (as the fundamental criterion in determining the peoples covered by the policy), a prohibition of involuntary resettlement, and respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 right to self-determination.17 They explain that in many cases they continue to experience severe negative impacts and human rights abuses in relation to WBG projects and therefore a strong and effective safeguard policy that is grounded in and consistent with international human rights law is needed. Negative impacts and abuses have also been identified in internal WBG performance evaluations,18 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 48 4 19 See for instance, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Mr. Rodolfo Stavenhagen, submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 2001/57.

A 2003 WBG review of OD 4.20, for instance, found that it was only applied, fully or partially, in 50 percent of projects affecting indigenous peoples and of those only 14 percent had the required Indigenous Peoples Development Plan.22 Another WBG evaluation found that Project results for [indigenous peoples] were not as satisfactory in the energy and mining, transportation, and environment sectors, which comprised 65 percent of Bank commitments evaluated for this second phase, and include projects with significant potential to harm IP. The majority of these projects neither mitigated adverse effects on IPs nor ensured that they received an equitable share of benefits;23 The evaluation also found that only 38 percent of a sample of WBG projects which did apply the policy satisfactorily mitigated adverse impacts and ensured benefits for indigenous peoples.24 World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 49 4 25 See The World Bank, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Articles of Agreement, (setting forth the purposes of the Bank), art.

Operational Policy 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples of 10 May 2005 With this background in mind, this section summarizes and comments on selected provisions of OP 4.10 of 10 May 2005. The OP will likely be the standard applied by the public sector arm of the WBG for the next decade or more. Special attention is devoted to the use and meaning of the language \u2018free, prior and informed consultation resulting in broad community support\u2019 because in many respects the efficacy of the protections set forth in the OP may turn on its interpretation and use in practice. 1. The \u2018Preambular\u2019 Paragraphs Paragraph 1 provides that OP 4.10 \u201ccontributes to the Bank\u2019s mission of poverty reduction and sustainable development by ensuring that the development process fully respects the dignity, human rights, economies and cultures of indigenous peoples.\u201d This statement can Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 50 4 be read two ways: as a conclusion \u2013 i.e., the OP as it presently stands does now ensure that the development process fully respects indigenous peoples\u2019 dignity, human rights, etc., or; as a forward looking statement requiring that interpretation and implementation of the OP should be consistent with indigenous peoples\u2019 dignity, human rights, etc. If it is the former, this is a dubious assertion as the OP itself clearly does not fully respect indigenous peoples\u2019 human rights, economies, and cultures. If it is the latter, the OP should be interpreted and applied so as to fully respect indigenous peoples\u2019 cultures, human rights, dignity and economies. This language is significantly different that OD 4.20, which states that fostering full respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 dignity, human rights, etc., is a broad objective of the OD itself. Paragraph 1 also states that for all projects proposed for Bank financing that affect indigenous peoples, the borrower must engage in free, prior and informed consultation (\u201cFPICon\u201d) with indigenous peoples.30 It continues that the Bank \u201cwill provide project financing only where [FPICon] results in broad community support to the project by the affected Indigenous Peoples.\u201d The definition and application of FPICon and \u2018broad community support\u2019 are key issues requiring clarification in the OP and may in large part determine whether the OP can be an effective safeguard for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and interests. FPICon and broad community support are addressed in detail below. Paragraph 1 further provides that Bank-financed projects will include measures to avoid potential adverse effects or where avoidance is \u201cnot feasible\u201d to \u201cminimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects.\u201d In relation to this, in the past the Bank has often determined feasibility in solely economic terms, i.e., avoidance is not possible because it makes the project infeasible by raising costs. Finally, paragraph 1 provides that Bank projects will be designed to \u201censure that Indigenous Peoples receive social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate and gender and inter-generationally inclusive.\u201d For many indigenous peoples, the term \u2018inter-generational\u2019 includes ancestors and future generations: if the Bank is to fully respect indigenous peoples\u2019 cultures, such relationships must also be respected. Most likely, however, the OP is referring to generations in the sense of youth, adults and elders. Paragraph 2 explains that the Bank recognizes that indigenous peoples\u2019 cultures and identities are \u201cinextricably\u201d related to traditional lands and resources and, therefore, \u201cdifferent risks and impacts can be expected in development projects.\u201d It also acknowledges that indigenous peoples often have limited ability to assert and defend their rights and interests at the domestic level and to participate in and benefit from development. Finally, consistent with the Final Declaration of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, it affirms that indigenous peoples \u201cplay a vital role in sustainable development,\u201d and that their rights are receiving increased attention and recognition in domestic and international law.31 30 Footnote 3 explains that the OP applies to all project components affecting indigenous peoples \u201cregardless of the source of financing,\u201d presumably meaning that the OP applies when the Bank is a co-financer as well as the sole donor and irrespective of the particular source of financing within the Bank. 31 Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August-4 September 2002.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49ff691d-02c5-4f2c-9c53-b0f652783154": {"__data__": {"id_": "49ff691d-02c5-4f2c-9c53-b0f652783154", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "366429f1d61af230e58c1ddc3051676e4e492f30e4819fcc0a4f9cc5fd16cd9a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d35224ba-ff5c-43e2-b63e-3d8f9b8038ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c92b217ea11bd1a863d897cc32dc7f8980e679ccc61f15d33ef5f8878df89d5c"}}, "hash": "05371eea83a24916291a824a0ebb3c4f5cba7857a1dfe6ed6c33963612dfb5a3", "text": "UN Doc.

Self-identification/definition of indigenous peoples (Paras. 3 and 4) The OP does not employ a specific definition of the term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d as does OD 4.20. Instead, it states that there is \u201cno universally accepted definition\u201d and therefore, it will \u201cnot define the term.\u201d32 Paragraph 4, however, states that for the purposes of the OP, the term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d refers to \u201ca distinct, vulnerable, social and cultural group\u201d possessing a number of characteristics in varying degrees. These characteristics include: self-identification as indigenous and recognition by others; \u201ccollective attachment\u201d to distinct habitats or territories and the natural resources therein; the presence of \u201ccustomary cultural, social, economic or political institutions\u201d separate from those of the dominant society; and, an indigenous language, often different from the national language. Paragraph 4 further provides that indigenous peoples who have \u201clost collective\u201d attachment because of \u201cforced severance\u201d remain eligible for application of the policy. Footnote 7 defines collective attachment to mean \u201cthat for generations there has been a physical presence in and economic ties to lands and territories traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied by the group concerned, including areas which hold special significance for it, such as sacred sites. \u2018Collective attachment\u2019 also refers to the attachment of transhumant/nomadic groups to the territory they use on a seasonal or cyclical basis.\u201d Forced severance is defined as \u2026loss of collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories occurring within the concerned group members\u2019 lifetime because of conflict, government resettlement programs, dispossession from their lands, natural calamities or incorporation of such territories into an urban area. \u2026\u201curban area\u201d normally means a city or large town, and takes into account all of the following characteristics, no single one of which is definitive: (a) the legal definition of the area as urban under domestic law; (b) a high population density; and (c) a high proportion of non-agricultural economic activities relative to agricultural activities. This definition of forced severance is highly problematic for a number of reasons. First, loss of collective attachment \u201cwithin the concerned group members\u2019 lifetime\u201d probably refers to a period of 50-80 years, and therefore would exclude loss of lands and resources predating this period, lands and resources with which indigenous peoples most likely continue to maintain a variety of relationships. Second, the definition of urban areas would exclude non-legally designated areas, smaller population centres or population centres with a high proportion of agricultural activities. Colono or migrant communities established on indigenous lands in the Amazon, for instance, would not qualify as urban areas under the policy and, assuming that such colonization did not occur outside of the lifetime of the members, unless this could be characterized as \u201cdispossession from their lands,\u201d would not qualify as a forced severance. Finally, paragraph 4 provides that determinations of whether indigenous peoples are affected by a Bank project, thereby triggering the application of the OP, \u201cmay require a technical judgment (see paragraph 8).\u201d Paragraph 8 contains the screening procedures through which the Bank determines the presence of indigenous peoples in a project area. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 52 4 In making this determination, the Bank will seek the opinions of \u201cqualified social scientists with expertise on the social and cultural groups in the project area.\u201d The Bank will also consult with indigenous peoples and the borrower government on this issue and the Bank may choose to \u201cfollow the borrower\u2019s framework for identification of indigenous peoples during project screening when that framework is consistent with [the OP].\u201d In other words, the Bank may choose to follow national law and policy related to the identification of indigenous peoples if it decides that that law and policy is consistent with the requirements of the OP. Self-identification is clearly not the primary or only criteria that the Bank will assess to determine the presence of indigenous peoples for the purposes of applying the policy and the potential use of national law definitions could be very problematic. 3.

Aspects thus identified must be strengthened by the borrower prior to the Bank\u2019s agreement to rely upon the system to achieve the objectives of this policy. This approach will essentially permit a borrower, provided the Bank approves, to apply its national legislation in Bank-financed projects instead of the Bank\u2019s operational policies. Note particularly that, in order to be approved by the Bank, the borrower\u2019s legislation need only comply with the objectives of the OP rather than the substantive requirements; this may allow much weaker standards to be applied to a project. Concern about this approach is sharpened given the nature of preliminary Bank papers on using country systems.34 A draft operational policy called Piloting the Use of Borrower Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies, Procedures, and Practices in Bank-Supported Projects, for example, states that The Bank considers a country\u2019s relevant safeguard systems to be equivalent to its own safeguards policy framework if they are designed to achieve the objectives and adhere to the operational principles set out in Table A1 [see explanation below]. In determining equivalence, the Bank may take account of agreed improvements in the borrower\u2019s systems that take place under the project concerned, including Bank-supported efforts to strengthen relevant institutional and human capacity, and incentives and methods for implementation. In addition, the Bank assesses whether country implementation practices, track record, and capacity going forward are acceptable.35 33 The Inspection Panel is only authorized to review Bank compliance with its operational policies and is not permitted to assess national law standards.

Screen early for potential impacts on indigenous peoples, who are identified through criteria that reflect their social and cultural distinctiveness (including indigenous language, self-identification and identification by others, presence of customary institutions, or collective attachment to land). 2. Undertake meaningful consultation with affected indigenous peoples to solicit informed participation in designing and implementing measures to (a) avoid adverse impacts, or (b) when avoidance is not feasible, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects. 3.

The WBG rejected recognition of and respect for FPIC in relation to the recommendations of the WCD and the EIR and has failed to incorporate it into OP 4.10 and the IFC\u2019s draft Performance Standards.44 Instead, the WBG Board of Executive Directors approved, in its decision on the EIR made in August/September 2004, that the standard to be adopted and applied will be \u2018FPICon resulting in broad community support\u2019.45 Of the 24 Executive Directors, only a few supported full recognition of and respect for FPIC. The Executive Director for Thailand/Indonesia, for instance, stated that \u201cwe do emphasise the community directly affected here as the principal stakeholder that should be recognized as the body for application of the notion of free, prior, informed consent (FPIC).\u201d 46 The German and Swiss Executive Directors made similar statements,47 while the Dutch Executive Director observed that we note a degree of ambiguity with regard to the internationally recognized rights of indigenous peoples. \u2026It would be a major step forward if the Bank would address these aspects in a still more forthcoming and creative manner; much of what now still seems a controversy would become a new way of reconciling local tradition and the kind of globalisation that instils universally accepted principles of justice and participation in the operations of global players, be they industries, Banks or international organisations. It would therefore be a better understood signal if the approach of \u201cprior informed consultation\u201d would be replaced by the recognition of a necessary process of \u201cconsensus building\u201d in line with the \u201cbroad support\u201d by affected communities, including indigenous peoples that is already accepted as a prerequisite.48 b. What does the OP say? As noted above, paragraph 1 of OP 4.10 provides that for all projects proposed for Bank-financing that affect indigenous peoples the borrower must engage in FPICon with indigenous peoples. FPICon is defined in footnote 4 as: \u201cFree, prior and informed consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities\u201d refers to a culturally-appropriate and collective decision-making process subsequent to meaningful and good faith consultation and informed participation regarding the preparation and implementation of the project. It does not constitute a veto right for individuals or groups (see paragraph 10). Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 56 4 According to this definition, the following elements may be identified: meaningful and good faith consultation; informed participation; followed by a culturally appropriate and collective decision making process. Based on this definition, it appears that FPICon refers to a process comprised of the preceding elements rather than just consultation as such (see, however, the discussion on paragraph 10 below). Paragraph 1 continues that the Bank \u201cwill provide project financing only where [FPICon] results in broad community support to the project by the affected Indigenous Peoples.\u201d Conversely, if there is no \u2018broad community support\u2019 for the project, the Bank presumably will not continue to process or finance the project. This is ostensibly confirmed in paragraph 11, which states in part that: The Bank subsequently satisfies itself through a review of the process and outcome of the consultation carried out by the borrower that the affected indigenous peoples\u2019 communities have provided their broad support to the project. The Bank pays particular attention to the social assessment and to the record and outcome of the free, prior and informed consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities as a basis for ascertaining whether there is such support. The Bank will not proceed further with project processing if it is unable to ascertain that such support exists. Note that the Bank \u201cpays particular attention\u201d to the social assessment in addition to the outcome of the FPICon process and therefore, indigenous peoples\u2019 support is not necessarily the decisive factor in whether the Bank may fund a project. In principle, this same language also does not preclude the Bank from assessing sources of information not mentioned above as a basis for ascertaining broad community support.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cfabf35-3bf5-4859-a391-d4847d04ee78": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cfabf35-3bf5-4859-a391-d4847d04ee78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab5e2fde85280a4cac1f75ad1ce44dd0822430aac121d7d76b49de22d7dfb8e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "70ccb8d3-847a-43db-99a6-4785fdf9d1be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a7fa6c1f6304abd95338eaacce8f3922c9166848276b69469fd03f3c3881211"}}, "hash": "67adae78f3f344d216edc3c0fae518195ad5b5a024e40be198aa515dd0a4a4a5", "text": "That FPICon resulting in broad community support is required in Bank projects is further confirmed in paragraph 6(c), which states that all proposed Bank projects that affect indigenous peoples require \u201ca process of [FPICon] with the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Communities at each stage of the project, and particularly during project preparation in order to fully identify their views and to ascertain their broad community support to the project (see paragraphs 10 and 11).\u201d This section adds an important requirement: that FPICon and broad community support are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33ad59c7-1fcd-4f8a-a1f1-439780fd1f62": {"__data__": {"id_": "33ad59c7-1fcd-4f8a-a1f1-439780fd1f62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8cfd4c8346a9a72a94820be0485c4dee214a629eeec476de22b48e1448b0291"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3d9e5a4-c53f-4af5-b983-bfa84c5d5a25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8740662525856e72a2de48fd34dfd8d8d9dd9fe181d6a3ef6591faa055f1b29f"}}, "hash": "a5ad6aaffa3d3b5fba8ac0e9eb51192417ffca7331692fee7dd2f9fce72dc541", "text": "required at each stage of the project. However, in this respect, it is unclear in the OP if broad community support is required for the development of the Indigenous Peoples Plan, clearly a stage of the project, \u2013 \u201cin consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Communities\u2026\u201d (para. 12 and Annex B) \u2013 and it does not appear to be required in relation to the Indigenous Planning Framework required in paragraph 13. This seems to be confirmed in paragraph 15 on disclosure (see below). While FPICon is defined in a footnote in paragraph 1 (subject to paragraph 10), there is no definition of broad community support other than by reference to paragraph 11. What do these paragraphs say and do they help further explain these concepts? Paragraph 10 provides that where the project affects indigenous peoples \u2013 determined on the basis of Bank screening processes, in which indigenous peoples will be consulted, and the social assessment \u2013 the borrower shall engage in FPICon with them. \u201cTo ensure such consultation, the borrower: World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 57 4 (a) establishes an appropriate gender and inter-generationally inclusive framework that provides opportunities for consultation at each stage of project preparation and implementation among the borrower, the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities, the Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPOs), if any, and other civil Society Organizations (CSOs) identified by the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities; (b) use consultation methods[ ] appropriate to the social and cultural values of the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities and their local conditions and, in designing these methods, gives special attention to the concerns of Indigenous women, youth and children and their access to development opportunities and benefits; and (c) provides the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities with all relevant information about the project (including an assessment of the potential adverse affects of the project on the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities) in a culturally appropriate manner at each stage of project preparation and implementation.\u201d The footnote associated with the term \u2018consultation methods\u2019 in sub-paragraph (b) states that \u201cSuch consultation methods (including using indigenous languages, allowing time for consensus building, and selecting appropriate venues) facilitate the articulation by Indigenous Peoples of their views and preferences. The \u2018Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Guidebook (forthcoming) will provide good practice guidance on this and other matters.\u201d49 What is conspicuously absent from paragraph 10, however, is the informed participation component found in the footnoted definition of FPICon in paragraph 1. This omission is even more glaring given that ensuring informed participation is required in OD 4.20 and the Bank has repeatedly stated that OP 4.10 must, at a minimum, be consistent with OD 4.20. Informed participation is a substantially higher standard than consultation and requires active involvement in decision-making. Without explicit mention in paragraph 10 there is a real possibility that Bank staff and the borrower will mechanically follow the requirements set forth in paragraph 10, which require nothing more than consultation using methods designed by the borrower. Paragraph 11, partly quoted above, provides that In deciding whether to proceed with the project, the borrower ascertains, based on the social assessment (see paragraph 9) and the free, prior and informed consultation (see paragraph 10) whether the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities provide their broad support to the project. Where there is such support, the borrower prepares a detailed report that documents: (a) the findings of the social assessment; (b) the process of free, prior and informed consultation with the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities; 49 According to the World Bank website: \u201cA guidebook for Bank staff in implementing the Bank\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy is under preparation. Sections will be dedicated to special issues arising in each of the Bank\u2019s operational regions as well as the major sectors where projects affecting Indigenous Peoples can also be found.

There are a number of important questions and issues raised by this paragraph. i) There is no adequate definition of or attempt to explain what is meant by broad community support (i.e., does it mean a simple majority? three-quarters of the population? does it include decisions made in accordance with indigenous peoples\u2019 customary laws and through traditional or other representative institutions, etc.). The only indication of how to interpret the term is found in Bank Procedures 4.10, a policy to Bank staff adopted a month after OP 4.10, which states that Bank staff shall \u201cverify that the borrower has gained the broad support from representatives of major sections of the community required under the policy;\u201d50 ii) At this stage of project processing it is only the borrower and the Bank that ascertain whether broad community support exists \u2013 there is no explicit mechanism for indigenous peoples to state their views about the existence or non-existence of broad community support or the veracity of the borrower\u2019s report and there is no provision for independent verification of its existence or non-existence. This could and should be addressed by requiring formal agreements with indigenous peoples, as proposed in sub-paragraph (e), and by requiring that these agreements codify the terms and conditions of broad community support as well as the nature of subsequent FPICon processes. Ideally, these agreements should be reflected in loan covenants that provide indigenous peoples\u2019 standing to challenge future project implement should conditions be disregarded; iii) In connection with point (ii) above, paragraph 15 provides for disclosure of the social assessment and draft Indigenous Peoples Plan/Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework to affected indigenous peoples\u2019 communities \u201cin an appropriate form, manner and language.\u201d These are then approved by the Bank as the basis for project appraisal (the last phase of project processing prior to submission to the Board for approval) and subsequently released to the public and again to the affected indigenous peoples\u2019 communities. While indigenous peoples can raise issues of concern regarding the social assessment and draft IPP/IPPF with both the borrower and the Bank informally, there is no explicit mechanism to do so in the policy and it does not appear from this paragraph that broad community support World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 59 4 is required for the IPP/IPPF. The IPP/IPPF will in large part determine how the project will be implemented in relation to indigenous peoples and is therefore a critical component of the decision making process on whether to support the project; iv) The elements of the social assessment, which are set forth in Annex A to OP 4.10, only indirectly concern assessing broad community support and then only implicitly as part of FPICon processes about avoiding or mitigating adverse impacts and benefits (see, paras. 2(d) and (e)). Therefore, it may be difficult to ascertain on the basis of a social assessment if broad community support exists. Further, while social impact assessments may be used as supplementary materials, the decisive voice in determining whether support exists must be indigenous peoples alone not the views of Bank or the borrower\u2019s consultants that conduct social impact assessments; v) The borrower alone, subject to review by the Bank and the recommendations of a social assessment consultant, makes recommendations with regard to future FPICon and participation in the various project phases \u2013 it is unclear whether indigenous peoples will have a role in formulating these recommendations via the initial FPICon leading to broad community support or otherwise, and there is no guarantee that the borrower will not ignore or reformulate indigenous peoples\u2019 proposals in its report to the Bank. There is also no requirement that the borrower\u2019s report be disclosed to indigenous peoples; vi) It is unclear what happens when broad community support has been obtained initially and the project has been approved and funds disbursed, but indigenous peoples withhold such support in later stages of the project (see, para. 6(c) requiring [FPICon] at each stage of the project to ascertain their broad community support); vii) There is no built-in grievance/complaints/mediation mechanism for addressing disputes about the existence of broad community support in the initial project discussions. Provision is made in Annex B, paragraph 2(h), pertaining to the Indigenous Peoples Plan, \u201cas needed,\u201d for \u201cAccessible procedures appropriate to the project to address grievances by the affected Indigenous Peoples\u2019 communities arising from project implementation. When designing the grievance procedures, the borrower takes into account the availability of judicial recourse and customary dispute settlement mechanisms among the Indigenous Peoples.\u201d The IPP, however, is developed after broad community support is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b57c3547-491b-4aad-b55a-7ea07c2416d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b57c3547-491b-4aad-b55a-7ea07c2416d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bb82769eb54aa329ed078ccee7907e0f828dd67ed7313c670893874d7419482"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bb2097e-ccfb-4132-ac3d-b2eab78305dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5639420b1a172fc274c48c79f7577e97ad109a3e6e162e246c4984054434194f"}}, "hash": "11d8f4583b793917d51782ca32dccff0ad547c6e6bfd780070ef00ed2d1f5285", "text": "obtained and therefore any grievance mechanisms will only apply to project implementation rather than to the initial broad community support determination. 6. Lands and resources As with FPIC, the requirement that broad community support be obtained is triggered by an actual or potential impact on indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional lands, territories and resources and therefore is dependent on a clear identification, recognition and protection of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights to lands, territories and resources traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used. While this may seem an obvious point, it is not uncommon for states to limit FPIC to lands that are legally recognized in their own legal systems rather than the lands and territories traditionally owned by indigenous peoples in accordance with Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 60 4 their customary law and values, the standard employed in international law.51 In many cases, there is a large disparity between the two categories and requiring FPIC only in connection with the former potentially exempts large areas of indigenous lands from the FPIC requirement. In Guyana, for instance, FPIC applies only to \u201crecognized\u201d or titled lands thereby excluding approximately three-quarters of the lands traditionally owned and presently claimed by indigenous peoples.52 The same also applies in the case of Australia\u2019s Northern Territory where FPIC applies to aboriginal lands recognized under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, but not to lands that may be owned pursuant to the 1993 Native Title Act (Cth). With regard to the latter, a \u2018right to negotiate\u2019, subject to arbitration if agreement cannot be reached, applies, not FPIC.53 How does the OP define indigenous lands and territories for the purposes of determining if indigenous peoples are affected and, if so, requiring that FPICon resulting in broad community support applies and does it require recognition and regularization of rights to lands, territories and resources? In September 2004, the WBG recognized that \u201cindigenous peoples can be particularly vulnerable to projects that affect them due to their unique collective ties to lands, territories and natural resources.\u201d54 At the same time it made a commitment that OP 4.10 will require recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples to lands and territories traditionally owned and customarily used and ensure that indigenous peoples receive due process guarantees, benefits and compensation \u201cat least equivalent to what any landowner would be entitled to in the case of commercial development on their land\u2026\u201d55 It is doubtful that draft OP 4.10 does adequately address land and resource rights and meets this commitment. a. Identifying indigenous lands, territories and resources According to paragraphs 6(c), 8, 9 and 10, indigenous peoples must be present in or have a collective attachment to the project area and be affected by the project for the FPICon resulting in broad community support requirement to become operative. Footnote 7 of OP 4.10 states that collective attachment, \u201cmeans that for generations there has been a physical presence in and economic ties to lands and territories traditionally owned, or customarily used or occupied by the group concerned, including areas which hold special significance for it, such as sacred sites.\u201d 51 See inter alia, The Mayagna (Sumo) Awas Tingni Community Case, Judgment of August 31, 2001. Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Series C No. 79, para. 146, 148, 164 (holding that states \u201cmust adopt the legislative, administrative, and any other measures required to create an effective mechanism for delimitation, demarcation, and titling of the property of indigenous communities, in accordance with their customary law, values, customs and mores\u201d).

Also, OP 4.10 (para. 4) recognizes that some indigenous peoples may have lost collective attachment to all or parts of their traditional territories because of \u2018forced severance\u2019. The problematic nature of the definition of forced severance is discussed above particularly in relation to its potential to artificially limit the application of the OP including the FPICon resulting in broad community support requirement. b. Special considerations Paragraph 16 states that due to indigenous peoples\u2019 close ties to lands and natural resources, special considerations apply which require that the borrower \u201cpays particular attention\u201d to the following when conducting social assessments and preparing IPPs/IPPFs: \u25a0 Customary rights, both individual and collective, pertaining to traditionally owned lands or territories, lands and territories customarily used or occupied and where access to natural resources is \u201cvital to the sustainability of their cultures and livelihoods;\u201d \u25a0 Protection of the above mentioned lands and resources from illegal \u2013 presumably \u2018illegal\u2019 under domestic law \u2013 encroachment or intrusion; \u25a0 The cultural and spiritual values that indigenous peoples attribute to their lands and resources; \u25a0 Indigenous peoples\u2019 natural resource management practices and the long-term sustainability of those practices. Footnote 16 defines \u2018customary rights\u2019 to lands and resources as \u201cpatterns of long-standing community land and resource usage in accordance with indigenous peoples\u2019 customary laws, values, customs and traditions, including seasonal or cyclical use rather than formal legal title to land and resources issued by the State.\u201d The terminology used in paragraphs 16 (and 17) is confusing, although it is not clear how important this may be in practice. Specifically, the terms \u2018traditionally owned\u2019 and \u201ccustomarily occupied or used\u201d are largely synonymous \u2013 the only exception being in rare instances where indigenous peoples do not assign ownership or other rights under their customary laws. The real distinction is between lands owned in accordance with indigenous peoples\u2019 own laws and customs, but not legally recognized by the state, and those lands over which indigenous peoples hold title issued by the state that may or may not correspond to the full extent of lands, territories and resources traditionally/customarily owned. Finally, mention is required of the phrase \u2018vital to sustainability of their cultures and livelihoods\u2019. Non-indigenous people\u2019s property rights, including protection thereof, are not limited to those \u201cvital\u201d to cultural or livelihood sustainability and it is manifestly discriminatory to apply this standard to indigenous peoples. c. Action on lands, territories and resources Paragraph 17 of the OP provides: Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 62 4 If the project involves (a) activities that are contingent on establishing legally recognized rights to lands and territories that indigenous peoples traditionally occupied, or customarily used and occupied (such as land titling projects); or (b) the acquisition of such lands, the [Indigenous Peoples Plan] sets forth an action plan for the legal recognition of such occupation, or usage. Normally, the action plan is undertaken prior to project implementation; in some cases, however, the action plan may need to be carried out concurrently with the project itself. Such legal recognition may take the form of: (a) full legal recognition of existing customary land tenure systems of Indigenous Peoples; or (b) conversion of customary usage rights to communal and/or individual ownership rights. If neither option is possible under domestic law, the IPP includes measures for legal recognition of perpetual or long term, renewable custodial or use rights. Whether this language requires prior recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights of ownership to lands, territories and resources turns on whether a project can be classified as (a) or (b) in the first paragraph and whether there is a procedure under domestic law that allows for such recognition. For instance, if a project does not contain activities contingent on establishing legally recognized rights \u2013 other than a mention of land titling projects, there is no indication as to what kind of projects will fall into this category \u2013 or the \u201cacquisition\u201d of such lands \u2013 \u2018acquisition\u2019 essentially means a taking or expropriation of indigenous lands for project-related purposes \u2013 paragraph 17 will not apply at all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd5a950-1159-4557-9c45-78676252d6c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd5a950-1159-4557-9c45-78676252d6c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cfa71a6522aafd5ba4f078ee990c725a6e6acfd01b8fea17de4c6727a1c7d8a"}, "2": {"node_id": "39c39a21-2f52-4da6-aec5-04fd87512feb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1723182dda6020a93ef01afd4f5e11fd1bdafe022b3247ddcd34868f4979d80"}}, "hash": "054b70d49f4149866058e7f4c1860c877f63145e080b699e3c41c5c1284187ee", "text": "It is also unclear why the Bank cannot require that domestic laws be adopted to recognize ownership rights if they do not exist, rather than requiring that the IPP provide for legal recognition of custodial or use rights; presumably the latter will require some form of legislative action anyway.

Commercial exploitation of natural resources If a project involves commercial exploitation of natural resources \u2013 defined in the OP as \u201cminerals, hydrocarbon resources, forests, water, and hunting/fishing grounds \u2013 in indigenous peoples\u2019 territories (really areas where there is \u2018collective attachment\u2019), paragraph 56 See among others, Report of the Committee set up to examine the representation alleging non-observance by Peru of the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), made under article 24 of the ILO Constitution by the General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP). Doc. GB 270/16/4; GB 270/14/4 (1998), at para. 26 (finding that \u201cwhen communally owned indigenous lands are divided and assigned to individuals or third parties, the exercise of their rights by indigenous communities tends to be weakened and generally end up losing all or most of the lands, resulting in a general reduction of the resources that are available to indigenous peoples when they keep their lands in common\u201d). World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 63 4 18 requires that \u201cthe borrower ensures that as part of the [FPICon] process the affected communities are informed of (a) their rights to such resources under statutory and customary law; (b) the scope and nature of such proposed commercial development and the parties involved or interested in such development; and (c) the potential effects of such development on their livelihoods, environments, and use of such resources.\u201d Also, the IPP must \u201cenable\u201d equitable benefit sharing and; at a minimum, the IPP must provide that indigenous peoples receive benefits in a culturally appropriate manner and that the \u201cbenefits, compensation and rights to due process [are] at least equivalent to that which any landowner with full legal title to the land would be entitled to in the case of commercial development on their land.\u201d The appropriateness of this paragraph is entirely dependent on the definition of broad community support and whether this is implicitly required as part of the definition of FPICon. Rather than rely on this, it is critically important that this paragraph explicitly require that FPICon resulting in broad community support is required, particularly in light of the often severe and negative impact of extractive industry projects on indigenous peoples.57 As stated by Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, an indigenous leader from the Philippines, \u201cFor many indigenous peoples throughout the world, oil, gas and coal industries conjure images of displaced peoples, despoiled lands, and depleted resources. This explains the unwavering resistance of most indigenous communities with any project related to extractive industries.\u201d58 These abuses have also been documented by the WBG.59 e. Commercial exploitation of cultural resources or knowledge Paragraph 19 concerns commercial exploitation of indigenous peoples\u2019 cultural resources or knowledge \u2013 the term \u201ccultural resources\u201d is not defined in the OP. Commercial exploitation is dependent on indigenous peoples\u2019 \u201cprior agreement\u201d and the IPP must reflect the nature and content of such agreements as well as provide for culturally appropriate and equitable benefit sharing. This formulation would be appropriate to use in connection with commercial exploitation of natural resources in paragraph 18 \u2013 or indeed in place of FPICon resulting in broad community support throughout the OP \u2013 and it is disappointing that this is not applied in that context as well. f.

In this context, IP living on these remote and resource rich lands are particularly vulnerable, because of their weaker bargaining capacity, and because their customary rights are not recognized in several countries\u201d). Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 64 4 60 For requirements of a resettlement plan, see OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, December 2001 (revised April 2004), para. 6, available at http://wbln0018.worldbank.org/Institutional/Manuals/OpManual.nsf/0/ CA2D01A4D1BDF58085256B19008197F6?OpenDocument 61 Supra note 15, para. 20 (providing that involuntary relocation may take place subsequent to \u201cconsultation\u201d with indigenous peoples). See also, id. para. 9, which provides that: Bank experience has shown that resettlement of indigenous peoples with traditional land-based modes of production is particularly complex and may have significant adverse impacts on their identity and cultural survival. For this reason, the Bank satisfies itself that the borrower has explored all viable alternative project designs to avoid physical displacement of these groups. When it is not feasible to avoid such displacement, preference is given to land-based resettlement strategies for these groups (see para. 11) that are compatible with their cultural preferences and are prepared in consultation with them. 62 OP 4.12, paragraph 7, provides that: 7. In projects involving involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and protected areas (see para. 3(b)), the nature of restrictions, as well as the type of measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts, is determined with the participation of the displaced persons during the design and implementation of the project. In such cases, the borrower prepares a process framework acceptable to the Bank, describing the participatory process by which (a) specific components of the project will be prepared and implemented; (b)the criteria for eligibility of displaced persons will be determined; (c) measures to assist the displaced persons in their efforts to improve their livelihoods, or at least to restore them, in real terms, while maintaining the sustainability of the park or protected area, will be identified; and (d)potential conflicts involving displaced persons will be resolved. The process framework also includes a description of the arrangements for implementing and monitoring the process. protected areas. Paragraph 20 states that physical relocation should be avoided and is only an option in \u201cexceptional circumstances, when it is not possible to avoid it\u2026\u201d In such exceptional circumstances, relocation may then only take place with indigenous peoples\u2019 broad community support subsequent to FPICon. If indigenous peoples do provide broad support, a resettlement plan, developed in accordance with OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, is required, which will be compatible with indigenous peoples\u2019 preferences and requires a land-based resettlement strategy.60 A right of return once the reasons for resettlement have ceased should also be included in the plan. While the potential of paragraph 20 to provide adequate protection for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights ultimately depends on what \u2018broad community support\u2019 means in practice, this paragraph is nonetheless a significant evolution in thinking within the Bank and especially when viewed in relation to the previous draft of OP 4.10 (dated 17 May 2004).61 Not only have they ceased to use the term \u2018involuntary resettlement\u2019, this is the first time that the Bank has agreed that indigenous peoples have some degree of say about relocation and should broad support not exist that it will not fund the proposed project, at least the resettlement component (this could of course still be funded and take place outside of the Bank project itself and it remains to be seen how the Bank would address such a situation).

Also, the Bank is one of the implementing agencies for funds from the Global Environment Facility, and therefore plays a significant role in funding protected areas in all regions of the world. Some GEF projects have been heavily criticized by indigenous peoples for, sometimes, gross violations of their rights, including forced resettlement and unilateral expropriation of traditional lands and resources. Independent studies conducted by NGOs, academics and others confirm many of these allegations.63 Moreover, it appears that FPICon in paragraph 21 is only related to the development of a process framework rather than whether there are involuntary restrictions in the first place. It is however possible that the general requirements of FPICon and broad community support set forth in paragraphs 1, 6(c), 10 and 11 would apply to all projects and therefore that paragraph 21 only deals with involuntary restrictions subsequent to broad community support for the project in general. Nonetheless, it appears that the Bank has consciously created an exception to the broad community support requirement in this paragraph. It is also unclear whether protected areas would fall into either category (a) or (b) in paragraph 17 and therefore trigger the requirement that indigenous peoples\u2019 rights to lands, territories and resources be recognized and regularized prior to the establishment of protected areas. If we apply the most negative interpretation of paragraph 21 it would appear to permit unilateral expropriation of indigenous peoples\u2019 lands, territories and resources in the name of nature conservation; non-consensual restrictions on access to protected areas including sacred areas located therein; and little more than participation in protected area management, which \u201cshould,\u201d rather than must, provide for continued use of resources. This paragraph, if this is the correct interpretation, also adds to the conclusion that OP 4.10 has not provided adequate protections for indigenous peoples\u2019 land and resource rights as the WBG committed to do in its response to the EIR. The preceding \u2018worst case\u2019 interpretation is clearly contrary to indigenous peoples\u2019 rights in international law and contravenes the Convention on Biological Diversity. With regard to the former, the UN Human Rights Committee has emphasized that \u201csecuring continuation and sustainability of traditional forms of economy of indigenous minorities (hunting, fishing and gathering), and protection of sites of religious or cultural significance for such minorities \u2026must be protected under article 27 [of the International Covenant on Civil and 63 See, among others, T.

Additionally, the nature of and extent to which informed participation is required as part of FPICon, if at all, as distinct from mere consultation, is very unclear. Although certain elements of the draft OP may be considered improvements over prior versions \u2013 the provision on physical relocation may fall into this category \u2013 the extent of some of these potential improvements, including that on relocation, ultimately turn on the definition of FPICon resulting in broad community support. Furthermore, the Bank\u2019s record of applying and adhering to its operational policies is poor and, assuming that an acceptable definition of FPICon resulting in broad community support is possible, its efficacy remains subject to implementation and enforcement mechanisms. That OP 4.10 does not contain prompt and simple mechanisms for indigenous peoples to challenge and complain about faulty or false assessments of broad community support nor require that such support and the conditions thereof be subject to written agreements between the borrower and affected indigenous peoples should be seen in this context. Without prompt and effective grievance, complaints and verification mechanisms, adherence to OP 4.10 is largely dependent on the good will of the borrower and the Bank. 64 Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee: Australia. 28/07/2000.

The International Finance Corporation The IFC is part of the private sector arm of the WBG and as such provides loans and other support to corporations and other private sector entities, including some of the world\u2019s wealthiest, rather than to governments. According to the IFC, its mission is \u201cto promote sustainable private sector development in developing countries helping reduce poverty and improve peoples\u2019 [sic] lives. IFC believes that sound economic growth, grounded in sustainable private investment, is crucial to poverty reduction.\u201d68 As the IFC often buys a stake in projects, it operates as both guarantor of environmental and social standards in projects and as an investor that stands to profit from the same projects. The IFC has traditionally employed the safeguard policies used by the Bank, such as OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. Citing the need to be more responsive to the needs of the private sector, particularly the differences in lending to the private as opposed to the public sector for which the safeguard policies were primarily designed, the IFC obtained Board approval to adopt a new set of safeguards in 2003. It subsequently proposed that the ten safeguard policies previously in use will be replaced by eight new \u2018performance standards\u2019 and an IFC Policy that will set out \u201cIFC\u2019s roles and responsibilities in its investment operations, as well as the requirements that IFC\u2019s clients are expected to fulfil for IFC financing.\u201d69 One of these performance standards addresses indigenous peoples. The Performance Standards are complemented by the IFC\u2019s Policy on Social and Environment Sustainability, which sets forth the obligations of the IFC as distinct from requirements of clients contained in the Performance Standards, and by Guidance Notes, which contain non-binding principles of best practice that the client may or may not choose to follow. There is also a new IFC disclosure policy being developed that will define when and whether the IFC and client are required to disclose information to affected persons, communities or peoples, or to the general public.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed25890f-8486-4302-97a3-cdced5404cc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed25890f-8486-4302-97a3-cdced5404cc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f28c4252f34e2673628df27859eac319c20effe196dc72ad96dd3a67f5fd32e"}, "2": {"node_id": "aeaca349-cdef-47a1-abc0-ec02df9e9b20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec85d99020e1cf0a66aaeec02f3304b813c9484d70b7ee7918397068cb023d47"}}, "hash": "af0e2643e06d62472cce92240554f84355dc992a78744028d63da94a0da4f4cb", "text": "Given that policy requirements as well as best practice statements are spread over a number of documents and policies, the new IFC framework, at least as presently drafted, is confusing and it is sometimes difficult to ascertain with any specificity what is required in a given situation.

This raises serious questions about the degree to which IFC and clients can be held responsible for social and environmental problems caused by their activities. The impact of the revision of the IFC\u2019s safeguard policies goes far beyond changes to the operating policies of the IFC itself. In the past three years more than 29 large commercial banks have agreed to follow a set of environmental and social standards known as the Equator Principles which are based on the IFC\u2019s safeguard policies.70 These banks provided 80 percent (US$55.1 billion) of all private sector direct foreign investment financing around 68 IFC Draft, at 2. 69 Id., at 1. 70 See The Equator Principles. Available at: http://www.equator-principles.com Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 68 4 the world in 2003.71 Further, national export credit agencies (ECAs) are increasingly relying on IFC safeguard standards. Both the Equator Banks and various ECAs will adopt the new IFC standards as their own once they come into force. As the IFC revises its own policies, it is in effect undertaking a global standard setting exercise affecting environmental and social issues in the vast majority of privately financed projects. IFC-supported operations have greatly affected some indigenous peoples. The Chad- Cameroon oil pipeline project (also funded in part by the Bank), for instance, passes through indigenous lands in Cameroon and has resulted in uncompensated and non-consensual losses of lands and resources, exacerbated conflicts with non-indigenous neighbours, and has caused an overall deterioration in indigenous peoples\u2019 economic and social well-being. Protected areas established under the project to off-set biodiversity loss have also resulted in violations of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights. A number of IFC supported mining projects \u2013 the Glamis-operated mine in Guatemala and the Newmont-operated Yanacocha mine in Peru, for instance \u2013 have also engendered substantial opposition from affected indigenous peoples. Will the proposed new IFC performance standard on indigenous peoples provide effective safeguards and ensure that this will not occur in the future? A. Performance Standard 7 on Indigenous Peoples 1. Objectives and application As noted above the revised IFC safeguards include a performance standard on indigenous peoples (\u201cPS7\u201d or \u201cthe PS\u201d). Other performance standards also affect indigenous peoples, for instance, PS5 on involuntary resettlement and PS8 on cultural resources. Similar to OP 4.10, the objectives of the PS7 are stated as: \u201cto ensure that the development process fosters full respect for the dignity, human rights, aspirations, cultures and customary livelihoods of indigenous peoples;\u201d to avoid or minimize risks to indigenous peoples occupying or using the affected area; to promote informed participation throughout the life of a project; to \u201cfoster good faith and meaningful engagement\u201d with indigenous peoples when projects are to be located on traditional or customary lands; and to respect indigenous peoples\u2019 culture, knowledge and practices.72 \u2018Engagement\u2019 is defined in PS1 as \u201cdisclosure of information, consultation, and informed participation, in a manner commensurate to the risks and impacts to the affected communities.\u201d As with OP 4.10, PS7 does not employ a definition of the term \u2018indigenous peoples\u2019 as such observing that there is no accepted international definition. Instead it says that it will apply to indigenous peoples who are a \u201cdistinct social and cultural group\u201d possessing the following characteristics in varying degrees \u25a0 Self-identification as members of a distinct indigenous cultural group and recognition of this identity by others; \u25a0 Collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories in the project area and to the natural resources in these habitats and territories; 71 IFC Strategic Directions 2004, International Finance Corporation: Washington D.C., 23 March 2004, 2.

The non-binding Guidance Notes 14 and 20 to PS7 indicate that participation in impact assessment should be at least considered best practice, stating respectively that As part of the S&EA process, and as required by the Performance Standard, the client will engage with the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples within the project\u2019s area of influence through the process of information disclosure, consultation and informed participation. The general characteristics of engagement with affected communities are described in Performance Standard 1 and Guidance Note 1, and further described below as they apply to Indigenous Peoples in particular. Further guidance on engagement processes is provided in IFC\u2019s Good Practice Manual Doing Better Business through Effective Public Consultation and Disclosure. Clients should encourage participation of affected communities of Indigenous Peoples throughout the project in the process of project assessment and implementation. It is through an iterative process of listening to and incorporating concerns, sharing certain decisions, and adapting the project as necessary and feasible, that the project manages risks to the affected communities and improves its social performance. Engagement with the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples in important project decisions that may affect the interests of these communities should continue throughout the life of the project.

Specific requirements Specific requirements contained in PS7 include the following (the FPICon and broad community support requirements will be discussed in sub-section 4 below): \u25a0 Client will identify indigenous peoples in the project\u2019s area of influence, as well as the nature and degree of the expected social, cultural (including cultural heritage), and environmental impacts on them and where possible avoid adverse impacts on indigenous peoples. Where avoidance is not possible, client will mitigate, minimize or compensate for adverse impacts. This requirement should be viewed in light of the ambiguities surrounding indigenous peoples\u2019 right to informed participation in impact assessments in PS7. However, even with informed participation, the client\u2019s impact assessments need not respect and incorporate indigenous peoples\u2019 views and preferences, all that need occur is that these views are incorporated into the client\u2019s decision-making processes, which may reach conclusions contrary indigenous peoples\u2019 preferences. This conclusion is based on the IFC\u2019s own definition of \u2018informed participation\u2019 found is PS1, which states that \u201cInformed participation involves organized and iterative consultation, leading to the client\u2019s incorporating into their decision-making process the views of the affected communities on matters that affect them directly, such as the design of mitigation measures, the sharing of development benefits and opportunities, and implementation issues.\u201d75 This definition should be referenced wherever the term \u2018informed participation\u2019 is used on PS7 or elsewhere in the IFC framework (see, for instance, on Action Plans and development opportunities below).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89eb6e5d-4fea-4fc5-8537-09f0b468809e": {"__data__": {"id_": "89eb6e5d-4fea-4fc5-8537-09f0b468809e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fddc78114e95e20254feb74d646cf01e146b4a0cacd1adaa43b44c3c26a0e2ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa252598-955c-4c66-8e56-7cad041d9d22", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d917e4ad932f41c57e7aae402bafb876d1b4a663bf33022a57e3d474888d4bfd"}}, "hash": "b4d46408467243fc04e687a2db1170adaece9b0e11ec312ae31626755361cb38", "text": "The \u201cproject\u2019s area of influence\u201d is defined in PS1 as: (i) the primary project site(s) and related facilities that the client (including its contractors) develops or controls (e.g., power transmission corridors, pipelines, canals, tunnels, relocation and access roads, borrow and disposal areas, construction camps); (ii) associated facilities that are not funded as part of the project (funding may be provided", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1b3c650-14d6-4e55-b9f6-1c1bd22215ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1b3c650-14d6-4e55-b9f6-1c1bd22215ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3821aa5aed8c3c99ba5d70feb3cc85028d623ef7d5a62b3be95742e3d4b929d9"}}, "hash": "3821aa5aed8c3c99ba5d70feb3cc85028d623ef7d5a62b3be95742e3d4b929d9", "text": "separately by the client or by third parties including the government), and whose viability and existence depends exclusively on the project and whose goods or services are essential for the successful operation of the project; World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 71 4 76 Id. at 2.

The area of influence does not include potential impacts that would occur without the project or independently of the project.76 \u25a0 Mitigation, minimization or compensation measures, among others, must be clearly set forth in an Action Plan (governed by PS1), which must be developed with indigenous peoples\u2019 informed participation, and in a time bound plan such as an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) or a community development plan with separate components for indigenous peoples if the projects affects a broader group of persons/communities; The Action Plan is the primary instrument that governs the life of a project, whereas an IPDP most likely will be an elaboration of certain elements of an Action Plan as it relates to indigenous peoples. Certain elements of the Action Plan may also be included in the financing agreement, the primary legal agreement applicable to a project, between the IFC and a client. Failure to comply with those elements incorporated into the financing agreement may allow the IFC to suspend the project or require other remedial action for breach of contract. This however assumes that the IFC is willing to take such action and its willingness also should be viewed in light of the fact that IFC will most likely also be an investor in the project itself. Further, while the Action Plan must be developed with indigenous peoples\u2019 participation, no such requirement is stated for the IPDP, unless the IPDP is considered an integral part of the Action Plan and this is unclear in PS1 and PS7. \u25a0 The client will establish an on-going relationship with the affected indigenous peoples from as early as possible in the project planning through decommissioning of the project, through an on-going, culturally appropriate process to inform indigenous peoples of risks and impacts that may be posed by the project, and to consult with and seek the informed participation of indigenous peoples in decisions that affect them. In particular, the process will: \u25a0 Involve Indigenous Peoples\u2019 representative bodies (for example councils of elders or village councils, among others); \u25a0 Be inclusive of both women and men and of various age groups in a culturally appropriate manner; \u25a0 Provide for sufficient time for Indigenous Peoples\u2019 collective decision-making processes; \u25a0 Facilitate the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 expression of their views, concerns, and proposals in the language of their choice; and \u25a0 Ensure that the grievance mechanism or procedure established for the project, as described in Performance Standard 1, is culturally appropriate and accessible for Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 72 4 The grievance mechanism referred to here is intended to act as a complaints mechanism and/or dispute resolution mechanism that will function at the project level. This most likely means that it will be an internal mechanism established and run by the client. It should not be viewed, however, as a substitute for recourse to national legal remedies, where these exist, or use of the IFC\u2019s complaints mechanism, know as the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, should the complaint concern the failure of the IFC to comply with its responsibilities rather than the client specifically. The CAO performs largely the same function as the World Bank\u2019s Inspection Panel, receiving complaints about failures to adhere to safeguard policies. \u25a0 The client will provide development opportunities that are identified with the informed participation of the affected indigenous peoples. Such opportunities should be commensurate with the degree of project impacts, with the aim to improving their standard of living and livelihoods in a culturally appropriate manner, and to fostering the long-term sustainability of the natural resource on which they depend; \u25a0 If the project is to be located on traditional or customary lands under use, and adverse impacts can be expected on the customary livelihoods, and/or cultural, ceremonial or spiritual use that define the identity and community of the Indigenous Peoples, the client will respect their use by taking the following steps, in addition to the other requirements of this", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa94d890-b3ec-4d21-82e3-0325f288b1cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa94d890-b3ec-4d21-82e3-0325f288b1cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09bf932b6d6f85187f7593d476ac7407ddb78fb71d7821bbd64e051bac309acd"}}, "hash": "09bf932b6d6f85187f7593d476ac7407ddb78fb71d7821bbd64e051bac309acd", "text": "Performance Standard: \u25a0 The client will document its efforts to avoid or at least minimize the size of land proposed for use by the project; \u25a0 Indigenous peoples\u2019 land use will be documented by experts using appropriate methods in consultation with the affected communities of indigenous peoples; \u25a0 The affected communities of indigenous peoples will be informed of their rights with respect to these lands under national law, including any national law recognizing any customary rights or use; and \u25a0 The affected communities of indigenous peoples will be offered at least compensation and rights to due process available to those with full legal title to land in the case of commercial development of their land under national law, together with culturally appropriate development opportunities. The first three of these points should all be part of an adequate environmental and social impact assessment and do not add much, if anything, to what a responsible company should be undertaking at present. Note also that, as with OP 4.10, PS7 focuses on only impacts to \u201ccustomary livelihoods,\u201d rather than all livelihoods. As noted with respect to the OP, this formulation is discriminatory as non-indigenous persons\u2019 rights to their livelihoods are not limited only to those that are customary and many indigenous peoples\u2019 livelihoods today are at least in part something other than customary. The last point potentially undervalues indigenous peoples\u2019 rights to and relationships with traditional lands, territories and resources, and undermines indigenous peoples\u2019 rights in international law. Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights to lands, territories and resources including attendant due process, cultural and other rights are not equivalent to the property rights of non-indigenous persons and are accorded higher degrees of protection under international law and some domestic legal regimes. One higher due process standard accorded to indigenous peoples\u2019 property rights under international law \u2013 at least in part because of World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 73 4 the applicability of the right to self-determination \u2013 is the right to give or withhold FPIC, including in cases of compulsory acquisition or takings and proposed resettlement. This right does not apply to non-indigenous persons in international law. It is therefore not appropriate that indigenous property rights be treated in the same manner as non- indigenous property rights. Also, many companies will do only the minimum that is required to comply with external requirements resulting in indigenous peoples\u2019 being treated in same the manner as non-indigenous property holders. Finally, culturally appropriate development opportunities are required under other sections of PS7, therefore, the only requirement that this sections adds is one that undermines indigenous peoples\u2019 internationally guaranteed rights. The significance of this language further amplified in relation to PS5 and PS7 as they apply to economic displacement of indigenous peoples due to involuntary takings of lands for project purposes (see below). \u25a0 \u201cCare should be taken to ensure that any indigenous peoples\u2019 land claim is not prejudiced during these steps.\u201d It is entirely unclear what the actual requirements are in relation to this statement and it is unclear how the term land claim may be understood and used in practice. In the first place, non-mandatory language \u2018should\u2019 is employed raising questions about whether the client is actually required to do anything pursuant to this section. Second, the term \u2018care\u2019 may imply a duty to exercise due diligence to verify if a \u2018land claim\u2019 exists (something that should be done as part of the impact assessment) or it may imply some other more or less onerous duty. With regard to ensuring that the client\u2019s actions will not prejudice the \u2018claim\u2019, the term \u2018prejudice\u2019 is highly contextual and open to various interpretations, many of which may not comport with indigenous peoples\u2019 views. Use of the term \u2018claim\u2019 is also problematic in and of itself as indigenous peoples have rights in international law to own and control lands, territories and resources traditionally owned or otherwise occupied and used. States and corporations have, at a minimum, the obligation to respect those rights. Rights in this sense are not \u2018claims\u2019, but impose specific obligations of conduct and result applicable to others. Also, in principle any operation within indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional territories that takes place without their consent may be considered a violation of rights and this is certainly prejudicial to those rights or a \u2018claim\u2019 over the same lands. The next question, considering that indigenous peoples\u2019 rights are inherent, is whether a \u2018claim\u2019 must be cognizable under national law or even officially registered in order to be considered a \u2018claim\u2019 for the purposes of PS7?

If prejudice were to occur in relation to informing indigenous peoples about rights under national law or in documenting land use, the client presumably will have acted dishonestly or incompetently. Point four is by itself prejudicial to indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and therefore it is difficult to see how the client could avoid additional prejudice. The only way to avoid prejudice under the first point, at least without FPIC by indigenous peoples, would be simply to avoid any use of or encroachment on indigenous lands, something that would preclude the further application of PS7 entirely. Finally, the Guidance Notes provide no help in clearing up any of these difficulties saying only that \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 claims to land or resources will be documented as part of the S&EA process.\u201d77 77 Id. at 113, Guidance Note 24. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 74 4 \u25a0 The client will make every effort to avoid the relocation of Indigenous Peoples from their communally held traditional or customary lands under use. If relocation is unavoidable, the client will not proceed unless it enters into good faith negotiation with the affected indigenous peoples and documents their informed participation, consistent with PS7 and PS5 as it relates to physical displacement. The footnote associated with this section adds that \u201cWhere members of the affected communities of Indigenous Peoples individually hold legal title, or where the relevant national law recognizes customary rights for individuals, the requirements of Performance Standard 5 will apply, rather than the requirements under this heading.\u201d In other words, good faith negotiation and other requirements will not apply to indigenous persons holding individual rights. The language pertaining to good faith negotiation as it relates to physical displacement/ relocation and cultural resources (see below), is discussed in the section on broad community support immediately following this section. Both the preceding section and PS5 cross reference each other and should be read conjunctively. PS 5 in particular states that when indigenous peoples are to be either physically or economically displaced, the requirements of PS7 must be followed as well as the requirements of PS5. In the case of physical relocation the above quoted language applies and should a negotiated settlement resulting in relocation be concluded, PS5 must then be reference for further requirements. In the case of economic displacement however there is no obligation for the client to reach a negotiated a settlement pursuant to either PS5 or PS7. As with OP 4.10, this may encompass involuntary restrictions on access to protected areas and takings of traditional indigenous lands, provided that physical displacement is not involved. According to PS5, \u2018economic displacement\u2019 means the \u201closs of assets or access to assets that leads to loss of income sources or means of livelihood as a result of project-related land acquisition\u201d (emphasis added). PS5 is clear that this may occur involuntarily including in the case of indigenous peoples. In defining its scope of application, PS5 specifies that it applies to land transactions that are for a private sector project acquired through expropriation or other \u201ccompulsory procedures\u201d and; \u201cfor a private sector project acquired through negotiated settlements with property owners or those with legal rights to land, including customary or traditional rights recognized or recognizable under the laws of the country, who do not have the option to retain the land.\u201d Consequently, under the proposed IFC standards it is permissible for a company, or the government on behalf of a company, to take indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional lands and territories, and as long as physical displacement is not involved to do no more than (as provided by PS7) seek their informed participation in decision making and offer compensation and rights to due process at least equal to that available to persons with full legal title to land. While PS7 does at least ensure that indigenous peoples will be treated as the equivalent of any title holder irrespective of whether they are recognized as such by national law \u2013 an improvement over the terms of PS5 apply to persons without formal legal title \u2013 non-consensual expropriation of indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories amounts to a gross violation of their internationally guaranteed rights. \u25a0 Where a project uses the cultural resources, knowledge, innovations, and/or practices of indigenous peoples for commercial purposes, the client will inform the Indigenous Peoples of (i) their rights under national law; (ii) the scope and nature of the proposed commercial development; and (iii) the potential consequences of such development.

FPICon and broad community support While the FPICon and broad community support requirement is set out in various sections of OP 4.10, the requirement is not specifically stated at all in PS7. In order to understand how the principle operates in the IFC framework reference must be made to PS1 on impact assessment, the IFC Draft Procedure for Environmental and Social Review of Projects and the IFC Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability, the latter two only applying to the IFC itself. These components of the policy framework are the only ones that explain and require FPICon and broad community support. As noted above, it is very likely that the Equator Banks and a number of ECAs will also adopt the IFC\u2019s new performance standards as their own operating policies. They will not however adopt the policies that only apply to the IFC. Therefore, the broad community support requirement \u2013 being absent from the performance standards \u2013 will not be included in policies adopted by the Equator Banks and ECAs, unless they choose to modify the IFC standards when they incorporate them into their own policies. a. Defining FPICon and broad community support According to PS1, \u201cBroad community support is a collective expression by the affected communities, through individuals and/or their recognized representatives, in support of the project. There may be broad community support even if some individuals or groups object to the project.\u201d78 The terms \u2018individuals\u2019 and \u2018groups\u2019 in the last sentence refer to persons or groups within a \u2018community\u2019 and therefore indicates that broad community support may be determined to exist despite the objections of small numbers of individuals or small groups within a \u2018community\u2019. Two of the main questions raised by this definition are: 1) What is the \u2018community\u2019 for the purposes of broad community support \u2013 is it a village, the entire indigenous people(s) or some sub-entity, such as a clan, for instance \u2013 and will this account for indigenous peoples\u2019 customary laws which may assign rights in different circumstances to different entities: individuals, families, extended families, clans, villages, geographically defined sub-groups or the entire nation or people? In this context, also, are the \u2018recognized representatives\u2019 those recognized by indigenous peoples or by the state/national law? 2) If broad community support can exist over the objections of individuals or groups within the \u2018community\u2019, how much of the \u2018community\u2019 must be in support or opposed for broad community support to exist or not exist? What does this say about traditional consensus-based decision-making processes employed by indigenous peoples? The IFC also provides a definition of FPICon, one that is substantially different from and less accommodating than that found in footnote 1 in OP 4.10. According to Guidance Note 45 to PS1, \u201cConsultation should be \u2018free\u2019 (free of intimidation or coercion), \u2018prior\u2019 (timely 78 Id. at 2. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 76 4 disclosure of information) and \u2018informed\u2019 (relevant, understandable and accessible information), and apply to the entire project process and not to the early stages of the project alone.\u201d This is no more than a description of the terms preceding the word \u2018consultation\u2019 and should be part of any consultation process at present. b. Application of FPICon and broad community support The major difference between the OP and IFC policy is that FPICon and broad community support is only required for large projects with significant adverse impacts under the IFC framework.79 Under OP 4.10, FPICon and broad community support is required for all projects and at each stage of the project. This is a difference that is difficult to understand and justify, at least on the basis of any distinction between the nature of public and private sector projects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff6ac7b3-db95-4807-b26b-9f2e0b70dffa": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff6ac7b3-db95-4807-b26b-9f2e0b70dffa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea82a729fd3dd10adca8317ac190543d104a1cfe136c732690dd41d1eaefacde"}, "2": {"node_id": "570f2c2d-0b33-45c5-abcc-06eef1aeb2ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a9f3892b846589d14319a53cad5e154a6868772c92437ab37de99c6b7ca050d"}}, "hash": "f221ed81227335887782948da80026791709efd025caaae29eb5fb2c0418b68c", "text": "The only indication of the nature of a \u2018significant adverse impact\u2019 is found in the IFC\u2019s project categorization criteria, which indicate that such project impacts are \u201cdiverse, irreversible or unprecedented;\u201d \u201cmay be partially mitigated or compensated, but cannot be completely avoided or fully mitigated;\u201d and, \u201cpose substantial risks to surrounding communities or environment.\u201d80 Note also that if a project has such impacts but it is not further classified as a \u2018large\u2019 project, the FPICon and broad community support requirement is not applicable.

This is not explicitly stated in PS7 although it is confirmed in the associated Guidance Notes and through personal communications with IFC staff. At least with regard to relocation, the Guidance Notes state that \u201cIFC will evaluate the client\u2019s documentation of its engagement process to establish that broad community support for the relocation exists amongst affected communities.\u201d81 As stated in the preceding section, when relocation is unavoidable or where a project plans to commercially develop indigenous peoples\u2019 cultural resources or traditional knowledge, \u201cthe client will not proceed unless it enters into good faith negotiation with the affected indigenous peoples and documents their informed participation\u2026\u201d At least with regard to relocation, the logic employed by the IFC should be as follows: the client must negotiate the terms of relocation with affected indigenous peoples \u2013 should indigenous peoples agree, the next step will be for the client to develop a Resettlement Action Plan (as governed by PS1 and 5), which will be reviewed by IFC; however, if the negotiation between the client and indigenous peoples does not result in an agreement concerning resettlement, the IFC should acknowledge the failure to agree as evidence that broad community support does not exist and therefore decline to finance the project. If the preceding is in fact what is required by PS7, it begs the question of why the IFC cannot clearly state this rather than only noting it in a non-mandatory Guidance Note. The language presently used in PS7 does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that broad community support or agreement subsequent to negotiation is required. It merely states that the client will enter into good faith negotiation without specifying any required result 79 Id. at 3. 80 Id. at 3 and Draft IFC Environmental and Social Review Procedures, at 4.2.2. 81 Id. at 114, Guidance Note 28. World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 77 4 of the negotiation nor even that the negotiation has to have any result at all. As noted above, the requirement also only applies in cases of physical displacement but not to economic displacement. Moreover, the terms of a Resettlement Action Plan should be agreed to as part of the negotiations themselves not after the negotiations. This is the case because, assuming that the RAP does not simply codify the agreement reached in the negotiation, indigenous peoples\u2019 broad community support/agreement must be based on a full consideration of all relevant information, which includes the RAP. While presumably negotiation must be with recognized representatives of the affected indigenous people(s), employing a negotiation process rather than an explicitly community-based decision-making process \u2013 such as FPIC or perhaps even broad community support \u2013 fails to acknowledge substantial inequalities in bargaining power among the parties and the heightened possibilities for manipulation of the process. To address the last point, at a minimum, PS7 could specify and require that any negotiated settlement be ratified by the affected community/people as an integral part of the negotiation process and that it be independently verified to further guard against coercion or manipulation. Presumably indigenous peoples may insist on this in discussions with the client, but the client is not required to agree with this, and may be reluctant to do so particularly if manipulation of the process or coercion is involved. Finally, given that the IFC sometimes invests in projects that have commenced a number of years prior to its involvement, it is possible that project could involve relocation prior to IFC investment. The Guidance Notes acknowledge this situation and provide that: In cases where the host government has made the decision to relocate Indigenous Peoples, consultation with relevant government officials would be important to understand the rationale for such relocation, and whether a good faith negotiation based on informed participation of the Indigenous Peoples has been implemented regarding the aspects of the project and the relocation affecting communities of Indigenous Peoples, prior to the decision to finance the project.82 It is unclear what the result of such a retroactive analysis would be and this paragraph fails to state what action the client or the IFC should take if it is determined that good faith negotiation did not take place. Without a clear statement on this issue, it may create an incentive for governments and companies to forcibly relocate indigenous peoples prior to seeking support from the IFC (the same could also be the case in relation to the Bank under OP 4.10).

Verification of broad community support The OP and IFC policy frameworks are similar in that both require that the Bank and IFC respectively verify that broad community support exists as a precondition to financing the project. The IFC, for instance, states that: 78 Id. Guidance Note 29 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 78 4 * The Transaction Leader is the member of IFC\u2019s Investment Department with overall responsibility for developing a particular project with a client. It corresponds to a Task Manager at the Bank. 83 Id. at 4. 84 Draft IFC Environmental and Social Review Procedures, Working Draft, Version 0.1, 22 September 2005, at 3.2.9. Available at: www.ifc.org/policyreview 85 See, Memorandum of Ian Johnson, EESD World Bank, to Asaad Jabre, IFC, 5 August 2005, available at: http://www.ifc.org/ ifcext/policyreview.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/IFC+Response+and+ESSD+letter/$FILE/ IFC+Cover+Note+_ESSD+Memo_.pdf IFC will review the client\u2019s documentation of the engagement process, and in addition, through its own investigation, assure itself that the client\u2019s community engagement is one that involves free, prior and informed consultation and enables the informed participation of the affected communities, leading to broad community support for the project within the affected communities, before presenting the project for approval by IFC\u2019s Board of Directors.83 The IFC\u2019s Draft Environmental and Social Review Procedures, which contain the procedures IFC staff are required to follow when processing projects, provides very little information on how the IFC will conduct its \u201cown investigation\u201d to assure itself that broad community support exists. It simply states that IFC\u2019s Environment and Social Department will \u201cSupport the [Transaction Leader*] in determining, in the case of large projects with significant adverse impacts, whether the project has Broad Community Support.\u201d84 For both the IFC and the Bank, no independent verification is required nor is any specific written confirmation or refutation by indigenous peoples required to demonstrate that broad community support exists or does not exist. Moreover, both the Bank and IFC will rely primarily, at least initially, on documentation produced by the borrowing government and the client, or consultants hired by the government and client, to determine if broad community support exists. B. Concluding Remarks The proposed IFC policy framework and PS7 in particular are fraught with problems, loopholes and ambiguities that render their effectiveness as meaningful safeguards for indigenous peoples questionable at best. In many cases, the framework seems to be based on the implicit proposition that indigenous peoples should trust the IFC (and in some cases the client) to ensure that rights and interests are protected. In other cases, it is clear that PS7 does not provide an effective guarantee at all for rights and interests as the text permits activities that are in direct contravention of those rights and interests. The same problems (and more) as those identified in OP 4.10 exist with regard to FPICon and broad community support and the provisions pertaining to lands, relocation and procedural issues are weak, vague and flawed. In some cases, PS7 is weaker than the standards set forth in OP 4.10. With regard to the last point, a Bank memorandum to the IFC concerning the draft IFC safeguards also notes that PS7 is inconsistent with and weaker that OP 4.10.85 The forgoing should be viewed in the context of an increasing focus on the private sector as development actors and the well documented problems faced by indigenous peoples with many private sector projects. While the IFC may argue that its involvement should decrease these problems, the evidence suggests that this has not necessarily been the case in the past, nor, based on a review of the proposed standards, will it be in the future.

Moreover, the IFC only considered directly consulting with indigenous peoples when indigenous peoples themselves and a few NGOs complained about their exclusion from the revision process. This should be contrasted with the consultation process employed in relation to OP 4.10, which, although far from adequate and acceptable, involved numerous meetings with indigenous peoples, at the regional as well as the global levels. These consultations took place over more than nine years. The IFC should be held to account for this substantial failure to adhere to what has become an accepted practice of direct consultations with freely chosen indigenous representatives when policies are being revised or changed. These issues are discussed in greater detail in the next section. IV. Indigenous peoples\u2019 engagement with the WBG While indigenous peoples\u2019 have been affected by the activities of the WBG from the earliest days of its operations, other than in relation to a few localized projects, sustained engagement is relatively recent, dating initially from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Around this time, indigenous peoples highlighted the need for major reforms within the WBG to ensure compliance with safeguard policies and demanded direct participation in the drafting of OD 4.20. They also proposed that WBG projects be subject to tripartite agreements between the WBG, the borrower or client, and indigenous peoples where these projects would affect traditional territories. In 1990, indigenous peoples from the Amazon demanded not only direct participation in drafting of the OD but also, among others, that it be consistent with indigenous rights in international law, that no projects be financed without prior consent and the prioritization of indigenous peoples\u2019 own development initiatives.86 These same demands were reiterated by the International Alliance of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of the Tropical Forests in 1992.87 Despite these demands, OD 4.20 was drafted internally by the Bank without any participation by or consultation with indigenous peoples. The same was also the case for OMS 2.34 adopted in 1982. As noted above, the process leading to the adoption of OP 4.10 was quite different and involved numerous meetings with indigenous peoples, both locally and globally. Nonetheless, this process was far from adequate and was severely criticized by indigenous peoples.88 For instance, it was only after the revision process had been underway for four years that the first set of consultation meetings were held with indigenous peoples in 1998. These meetings focused on an \u2018approach paper\u2019 developed internally by Bank staff and were held in Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Viet Nam, Philippines, India and Russia. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 80 4 89 The discussions held at the legal roundtable are summarized in, M. Castello, World Bank Round Table Discussion of Indigenous Representatives and the World Bank on the Revision of the World Bank\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy. Summary Report. Forest Peoples Programme, UK (2003), available at http://www.forestpeoples.org/documents/ifi_igo/ wb_ip_round_table_summary_oct_02_eng.pdf 90 Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Statement to a Round Table Discussion on the Revision of the World Bank Policy on Indigenous Peoples, 18 October 2002, available at: http://www.forestpeoples.org/documents/ifi_igo/ wb_ip_round_table_ip_statement_oct02_eng.shtml A first draft of OP 4.10 was released for comment in 2001 and was followed by 25 meetings in 14 countries. While the Bank expressed considerable pride at its consultation efforts, indigenous peoples who participated reported numerous negative experiences and complained that the process was seriously flawed. For instance, 11 of the 25 meetings lasted less than one day and were reportedly mostly taken up by presentations by Bank staff leaving little time for discussion; some participants were not given the required documents until a few hours before the meeting; and, some meetings lacked adequate translation services. In relation to the consultation process in general, indigenous peoples were also told by the Bank that their key demands expressed during the discussion of the approach paper could not be incorporated into the revised policy and few changes would be made to the text of the draft OP. While subsequent statements by the Bank back-tracked somewhat on this position, this view seems to be a common feature of consultations: indigenous peoples expect that issues and concerns raised will be reflected in ongoing revisions of text or project design, whereas the WBG is of the view that consultation does not require incorporation of indigenous peoples\u2019 views. However, this is not restricted only to processes involving indigenous peoples as the WBG similarly rejected recommendations, including those pertaining to indigenous peoples, such as respect for FPIC, made by the World Commission", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43b909db-2330-41ef-9586-3f44be96a120": {"__data__": {"id_": "43b909db-2330-41ef-9586-3f44be96a120", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30d420449713c11b3d364f50327cce4c0eff24d1d784f623f057eed873c18c9b"}}, "hash": "30d420449713c11b3d364f50327cce4c0eff24d1d784f623f057eed873c18c9b", "text": "on Dams and the Extractive Industry Reviews, both of which were processes either initially commissioned by the WBG itself or in which it played a major role. Additional meetings were held with Bank staff prior to the adoption of the OP in May 2005, including a legal roundtable with Bank lawyers and high ranking officials in 2002, and a meeting during the 2004 session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues session.89 A statement issued by indigenous peoples in relation to the legal roundtable stated, among others, that \u201cindigenous peoples do not accept the World Bank\u2019s March 2001 revised Draft Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP/BP4.10) as an effective instrument for safeguarding the rights and interests of indigenous peoples affected by its development projects and programmes;\u201d and, \u201cthat we as indigenous peoples consider that we have so far been denied the opportunity to significantly shape the outcome of the policy revision and that the Bank has not addressed our principal concerns and our proposals on how to improve the existing policy.\u201d90 Serious concerns have also been raised in relation to OP 4.10 subsequent to its adoption. For instance, a statement endorsed by 25 indigenous organizations and presented to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in May 2005 states that: World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 81 4 The World Bank recently approved its Operational Policy on indigenous peoples (OP/BP 4.10) after seven years of consultations and revisions. \u2026 The newly revised policy has made important improvements in several areas, such as requiring that the commercial development of affected indigenous peoples\u2019 cultural resources and knowledge be conditioned upon their prior agreement to such development. Nevertheless, we continue to be extremely concerned about these Multilateral Development Banks lack of recognition of indigenous peoples\u2019 customary rights to their lands territories and natural resources and to their related right of free prior informed consent, and their derogation of international standards to national law. \u2026 Of specific concern is the World Bank\u2019s recent decision to require a process of free prior and informed consultation with affected indigenous peoples\u2019 communities to ascertain their broad community support for a project, rather than requiring the free prior and informed consent of the affected indigenous people. By merely requiring the World Bank to verify that the borrower has gained the \u201cbroad support from representatives of major sections of the community\u201d\u2013 with no guarantees as to what information will be disclosed and when, how such verification will be conducted and by who, and how the collective decision-making processes and structures of the affected indigenous people will be recognized and respected \u2013 the free prior and informed consultation process stands to reduce indigenous peoples rights to a mere technical procedure. The weakening of free prior and informed consent as an international standard for indigenous peoples stands to severely threaten the lands, territories, and natural resources of indigenous peoples and to undermine their internationally recognized human rights.91 This same statement also called on the Bank \u201cto create a mechanism which will guarantee the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in discussing and defining the meaning and application of conducting free prior and informed consultation and ascertaining broad community support with the Bank\u2019s management, legal counsel, and task teams (TT). Indigenous peoples\u2019 suggestions and comments should be reflected in the forthcoming Indigenous Peoples Guidebook and in any revisions made to BP 4.10.\u201d92 While the process leading to the adoption of OP 4.10 was far from adequate, it certainly was an improvement in relation to the adoption of OMS 2.34 and OD 4.20. It should also be contrasted with the process employed by the IFC as it revises its safeguard framework. As noted above, in the almost three years since the process began, the IFC has held only one formal meeting, in May 2005, with indigenous peoples to discuss its policy. This meeting was largely off-the-record; hastily organized with participants not receiving the documents until a few hours before the meeting; and did not deal with text that had been endorsed by IFC management with the result that many questions were simply deferred and unanswered.

Additionally, as discussed in section III above, the application of PS5 and PS7 will result in indigenous peoples\u2019 customary lands and natural resource rights being undermined and violated. Indigenous peoples\u2019 experiences at the project level have not been much better than they have with policy processes, although there is some amount of variation depending on the nature of the project, the government involved and the degree to which indigenous peoples are organized in relation to the project. These projects have sometimes engendered substantial opposition by indigenous peoples and violent suppression of this opposition by some governments. Problems can and have occurred at all stages of projects: preparation, implementation, monitoring and closure, for example. Project preparation and design control the remainder of the project and, therefore, are the stages where indigenous peoples\u2019 input is most critical. According to Griffiths, however, it \u201cis not uncommon for indigenous communities to only learn of a project once it has already started after key assumptions [have been] made and decisions taken by outsiders.\u201d94 Put another way, many projects may be and are viewed as top-down, external interventions that are imposed on indigenous peoples, do not take into account their rights, priorities and preferences, and more often than not place the majority of costs on indigenous peoples while the vast majority of benefits are enjoyed by others. The preceding views are largely confirmed by internal WBG studies. A 2003 review of the implementation of OD 4.20, for instance, observed that the participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making in WBG projects affecting them was \u201clow\u201d and that just 20 percent of projects had included clear benchmarks to measure impacts on indigenous communities.95 The same report also found that sustainability of results for indigenous peoples in all project types was also generally much lower than overall project sustainability indicators.96 Another internal report reviewing OD 4.20 in relation to 87 projects approved after 2001 found that around 20 percent had little or no provision for enabling indigenous peoples\u2019 participation.97 Of those that did have participation measures, the report concluded that these were normally confined to basic consultation meetings rather than meaningful participation.98 93 Id. 94 Griffiths, supra note 88, at 13. 95 OED Report No. 25332, supra note 18, at 20. 96 Id. at 36. 97 OED Report No. 25754, supra note 18, at 11. 98 Id. at 20.

According to Griffiths, improved performance in these projects was related to \u201clong project preparation times, intensive staff inputs, willingness to pay unusually high transaction costs, strong borrower commitments to reform and genuinely participatory decision-making both in project preparation and implementation.\u201d103 This could lead to the conclusion that these elements should all be part of any project affecting indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, even these projects have their critics, who argue that the projects have caused divisions in indigenous organizations and communities, failed to address underlying causes of poverty and have not effectively carried out the legal and policy reforms required to secure and protect indigenous peoples\u2019 land and resource rights.104 In order to comply with WBG safeguard policies, projects normally must have built-in participation mechanisms. Under OP 4.10 and to a lesser extent the IFC\u2019s draft policy framework, indigenous peoples\u2019 broad community support will now also be required in relation to projects. How this will work in practice and whether it will improve indigenous peoples\u2019 participation in, acceptance of and benefits derived from WBG projects remains Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 84 4 to be seen. However, somewhere around 50 percent of World Bank operations is programmatic lending such as structural adjustment and technical assistance loans, which are not subject to the normal array of safeguard policies applying to projects, including those pertaining to indigenous peoples. Programmatic lending therefore also is not subject to any requirements concerning participation by indigenous peoples. These loans, which often have significant and long-lived negative impacts, are routinely designed and implemented behind closed doors and without any involvement of indigenous peoples or others. In recent years, the Bank has begun to work through Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers with the goal of creating an alternative to traditional adjustment loans. While PRSP formulation processes do often require indigenous participation, indigenous peoples still complain that these processes disregard their concerns and still focus on conventional adjustment measures such as liberalization, increasing foreign investment and privatization. In some countries, indigenous peoples are not formally included in the process and are instead categorized simply as \u2018poor people\u2019 and lumped in with civil society in general. In others, indigenous peoples have managed to insert provisions in the PRSP, yet nonetheless maintain that these provisions are not implemented while the conventional adjustment-related provisions are prioritized. The preceding indicates that there are major challenges to be faced when considering the nature and extent of future engagement with the WBG, be it at a policy, project or programme level. While some gains have been made in the past, these gains are tenuous, some exist mostly on paper, and others have yet to be tested in the real world, in particular in projects where governments are not committed to indigenous participation and rights. Additionally, some of what may be considered to be gains \u2013 the inclusion of broad community support, for instance \u2013 may actually represent serious set backs for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights in the long term. This will be especially the case if donor agencies, the private sector and other multilateral agencies, for example, adopt FPICon leading to broad community support in place of FPIC, the latter being employed by human rights bodies and some multi- and bilateral donors and private sector bodies. This is not far fetched as it is highly probable that the Equator Banks and a number of ECAs will adopt this terminology as part of incorporating IFC standards. V. Conclusions and strategic issues When thinking about how to deal with the institutions that comprise the WBG, the fact that they are owned and controlled by states should always be borne in mind. While consensus decision-making at the board level of the institutions often has the effect of softening extreme positions put forth by certain states, many of the states bring the same issues, concerns and prejudices about indigenous peoples to WBG decisions that they hold in domestic affairs. In some cases, policies expressed at the WBG may be less favourable to indigenous peoples than domestic policies because it is finance ministries or their equivalents that are the primary domestic focal points in relation to the WBG.

World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 85 4 The dynamics of decision-making at the WBG are further complicated by the fact that all but five of the Executive Directors represent groups of states on the board and must achieve consensus among these groups prior to expressing a position at board meetings. This can also lead to the adoption of positions that contradict national policies and even national laws being expressed on behalf of certain countries. The Philippines, for instance, is represented at present by a Brazilian Executive Director. During the debate about FPIC at the WBG board meeting held in August/September 2004, this Executive Director was one of the most vigorous opponents of FPIC despite recognition of the right in the domestic law of the Philippines. Moreover, if it were so inclined, Philippines would be unable to dissociate itself from such a view at the level of the board or to express a contrary view on its own. While the board is the ultimate authority in the WBG, the role of WBG staff and especially management should not be minimized. Projects and policies are in the first place designed by staff and endorsed by management. WBG staff thus has a substantial role in shaping what is eventually submitted to the board and the board, normally after substantial informal and formal interaction with staff and sometimes even negotiation with management, often makes few significant changes to what has been developed and forwarded by staff. In this respect, it is also important to bear in mind that WBG staff overall remains heavily dominated by economists, who often have little understanding of social and environmental issues. Understanding of human rights issues and the role of human rights in development is also minimal. Moving from WBG policy issues to actual projects the situation can be equally complicated because projects are basically government or corporate initiatives that receive funding from the WBG. In the process of developing projects, the practice within the WBG, although much more so in the case of the Bank, seems to be to negotiate project development and conditions with the government and client with varying degrees of attention to safeguard policy issues. This sometimes leads to safeguards being applied (or not applied) in very different ways in different countries, something that will become even more complex if the Bank begins to systematically employ the use of country systems (meaning national laws) in place of safeguard policies. The issue of the application of safeguards is further confused by the practice of the Bank and sometimes the IFC not to fund more than one-third of the total project costs. This often requires that additional donors be brought in as co-financers. These additional donors may be other development banks, UN agencies, bilateral donors, ECA\u2019s or the private sector, some or all of whom may have their own safeguard standards. This may then require a working knowledge or two, three or more sets of (potentially contradictory) policy standards that apply to one project as well as any complaints or grievance mechanisms that may be associated with the various policies. This problem is sometimes avoided by all donors agreeing to apply one donors safeguard standards, but this is not always the case. With regard to IFC projects it is also important to ascertain if the company in question employs specific internal policies and how these may relate to indigenous peoples. With the preceding in mind, this final section provides thoughts and suggestions concerning future strategic engagement with the WBG, both at the policy and project levels, as well as engagement with other institutions and fora that may enhance the efficacy of future engagement with the WBG. In formulating these suggestions, I have tried to Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 86 4 ensure that they are general enough for adaptation to a variety of local situations and to thinking about a regional approach to these important issues. At the same time, given that there will be discussion of these issues in workshops and further elaboration of ideas and strategies, I have also tried to include mostly basic rather than detailed suggestions. A. Policy level OP 4.10 was adopted a mere six months ago and only applies to projects that entered the funding pipeline after August 2005.

One of the most important is clearly FPICon resulting in broad community support, particularly given the ambiguities surrounding this concept and the fact that its interpretation and utility may be strengthened and enhanced through practice in implementation or the opposite may be the case. The board of the Bank also committed to conducting a review of the first three years of implementation of OP 4.10, which will be carried out sometime in mid- to late-2008. Bearing in mind that some indigenous peoples are opposed to and reject any engagement with the WBG, suggestions relating to OP 4.10 include: \u25a0 Ensuring that indigenous organizations, peoples and communities that are concerned with or may be affected by Bank projects are well informed about the requirements of OP 4.10 (and inter-connected OPs such as OP 4.01 on environmental assessment) and are able to insist that projects are at least consistent therewith. This is best done through direct training and the development of simple explanations of or guides to the Bank and its OPs with a special emphasis on OP 4.10. This training process should not treat Bank policy and projects in isolation from international human rights standards applicable to indigenous peoples; \u25a0 Establishing national and regional \u2018working groups\u2019 or the like to systematically identify and track Bank projects applying OP 4.10 with the aim of providing well documented inputs to the three year review of the OP agreed to by the board. In the same vein, these groups could advocate, together with indigenous peoples from other regions, for full indigenous participation in the three year review; \u25a0 Consistent with statements made to the UN Permanent Forum, advocating that the Bank establish or cooperate with mechanisms \u201cwhich will guarantee the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in discussing and defining the meaning and application of conducting free prior and informed consultation and ascertaining broad community support with the Bank\u2019s management, legal counsel, and task teams.\u201d One mechanism that the Bank could cooperate with in this respect is the UN Permanent Forum itself, which has begun work on FPIC methodology and mainstreaming FPIC in UN system activities pertaining to indigenous peoples; \u25a0 Irrespective of whether the Bank agrees to the preceding point, it is important for indigenous peoples, nationally, regionally and globally to proactively seek to define FPICon and broad community support in ways that are consistent with indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional (or otherwise prevailing and accepted) methods of collective World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 87 4 decision making and use these \u2018definitions\u2019 both as a means of working with affected communities/peoples and as a way of influencing government and Bank understanding and implementation of the concept in Bank-financed projects; \u25a0 With regard to the last point above and in general, it is important to identify those in government with primary responsibility for Bank projects and policy issues and attempt to influence their thinking. In some cases, this may be helped by involving national agencies and bodies responsible for indigenous issues or even legislative committees or other bodies in any dialogue. The wisdom of such an approach is very much dependent however on local political and other realities; \u25a0 In principle, Bank-funded project have to respect national laws. In some countries, national laws contain higher levels of protection for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights than OP 4.10. The Philippines\u2019 Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights Act is one such law, requiring FPIC and having, at least on paper, much higher protections for land and resource rights as the trigger for FPIC. In such countries, particular attention is required to assessing projects in relation to higher national legal standards in addition to OP 4.10 and in this sense it may be important to develop tailored training materials that focus on this aspect of Bank projects; \u25a0 A working relationship with the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Unit at the Bank could also be useful in relation to all of the above as well as in general; \u25a0 Where a Bank project fails to adhere to the broad community support requirement or fails to apply the concept in an adequate manner, consideration could be given, where applicable, to filing a formal complaint with the Inspection Panel to seek a formal ruling on the nature and content of the concept (the risk would be that the Inspection Panel interprets the concept restrictively); \u25a0 Continue to provide input to and seek recommendations from the UN Permanent Forum with regard to the activities of Bank and interpretation and implementation of OP 4.10.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "342a7a2b-2b91-477b-bdf9-16d275e8fa70": {"__data__": {"id_": "342a7a2b-2b91-477b-bdf9-16d275e8fa70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee293dcc6454b6e4a4c93b18439d928b2ddd0e34594f98f9e8db47c3b5317891"}}, "hash": "ee293dcc6454b6e4a4c93b18439d928b2ddd0e34594f98f9e8db47c3b5317891", "text": "Regional caucuses are the norm at the Permanent Forum and therefore, consideration can be given to formulating a regional position on OP 4.10 for discussion in the Asian caucus.

This makes it difficult to state concrete suggestions other than ones that pertain to the process of further elaborating the draft text and eventually its approval, or ones that apply to issues that almost certainly will appear in the final policy. Some of these are similar to those discussed above in relation to OP 4.10. I will begin with process issues: \u25a0 While there is not much time to do so, it is still important to submit national and regional statements expressing indigenous peoples\u2019 views on the IFC policy framework.

Comments to Executive Directors should be submitted not only to Asian Executive Directors but to all the Executive Directors, and could focus on the lack of meaningful consultations with indigenous peoples as well as flaws with the substance. It is also important to raise these issues with Permanent Forum members and ask that they reiterate concerns to the IFC and others; Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 88 4 \u25a0 The Equator Banks have a working group on the IFC policy revision process that provides input to the process as well as assesses implications for the Banks themselves. It is important to consider direct engagement with this group in order to seek strengthening of policy standards when these are incorporated into the common standards employed by the banks. This can be done using largely the same analysis as that employed for the IFC policy and in cooperation with sympathetic organizations monitoring the Equator Banks, such as the Bank Track Network. It is important to recall that these banks provide substantially more private sector financing than the IFC does and have expressed a willingness to address gaps in the IFC policy when they formulate or finalize their own standards; \u25a0 The points proposed in the section on OP 4.10 could all also apply to the IFC policy once adopted. B. Project level Projects present some of the same issues that were raised above in relation to policies \u2013 after all the policies apply primarily to projects \u2013 as well as some different issues. Interpretation and application of broad community support is one very important issue in relation to projects and policies, for instance. There will also be differences in the way an IFC project may be approached compared to a Bank project given that the former invariably involves private sector actors. Key suggestions include: \u25a0 Providing support to national and regional organizations to develop staff capacity to identify, advise affected communities on and monitor WBG-financed projects from as early in the project cycle as possible. Identifying projects early in the cycle is critical to success in influencing project design and subsequent implementation. A good understanding of the internal project processing cycle within the Bank is very important in this respect. As the project is designed through interactions between the government and the Bank, interventions should be addressed to both the Bank and government, although it may be strategic or, in some cases, the only option to focus more on the Bank and its compliance with safeguard policies \u2013 the only real means of holding the WBG accountable \u2013 if the government is inaccessible or unreceptive; \u25a0 Consultants are usually employed in the design of projects and it is also therefore important to try to identify and communicate with consultants, particularly those specifically addressing indigenous peoples\u2019 issues and legal issues; \u25a0 It is also important to identify the full range of financers in WBG-funded projects, whether they have policies of their own and to what extent these apply to the project in question. It is also important to communicate concerns to all of the donors involved as one may raise issues with the Bank or the government and can assist in influencing the project in this way. It is not uncommon for certain donors to take and act on more supportive positions in relation to indigenous peoples\u2019 rights than the WBG and the government or client and this possibility should not be ignored; World Bank, International Finance Corporation and Indigenous Peoples in Asia 89 4 \u25a0 In IFC projects,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3f511e7-9605-427e-bc0f-3b2c0019dc8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3f511e7-9605-427e-bc0f-3b2c0019dc8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20b05a8ece1f406d47ebfd3d3b80c6a1d31659e0473dc67fb7fd7345cf1640d8"}}, "hash": "20b05a8ece1f406d47ebfd3d3b80c6a1d31659e0473dc67fb7fd7345cf1640d8", "text": "it is important to identify company policies that may apply to indigenous peoples and also compare these to project criteria and performance. The company may also be a member of an industry group that has policies that can be raised, for instance, the International Business Leaders Forum or the International Council on Metals and Mining. These policies, with the exception of company policies, are almost always voluntary and therefore of limited utility. Pressure can also be brought to bear on companies through shareholder meetings and through investor groupings with an interest in the company; \u25a0 Finally, where national legal systems provide adequate remedies, strategic litigation against WBG projects could form part of an overall strategy for addressing deficits in rights protection. While domestic remedies may not always be sufficient to achieve adequate rights protection, litigation may nonetheless be useful as a means of exhausting local remedies for the purposes of having the case reviewed by an international human rights body. This option, however, is only available to indigenous peoples in those countries that have ratified the relevant human rights instruments and/or accepted the jurisdiction of human rights bodies to receive complaints. This is an important strategic option over and above addressing specific cases because building a body of jurisprudence demonstrating that rights violations occur in WBG-projects strengthens the argument that OPs are inadequate and require strengthening and that the WBG in general needs to better address human rights issues throughout its operations. While cases may not be brought against the Bank directly \u2013 it enjoys immunity from domestic legal action \u2013 they may nonetheless be brought against the government in relation to the same Bank-financed project and therefore decisions may apply by association to the Bank as well. The IFC is not necessarily immune and can be sued in countries where it maintains a country office. IFC clients may also be sued in domestic venues as may host governments for failure to protect indigenous peoples from violations perpetrated by corporations. In either case, where applicable, international complaints may then be filed once domestic remedies have been exhausted. C. Programmatic level Addressing issues at the programmatic level is a great deal more complicated than it is at either the policy or project levels. This is especially the case as many programmatic loans are not well publicized, if at all, and are not subject to the safeguard policies applying to indigenous peoples including the participation requirements set out therein. The main suggestion with regard to programmatic lending is to try and identify these loans and raise concerns before they are approved or otherwise at the earliest stage possible and to lobby both the government and the Bank to ensure that indigenous peoples are involved in decision making. A Framework for Advocacy in Support of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Visions, Perspectives and Strategies for Self-Determining Development Victoria Tauli-Corpuz 5 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 92 5 1 See Paragraph 12 of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues Report on Fourth Session (16-27 May 2005), E/2005/43 and E/C.19/2005/9. p. 4. 2 This refers to a review of some projects funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development that were implemented in indigenous peoples\u2019 territories in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Northeast India. 3 It was seen that lessons learned from implementing specific projects were not used in a systematic manner to bring about changes in government policies on development work done among indigenous peoples. The case studies will be made available soon on the website of the Permanent Forum. 4 This is a conclusion that emerged from analysis of some MDG national reports and Country PRSPs, which were done by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 5 See UN E/C.19/2005/2. Report of Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues on its 2004 Session (14 Feb. 2004). p. 20. I. Introduction The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues urges States, the United Nations (UN) system and other intergovernmental organizations to \u201csupport the efforts of indigenous peoples to build, articulate and implement their visions of and strategies for development.\u201d1 In this light, the establishment of appropriate policy and institutional frameworks was identified as an important component of such efforts. Likewise, a review of good development practices of projects in support of indigenous peoples came up with a similar recommendation.2 The review noted that supporting specific projects for indigenous peoples that reinforce development as determined by them is a necessary but insufficient measure.3 It is crucial to complement these projects with advocacy work from the local to the global levels to foster greater understanding", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5ca7d65-7e8b-405a-804d-3330c250e2c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5ca7d65-7e8b-405a-804d-3330c250e2c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "143566230f97968558610bbb2732f9f94264594549cd613055464a299f402f62"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1f0ce01-b65f-408a-8dcc-16213a9c744e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ab5e67bc407b40a75d8277b71a79e167febb9b36d6391c5d45d8077ee980e3f"}}, "hash": "7a275f0259dec968c251f84b2ed52cad737c21da8e73aaf28283b8eef54da1dd", "text": "and support for indigenous peoples\u2019 self-determining development. The development model of international financial institutions, the UN system and bilateral and multilateral donors is generally regarded by indigenous peoples as more of a problem than a solution. This is mainly because this development model ignores and undermines indigenous peoples\u2019 natural resource management systems, and indigenous economies and traditional livelihoods that have sustained them through generations. Furthermore, they are not consulted nor involved in making decisions on development projects brought to their communities. At worst, violations of their basic human rights take place in the development process and this phenomenon has been labelled by them as \u201cdevelopment aggression\u201d. Even new platforms, such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) fail to take indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and issues into account.4 The challenge, therefore, is to bring about development with a strong social and cultural dimension, which promotes respect for the basic human rights of indigenous peoples and which integrates their own development visions. The Inter-Agency Support Group (IASG) in their statement on indigenous peoples and the MDGs said that: the main challenge is to interpret and qualify the Millennium Development Goals as related to the rights and priorities of indigenous peoples in a way that is relevant and attributes to indigenous peoples a sense of ownership in the process, and to articulate the Millennium Development Goals within the framework of international human rights standards.5 A Framework for Advocacy 93 5 6 Some policies of intergovernmental organizations and international financial institutions policies include the following: the UNDP Policy of Engagement with Indigenous Peoples (2001), the World Bank OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples which superseded the OD 4.20, the Asian Development Bank Policy on Indigenous Peoples, the Inter-American Development Bank Draft Strategic Framework for Indigenous Development, European Union 1998 Council Resolution in Support of Indigenous Peoples, etc. Examples of policies of bilateral donors are as follows: Strategy for Danish Support to Indigenous Peoples (1994), Netherlands: National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation\u2019s Recommendation on Indigenous Peoples (1993), Germany: Policy for Development Cooperation for Indigenous Peoples in Latin America (1996), United Kingdom: Guidance on Ethnicity, Ethnic Minorities and Indigenous Peoples (1995), Spain: Strategy for Co-operation with Indigenous Peoples in Latin America (1997), Spanish Strategy for Co-operation with Indigenous Peoples (2005). 7 ILO Convention No. 169 has been ratified by 17 States as of 2005.These are Mexico, Denmark, Ecuador, Fiji, Norway, Venezuela, Argentina, Costa Rica, Colombia, Honduras, Peru, The Netherlands, Guatemala, Bolivia, Dominica, Paraguay, Brazil and Panama. 8 See Annex II \u201cStatement adopted by the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues regarding indigenous peoples and the Millennium Development Goals,\u201d E/C.19/2005/2. p.11. While the MDGs are just a subset of a broader development framework, this can provide the springboard upon which indigenous peoples\u2019 development can be further reinforced and debated. Within the past two decades there have been positive developments in the areas of standard-setting on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and the formulation of policies by intergovernmental bodies, international financial institutions and bilateral donors on indigenous peoples development.6 This includes existing legally binding international standards on indigenous peoples rights that are stated in ILO Convention 107 and ILO Convention No. 1697 and the emerging standard which is the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It also includes policies on indigenous peoples\u2019 development which came out from the World Bank, donor agencies and UN programmes like the UNDP. In May 2003 the Interagency Workshop on the Human Rights-based Approach came up with a document entitled \u201cThe Human Rights Based Approach to Development Cooperation: Towards a Common Understanding Among UN Agencies\u201d. Since the international financial institutions (IFIs) and the donor community are key players in development work among indigenous peoples, it is the hope of indigenous peoples that these entities will use the human rights-based approach as a guiding framework in their development work. The World Bank is a specialized UN Agency but the other IFIs and bilateral donors are not. So it cannot be assumed that these bodies are part of this common understanding. Nevertheless, as this is an approach which resonates significantly with indigenous peoples\u2019 own views and perspectives on development, the IFIs and bilateral donors should endeavour to use this also as their guiding framework.

Poverty studies on indigenous peoples done by IFIs and other intergovernmental organizations during the past two decades confirm that most poverty maps still coincide with indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples compose around 5 percent of the world\u2019s population but represent 15 percent of the world\u2019s poor. In many countries they are the poorest of the poor. Studies conducted in several countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia show that most indigenous peoples are in situations of pervasive, chronic and severe poverty. The most recent World Bank study, presented during the Fourth Session of the UN Permanent Forum, was on the indigenous poverty situation in five Latin American countries.9 It looked at the changes in the poverty situation of indigenous peoples during the International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People (1994-2004). Some of the study\u2019s conclusions are as follows: \u25a0 Few gains were made in income poverty reduction among indigenous peoples during the Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Decade (1994-2004); \u25a0 Indigenous peoples recover more slowly from economic crisis.10 A policy environment that successfully brings about poverty reduction for the population at large may not equally benefit indigenous peoples; \u25a0 The indigenous poverty gap is deeper and shrank more slowly over the l990s; \u25a0 Being indigenous increases an individual\u2019s probability of being poor and this relationship was about the same at the beginning and at the close of the Decade; \u25a0 Education outcomes are substantially worse for indigenous peoples, indicative of problems in education quality; \u25a0 There is systemic evidence of worse health conditions among indigenous peoples. Indigenous women and children continue to have lesser access to basic health services; therefore, major differences in indigenous and non-indigenous health indicators persist. While these conclusions were reached from studies in Latin America, similar trends can be gleaned from other studies such as the one made by the International Labour Organization (ILO).11 The ILO did an ethnic audit of the PRSPs of 14 countries.12 One conclusion reached is that \u201cmost of the PRSPs recognize that poverty is widespread and persistent among indigenous and tribal peoples or in those areas prevalently occupied by them.\u201d This study also shows that the serious lack of reliable, up-to-date statistics and disaggregated data is 9 See Gillete Hall and Harry Anthony Patrinos (2005), Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America: 1994-2004. Unpublished manuscript. The countries included in the study were Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru. 10 This is confirmed by findings of the International Fund on Agricultural Development in studies done in the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis and also after the tsunami. 11 See Manuela Tomei (2005). Indigenous and Tribal Peoples: An Ethnic Audit of Selected Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.

A Framework for Advocacy 95 5 a major factor in the disjuncture between poverty diagnostics and poverty-reduction strategies addressing indigenous peoples. A similar observation was presented by the IASG. It stated: A review of the Millennium Development Goal progress reports in countries that have significant populations of indigenous peoples reveals that few are undertaking the effort needed to provide specific information and disaggregated data on the poverty of indigenous peoples.13 Clearly, there is a need to undertake similar poverty studies among indigenous peoples in other regions. Future studies, however, should go deeper into identifying the structural causes of indigenous poverty, develop appropriate indicators and come up with relevant recommendations for future action. It is increasingly recognized that indigenous peoples remain poor, not because they do not have the resources or knowledge to change their situation, but because they have been denied of their rights to have control and access to their resources and protection of their traditional knowledge. The IASG aptly summarized this point: As the result of various historical processes, indigenous peoples have often been excluded from political participation in the States in which they live and their rights to land and resources are seldom recognized. Indigenous peoples also suffer disproportionately from human rights abuses and the effects of conflict.

They are subjected to discrimination by state authorities and also by the elite and dominant populations. This is more felt by the poor, however, as poverty exacerbates discrimination. The reports of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People confirm the appalling poverty situation of indigenous peoples, which is closely interlinked with the continuing violations of their basic human rights. In his report presented to the General Assembly in September 2005 the Rapporteur concluded: \u2026this complex panorama of persistent poverty is rooted in the conditions of destitution, discrimination and structural inequality \u2026and such multidimensional poverty cannot be overcome through a piecemeal approach; rather, it requires comprehensive public policies, which most States and multinational agencies unfortunately have not yet developed for indigenous peoples.15 13 See \u201cTechnical Position Paper prepared by the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues on the Millennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples,\u201d Annex III of UN E/C.19/2005/2. 14 Ibid. p. 15, paragraph 6. 15 See United Nations General Assembly Document A/60/358, 16 September 2005, The Situation of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of Indigenous People. p. 10. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 96 5 16 See Annex III of E/C.19/2005/2. In some areas where indigenous peoples are vigorously asserting their rights, conflict situations emerge. Some of these conflicts are intractable and remain unresolved. Development assistance has had both positive and negative contributions in the resolution or exacerbation of such conflicts. There are conflicts in indigenous territories that have been ended through political settlements, but post-conflict programmes have not yet adequately addressed the reasons why such conflicts came about in the first place. Effective mechanisms that can provide redress for the injustice and human rights violations committed against indigenous peoples in the name of national development are not yet in place. The realization of human rights requires recognition of conflicts between competing rights and the design of mechanisms for negotiation and conflict-resolution. It is important to acknowledge that there are various efforts on the part of intergovernmental organizations, NGOs and some governments to support self- determining development priorities of indigenous peoples. Some even helped set up mechanisms for negotiating conflicts between competing rights. However, there are not enough of these to significantly change the poverty situations of indigenous peoples. More widespread replication of such experiences within countries is very much needed so that these will not remain as isolated or exceptional cases. More effective communication strategies should also be implemented so that such experiences and the lessons learned can be shared more widely. It is within this context the advocacy framework has been developed. This framework is in support of indigenous peoples\u2019 visions, strategies and perspectives on development. It draws substantially from the Technical position paper prepared by the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues on the Millennium Development Goals and indigenous peoples,16 which was submitted during the Fourth Session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. The ideas presented here, which include proposed areas of work, are drawn from various discussions with indigenous peoples and with other development actors from intergovernmental bodies and NGOs. An Annex which further elaborates on the points raised in the main paper is included. III. Objective and basic underlying principles Objective: \u25a0 To advocate for development that reflects indigenous peoples\u2019 own vision, perspectives and strategies of self-determining development within the framework of respect for their basic human rights and fundamental freedoms and to effectively monitor this using indicators that are sensitive and relevant to their specific conditions. The basic normative framework upon which an advocacy for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development is grounded upon is international human rights law as enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenants on Civil and A Framework for Advocacy 97 5 17 This includes the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965; Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, l979; Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989; International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, l990; among others. 18 While the UN Draft Declaration on Indigenous Peoples Rights still remain as a Draft and, therefore, does not have the same status as the other Conventions, it is regarded as an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea49016d-2389-454b-a6ec-b81426a27f54": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea49016d-2389-454b-a6ec-b81426a27f54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00740ca56a6a47e6d2e40d7d0de4a386c08c5554dd23c3a97cecc90f44d23b9f"}}, "hash": "00740ca56a6a47e6d2e40d7d0de4a386c08c5554dd23c3a97cecc90f44d23b9f", "text": "emerging standard on the rights of indigenous peoples and it has been cited and used as a basis for the formulation of existing intergovernmental policies and national laws (e.g. 1997 Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of the Philippines). 19 See \u201cThe Human Rights Based Approach to Development Cooperation: Towards a Common Understanding Among UN Agencies.\u201d Available at www.undp.org/governance/dochurist/031616/CommonUnderstanding.doc 20 Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as other core human rights treaties.17 States which ratified the core human rights instruments are legally bound to respect, protect, promote, and work towards the realization of these. The ILO Convention No. 169 and the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples18, decisions of treaty bodies, Declarations and Plans of Actions of World Conferences and Summits (e.g. Agenda 21, Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action, Johannesburg Declaration, Beijing Plan of Action, etc.) form part of this normative framework. The key principles which underpin such a framework are the following: 1. Human rights-based approach to development The basic premise of this approach is that development should enable people to live in dignity and to attain the highest standards of humanity guaranteed by international human rights law. A statement of UN Agencies on how they understand the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation19 provides, among other points, that: \u25a0 All programmes of development cooperation, policies and technical assistance should further the realization of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. \u25a0 Human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process. \u25a0 Development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of \u2018duty bearers\u2019 to meet their obligations and of \u2018rights-holders\u2019 to claim their rights. 2. Non-discrimination and equality The fundamental principles of international human rights law are equality and non- discrimination. This explicitly prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.20 All individuals are equal as human beings and by virtue of the inherent dignity of each human person. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 98 5 3. Respect for individual and collective rights Indigenous peoples possess collective rights that are indispensable for their existence, well-being and holistic development as peoples. These include the right to self- determination, right to territories, lands and resources, and right to culture, among others. Individual rights of indigenous persons as enshrined in international human rights law should likewise be respected. 4. Self-determination The right to self-determination is a fundamental right of all peoples, including indigenous peoples. It is the basis for the broader recognition of their right to have control over their institutions, territories, resources, and cultures without external domination or interference; their right to freely pursue their own economic, social and cultural development and to establish their relationship with the dominant society and the State on the basis of consent.21 5. Empowerment The international normative framework empowers indigenous peoples by granting them rights; thus, it is imperative to make them aware of their rights. It also means enhancing the capabilities of indigenous women and men to assert their rights and claim their entitlements in a democratic and equitable manner. The human rights-based development approach is aimed at the empowerment of people and therefore it rejects the welfare or charity approach. Creating spaces and mechanisms which allow for their full and effective participation in decision-making is a key component. 6. Free, prior and informed consent The principle of free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples to development projects and plans affecting them, is emerging as a standard to be applied in protecting and promoting their rights in the development process.22 Mechanisms should be established which ensure that indigenous peoples are able to give their free, prior and informed consent to activities affecting them, using processes that take into account their own methods of consultation and decision-making. 7. Gender equality Ensuring equality between genders is crucial for indigenous development. Particular attention has to be given to gender differences and inequalities. Gender equality ensures that the rights and voices of women and men are heard and that differentiated approaches and responses are adopted to address gender discrimination and inequalities. Gender equality should be promoted as a basic norm in the political, social and economic fields. 21 This right is contained in common Article 1 of the International Covenant on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88931bb1-3353-4c46-ab35-d3338315bd85": {"__data__": {"id_": "88931bb1-3353-4c46-ab35-d3338315bd85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "439e220d938707d7c975e58e5c39041b34b1d1b1606a58cefa40c7dab7d98d10"}}, "hash": "439e220d938707d7c975e58e5c39041b34b1d1b1606a58cefa40c7dab7d98d10", "text": "Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well as Article 3 of the UN Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 22 Article 7 (1) of the ILO Convention No. 169 recognizes that indigenous peoples \u201cshall have the right to decide their own priorities for the process of development as it affects their lives, beliefs, institutions and spiritual well-being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use, and to exercise control, to the extent possible, over their own economic, social and cultural development. In addition, they shall participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly.\u201d A Framework for Advocacy 99 5 8. Accountability and establishing legal obligations and duties on States States and other duty-bearers are answerable for the observance of human rights and they have to comply with the legal norms and standards enshrined in human rights instruments. When they fail to do so, aggrieved rights-holders are entitled to institute proceedings for appropriate redress before a competent court or other adjudicators in accordance with the rules and procedures provided by law.23 9. Respect for cultural diversity, cultural identity and indigenous knowledge An advocacy framework for development, which will have relevance for indigenous peoples, has to have strong cultural underpinnings. It should respect their distinct cultural identities and ensure their control over their own diverse economic, political and socio-cultural systems. Indigenous knowledge systems, which evolved through generations and which are used for the common good, should be protected and developed to prevent appropriation and commercialization by others without indigenous peoples\u2019 free, prior and informed consent. 10.Sustainability The balance between economic, social and environment objectives should guide any development process related to indigenous peoples. IV. Capacity-building and communication strategies Advocacy is understood as a continuous process of influencing or changing policies, frameworks, laws, and programmes of institutions, groups and individuals who are in positions of power, towards the betterment of affected peoples. In this case, we are talking about a framework for advocacy that will lead to a better understanding, respect and support of indigenous peoples\u2019 perspectives and strategies for self-determining development. It also involves collecting and packaging information into a persuasive case and communicating these to decision-makers and potential supporters, including the general public. This means developing and effectively using interpersonal relationships and the media which includes modern information and communication technologies. Each advocacy actor should give consideration to adopting a series of capacity-building and communications strategies, capitalizing on the opportunities offered by the Second International Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous People and the Millennium Declaration, including the MDGs. These can be along the following lines: 1. Build awareness and undertake sensitization activities for high-officials, senior management and staff of key bodies involved in development work, such as international financial institutions, the UN system and other multilateral bodies. 23 Ibid. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 100 5 It is fundamental to build awareness on the rights and situation of indigenous peoples among high officials, senior management and staff of these bodies from the country level to the international level. This sensitization process can also lead to a better understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 issues, perspectives and strategies on development, in general, and their critiques and recommendations on the MDGs, in particular. Forms and methods of sensitization vary depending on the roles and responsibilities of these persons. With high officials and senior management experts, the Permanent Forum can seek audiences with them to discuss such issues. For staff directly dealing with indigenous peoples, it is important to raise their awareness on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and international human rights law; existing policies and laws on indigenous peoples on the national level; recommendations and relevant documents of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, as well as other existing policies on indigenous peoples of multilateral and bilateral organizations. It is important to popularize the document \u201cThe Human Rights-Based Approach to Development Cooperation: Towards a Common Understanding among UN Agencies\u201d so that it will be better internalized. The operationalization of this approach remains the biggest challenge. Personnel of aforementioned institutions should work in close partnership with indigenous peoples to operationalize the human rights-based approach to indigenous peoples\u2019 development. Mechanisms can be created for sustained dialogues and discussions between these development actors and indigenous peoples so more concrete steps can be taken towards better integration of indigenous peoples\u2019 perspectives and strategies on development 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7acf814-d037-415f-aa78-cba1f0f084ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7acf814-d037-415f-aa78-cba1f0f084ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "639b16dd76c5b909efbbcdcc81304d94612c9c1297a18fd703013ca0c6952f89"}}, "hash": "639b16dd76c5b909efbbcdcc81304d94612c9c1297a18fd703013ca0c6952f89", "text": "Analyse and assess existing institutional development frameworks, policies, instruments, programmes and projects affecting indigenous peoples. Personnel of IFIs and IASG members can make an analysis of their institution\u2019s frameworks, policies, programmes and projects to see how these are consistent or contradictory to indigenous peoples\u2019 visions, perspectives and strategies on development. They can also review and evaluate their existing projects and programmes in indigenous peoples\u2019 communities to gather good practices and lessons learned. Recommendations on how to upscale good practices and how to advocate for relevant changes in existing frameworks, policies, programmes and projects can be evolved and implemented. Sharing of analysis and studies between them can be facilitated and common recommendations on what can be done to make frameworks, policies, programmes and projects more supportive of indigenous peoples can be evolved. The key principles identified in this document can be used as guides in this endeavour. For agencies with specific policies on indigenous peoples, reviews and evaluations done on the monitoring, implementation or revision of these policies can also be shared and discussed. Results of these analyses and studies can be presented in relevant processes of the agencies, i.e. Governing Council meetings, Executive Committee meetings, Inter-agency processes, Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, etc. These results can also be the basis for advocating changes in the development frameworks, policies, programmes and projects to be more relevant and appropriate for indigenous peoples or for creating new policies and programmes. A Framework for Advocacy 101 5 3. Establish partnerships with indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations, experts, NGOs and bilateral donors for mutual support in advocacy work. For the two components above, it is important to work in partnership with indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations and experts, NGOs, other agencies, bilateral donors and States. Awareness-building and analytical evaluations can be done jointly with the various actors. Effort should be exerted to ensure that indigenous peoples are effectively participating in these processes. Partnership-building includes enhancing the capacities of indigenous peoples to do advocacy work themselves. This includes indigenous people developing an understanding of the nature, mechanisms and processes of the IFIs, the UN system and the donor community and providing them with training, toolkits, etc. so that they can effectively lobby governments and intergovernmental bodies. This also means openly sharing with them the lessons learned and good practices in development work in indigenous territories and involving them directly in reviews and evaluations of policies, programmes and projects. 4. Provide appropriate technical assistance and capacity-building activities to member states. One of the primary roles of the IFIs and IASG members is to support their member states through technical assistance, capacity building and funding (loans or grants). They can consider how this support could be geared towards increasing their members\u2019 capacities to comply with their legal and moral obligations to international human rights standards and environmental laws. This means increasing their capacities to promote and respect the basic rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples and to understand and support indigenous peoples\u2019 development perspectives and priorities. This also means supporting them to amend or redesign existing laws, frameworks, policies, programmes and projects that are discriminatory to indigenous people; or helping to establish laws, policies or programmes that promote indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and priorities for development. It can also mean strengthening the capacities of national machinery responsible for human rights, indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, women and children\u2019s rights, among others, to be more effective in implementing their mandates. The review of MDG implementation, poverty reduction strategies, Common Country Assessments/UN Development Assistance Framework to see how these have integrated indigenous peoples\u2019 concerns is another area where IFIs and IASG members can help governments and indigenous peoples. 5. Develop training modules and toolkits and undertake training activities on indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, perspectives and strategies on self-determining development and how to use existing policies on indigenous peoples. To be able to effectively address the points raised above, it is important that the IFIs, bilateral and multilateral donors and IASG members share with each other the policies, guidebooks, toolkits or training materials and modules that they have developed. Training activities among IFI staff, UN staff, government bureaucrats, NGOs and even indigenous peoples can be undertaken using existing modules and toolkits. Programmes like HURIST (Human Rights Strengthening (a joint programme between UNDP and OHCHR)), ILO training programmes for its staff, can be replicated by other agencies. The development and use of guidebooks by the IFIs on how to implement their policies on indigenous peoples should be done as soon as possible. Both indigenous peoples and governments should be familiarized with these policies, toolkits and guidebooks.

Enhance and institutionalize support for indigenous peoples\u2019 priorities and strategies on self-determining development. IFIs, bilateral and multilateral donors and UN agencies may further strengthen, institutionalize and systematize their support for indigenous peoples through the enhancement of support for focal points on indigenous issues. Mechanisms for coordination on indigenous issues within an institution or agency and in between these entities, and existing units solely addressing indigenous peoples\u2019 issues (i.e. Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Team in the OHCHR, Indigenous Team in the Convention on Biological Diversity, etc.) should also be given more support in terms of personnel and funds. Those agencies that do not have such mechanisms are encouraged to set these up as soon as possible. The Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues is a very innovative development. So far, its operations have been very important for indigenous peoples. The members of the IASG should explore further how they can implement the recommendations arising out of the Permanent Forum that specifically addressed indigenous peoples. Further discussions should be undertaken with Permanent Forum members on the constraints and potentials in implementing these recommendations. Communication plans on the work of each agency on indigenous issues, as well as on the work of the IASG, should be developed. The IASG, together with the Permanent Forum members and governments, can explore further how to advocate effectively, giving more attention to indigenous peoples\u2019 issues at the Economic and Social Council and at the General Assembly. The IASG members can also undertake the dissemination of reports of agencies dealing with indigenous peoples in a more systematic and wide-scale fashion. The IASG has expanded its membership to include not only UN bodies, organizations and programmes but also multilateral bodies, such as the European Commission and other funding mechanisms like the Indigenous Fund of Latin America. More IFIs, in addition to the World Bank, should also be invited to become part of this IASG. 7. Support efforts of indigenous peoples to further elaborate their vision, framework and strategies for self-determining development. While there are scattered efforts by indigenous peoples, NGOs and some intergovernmental agencies to articulate and put into writing indigenous peoples\u2019 visions and strategies on development, there has not been an organized effort to bring these efforts together and to come up with a consolidated framework. The IFIs, bilateral and multilateral donors and the IASG can support the efforts of indigenous peoples to do this. 8. Develop effective communication strategies. It is important to effectively communicate the work of each agency on indigenous issues to their own decision-makers and also to the general public. Opportunities to present these in appropriate processes and bodies, such as the meetings of the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, Governing Council or Executive Board meetings, among others, should be maximized. Focal persons on indigenous issues should be appointed where they do not exist. To be more efficient in their work, which includes implementation of communication plans, the focal persons should not be unduly burdened with other tasks. Communication plans can include the A Framework for Advocacy 103 5 organization of exhibits, panels or roundtable discussions where examples of indigenous peoples\u2019 development visions, strategies and initiatives are discussed and debated with others. The facilitation of exposure trips of government officials to areas where there are good practices on indigenous peoples\u2019 development can also be undertaken. Proper documentation of such good practices that make use of multimedia can be done so that these can be communicated more widely. V. Conclusions This framework for advocacy is a work in progress. It is meant to initiate discussion and debate on the challenges and opportunities in advocating for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights and development. It recognizes the critical role of the IFIs, the bilateral and multilateral donors and the UN system in such advocacy efforts. It underscores the need to ensure the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples not only in doing advocacy work but in decision-making processes on policies, programmes and projects which affect them. Advocacy work for indigenous peoples\u2019 development with governments, intergovernmental bodies, and non-government actors has to be guided by the human rights-based approach. Much more work has to be done to further elaborate and effectively implement this approach for indigenous peoples. This challenge has to be seriously addressed. It is hoped that when the Second Decade of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples ends in 2015, significant positive impacts in terms of changing the face of indigenous peoples\u2019 poverty and reinforcement of their self-determining economic, social, cultural and political development are achieved.

CHAPTER 5 ANNEX: Further elaboration of key areas of work Note \u2013 this is a preliminary indicative list. Some parts are more developed than others. It is a work in progress, so more suggestions for improvement are welcome. 1. Elaborate and operationalize the human rights-based approach for indigenous peoples\u2019 self-determining development. Since the adoption of the human rights-based approach in 1999 (CCA/UNDAF)24 there has been an increasing recognition that it has to be applied. However, its implementation and operationalization in relation to indigenous peoples is not happening in any significant manner. This is an approach and a framework that speaks of the realities and aspirations of indigenous peoples. It is imperative, therefore, to develop and implement a human rights-based approach specifically for indigenous peoples\u2019 development. This can be done jointly by the IFIs, bilateral and multilateral donor bodies and the UN system, states and indigenous peoples. The human-rights based approach cannot be fully implemented unless it includes the understanding of indigenous peoples\u2019 self-determining development. Some activities which can be undertaken are as follows: 1.1. Support for indigenous peoples to make reports on their actual experiences with respect to the enjoyment and denial of their human rights and fundamental freedoms within a given state, using as a yardstick the international human rights norms and standards. 1.2. Identification of steps that States are obliged to take, in order to comply with their legal obligations under international law, and with their political commitments in international conferences. 1.3. Technical assistance for governments to build their capacities and political will in meeting their obligations. 1.4. Assistance for indigenous organizations and communities to raise their own awareness on their fundamental human rights; to build their capacity to act together to assert these rights; to recognize and act upon the policies, laws and practices of government and international institutions that play a role in their impoverishment; and to get states to comply with their obligations. 1.5. Support efforts towards the early adoption of a United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as this is a crucial part of the normative framework for a human rights-based development approach for them. 1.6. Develop a consolidated document on \u201cThe human rights-based approach to development and indigenous peoples\u201d. This can be developed by the Permanent Forum jointly with indigenous peoples and government experts, IFIs, bilateral and multilateral donors and the Inter-Agency Support Group. 1.7. Undertake case studies of good practices of IFIs and UN agencies in terms of operationalizing the human rights-based approach for indigenous peoples. 1.8. Analyse various existing development frameworks and approaches (i.e. sustainable livelihoods approach, people-centred development approaches, human rights-based approach to development, gender approach, development with identity, development with culture, life projects, etc.). Review policies of donor agencies and intergovernmental bodies (i.e. Strategy for Danish Support to Indigenous Peoples, UNDP Policy of Engagement with Indigenous Peoples, WB OD 4.10, ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples, etc.). Strengthen the good elements that can reinforce indigenous peoples\u2019 self-determining development and reform the weak or negative parts. 1.9. Undertake participatory processes with representatives of indigenous organizations, governments and intergovernmental bodies to discuss how to further support self-determining development of indigenous peoples. A Framework for Advocacy 105 5 2. Collect disaggregated data on indigenous peoples and develop indicators sensitive to the situation of indigenous peoples. The lack of disaggregated data based on ethnicity precludes an accurate assessment of where indigenous peoples are, who and how many they are, what their living conditions are, situations of poverty, etc. The existence of such information will strengthen cases for introducing programmes and policy reforms in the various systems and processes of governments, intergovernmental bodies, and even NGOs. This includes reforms in health and education systems, economic production models, natural resources and environmental management, among others, to be more appropriate and responsive to indigenous peoples\u2019 issues and aspirations. Disaggregated statistical data is a tool for promoting relevant actions and programmes.

This means involvement of indigenous experts and organizations in all phases of statistical work from: a) development of data collection instruments, b) data collection, c) tabulation, d) analysis and e) dissemination. 2.2. Disaggregation based on ethnicity should be integrated into the data generation activities undertaken by specific government ministries or departments such as those in health, education, agriculture, labour, women, children, housing, etc. 2.3. The development of indigenous-sensitive indicators is an important component of data disaggregation. This is crucial for benchmarking, impact assessment, poverty studies, etc. and in ensuring respect for the diversity of concepts and perceptions of poverty, well-being, quality of life as well as the realization of indigenous peoples\u2019 basic economic, social and cultural rights. 3. Carry out impact assessment studies and reviews of existing policies, frameworks, strategies, programmes and policies that affect indigenous peoples. This includes comprehensive assessments of impacts on indigenous peoples of national or institutional frameworks and policies on development, poverty alleviation and social sector programmes. Develop and use indigenous peoples\u2019 expertise in conducting such assessments. Encourage all development actors to formulate and implement policies on indigenous peoples or to review and strengthen their existing policies. Some proposed activities are the following: 3.1. Undertake assessments of the social, human rights and environmental impacts of existing frameworks, policies and programmes of governments , intergovernmental agencies and institutions as these relate to the protection or denial of their basic rights to self-determination, rights to land, territories and resources, cultural rights, among others. This can include comprehensive assessments of impacts on indigenous peoples of national or institutional frameworks and policies on development, poverty alleviation, social sector programmes, etc. 3.2. Conduct impact assessments of poverty reduction, frameworks and strategies, in general, and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), in particular, to see how these either alleviate or exacerbate indigenous peoples\u2019 poverty situations. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 106 5 3.3. A review of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals from the perspective of indigenous peoples should also be undertaken. This can lead to the generation of parallel country reports on \u201cMillennium Development Goals and Indigenous Peoples\u201d, which could be presented to the fifth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 3.4. Conduct impact assessments of global, regional and bilateral rules on trade, investment and finance as they affect indigenous peoples. Increasing evidence shows that the liberalization of trade, finance and investments has direct effects on indigenous peoples. Case studies in specific countries could be done to show what these impacts are, including specific recommendations on how these should be addressed. 4. Identify and increase allocation of resources for indigenous peoples\u2019 development. Carry out budget analysis and promote participatory budgeting processes for indigenous peoples. Budget analysis is a tool that can be used to understand and advocate for better resource allocation for indigenous peoples. Such analysis can also help in assessing needs and establishing benchmarks in sectoral areas of concern to indigenous peoples, as well as directly linking these to the MDGs. The efforts and experience of the UN system and other development actors in mainstreaming gender in budgets can serve as a useful tool for indigenous related budgeting. Best practices of participatory budgeting can be used to enhance indigenous peoples\u2019 participation. It is necessary to assist governments and parliaments in using participatory budgeting processes at all levels. This also applies to intergovernmental organizations. Some proposed activities are the following: 4.1. Undertake budget analysis in some countries to identify the level of resource allocations targeted for indigenous peoples and in which areas these are used. 4.2. Develop further the concept of indigenous budgeting, using gender budgeting as a model, and evolve and disseminate this as a tool. 5. Reinforce respect and protection of indigenous peoples\u2019 rights over their lands, territories and resources. 5.1.

A Framework for Advocacy 107 5 6. Protect indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional livelihood and economic systems. Encourage the development of indigenous peoples\u2019 traditional economy and ensure food security. The acceleration of the process of alienation, privatization and commercialization of indigenous peoples\u2019 resources (including forests, lands, waters, sub-surface resources, biogenetic resources and medicinal plants) due to internal and external actors has considerably eroded the livelihood systems of indigenous peoples. In order for governments to reach the MDGs in an equitable and fair manner, systematic and concerted efforts are required to restore and enhance these systems. In the past, other interests drove innovations in indigenous peoples\u2019 communities. It is time to support indigenous peoples\u2019 innovations and to give them the say on what innovations and technologies should be developed in their communities. 7. Protect and develop indigenous knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge systems are integral to indigenous cultures, including indigenous economies. Such systems, which were developed over generation, also define indigenous peoples\u2019 identities and their management of biodiversity. These systems are valuable for humankind, yet, they are now under threat by commercial interests or other policies that deeply affect indigenous cultures and their expressions. Assisting in the protection and development of traditional knowledge, therefore, is a contribution to sustainable human development of indigenous peoples and of society, as a whole. 8. Reinforce indigenous health systems and practices and develop holistic, appropriate, accessible and affordable health services for indigenous peoples. Providing health care to indigenous peoples, at least on an equal basis as the rest of the population, is a minimum requirement. However, to go beyond this, it is important that indigenous health systems and practices be considered when developing health care delivery systems among them. 9. Revitalize, strengthen and develop indigenous teaching and learning institutions and systems and work towards reforming public and private education systems at all levels. The enhancement and revitalization of indigenous learning systems is a necessity for the survival of indigenous language, cultures and visions. It is essential to promote intercultural education in order to sensitize indigenous and non-indigenous children and youth to each other\u2019s cultural value systems. 10. Link local and national advocacy work for the promotion of indigenous rights to the global level, and link global work to the national and local. The linkages between the local and the global and vice-versa have to be strengthened so that the problems at the local and national levels will be better communicated to and understood by the international community. Issues faced by indigenous peoples at the local and national levels should inform decisions, programmes and priorities of global institutions. In the same vein, the awareness of indigenous peoples on global developments should be raised and steps to mitigate actual and potential adverse impacts should be taken. The gains achieved at the international level, especially in terms of the creation of spaces, processes and mechanisms that promote indigenous rights and development must be disseminated widely so that these can be effectively used. 10.1.Undertake education and training activities for indigenous peoples to become more aware of national and global developments. Build their capacities to occupy, engage and use more effectively existing spaces, mechanisms and processes to raise their issues and concerns. Seek redress for their complaints and get national and global institutions to be more responsive and sensitive to indigenous situations and perspectives. 10.2.Facilitate effective participation of indigenous representatives to global and regional processes (i.e. UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Commission on Human Rights, Working Group on Indigenous Populations, Organization of American States, Draft Declaration process, etc.). Geographical, gender and intergenerational balance should be ensured in choosing potential participants. Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 108 5 10.3.Encourage and support efforts of indigenous participants to disseminate more widely what they have learned in the various global processes, so that awareness on global developments will be raised and inter-linkages between local and global issues are better understood and established. 10.4.Facilitate networking among indigenous peoples. Enhance possibilities for undertaking joint activities and campaigns among them for better impact. 10.5.Develop innovative partnerships between indigenous organizations and UN bodies, agencies, programmes and funds towards developing and implementing more programmes and projects promoting indigenous rights and development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d14450fe-651a-4b97-9417-ed749b1d79c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d14450fe-651a-4b97-9417-ed749b1d79c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6fbd50c17a73048f79f7e4aedfef7f0af22a737c19c73f97805fb212abc636c"}}, "hash": "d6fbd50c17a73048f79f7e4aedfef7f0af22a737c19c73f97805fb212abc636c", "text": "11. Strengthen indigenous governance systems and capacities of indigenous peoples to govern and influence decision-making processes, mechanisms and policy development. Modern nation-state building has undermined many indigenous governance systems. Fortunately, in many communities, indigenous systems still co-exist with modern systems. There is a need to strengthen these systems and enhance their best elements and features such as consensual decision-making processes, promotion of the collective good, responsibility, mutual support and accountability, among others. The weaknesses of indigenous governance systems, such as discrimination against women and other democratic deficits, etc. must also be addressed. 11.1.Analyse how national and local governance systems undermine or reinforce indigenous governance systems and customary laws. Make recommendations on how to interface these two systems so that indigenous rights and development will be enhanced. 11.2.Help develop training programmes and institutes for indigenous parliamentarians and indigenous civil servants to increase capabilities, especially in terms of ensuring that the indigenous peoples\u2019 agenda for rights and development are integrated into their work. 11.3.Facilitate exchange visits between indigenous parliamentarians and between representatives of indigenous governments to learn more about each other\u2019s situations and experiences in governance. 11.4.Enhance capacities of indigenous peoples to influence decisions and decision-making processes in government and intergovernmental bodies. Ensure that they are effectively participating at all stages of decision-making in programmes, policies and institutions doing development work. 11.5.Undertake awareness and capacity-building training workshops for government bureaucrats and politicians so that they will become more sensitive and responsive to indigenous rights and development. 12. Strengthen the roles of indigenous leaders, traditional authorities and indigenous women in resolving and mediating conflict issues. Several conflict situations in indigenous peoples\u2019 territories still remain unresolved. Even in areas where armed struggle has stopped and peace negotiations took place, there is still a lot of dissatisfaction in the implementation of negotiated peace agreements. There is a need to analyse why this is so and to develop innovative steps to address these situations more satisfactorily. The role of traditional authorities, indigenous leaders, and indigenous women in conflict resolution and mediation should be enhanced. Lessons learned in helping resolve or transform conflicts should be shared and discussed in more detail. Workshop Report: Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development \u2013 Engaging in Dialogue 6 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 110 6 I. Introduction For the Asia-Pacific region, the most relevant international financial institutions are the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank (WB). Projects developed and implemented by these institutions impact enormously on the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples throughout the region. In recognition of this, WB and ADB have developed policies and guidelines for project development and funding in the territories and lands of indigenous peoples. However, consultations with indigenous peoples have demonstrated that there remain significant concerns with the policies as they currently stand, and that there are varying levels of knowledge regarding the policies both within the institutions themselves and among indigenous peoples. In addition, there has been some movement within the institutions themselves towards policy review, complemented by a willingness to engage with indigenous peoples in reviewing these policies. To this end, sustained engagement and education of indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations in the development policies and interventions of international financial agencies is essential for full and effective participation in these processes. In response to the opportunity and need to create stronger and more effective dialogue between indigenous peoples and the international financial institutions active in the region, UNDP-RIPP (Regional Initiative on Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development) and DINTEG (The Cordillera Peoples Legal Centre) held a planning workshop to strategize on how best to both increase indigenous capacities in engaging the international financial institutions (IFIs) and create a space for policy dialogue with the same. This initiative was developed in response to a request to RIPP by indigenous participants at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (May 2005) to facilitate a process of dialogue with IFIs active in the Asia-Pacific region. This report covers the process and outcome of that planning workshop conducted on 4-6 November 2005 in Baguio City, Cordillera, Philippines. The planning workshop involved indigenous leaders and representatives from throughout Asia; members of the UN Permanent Forum on indigenous Issues (PFII); ADB and UNDP. The workshop was hosted and organized by the Cordillera Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Legal Centre (DINTEG) in partnership and with the support of UNDP-RIPP Regional Centre in Bangkok. The key objectives of the workshop were: 1. To initiate a process of dialogue between indigenous peoples and IFIs; 2. To provide a forum in which key indigenous leaders in the region can discuss and agree strategies of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d423b70-af59-4296-a3d0-ee13a270520c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d423b70-af59-4296-a3d0-ee13a270520c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09702dbed71842a374161ac03c806332656c82364c21e49ebeea44330803a338"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4a3e564-5f5b-4c1a-9dac-614c2e3f87fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f6ee5a3bfbf8bbc3202ebece3f0e1507ea9c674ce329cebb5678c035d668ad3"}}, "hash": "52ed12d17c447e3d543d30e6693e78716af13e5dd847bf5eadf8ed3d0780cae9", "text": "engagement with IFIs; 3.

Workshop Report: Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development \u2013 Engaging in Dialogue 111 6 1 The background paper on the World Bank Group was prepared by Fergus McKay, who was unable to participate at the workshop. Representatives of the World Bank were also unable to participate, but have indicated their interest in the dialogue. II. Framework Strategic planning and preparation for the proposed training events on IFIs in Asia was the focus of the workshop. However before entering the strategic planning sessions, relevant inputs to provide the general framework within which the proposed training programme is to be situated were shared by experts. Ms. Chandra Roy, Programme Coordinator of the UNDP-RIPP, provided an overview of UNDP\u2019s strategic objectives and the UN Common Understanding on a Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to Development, a policy advocating for a development strategy that places advancement of human rights as both a goal and methodological approach. She also elaborated on UNDP\u2019s policy of engagement with indigenous peoples (2001) and the work and outreach of RIPP. Greater elaboration was provided by Robert Bernardo from the UNDP Capacity 2015 Programme, Asia Region, which is currently working on a resource guide on capacity assessment and development using the HRBA perspective. Noteworthy to mention is the on-going initiative of Capacity 2015 to design an complex but straightforward assessment instrument on institutional performance related to leadership, external relations, programme planning, monitoring and evaluation, external relations and sustainability. The indigenous perspective of the use of the HRBA and the operationalization of this approach was provided by Victoria Tauli-Corpus, Chair of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. This was supported and extended by a presentation on the contentious issue of free, prior and informed consent by Parshuram Tamang, Asia member of the UNPFII. Both emphasized that at the centre of a rights-based approach to development for indigenous peoples is respecting, promoting, protecting and fulfilling the right to self-determination of which one illustrative manifestation is the right to free, prior and informed consent. From the perspective of indigenous peoples, a policy or intervention will be judged as \u201cdevelopment\u201d in so far as it will promote and fulfil the right to self determination, by which one concrete application is if the development intervention will uphold the right to free, prior and informed consent. The challenge is the operationalization of the HRBA in a manner consistent with the interests, needs and perspective of indigenous peoples with specific interest in engaging IFIs such as the World Bank Group (WBG), ADB and JBIC \u2013 the three major banks influencing development in Asia. To provide an understanding on the policies of IFIs impacting on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and territories in Asia, three case studies were presented: World Bank Group: A comprehensive review on the WBG\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples and its application at the project level was presented by Ms. Vicky Tauli-Corpuz, together with concluding recommendations for engagement of the WBG by indigenous peoples. Both positive efforts of WBG at engagement in the past, and weaknesses seen in that engagement process, were presented for participants and discussed.1 Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development 112 6 Asian Development Bank: Ms. Indira Simbolon, with support from Mr. Albab Akanda, presented the ADB\u2019s current policy on indigenous peoples, and provided some details on the review process currently being undertaken by ADB on the indigenous peoples\u2019 policy, and two other social and environmental responsibility policies. The presentation detailed the purpose of the policy: to promote effective participation, to mitigate adverse impacts and to provide information to indigenous peoples and to the public. The review process is referred to as the \u2018safeguard policy update\u2019 and is intended to enhance flexibility of ADB\u2019s work and contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4a3e564-5f5b-4c1a-9dac-614c2e3f87fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4a3e564-5f5b-4c1a-9dac-614c2e3f87fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09702dbed71842a374161ac03c806332656c82364c21e49ebeea44330803a338"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d423b70-af59-4296-a3d0-ee13a270520c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52ed12d17c447e3d543d30e6693e78716af13e5dd847bf5eadf8ed3d0780cae9"}}, "hash": "1f6ee5a3bfbf8bbc3202ebece3f0e1507ea9c674ce329cebb5678c035d668ad3", "text": "A review of the ADB\u2019s policy from an indigenous perspective was provided by Raja Devasish Roy from the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

Further, it was firmly recommended that the review process should be designed and implemented together with indigenous peoples representatives and that the process should not repeat the policy review process of WBG which was viewed as insufficient at best, and resulted in a weakened policy on the protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. Japan Bank of International Cooperation: The third case study was on JBIC, the second largest \u2018development\u2019 bank in the world with 80 percent of its loans directed to Asia. In contrast to the ADB and WBG, JBIC does not have a policy specially designed for indigenous peoples. However, it has recently established environmental and social guidelines that are relevant to indigenous peoples, with certain provisions specific to indigenous peoples. The issues paper was prepared by Joan Carling of the Cordillera Peoples Alliance and Hozue Hatae of the Friends of the Earth-Japan. Ms. Carling presented the paper and elaborated as examples four cases of indigenous peoples\u2019 engagement with JBIC: Kotong Panjang Dam in Indonesia; San Roque Dam in the Philippines; Kelau Dam in Malaysia; and Sakhalin II Oil Development Project in Russia. The four case studies illustrated the lack of respect for indigenous peoples\u2019 rights by the JBIC, and its failure to conform to its own policies. From these three case studies of banks, a ten-point comparative observation was drawn, which includes but is not limited to the following: \u25a0 The overriding concern of the safeguard policies of the three banks are mitigation of adverse impact on the environment and social cost among indigenous peoples. \u25a0 Both WB and ADB have specific policy safeguards pertaining to indigenous peoples. JBIC has no specific policy on indigenous peoples but has a specific provision pertaining to indigenous peoples in its policy on environmental and social responsibility. \u25a0 All three banks have provisions on mandatory safeguards to mitigate social and environmental impact, although these differ in extent and coverage. \u25a0 All three banks uphold mandatory provisions on mitigation of adverse impacts. \u25a0 All three banks have specific policies on involuntary resettlement/physical relocation with particular concern on avoidance if possible and if not, at least with varying structured processes of support and participation from affected communities. \u25a0 All three banks have explicit provisions for information disclosure. The policies and procedures however, remain inadequate. Workshop Report: Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Rights and Development \u2013 Engaging in Dialogue 113 6 \u25a0 All three banks maintain mechanisms for appeals and accountability. The mechanisms though are faulty and bureaucratic with no effective mechanisms to seek redress and justice. Further, there is no clear application of appeals and accountability in relation to WBG\u2019s policy on \u201cfree, prior and informed consultation leading to broad support.\u201d III. Proposed actions and time frame Being fully convinced of the impact of powerful international financial institutions on indigenous peoples and recognizing the gap in the capacity of indigenous peoples to deal with these institutions, the participants agreed to address such need through a supplementary training programme. The immediate goal is to produce training manuals with subsequent training activities to be organized at sub-regional and national levels. Three separate working group discussions took place during the workshop dealing with the three identified sections of the training manual. Each working group discussed surveying capacity needs, target groups, methodologies of delivery, content, existing manuals on similar topics and strategic approaches to the provision of such training and its overall objectives. The three modules that were discussed and which emerged from the plenary discussion of the presentations from the working groups were: 1. Volume I \u2018Human Rights and Emerging Standards on Indigenous Rights\u2019: will focus on frameworks on human rights and indigenous peoples rights, which include: the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (ILO No. 169); Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Millennium Declaration and Millennium Development Goals, among others. 2. Volume II \u2018Human Rights-Based Approaches, Uses and Advocacy\u2019: will focus on operationalizing the human rights-based approach to development and advocacy work that will strike on free, prior and informed consent principles and approaches. 3. Volume III \u2018Development Financing Agencies\u2019: will focus on International Financial Agencies, their policies and their approaches to and strategies of engagement related to indigenous peoples. Details of the presentations from each of the working groups was then provided for a plenary session during which all participants worked together to produce a combined plan for the training module and the three volumes within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a60f7ed0-b317-4df4-9a31-b0bd2bad0d8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a60f7ed0-b317-4df4-9a31-b0bd2bad0d8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Indigenous Peoples and the Human Rights-Based Approach to Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b942478a634b9eb9475f797f492e9f416aea92dce14b392aa50cfe8bbd212e33"}, "3": {"node_id": "266185a3-6492-4ae1-93a7-c0f2201c1232", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights-based-approach-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d65181ecb297f58c580923d553dd3f2bab6d9faf7d1978e3309208753fd2754"}}, "hash": "44facbccc92fec478815fcf05c48f17f3de1de625e6cc6bf01fb327e1c5ecd17", "text": "it.

Being fully aware of related initiatives in training and module development by other organizations and agencies, each task force is will to coordinate and work collaboratively with these groups. All three volumes of the training manual are expected to be available for piloting in sub-regional trainings, one set for South Asia and another set for South-East Asia. Each training will target 20 participants. It will be during these sub-regional trainings that the plan for subsequent national trainings will be detailed. These national trainings are set to take off by the year 2007.
