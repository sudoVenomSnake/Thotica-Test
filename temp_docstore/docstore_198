ives are most powerful when they are effectively targeted, and temporary. Fiscal incentives are easier to administer and are used by many countries, although their often-high cost means that many countries are moving away from them towards more targeted financial incentives. It is also important to note that the evidence shows that incentives are far more effective in complement to, rather than in place of, an attractive wider business environment. Version 1.0 39 PPPs are a much-vaunted mechanism for attracting private investment in strategic public projects, particularly though not exclusively in the infrastructure sector. The examples from India and Lesotho above highlight both the potential and the potential pitfalls of these mechanisms. At its peak, the Indian PPP programme was mobilizing private investment in over 100 PPPs a year, though investment fell over time as the challenges managing and delivering the programme grew. Lesotho\u2019s experience highlights many of the risks of PPPs and raises pertinent considerations about the capacity and conditions for small states to successfully issue and manage such complex financing instruments. The \u201cworks for taxes\u201d example from Peru highlights an alternative, innovative approach to mobilizing private finance in strategic public infrastructure projects. This model may have the potential to be adapted and applied across a range of contexts facing similar challenges in funding and delivering public infrastructure. Social impact investment is an area of rapid growth that many countries are encouraging as an alternative model for financing certain investments and services, and as part of a wider private sector development strategy. The examples above highlight a range of steps that countries are taking to promote social impact businesses, stimulate capital investment that is willing to balance financial objectives with social and environmental ones, and intermediaries that can link the two. They also showcased social and development impact bonds, which many countries are establishing as a first foray into social impact investment. These mechanisms offer a way to share risks between public and private actors while also addressing the challenge of allowing government to pay for a contract at the point of outcome verification rather than output delivery. Beyond stimulating private investment, governments and private partners are innovating in a range of ways to improve the impact of private sector operations. Improving corporate governance \u2013 the rules, practices and processes that companies follow \u2013 can yield significant sustainable development returns. The examples from South Africa and Thailand highlight some of the ways that policy change and financial opportunities from private investors can support better corporate governance. In a related manner, the examples from India and Indonesia highlight some of the ways that governments are changing policy to bolster corporate social responsibility. Underpinning innovations in all these areas is the benefit of effective platforms for public\u2013private dialogue. Systematic engagement between the public and private sectors can be an important foundation to building trust and understanding between government and the firms whose decisions it aims to influence. Dialogue promotes joint solutions to the challenges of impactful private sector development and can be fertile ground for context-specific innovations. These policy areas are representative of some of the key challenges and steps that can be taken to help countries boost private sector investment for sustainable development. The examples above and the lessons they highlight can be used by policymakers to consider the areas of reform that may be most appropriate in their own context. They can be used to inform discussions throughout a DFA process about the most pertinent and impactful reforms that a country may wish to undertake. Public policy to leverage greater impact from remittances Remittances make important contributions to economic and social development in many countries. They support local economies in the communities that receive them and provide a source of hard currency at the national level. Remittances can also be an important driver of social progress at the local level, with funds often used to support access to education and health care. Yet they are primarily used for consumption purposes. There may be opportunities in many contexts to both leverage these flows to generate additional development finance and to enhance the impact of remittances themselves.

It also looks at innovations to enhance the impact of remittances at a micro-level, including efforts to reduce the cost of sending remittances as well as other initiatives such as policies to promote home ownership through regular remittances. 40 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS Leveraging additional development finance resources A number of countries around the world have experimented with or established mechanisms that engage the diaspora or leverage remittance flows to release funds that can be directly invested in sustainable development outcomes. This section explores two key mechanisms: diaspora bonds and securitizing the future flows of remittances. Issuing diaspora bonds A growing number of countries around the world are experimenting with diaspora bonds, which can offer a viable source of additional finance for many countries. Diaspora bonds are debt instruments targeted specifically at emigrants from the issuing country. They can provide a means for countries with significant overseas diasporas to access international credit and borrow on more favourable terms than they would otherwise be able to. The concept of diaspora bonds is not new (see Box 7), though they have a mixed record globally and their use remains nascent in many regions. Israel has developed a well-established programme of diaspora bonds, while India used them successfully to mobilize finance during times of crisis. Yet other countries such as Nepal have struggled to establish bonds, failing to raise the desired interest and levels of capital. Under the right circumstances and with effective design and management, diaspora bonds offer countries the potential to unlock a new, favourable stream of financing that can be invested for sustainable development purposes. This section explores some of these examples, analysing the lessons from successful and unsuccessful initiatives. Box 7. What are diaspora bonds? Diaspora bonds are instruments that allow a government to borrow from members of the overseas diaspora. They are potentially attractive to both borrowers and lenders for a number of reasons. For issuing countries that have limited access to international credit markets, they offer the opportunity to borrow in hard currency and to build a stronger history of borrowing that can improve perceptions of sovereign risk. Even for countries that do have access to international credit markets, diaspora bonds can offer favourable borrowing terms: a \u2018patriotic discount\u2019 of lower interest rates and longer-term length. There may be countercyclical motivations too; in times of crisis when access to capital markets may be reduced, the diaspora may feel more motivated to offer financing than commercial lenders \u2013 this has been the case with India and Greece, for example. For migrants, diaspora bonds can meet a desire to remain connected with their home country and offer a mechanism to support patriotic initiatives and contribute to progress. For countries to successfully issue diaspora bonds requires both the right contextual circumstances that support their potential as well as certain features in their management, design and practical delivery. The potential for diaspora bonds is influenced by a number of factors. There must be a significant overseas diaspora who feel a strong connection with their country of origin and the way it is being governed. The history of Israel Bonds shows how the connection may be strongest with first-generation diaspora. Wealthier emigrants will have more disposable income that can be invested in diaspora bonds so a diaspora that is more highly skilled and working in more developed or more rapidly growing economies may offer greater potential for raising finance. Yet even where the potential for diaspora bonds exists, realizing it in practice requires the careful design and management of a diaspora bond programme. In the most successful examples, such as the Israel bonds highlighted, diaspora bonds may be part of a wider package of close engagement with the diaspora. It is important for policymakers to understand the profile of potential diaspora investors. Research to understand the potential appetite regarding key decisions such as the interest rate, term length, frequency of issuances and use Version 1.0 41 of a project-based or unearmarked funding structure133 can be crucial.134 Defining eligibility is also important \u2013 bonds should target a group big enough to provide the uptake and financing that is sought after, but not so wide that the target audience does not perceive it as something designed for them. Determining who specifically to target within the diaspora \u2013 emigrants in which countries and matching which profiles \u2013 is an important basis for designing a promotion and communication campaign.

If the United States is a key source of potential diaspora finance, for example, then the product will need to be designed for compliance with US SEC regulations. 133 There may be potential to use diaspora bonds as a mechanism for raising capital within a social impact bond. A diaspora bond could be issued to raise the capital by the social impact bond intermediary. While this has not yet been trialled in practice, it has been considered as a possibility in Armenia and Israel. 134 The examples explored above are all unearmarked funding, where the use of funds raised through the diaspora bond are not tied to specific purposes. There are examples globally of countries using diaspora bonds to raise funds for specific projects. These are often megaprojects that are of high national importance, such as Ethiopia\u2019s Grand Renaissance Dam. 135 The primary sources of information for this case study are Y. Rehavi and A. Weingarten, Bank of Israel (2004). Fifty years of external finance via State of Israel non-negotiable bonds, and D. Ratha, World Bank (2007). Development finance via diaspora bonds \u2013 track record and potential. Promotion and communication before and during the lifetime of a bond is key to attracting and retaining interest. This is particularly important if the issuer has ambitions to establish diaspora bonds as a source of regular funding. Effective communication about the status of the bond and the investments it is financing can be a powerful mechanism for retaining the interest of and connection with the diaspora. This is particularly important where promotion of a bond has been centred around financing for specific projects or outcomes, or where the issuer intends to engage the diaspora for funding on a regular basis. CASE STUDY 23. Israel: An ongoing programme of diaspora bonds135 Israel has developed what is probably the most successful programme of diaspora bonds worldwide. For over sixty years, it has issued Israel Bonds for the diaspora and Jewish community abroad through a dedicated organization, Development Cooperation for Israel (DCI). These bonds form an important source of regular financing for the country and are seen as an important part of maintaining ties between Israel and the diaspora. Bonds are issued annually, with issuances determined by a level of required financing and foreign exchange requirements determined by the Ministry of Finance. Israel\u2019s history has been a key factor in the success of its bond programme. In the early years, bonds were regarded as a form of contribution to the State of Israel which was still in its infancy. They were launched in the United States by the first Prime Minister of Israel, who undertook a high-profile coast-to-coast tour of the country to promote the financing instrument. For a number of decades, bonds were sold at a rate of return significantly lower than the market rate. Over time, the profile of the diaspora has changed and a variety of bond products have been developed, including products targeting a younger generation as well as bonds designed specifically for small businesses. While bonds often still offer a rate below that of the market, the terms are now much closer to market rates. The majority of bonds are sold in the United States as well as, to a lesser extent, Canada and some European countries. Marketing is not done with the involvement of commercial banks or brokers as is often the case, but DCI has a sophisticated approach to maintaining ties with the diaspora community and sells bonds to them directly. In the United States, for example, they have a significant staff complement who maintain close contact with Jewish communities in order to both understand investor profiles and changing preferences, and to host events with the purpose of maintaining ties and selling bonds. 42 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS CASE STUDY 24. India: Diaspora bonds in times of crisis India has issued diaspora bonds on three occasions, 1991, 1998 and 2000, with a combined total value of over $11 billion.136 The first two issuances were in response to crisis \u2013 following a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991 and the imposition of sanctions in 1998. While there was an urgent need to raise financing on these occasions, the bonds were structured as diaspora bonds limited to investors of Indian origin only, as opposed to bonds that could be purchased more widely. A number of reasons are identified for this approach. Firstly, Indian investors may have been more willing to invest in an instrument that was exclusively for them. Secondly, there was an assumption that Indian investors may be more willing than others", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d33ad45-1071-4440-bab0-c9c7b01e89c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d33ad45-1071-4440-bab0-c9c7b01e89c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "074f719c60761a89c26291e843cc4cec770120a39931411b64a81a7ddb79e178"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0236a81-5a7e-4c39-a524-bf5aae2d08cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a7f6169f76b61ee5280e0e952382bdb865117fc528adfd5b1e0d84b5443b8b18"}}, "hash": "dc3bc7ad5140c5e26c2cc060c53436a5fe352c4e488162f3a54d8de13df9c39b", "text": "to receive repayment in rupees should the financial situation have demanded it when the time for repayment came. And thirdly, the Indian authorities had greater confidence that bonds sold to the diaspora would not be used for money laundering purposes.137 These three issuances were successful in raising significant amounts of capital, though they were initiated on an ad hoc basis and have not been used by India since 2000. This is primarily because, given the way the economy, investment and public finances have since grown, there has been reduced need for additional sources of financing. However, in 2013, the government did consider reintroducing a programme of diaspora bonds.138 CASE STUDY 25. Nepal: Challenges establishing a diaspora bond programme Nepal has had less success in issuing its diaspora bonds than India and Israel. The Nepalese diaspora bonds, known as foreign employment bonds, were first issued in 2010. The objective was to raise Rs. 1 billion initially, leading up to an ultimate target of Rs. 7 billion (US$100 million) through later issuances. Uptake of these bonds has been low, however. The initial issuance sold only 0.4 percent of its intended volume. Nepal Rastra Bank has continued issuing bonds, with a total of 15 issuances since 2010, yet none has sold more than one-third of its target and the average uptake of all 15 issuances is 5.26 percent.139 A number of potential reasons have been identified for these challenges.140 Chief among these are marketing, the incentives created for intermediaries and the interest rate offered. Marketing of the initial bonds at least was limited and, though the money transfer intermediaries received a 0.25 percent commission on all bond sales they facilitated, they also had to forgo money transfer fees, which weakened incentives to actively promote the bonds. Finally, the interest rate has been set at between 9 percent and 10.5 percent in every issuance and this may not reflect favourably in comparison to the interest rates available to overseas workers through commercial savings accounts. At the time of the initial issuances, commercial banks in Nepal were offering an interest rate of up to 13 percent on comparable fixed five-year deposits.141 136 The primary source of information for this case study is D.

In addition, some of the exchange rate risks that internationally denominated debt incurs are negated by the predictability of the flow, thereby allowing some reduced risk of rising repayment costs.

While these mechanisms have not been used in the Asia- Pacific region, a number of institutions worldwide, particularly in Latin America, have successfully used them to mobilize funding. As the examples from Brazil and El Salvador show below, they offer the potential to support lower-cost access to longer-term debt that can fund key investments in sustainable development, even in times of high domestic sovereign risk. Establishing future flow securitization mechanisms While diaspora bonds engage emigrants in development financing, a number of countries have used \u2018future flow securitization\u2019 mechanisms (see Box 8) to leverage the predictable flow of hard currency that remittances represent. The idea behind future flow securitization is that the flow of remittances represents a relatively stable, low- risk source of hard currency. This can be used as collateral to access international credit which can then be used to finance investments in sustainable development. Such mechanisms offer potential for countries to boost financing in areas such as infrastructure and increasing access to credit. There are also successful examples showing that it can be leveraged for priorities such as increasing access to credit for the poorest households. The securitization of future remittance flows, whether based solely on remittances or as part of a diversified payment rights transaction, offers significant potential for development banks and other financial intermediaries to access new forms of finance and expand their access to cheaper, longer-term international financing. These transactions have been used by organizations internationally, particularly in a number of Latin American countries \u2013 alongside the examples given below, Argentina, Mexico, Peru and others have used similar approaches. Yet their potential elsewhere remains largely untapped. The examples show how they can be established in a variety of contexts where there are significant flows of remittances, both in larger countries like Brazil, and smaller countries like El Salvador. While the examples highlighted all provide unearmarked 44 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS funding or support for financial services to low-income households, there is potential for their application in a range of other areas that generate a return by which the debt can be repaid.

However, as the Fedecr\u00e9dito example shows, organizations that are independent of government can also establish such mechanisms, often with the support of a multilateral development bank, and they can be powerful drivers of increased funding for projects that support investments in the poorest communities.

In this way, many of the perceived sovereign and exchange rate risks associated with lending to Brazil at the time were mitigated. The mechanism thereby provided access to international debt that could be used for economic and development purposes at a time of otherwise reduced access to international credit markets. A high debt-service coverage-ratio148 was used to further mitigate the risks of volatility or seasonal variation in remittance flows from Japan. The structure of the transaction and the collateralization against the predictable flow of remittances from Japan earned it a higher credit rating, BBB+, than both BdB (which had a local rating of BB+ at the time) and the sovereign foreign currency rating for Brazil (which was BB- at the time). This mechanism, which successfully issued and managed the US$250 million debt, not only provided valuable access to relatively low-cost financing for BdB but also helped establish a mechanism that both BdB and other Brazilian financial institutions have used repeatedly in the following years. It also helped strengthen perceptions of the country\u2019s sovereign risk at the time. Between 2002 and 2004, BdB and other major Brazilian banks completed a total of 22 issuances worth nearly US$5 billion cumulatively that were fully or partially149 collateralized by remittances. Nine of these were given an AAA rating. The average interest rate for 8 of these 22 transactions for which data are available was 7 percent lower than benchmarks for Brazil at the time.150 Version 1.0 45 CASE STUDY 27. El Salvador: Future flow securitization The El Salvadorean financial cooperative Fedecr\u00e9dito has issued debt backed by remittances on three separate occasions. This case study provides an interesting example of remittance-backed borrowing by an independent organization, designed specifically for initiatives that provide finance to poorer communities. Such investments would often be perceived as higher risk. The International Financial Corporation (IFC) played a key role in supporting Fedecr\u00e9dito to establish this mechanism. In 2010 and 2013, Fedecr\u00e9dito issued debt worth US$30 and US$20 million respectively, backed by remittances flowing through the organization. This debt was taken on to fund a range of operations including scaling up microfinance, providing financial products and services to low-income households, and supporting the integration of micro- and small enterprises into the formal sector. While the 2010 and 2013 issuances were wholly taken up by the IFC, a third issuance of $50 million in 2017 was only 30 percent taken up by the IFC with the remainder funded by international investors.151 These transactions have established a new source of funding for Fedecr\u00e9dito that has helped fund growth in its operations. Fedecr\u00e9dito\u2019s loan portfolio, for example, more than doubled from US$142 million in 2010 to $299 million in 2016.152 The initial transaction supported 142,000 loans to micro-entrepreneurs and low-income households, a 25 percent increase in the number of loans.153 Not only has it established a funding mechanism that can provide continued funding for Fedecr\u00e9dito into the future, but it has also proven that the concept of future flow securitization can be applied to non-governmental organizations that provide services to low- income households.

They are typically used for consumption purposes and support a range of spending in the communities that receive them, supporting access to food, health care and education among other things. Given the impact they can have at the local level, many countries are taking steps to enhance and bolster this impact. A common objective is to lower the cost of sending remittances, thereby leaving more money in the hands of the families that receive them. Other initiatives include establishing mechanisms to encourage home ownership or productive investment.

Available at: https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/sotir/ percent to sub-Saharan Africa.157 With such wide variation in the cost of sending remittances, steps to reduce these costs can significantly increase the funds available to the recipients of remittances. Internationally, there have been commitments made to reduce the cost of sending remittances; SDG target 10c aims to reduce average costs to 3 percent and eliminate costs above 5 percent in any corridor. A report on financing the SDGs in the ASEAN region, for example, concluded that reducing the cost to 5 percent in just the five most expensive intra-ASEAN corridors alone could save migrants US$240 million a year.158 A number of initiatives designed to lower the prices that migrants face in sending remittances are explored below: these tackle different aspects of the system, from encouraging the uptake of technology to establishing partnerships that can reduce the costs in key corridors. Countries are also innovating in other areas too, and the example from the Philippines shows a remittance policy designed to promote home ownership with remittances. CASE STUDY 28. Encouraging the development of fintech solutions worldwide One of the most promising avenues for reducing the cost of sending remittances is fintech solutions, particularly related to mobile money. These systems are able to offer significantly reduced transaction costs by cutting out many of the intermediate steps between remittance sender and receiver in the traditional process. While money transfer operators may channel a remittance transfer through multiple financial institutions, fintech remittance companies are able to transmit more directly through the use of mobile wallets that keep the transaction online. The use of mobile money is estimated to be more than 50 percent cheaper than global money transfer operators, and is particularly competitive for lower value transactions.159 There is also evidence that money transfer operators offer lower prices in the remittance corridors where mobile money options are available.160 Globally, mobile money-based remittances are growing rapidly. Over 2015 and 2016, international remittances were the fastest growing product within the mobile money ecosystem161 and by 2017 accounted for 1.1 percent of incoming transactions to the mobile money ecosystem \u2013 almost double the 0.6 percent in 2012.162 Version 1.0 47 Much of the growth in mobile money remittances has been in Africa but there are a growing number of actors offering services across other regions. Two key areas that can help to increase the growth in this industry are national regulation and interoperability between mobile money companies. Regarding regulation, many countries have legislation in place that limits international transfers from and in some cases to the country to formal banking institutions only. Mobile money has grown most rapidly in contexts where this is not the case, and mobile networks are able to offer money transfer services to their customers. Interoperability refers to the ability to transfer money between different companies\u2019 systems, thereby opening up a greater number of remittance channels. A growing number of partnerships are being established between companies and policymakers may be able to find ways to further encourage this.

India: Immediate payment service The Directo a M\u00e9xico example is fairly unique, though in many countries worldwide there are initiatives underway to strengthen systems for more efficient, faster financial transactions.166 In some instances, these have been linked with mechanisms for remitting from overseas. The Immediate Payment Service was launched in India in 2010. It focused initially on mobile transactions though has grown to incorporate 76 Indian banks and incorporates payments across a range of platforms. Several of these banks have partnered with cross-border money transfer organizations in order to support more rapid transfer of remittances into the country.167 This has the potential to help bring down the cost of remittances, although, despite rapid growth, the platform represents only a relatively small component of the Indian market. 163 Note that the name Directo a M\u00e9xico has been used since July 2005. 164 The Partnership for Prosperity was agreed by the US and Mexican presidents in 2001.

Across Asia, for example, almost two-thirds of payment locations for remittances are in urban areas.168 This reduced access to remittance corridors is a contributing factor to the higher cost of sending remittances to rural areas. There is potential to address this challenge through collaboration with two key types of institutions that maintain large networks that are present in many rural areas: microfinance organizations and post offices. One of the key factors constraining the involvement of microfinance institutions in remittances is that regulations in many countries do not allow them to perform currency transactions.169 Microfinance institutions in some countries have overcome this challenge by building partnerships with the money transfer organizations that facilitate 168 IFAD-World Bank (2013).

The Philippines: Remittances for mortgages In the Philippines, the Pag-IBIG overseas programme is a voluntary savings scheme which uses remittances as collateral for home loans. It gives members of the diaspora an opportunity to save towards the future purchase of housing. Migrants save money with the scheme on a monthly basis and, after a minimum of two years, can access a home loan. It offers particularly beneficial rates for low-income households, with preferential rates and longer home loan maturities for smaller home loans than are offered by private sector lenders. The scheme is guaranteed by the government and is funded by the largest government pension fund.176 Other innovative solutions include mechanisms to support diaspora investments in their country of origin,177 as well as funds that match the charitable use of remittances in areas such as education.178 Policy considerations \u2013 remittances Remittances account for significant flows of finance to many countries and though their primary use is often for consumption at the personal or family level, the examples above highlight the range of options that are available to policymakers wishing to amplify their SDG impact. Diaspora bonds and future flow securitization both offer the potential to generate additional resources that can be used for strategic SDG investments by governments and state banks or other financial institutions respectively. While there is potential in both instruments, both are complex to establish and require well- designed and careful management. Both instruments may take time and sustained commitment to become established sustainably. Nevertheless, under the right conditions and with strong management the benefits can be significant \u2013 diaspora bonds have been a critical source of funding for Israel and for key investments in other countries, while future flow securitization is creating new streams of revenue to boost access to finance in El Salvador. At the micro-level, the examples above highlight a range of options for enhancing the impact of remittance flows for families and communities. Transaction costs remain high in many remittance corridors and reducing these costs, through fintech solutions, partnerships between sending and receiving countries, or utilizing institutions such as microfinance lenders and post offices, can increase the money reaching the families that rely on remittances. Initiatives such as the \u201cremittances for mortgages\u201d example from the Philippines shows the potential to leverage these flows to support access to specific priorities such as housing. 176 Ibid. 177 Ibid. 178 K.

Linking planning and financing functions requires the ability to connect and monitor how the outcomes of short-term policies contribute towards longer-term objectives. For public and private finance flows to contribute effectively to SDG outcomes, it requires policies that promote and incentivize these contributions. The design and implementation of these policies is informed by information on what is being invested, what progress is being made and the outcomes generated by different types of investment. There are a number of components to effective monitoring and review systems. Finance tracking systems capture information on financing, on the resources that are being invested, by whom and how. Monitoring systems capture information on development results and the progress that is made towards the SDGs. These will typically be distinct systems and there may be multiples of each in any given country. The quality of these tracking and monitoring systems and the ability to connect information between them will determine the extent to which a clear picture can be developed about the impacts that different types of investment have on SDG outcomes. This chapter looks at finance tracking systems, with a particular focus on private sector financing, an area that has been highlighted as a priority through a number of DFAs. The private sector plays a key role in determining a country\u2019s sustainable development path, yet in many contexts there is limited ability to track the kinds of investments that are being made or the direct and indirect effects on sustainable development outcomes. Improving the systems that exist for private sector monitoring is therefore a priority for policymakers as it can inform more targeted, nuanced and responsive policymaking. It is also increasingly a priority for private businesses themselves. Understanding their sustainable development impacts allows businesses to adapt their operations and can support efforts to engage government on the policies that affect them.

This section explores three different approaches towards improving systems for reporting or tracking the investments and contributions that private sector actors are making towards the SDGs. Improving private sector reporting Innovations are underway in a number of countries to improve the data on, or reported by, private sector actors. This chapter focuses particularly on innovations in this area, considering examples from three countries and discussing how policymakers may be able to promote better private sector monitoring \u2013 and use that information for more effective policymaking. In Thailand, the stock exchange has promoted an international sustainability reporting standard among firms as part of a strategy to attract international investment that is increasingly conscious of ESG considerations. In Papua New Guinea, the Business Council has launched an initiative to promote reporting on SDG activities among companies as a means for deepening policy dialogue with government. And in the Philippines, an initiative has been established to showcase business contributions to the SDGs as part of efforts to promote a greater role for business in dialogue on advancing the SDGs. Version 1.0 51 CASE STUDY 32. Thailand: Sustainability reporting Improved private sector reporting can benefit businesses themselves, and frameworks for reporting and sharing information will be most sustainable when businesses understand that reporting is in their interest. One of the strongest incentives for improving private sector reporting is when it creates opportunities to access new sources of finance. Globally, there is a growing volume of finance controlled by investors who want a fuller understanding of the firms that they invest in and the impacts these businesses have. Thailand is a leader in private sector sustainability reporting and many Thai companies have responded to the growing interest among international investors for ESG information. Many companies have established sustainability reporting practices, publishing information on environmental, social and governance indicators from their operations annually. Thailand has, for example, more companies included in the international Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) than any other ASEAN country and the sixth largest number of firms in the emerging markets DJSI.179 The trend in sustainability reporting has been driven largely by the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and champions among large Thai companies. A key motivation has been responding to increased demand from international investors for ESG information that may materially affect their business operations in the future. This international demand presents an opportunity: by being an early mover among emerging markets in adopting sustainability reporting, the country can attract greater volumes of international capital through its stock exchange and financial markets. While it was large and listed firms that first started establishing sustainability reporting practices, momentum has been built and these practices are increasingly widely adopted. Reporting is now sufficiently widespread that an annual assessment of the \u2018ESG 100\u2019 has been established to assess performance on ESG issues which are material to investors\u2019 decision-making.180 The 2017 assessment included 656 companies.181 Adopting the standard has required a wide programme of capacity-building among listed and other firms. Most sustainability reports published by Thai companies use the international Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework; SET and other private sector bodies have championed this framework. While the drive behind this trend has largely been to support increased access to finance, it offers a significant body of information that can be used by both firms themselves and policymakers to design reforms that can advance sustainable development (see policy considerations below). 179 Stock Exchange of Thailand press release, September 2017.

Its aim is transparency and accountability, and it allows internal and external actors to gauge the contributions that a firm is making towards sustainable development. Most firms that undertake sustainability reporting use one of a number of common international standards. Sustainability reporting has grown rapidly since its beginning in the 1970s and by 2015 over 60 countries had established regulatory frameworks that mandate or encourage companies to disclose information beyond financial performance alone.182 While there are many common elements, sustainability reporting differs from impact measurement (see Box 6) in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8454c30c-2f6d-49ce-b8ca-0739fe34f43c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8454c30c-2f6d-49ce-b8ca-0739fe34f43c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc58bbe0ae1de14202d862efe1d66b1a22f975fd8f4245ee725bb274bf98114e"}}, "hash": "fc58bbe0ae1de14202d862efe1d66b1a22f975fd8f4245ee725bb274bf98114e", "text": "that it is externally driven for transparency and accountability purposes as opposed to tracking progress for a funder. It is also largely characterized by the use of common standards and application primarily by large and/or publicly listed firms. 89 percent of organizations publishing sustainability reports in 2015 were either large or multinational and 72 percent were publicly listed.183 Sustainability reporting represents a big step forward in understanding companies\u2019 impacts on sustainable development. Yet practices in reporting vary between companies and sustainability reporting may go only so far in presenting a full picture of impact. Central to this is the definition of \u2018materiality.\u2019 Materiality can be defined as any factors that may have an impact on a company\u2019s activities and position (and on its value to shareholders) now or in the future. Potential investors in a company are very interested in materiality because it may reveal factors that impact that value of their investment in the future. Yet how this is defined for any particular company can be subjective and can be interpreted narrowly or broadly. Depending on how the definition is applied, and the approach taken towards materiality in sustainability reporting, sustainability reports may yield more or less information on sustainable development outcomes.

Version 1.0 53 CASE STUDY 33. Papua New Guinea: The SDGs Dashboard In contrast to the approach in Thailand, where an international standard for private sector reporting is used to attract international capital, businesses in Papua New Guinea have developed a bespoke approach to private sector reporting. This has been motivated by the desire to enhance and deepen engagement with the government on policy issues that are important to businesses, as well as a desire to enhance their public image. Businesses in Papua New Guinea have come together through the Business Council of Papua New Guinea to develop a reporting mechanism, the SDGs dashboard, that captures their contributions towards sustainable development. The businesses were motivated in part by a desire to engage in deeper dialogue with the government about how the private sector can contribute to national development priorities and how to unlock those contributions through closer public\u2013private collaboration. It was prompted particularly by the process to develop a national medium-term plan that links annual government operations with the national long-term vision to 2050. The dashboard, which is in its first phase at the time of writing, has been designed with specific reference to the SDGs.187 While some of the companies involved in the development of the dashboard publish sustainability reports using ESG frameworks, there was a motivation among businesses to build something that captures contributions to SDGs systematically. This enables a close link to national development objectives that are linked with the international SDGs, and is important for public branding. The dashboard is structured to present data aggregated at the national level that can be disaggregated by individual companies. Sustainable development data for the country are presented alongside survey data on the sustainability practices of individual companies, mapped against the SDGs. Individual companies are given a sustainability score which is an assessment of how effectively their work is contributing to the SDGs. Data are gathered through a survey that has been designed specifically for the dashboard, with tailoring to the context of individual sectors. CASE STUDY 34. The Philippines: Showcasing transformational business In the Philippines, UNDP and Philippine Business for the Environment have established a process for showcasing the contributions that the private sector is making towards the SDGs in the country. The aim is promote dialogue and engagement on how the private sector contributes and can contribute more to the SDGs. The initiative encourages and enables businesses to report on their sustainability strategies and specific initiatives that are contributing to sustainable development outcomes.

Transformational business: Philippine business contributions to the UN SDGs. 54 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS Policy considerations \u2013 measuring private sector outcomes Private sector monitoring is an important part of an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. Improvements in the reporting or tracking of private sector investments and outcomes offer a more accurate, granular understanding of the outputs and direct and indirect outcomes that private sector actors generate. This can inform policy design that is more targeted at leveraging the strategic benefits of private investment for national sustainable development, and mitigating the risks. It can inform deeper dialogue with private sector actors about the contributions they can make to sustainable development and about the role of government in creating the incentives and policy environment that encourages it. The examples above highlight some of the range of options for encouraging private sector reporting and improved monitoring that can be considered by policymakers and as part of a DFA process and follow-up. Governments may be able to support private sector reporting initiatives by providing resources, promoting standards or supporting capacity-building. As in the examples above, this may include collaboration with actors such as chambers of commerce, stock exchanges or development partners. Policymakers can adapt policy in areas such as procurement and tendering, or incentives, so that eligibility is dependent on reporting social and environmental impact. It is seen as standard practice in most contexts that firms must have up-to-date financial accounts in order to be eligible for government tenders, for example. This helps government ensure that they are entrusting the provision of goods or services in the care of financially responsible organizations. Policymakers may wish to consider expanding such criteria to cover reporting on social and environmental outcomes, to also ensure they are entrusting the provision of goods and services to socially and environmentally responsible organizations. Governments can engage with private sector reporting standards to build mutual compatibility with their own monitoring systems. The more that standards can be harmonized,189 the easier it will be for governments and private sector representatives to exchange comparable information. Policymakers and private sector representatives can also work together to build an understanding of how to interpret linkages between private sector outputs, the outcomes they generate and the contributions that those outcomes make towards the results targeted in national plans. Beyond informing the design of policy, there may be potential for the data used and produced in private sector reporting to be used in the implementation of policy itself. Governments are increasingly experimenting with models of contracting centred on outcomes rather than outputs, for example. In such models, payment to a contractor is dependent on verified outcomes (e.g. the number of pupils passing an exam) rather than outputs (e.g. number of classes taught). Private sector outcome data could be used by governments to reorient investment incentives around the outcomes they aim to encourage, targeting job creation among deprived communities rather than investment in deprived regions, for example. With the right private sector outcome data and the means for verification, such outcome-based incentives could be used in policy around tax breaks, preferential access to credit, subsidies and other types of incentives (see Chapter 3, Offering incentives to promote private sector investment). 189 For example in the choice of indicators, use of common definitions and terminology, or common units and bases of measurement. Version 1.0 55 5 Transparency and accountability Transparency and collective accountability between public and private actors is a key part of an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. Transparency and effective accountability mechanisms are important for building trust that promotes collaboration between actors, supports scrutiny over the way resources are used and contributes overall towards greater effectiveness. Transparency and accountability are two-way responsibilities.

Mutual accountability and transparency support effective partnerships, stronger monitoring and lesson learning, and enable greater effectiveness and impact from public and private financing. This chapter looks at a selection of examples that highlight some of the steps being taken by public and private actors to promote transparency and accountability in the way that resources are being used. It looks at the role transparency can play in a number of key areas of financing the SDGs, public investment in cross-cutting priorities, public\u2013private transactions and other initiatives that can advance key strategic priorities within the 2030 Agenda. Reporting public spending on cross-cutting priorities Transparency and openness on the part of government about the way that public resources are used is vital for ensuring that government spending is responsive to the priorities of the country and is efficient and effective. It is also an important precursor to government advocacy for greater transparency among private actors. Many governments have taken steps to make their annual budget and spending more transparent, and initiatives in this area are well covered elsewhere. This section focuses on two case studies which highlight innovations being made to transparently respond to the 2030 Agenda. It looks at how the South Korean government has developed a system for gender budgeting and how Pakistan has established climate tagging systems within the budget process, as well as at efforts to improve public awareness of the investments being made in a key cross-cutting priority, such as climate change in Nepal. These examples highlight some of the steps that governments can take to go beyond simple reporting of budget allocations to monitor and publish information against priorities that are important to their constituents, which sit within or cut across the way budget allocations are structured. They highlight some of the steps that may need to be taken to present this information: in both instances a new mapping or tagging system was established to gather the cross-cutting information. The Nepal example further highlights steps to ensure that information is not just available, but accessible \u2013 publishing information is the first step to ensuring that transparency leads to accountability and greater efficiency. 56 INTEGRATED FINANCING SOLUTIONS CASE STUDY 35. South Korea: Gender budgeting190 South Korea is one of a number of countries that has established systems for monitoring investments in gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment that cut across ministerial briefs. Gender budgeting systems in South Korea are grounded in the Finance Act which, in 2006, called for the establishment of gender budgets and gender balance reports from 2010 onwards. The government annually produces gender budget statements which analyse the impact of budget allocations on women and men in advance. These statements analyse the objectives, anticipated outcomes and gender breakdown of beneficiaries to spending programmes, and also consider the gender sensitivity of government revenues. The government produces a separate gender balance sheet that assesses the balance of benefits to men and women, and takes action to remedy any imbalances. Work was also undertaken to identify gender needs in key areas of public services such as infrastructure, where modifications were made to public facilities to reduce waiting times for women, and care programmes, where funding to support home care for the elderly was increased in order to help the women, who often provide home care, to participate in the labour market. The Finance Act allowed four years for procedures to be established. In this time, the government undertook detailed research of best practices in gender budgeting in other countries and established clear definitions and guidelines for key concepts, working with leading national think tanks. Key tools, such as a gender information database, were piloted and refined, and a manual and training system were developed for use by government officials. Women\u2019s Focal Points were put in place in key ministries to lead and facilitate gender budgeting across core national ministries. As the system became established at the national level, efforts were made to extend the approach and tools to subnational government entities. CASE STUDY 36. Pakistan: Climate change tagging191 Climate change poses major threats to sustainable development in Pakistan, which ranks as one of the countries most vulnerable to the long-term risks of climate change. The government has developed tools including a climate tagging system to improve transparency about how it invests its resources in addressing these risks. Climate change has been incorporated within the coding of the country\u2019s national budget as well as the provincial budget for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Nepal: Parliamentary and citizen scrutiny of climate spending Climate change is a key consideration for Nepal as it is one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.193 Several laws and structures have been put in place to manage climate resources including a climate-tagging expenditure system that was established to monitor public spending on climate change initiatives. Building on the climate-tagging system, there have been efforts to enhance the accessibility and scrutiny of information about climate spending by the Nepalese government. In 2017, a Climate Citizens Budget194 was launched by Freedom Forum, a Nepalese NGO, and UNDP. It aims to increase awareness and understanding about how the government is budgeting for climate change and the way this cuts across sectors. The document builds on information generated by the climate-tagging system which is published by the government, but is of a technical nature and so relatively inaccessible to many interested parties. It summarizes this information and presents headlines about the scale, focus and trends in climate budgeting. It shows how much is being invested in different sectors, the volumes budgeted for capital and recurrent spending, and the degree of climate-relevance of different areas of budgeting. The analysis was developed with the collaboration of technical staff from the Ministry of Finance to ensure the validity of the information. It has been distributed widely across the country and has generated significant interest from citizens, civil society and media who can use it to advocate for effective investment in climate change priorities and strengthen government accountability. Alongside the development of the Climate Citizens Budget, steps have been taken to increase the engagement of the Nepalese Parliament with climate finance issues in national plans and the budget. A Handbook for Parliamentarians was established to enable two key thematic committees (the Environment Protection Committee and the Finance Committee) to scrutinize the annual budget from a climate change perspective. The two committees also jointly conducted an inquiry during the monitoring of climate change expenditure in the field in two districts (Myagdi and Bardiya) in September 2017. This was the first time that two committees worked in partnership on climate and finance issues. The handbook will also be used by other thematic committees of the parliament when they discuss the budget for the sectors they are responsible for.

The assessment led to the establishment of a subcommittee focused on procurement within the country\u2019s National Reform Council. The creation of an e-procurement system was expedited and a checklist for mitigating corruption risks was developed, with government officials trained in its application. Integrity Pacts were introduced to raise standards in major infrastructure projects, with a value exceeding 1 billion baht. And in 2017, a law was introduced outlining provisions across the whole public sector for procurement framework agreements, the professionalization of public procurement functions, and transparency and citizen monitoring of public procurement. These reforms to Thailand\u2019s procurement practices are contributing to the development of more transparent and accountable procurement functions. Given the high proportion of spending by many governments on procurement, increased transparency and accountability has the potential to significantly enhance the use of public finance overall.

Version 1.0 59 CASE STUDY 39. Dominican Republic: Tax expenditure reporting Tax expenditure is a key part of many governments\u2019 efforts to promote strategic policy objectives. Exemptions to taxes can be used across a variety of policy areas, from supporting individuals \u2013 for example by allowing deductions on mortgage interest to encourage home ownership \u2013 to promoting private investment, notably via incentive schemes designed to attract FDI and stimulate domestic investment (see the discussion on investment incentives in Chapter 3). While tax expenditure can support key policy objectives, it can also be very expensive in terms of forgone revenue. In Latin America for example, tax expenditure exceeded 20 percent of central government tax revenues in 9 of 11 Latin American countries for which data are published and exceeded 40 percent in 4 of these countries.200 Tax expenditure can be easier to establish politically than other forms of support for strategic policy objectives which require actual budgetary expenditure. Yet, though it is often used in similar ways as budgetary outlays and has equal significance for the public finances, there is in many contexts considerably less scrutiny over tax expenditure than on budget expenditure.201 The effective use of tax expenditure requires regular monitoring of revenue forgone and benefits accrued; tax expenditure reporting is a key part of this, allowing scrutiny by both government and non-governmental actors. In 2008, the Dominican Republic introduced tax expenditure reporting under the Public Sector Budget Law. This calls for publication of all tax incentives in the annual budget as well as the publication of estimates of the revenue forgone through these tax incentives. In 2011, an Interinstitutional Tax Expenditure Commission was created within the Ministry of Finance\u2019s Audit and Evaluation Unit. It was set up to estimate forgone revenues as well as to conduct cost\u2013benefit analyses on the exemptions offered, to ensure they are effective and are being used for the purposes for which they were designed. The annual publication, Gastos Tributarios en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, provides a breakdown of estimated tax expenditure202 under each tax exemption scheme as well as by the sectors and industries, and domestic and foreign actors, that are thought to have benefited.203 Establishing this system for monitoring tax expenditures has allowed the government of the Dominican Republic to better understand the costs that its tax exemption programmes are incurring. This has provided the foundation for accurate analysis of the cost\u2013benefit ratio of different schemes. It has also fed into plans to establish a fiscal pact. The country\u2019s National Development Strategy 2030, which was introduced in 2012, calls for a fiscal pact that will, among other reforms, consolidate tax expenditure into a single section of the tax code. The aim is to establish a more coherent approach to tax that reduces the fiscal impact and distortions associated with tax incentives.204 While a growing number of countries have established tax expenditure reporting systems \u2013 nine Latin American countries introduced monitoring between 2005 and 2014 \u2013 many countries do not publicly", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f74e2d1e-0842-4b30-8ae0-855d9271db59": {"__data__": {"id_": "f74e2d1e-0842-4b30-8ae0-855d9271db59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3cf3d4b00e3dc2112c05d63e0f3aef0b91ddf2c0ff06837e82b63ca62dfd073"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e140751-ab4d-4bde-b3be-a689e2718314", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4f41f8faa85ea2e1d353550c4d5d2abe7c37046b78c66e0dc23adc248fe22aa"}}, "hash": "c9a3cb0b3ac7deff6d5b31cf4989deb27763ee3a46c43f4359f4ccff30000223", "text": "report on tax expenditure, or provide only limited information.

The examples below highlight wider transparency initiatives that can catalyse advances in key aspects of the 2030 Agenda. The first focuses on a recent legislative change in the United Kingdom which requires all large public and private organizations to report on key gender pay ratios.

Ethiopia: Spreading agriculture market information The Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) was established in 2008 to provide a reliable system for trading agricultural products in Ethiopia. The exchange aimed to address inefficiencies in agricultural markets which were characterized by poor information, high transaction costs and high risks.211 Farmers would come to local markets with little information on prices, leaving them vulnerable to price fluctuations which reflected local conditions but not wider national or international market trends. This left many farmers vulnerable to falling prices during a local glut, regardless of trends in national or international prices.212 The exchange was launched to create a more transparent trading environment. It disseminates information about crop prices widely across the country. Initially launching with price dissemination in major market towns, it now operates electronic price displays in 160 of the 500 Woredas (districts) nationwide.213 It provides transaction security with systems for grading and storing commodities, matching offers and bids for commodity transactions and processing payments and goods delivery. Since launching, the exchange has achieve notable successes. The volume of coffee and sesame traded has grown rapidly, from 138,000 metric tonnes in 2008\u201309 to 715,000 metric tonnes in 2015\u201316.214 It settles transactions of more than $10 million a day.215 The exchange is estimated to have reached almost three million farmers across the country216 and has contributed to reduced price variation between regions.217 Informing farmers of the price differentials between different grades of produce has encouraged the production of higher quality crops.218 And farmers receive a larger proportion of the final price \u2013 estimated to have risen from 38 percent before the exchange was opened to 70 percent in 2012.219 211 IFPRI (2008).

The examples above are only a few of the kinds of innovations that countries are taking to improve transparency for more effective investment in the SDGs. The examples from Mexico and Nepal highlight efforts to improve transparency about investments in priorities that go beyond the structure of national budgets, reporting on investment against the SDGs and in climate change respectively. They highlight the steps that governments may need to take to create systems for mapping spending against these cross- cutting priorities, and the example from Nepal highlights efforts to go beyond pure transparency alone to increase accountability by enhancing access to key information and promoting its use for effective scrutiny of public spending. The examples from Thailand and the Dominican Republic highlight steps that can be taken to improve transparency and accountability in key areas of public\u2013private interactions, covering public procurement from the private sector and fiscal investment incentives respectively. Improving transparency and efficiency in these and other areas of direct public\u2013private interaction is an important step towards integrated approaches to financing the SDGs. Finally, the examples from the United Kingdom and Ethiopia highlight other cases of improved transparency bolstering progress towards the SDGs. The United Kingdom is the first country to mandate reporting of gender pay ratios, while the Ethiopian example highlights the importance of transparency for effective, inclusive market development. Version 1.0 63 Conclusion 220 At the time of writing, in September 2018. Countries around the world are looking for ways to mobilize greater and more impactful investments in the SDGs. There is wide recognition of the need for more integrated approaches to financing, where public and private resources contribute to different aspects of sustainable development according to their specific characteristics. The DFAs that have been completed or are underway across more than 25 countries worldwide220 have highlighted the demand that exists from policymakers for innovations that will help strengthen an integrated approach to financing. In particular, there is demand across many contexts to strengthen the integration of planning and finance policy functions and to develop more holistic public and private approaches to financing the SDGs or national development plans. These two aspects of integration are critical for implementing the kind of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b80c04f-92cc-4102-9ae0-03802258061d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b80c04f-92cc-4102-9ae0-03802258061d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Integrated Financing Solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/integrated-financing-solutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f829dc2e0dfcc2e17c4f7a7aef5ebfd3a547947bac5d237802dde4840567bed5"}}, "hash": "f829dc2e0dfcc2e17c4f7a7aef5ebfd3a547947bac5d237802dde4840567bed5", "text": "integrated national financing framework called for by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This report has presented examples of a wide range of innovations that countries around the world are using to strengthen these fundamental aspects of an integrated approach to financing the SDGs. In this way, this report is a complement to the DFA guidebook and can be used in DFA processes, and more widely, to inspire thinking about the kinds of solutions that may be appropriate for the financing challenges that policymakers face in a given context. It has looked at examples across a range of policy and institutional structures that can help government to play its role in implementing and instigating such an approach. The examples presented highlighted innovations that talk directly to these factors, focusing on steps for strengthening the alignment of national plans and financing policies as well as efforts to enhance and better integrate policies towards key private finance flows \u2013 notably private sector investment and remittances. The report also examined innovations in key supporting or cross-cutting areas, looking at reforms that improve the ability to track financing and monitor the contributions that different flows make towards SDG outcomes, and to strengthen transparency and accountability systems. Improvements in these areas can have a significant impact on policymaking and partnership and collaboration between actors. The aim of this report is to inspire ideas about potential solutions to the financing challenges faced by policymakers across a variety of contexts.

For some, problems arise while they are already employed, especially when they are trying to engage in a social transition in the workplace. For many, however, problems arise at the job hiring stage. Identification documents and educational certificates often \u2018out\u2019 trans people, even when their physical appearance does not. With employers either prejudiced or anxious about the possible reactions of co- workers and customers, trans people don\u2019t get hired. In order to avoid unemployment, many trans people find themselves forced to enter casual and low-paid occupations that are not commensurate with their abilities. These jobs can sometimes be exploitative, underpaid and provide no security or long-term livelihood. For many, especially trans women, sex work becomes a way of putting food on the table. Employment discrimination in trans communities is a human rights and public health issue. Yet, few jurisdictions in the region have effective anti-discrimination legislation to provide protection against discriminatory hiring practices. As with all of APTN\u2019s work, this study was done in consultation with trans community members, with trans people leading the process at every step. This is what makes the work unique and impactful. The methodology of the project was strategically developed to be inclusive - empowering trans individuals by training them as country leads in the project. This report, \u201cDenied Work: An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia\u201d is the first research project on such a scale examining discrimination against trans people seeking employment in the region. As evidenced by the report, trans people experience significant barriers to even obtain interviews for jobs compared to similarly qualified cisgender applicants. This study is indicative of discrimination faced by trans people at the initial stages of job application. There needs to be continued research and dialogue on employment discrimination of trans people. A heartfelt thanks to our country research assistants, Peeranee Suparak (Ami), Thailand, Chu Thanh Ha, Vietnam, and Dorian Wilde, Malaysia and Singapore, who have been pivotal in gathering the data for each of the countries. We also extend our gratitude to Edmund Settle, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Sam Winter and Catriona Davis-McCabe, Curtin University for their financial and technical support of this project and to the community members and organisations that have provided insights and guidance in the development of the study. Lastly, the strength and heart of this study lies in the diverse partnerships involved. We look forward to this report being utilised to break fundamental barriers, foster collaborations and spark greater dialogue surrounding workplace discrimination and policy changes to advance social protections and the livelihood of trans people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba0979da-4936-4b2c-92fe-521c8609cfc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba0979da-4936-4b2c-92fe-521c8609cfc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7505bc41a017562112cda76d8ad51dc08a2e763ce041fb4e53fb763bb071c365"}, "2": {"node_id": "350960f9-6726-44d8-9bc2-de0a87f9a039", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7331f3d63d0626195ce72fdd29c6ee9d27ea478d23988ecbd6219e401559c987"}}, "hash": "4b333c4877edfee36a846345a956c1c07709a56fe7eb1069a700973afc491516", "text": "Joe Wong Executive Director Asia Pacific Transgender Network Transgender people in Asia and the Pacific and worldwide have a strong sense of pride in their identity.

In using this terminology, it is acknowledged that other local terms are often used in the countries included in this study. 11 Cisgender (or \u2018cis\u2019): A term used to describe a person whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth. It is the opposite term, or antonym, to transgender. Gender expression: A person\u2019s way of communicating gender externally, for example, androgyny, masculinity and/ or femininity. This is done through physical appearance (including clothing, hairstyle, and the use of cosmetics), mannerisms, ways of speaking, and behavioural patterns when interacting with others. Gender identity: A person\u2019s internal sense of being a man, a woman, a third or some alternative gender, a combination of genders or no gender. Everyone has a gender identity. A person\u2019s gender identity may not correspond with their sex assigned at birth. This report acknowledges that people employ different terms to describe their gender identity or expression. In Asia, there is a long history of culturally specific terms for diverse gender identities or expressions. These include kathoey in Thailand and mak nyah in Malaysia. Typically, these terms describe people who were assigned a male sex at birth but whose gender identity or expression does not match the assigned sex. Gender marker: How a person\u2019s gender is recorded on official documents. Gender markers usually include the designations of Male (M) and Female (M) as well as gendered name titles in the forms of Ms., Mrs. and Mr. In a few jurisdictions, the non-binary gender marker \u2018X\u2019, \u2018other\u2019 or \u2018third-gender\u2019 is allowed on some identification. Gender non-conforming: This term is used to describe trans people who identify in a way other than male or female. Intersex/sex characteristics: Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies. Intersex is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural bodily variations. In some cases, intersex traits are visible at birth while in others, they are not apparent until puberty. Some chromosomal intersex variations may not be physically apparent at all. Being intersex relates to biological sex characteristics and is distinct from a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. An intersex person may be straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or asexual, and may identify as female, male, both or neither. LGBT and LGBTI: Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and LGBT and intersex. The terms \u2018LGBT\u2019 and \u2018LGBTI\u2019 are increasingly used by community-based organizations in Asia and the Pacific. While different sexual orientations, gender identities and intersex variations should not necessarily be grouped together, it can be helpful to group issues affecting LGBTI populations together for the purposes of advocacy and solidarity, while acknowledging that there are significant differences between the issues and priorities of each of these populations. However, it is equally important that when referring to the specific needs of one group that the group is mentioned explicitly. Non-binary: A term used for gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine and are outside of the gender binary. The term is synonymous with \u2018gender non- conforming\u2019, as used in this report. Sex: This term refers to the biological characteristics typically used to categorize people as either male or female (see definition of \u2018intersex\u2019). 12 T j T T T T T Sex assigned at birth: The sex to which a person is assigned at, or soon after, birth. This assignment may not accord with a person\u2019s own sense of gender identity as they age. Most people\u2019s gender identity coincides with their sex assigned at birth. However, for transgender people, their gender identity is different from their sex assigned at birth. Sexual orientation: A term referring to a person\u2019s emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, other individuals. A person may be attracted to people of the same gender (homosexual/gay/lesbian), to people of a different gender (heterosexual) or more than one gender (bisexual or pansexual).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfb061de-9ded-424f-abfd-91238738874b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfb061de-9ded-424f-abfd-91238738874b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da633da5a850e17c01094ea96c2c0bf0e7b373e1d4fa19566ee5a808d628d02e"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f9806ad-3620-45ca-b0c8-30504955a96a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ff4cba0fc932a0a180d135826722e4c247ba707b59be52d525d47c6ca8027ea"}}, "hash": "09b9ede42b04953c26a41c89ccd9b19bad51c4be7dad542c272e032eef082a35", "text": "SOGI, SOGIE and SOGIESC: The terms sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), sexual orientation and gender identity and expression (SOGIE) and sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC) are often used as a way of describing minority groups without making assumptions about how they identify.

It involved sending pairs of resumes in response to entry-level job advertisements to examine how signals of gender identity (\u2018cis\u2019 or \u2018trans\u2019) affect the likelihood of receiving a positive response to a job application. During an extensive pilot phase in each country, pairs of resumes were carefully piloted, and matched for qualifications and experience in order to ensure equivalent attractiveness in the job market. Subsequently, in the main part of the study, each resume in a pair was assigned a gender identity marker\u2014either \u2018trans\u2019 or \u2018cis\u2019\u2014at random. Applicants were marked as \u2018trans\u2019 in two ways: first, by way of explicit gender identification inconsistent with the legal sex indicated, and second, by way of a use name inconsistent with the legal name. Applicants were marked as cis by way of gender (\u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019 only) and legal name (no use name indicated). Consistent with common practice in applying for jobs in Singapore and Thailand, resumes also included a photo, with the photo chosen to match gender identity. Applicants were marked as cisgender by way of a simple designation as \u2018female\u2019 or \u2018male\u2019, with a name and photo. The key findings from this study are as follows: Trans people face discrimination when seeking employment in the South-East Asian countries studied. Alarmingly, this occurs even before the interview stage. Trans people are overall significantly less likely than cisgender people to receive a positive response to a job application. Across all job sectors targeted, and both genders examined in the study (male and female), the cis applicants overall received an average 50.6 percent2 more positive responses to job applications than trans applicants. They were 54.5 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. This was despite the resumes being rigorously tested to ensure equivalent attractiveness in the job market. Overall, a cis woman was 59.6 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans woman. She was 64.2 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. A cis man was 40.8 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans man, and 44.4 percent more likely to receive an invitation for an interview. Discrimination was evident in each country studied. Overall, our data indicated that the worst discrimination against trans people was in Singapore, with trans women and trans men affected to a similar extent. Cis applicants there were 81.5 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (76.5 percent more likely for cis women and 90 percent for cis men), and 107.2 percent more likely to get invited to interview, more than double (112.5 percent for cis women and 100 percent for cis men). Viet Nam was not far behind. Cis applicants were 70.1 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (68.3 percent more likely for cis women and 71.9 percent for cis men), and 45.8 percent more likely to be invited to an interview (54.4 percent for cis women and 38 percent for cis men).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9198985-1906-4185-a195-64c0892a67f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9198985-1906-4185-a195-64c0892a67f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f80983df7ce93d3db8a9889eb8f47317e59a51e2936ea7f29339483054b190c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "5db9a991-92c2-45cb-88ec-e42de364b88b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee4ef112f963f76d9ff755153f1bf69d0847de49d6e40953d3cd088ca0d29ce0"}}, "hash": "b9761995f77b31842746b1103d35eb211d42cdb4524c5a0e72a1b0bb0454d42d", "text": "In Malaysia, cis applicants were 50 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (64 percent more likely for cis women and 37.5 percent cis men), and 66.1 percent more likely to be invited to an interview (72.4 percent for cis women and 60.6 percent for cis men).

By comparing responses, the research showed levels of discrimination in each country and job sector. In summary, across the four countries and in each of the job sectors studied, it is clear that trans women and men encounter far greater difficulty in being invited to attend an interview (or to even receive a positive response) than cis applicants with equivalent resumes. Summary & Key Findings Authors\u2019 Note This report adds significantly to our understanding of discrimination against trans people in Southeast Asia. Our field experiment methodology provides confirmation for what trans people have told us for years - that they are often shut out of the job market. But this study represents much more than its findings. It is an example of how trans community and researchers can work together, collaborating as equal partners in work that can inform advocacy, and potentially impact on public policy and enhance the lives of trans people. The Curtin and APTN teams worked together to develop the research proposal and secure funding for this project. While APTN managed the funds, both teams worked together to select research assistants, to train them, and to manage the project. We collaborated to write the report. We were partners throughout. In a world in which trans community members often feel ill-served, even exploited, by those who research their lives, the Southeast Asian Job Audit represents a shining example of how things can be. Sam Winter and Catriona Davis-McCabe 14 0. 2.3 4.5 6. 8. 1 3 5 7 9 The key findings from this study are as follows. For Viet Nam, the data indicated that cis applicants were 70.1 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (68.3 percent more likely for cis women and 71.9 percent for cis men), and 45.8 percent more likely to be invited to an interview (54.4 percent for cis women and 38 percent for cis men). V. Across all job sectors targeted, and two genders examined in the study (male and female), the cis applicants overall received an average 50.6 percent1 more positive responses to job applications than trans applicants. They were 54.5 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. This was despite the resumes being rigorously tested to ensure equivalent attractiveness in the job market. II. Trans people routinely face discrimination when seeking employment in the South-East Asian countries studied. Alarmingly, this occurs even before the interview stage. Trans people are overall significantly less likely than cisgender people to receive a positive response to a job application. I. Overall, a cis woman was 59.6 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans woman. She was 64.2 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. A cis man was 40.8 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans man, and 44.4 percent more likely to receive an invitation for an interview. III. Discrimination was evident in each country studied. Overall, the data indicated very high levels of discrimination against trans people in Singapore, with trans women and trans men affected to a similar extent. Cis applicants there were 81.5 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (76.5 percent more likely for cis women and 90 percent for cis men), and 107.2 percent more likely to get invited to interview (112.5 percent for cis women and 100 percent for cis men). IV. 15 1 3 5 7 9 0. 2.3 4.5 6. 8. In Malaysia, cis applicants were 50 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (64 percent more likely for cis women and 37.5 percent cis men), and 66.1 percent more likely to be invited to an interview (72.4 percent for cis women and 60.6 percent for cis men). VI.

Evidence of discrimination was found against trans people in 27 out of these 30 comparisons. The exception to this general finding was for trans men. Trans men in a few cases were as likely as or more likely than their cis counterparts to be invited to an interview, but these numbers were small: Out of 840 invitations to interview, 12 trans and 4 cis gender male Thai computer science graduates, 6 trans and 6 cis gender male Malaysian psychology graduates, or 6 trans and 5 cis gender male Singaporean school leavers were invited to interviews. VIII. Raw data underlined the scale of missed opportunities across the four countries. While the job market was challenging for all applicants, the 1500 cis applications yielded 790 positive responses, of which 507 were invitations to interview. By contrast, the corresponding trans applications resulted in only 530 positive responses, of which only 333 were invitations to interview. There were, therefore, 174 lost interview opportunities (104 for trans women, and 70 for trans men). IX.

Equal access to employment is not a reality for trans people across much of the world.3 MALAYSIA Trans people in Malaysia are not legally able to change their identity documents to reflect their self- defined gender, regardless of their stage of transition; be it medical (by way of access to gender-affirming healthcare) or social.10 Due to this, all trans applicants for employment must \u2018out\u201911 themselves to employers during the application process when providing their name and identity information.

This research had not been published at the time of the writing of this report. 20 SINGAPORE Singapore has one of the more progressive legal frameworks for trans people in South-East Asia, allowing legal gender recognition \u2013 the ability to change one\u2019s name and gender marker on one\u2019s legal documents.25 However, stigma and discrimination against trans people in society are rampant.26,27 Furthermore, as is the norm in most countries in the world, sexual orientation and gender identity are not clearly understood by the general public, with widespread discriminatory attitudes as the norm.28 Trans men are largely invisible in contemporary discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity. In Singapore, at the time of writing this report, there was no research on employment specifically about trans people. One study of LGBT people states that 15 percent of LGBT employees report experiencing discrimination of some sort in employment.29 As mentioned earlier, transgender people in Singapore are legally able to change their identity documents to reflect their self-defined gender. However, applicants for this change must provide evidence of gender- affirming surgery. The Singaporean National Health system does not cover the costs of these procedures \u2013 in fact, the required surgeries have not been offered at Singaporean hospitals since 200330 meaning that trans people who are unable to afford surgery or choose not to have surgery for a variety of reasons are not able to change their documents. The problem then is that a trans person who cannot have surgery cannot change their documents. They are therefore unable to access THAILAND Research from Thailand on trans people\u2019s access to employment has been limited to self-reported data from trans respondents with sample sizes too small for statistical analysis. However, research indicates that starting from educational settings, trans women in Thailand are pressured by teachers into studies and professions deemed \u201csoft\u201d and discouraged from pursing high-status fields.31 Trans students are regularly barred from taking their university exams when wearing clothes that match their gender identities.

At the same time, bias and discrimination against transgender people are not against the law. 21 A UNDP-USAID report indicates that employment discrimination against transgender people begins before employment itself, with transgender respondents indicating problems in application and interview processes, as well as during employment.33 A study by the International Labour Organization (ILO) found that: \u201c in the private sector, transgender job applicants are often given psychological tests not given to other applicants, and transgender and tom [An informal Thai expression for a female who acts in a masculine way] applicants are often asked about their sexuality in job interviews and subsequently denied the job.34 \u201d In this study, a trans woman respondent indicated that she had watched as a job application she submitted was torn up in front of her.35 Trans men respondents also indicated being asked inappropriate questions about their sexuality during interviews and were often relegated to \u2018back room\u2019 roles when hired, such as stocking shelves or housekeeping.36 Many trans people end up entering informal, unsalaried or illegal positions, such as manual labour or sex work.37 Trans people in Thailand are not legally able to change their identity documents to reflect their self- defined gender, regardless of the stage of their medical or social transition. Due to this, all trans applicants for employment must \u2018out\u2019 themselves to employers during the application process when providing their name and identity information. This leads to increased exposure to harassment and degrading treatment of applicants.38 All Thai people assigned male at birth are legally required to report for military conscription. Trans women are exempt from military service but still must present themselves for the conscription process in order to receive their exemption letter. Until 2011, dismissal from service for trans women was classified as due to a \u201cpermanent mental disorder\u201d, in line with government adoption of the World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10).39 Military documents are regularly required by potential employers during the hiring process.

As of October 2018, the Department of Women\u2019s Affairs and Family Development, the Committee\u2019s Secretariat, reports that six cases have been settled for transgender people through this Committee. 22 VIET NAM Viet Nam has a cultural history of respect towards trans people, particularly in the context of cultural and traditional roles.43 However, in more recent times, stigma and discrimination against trans people have occurred more frequently.44 Sexual orientation and gender identity are not explicitly separated as concepts in general discussion; trans women are often considered to be a more visible and extreme form of gay men. Trans men are largely invisible in modern discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity.45 One study from the Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and the Environment (iSEE) of 2,363 respondents reported discrimination based on SOGI in the family, schools, workplaces, healthcare, housing and public areas. Of four groups, transgender people reported experiencing discrimination based on SOGI in the past 12 months the most often (compared to lesbians, gay men and bisexual people): 49.4 percent for trans men and 48.5 percent for trans women, although the study cautions the use of the figures because trans women were only 1.4 percent of respondents.46 One online study in Viet Nam found that 85 percent of trans women respondents had dropped out of school due to bullying and violence.47,48 This has significant impact on employment prospects for trans people, who suffer from chronic unemployment and underemployment.49 Many trans women perform as funeral singers as their main profession, a position which allows them to present themselves as women. However, these performances are often characterized by derision and mockery from cis people attending the funerals.50 An in-depth study on self-reported employment discrimination found that trans women often work in informal or unregulated industries because of lack of opportunity in the traditional job market.51 The same study found that 52 percent of transgender respondents received most of their income from family and friends; at the time, the average unemployment rate was 7 percent for the general population. This study also found that trans people in traditional employment were more likely to be employed in the food services (36 percent) or to own their own business (18 percent). When these responses were probed in interviews, respondents indicated that prospective employers had expressed that they wanted non-trans employees or that their co-workers had lost respect for them when they \u201cOne online study in Vietnam found that 85 percent of trans women respondents had dropped out of school due to bullying and violence. This has significant impact on the employment prospects for trans people, who suffer from chronic unemployment and underemployment.\u201d 23 became aware of their trans identity. More than half of trans women respondents and over a quarter of trans men had been forced to leave a job once their trans status became known.52 The iSEE study reported that transgender people had a job rejection rate that was three times higher than that of homosexual and bisexual people (and almost 30 percent of LGBT people were denied job applications for being LGBT). Transgender people reported facing discrimination in pay and promotions, being limited to low- level positions, and being unfairly treated for being LGBT. Verbal harassment or abuse from managers, colleagues and clients was reported often (ranging from 40 percent to 68.8 percent). Fifty percent of trans women and 41.7 percent of trans men were forced to wear uniforms not conforming to their gender.53 Vietnam\u2019s Civil Code 2015, which came into effect on 1 January 2017, allowed people who have undergone gender-affirmation surgery to register under their new gender.54 This improves employment opportunities for those who have undergone gender-affirmation surgery, but transgender applicants for employment who have not had surgery or for another reason cannot register their chosen gender must \u2018out\u2019 themselves to employers at the very beginning of the application process when providing their name and identity information. This leads to increased exposure to harassment and degrading treatment for applicants,55 and to negative impacts on the self-esteem of trans people.56 Further research", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02afff57-17d6-4f07-bddb-b6e4a488d7d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "02afff57-17d6-4f07-bddb-b6e4a488d7d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "299a2c1ff4db9f5c0fac826c29e9e73915f0c5487ccc063a7a07793d93e51ca2"}}, "hash": "299a2c1ff4db9f5c0fac826c29e9e73915f0c5487ccc063a7a07793d93e51ca2", "text": "on the impact of legal gender recognition on the lives and livelihoods of trans people in Vietnam is necessary.

One used an in-person audit and the other two were correspondence tests. All were small-scale US studies. The first was a small in-person employment audit conducted in 2008 in New York by an organization called Make the Road NY.58 Twenty- four retail stores in Manhattan were tested. Cis testers received 11 employment offers, while trans testers received only 2, suggesting a considerable level of discrimination against trans applicants. While the size and generalizability of this study is limited, results clearly indicate significant discrimination against trans people during hiring. Bardales59 conducted a correspondence test in Texas to assess discrimination against trans women. Bardales sent matching resumes \u2013 one with a marker of the applicant being trans and one without \u2013 in response to 109 online job advertisements within the customer service and food management job sectors in two cities in Texas. All applications were from women (trans or cis). Cis applicants received responses 54.1 percent more often than trans applicants. As in the case of the Make the Road Some of the most convincing field evidence for discrimination against minority groups has come from using an audit methodology, in which the experiences of members of a minority community are examined in a specific social situation, and are then compared with the experiences of persons in the general population in that same situation. Previous Audit Research research in New York, this Texan study was of limited scope. It examined discrimination against women only, was confined to two job sectors, and involved a relatively small number of applications. So, questions remain about its generalizability. The researchers made equivalent resumes based on their own ideas, with no validation process. Most recently, in a report entitled Qualified and Transgender, the District of Columbia (DC) Office of Human Rights conducted a correspondence test examining hiring discrimination against trans people across a range of job sectors.60 It is important to note that DC has anti-discrimination policies in place to protect against such discrimination. The applications targeted 50 jobs. There were a total of 200 applications, 4 for each job, from trans men, trans women and cisgender applicants, and other gender non-conforming persons. The authors reported that employers made responses to 21 jobs, and that in 10 of these, there was clear evidence of discrimination against trans and gender non-conforming applicants. The worst discrimination appeared to be against trans male applicants reporting previous work experience at a trans advocacy organization. In terms of job sector, the restaurant industry appeared to be the most discriminatory among the job sectors examined in DC. Once again, this study was small, limiting its generalizability. Moreover, the study explicitly ensured that each trans and gender non-conforming applicant was more highly qualified than the corresponding cis applicant. It is impossible to know what may have been the exact impact of this aspect of the methodology. However, it is likely that it may have enhanced the apparent employability of the trans applicants, thereby masking discrimination on the basis of their gender identity. 25 The research methodology used was \u2018correspondence auditing\u2019.1 This allowed for a randomized experimental design, which could provide direct evidence of any discrimination against trans people in job hiring practices in the real world. It involved sending pairs of resumes in response to entry-level job advertisements to examine how signals of gender identity (\u2018cis\u2019 or \u2018trans\u2019) affect the likelihood of receiving a positive response to a job application. During an extensive pilot phase in each country, pairs of resumes were carefully piloted, and matched for qualifications and experience in order to ensure equivalent attractiveness in the job market. Subsequently, in the main part of the study, each resume in a pair was assigned a gender identity marker\u2014either \u2018trans\u2019 or \u2018cis\u2019\u2014at random.

Across all job sectors targeted, and both genders examined in the study (male and female), the cis applicants overall received an average 50.6 percent2 more positive responses to job applications than trans applicants. They were 54.5 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. This was despite the resumes being rigorously tested to ensure equivalent attractiveness in the job market. Overall, a cis woman was 59.6 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans woman. She was 64.2 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. A cis man was 40.8 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans man, and 44.4 percent more likely to receive an invitation for an interview. Discrimination was evident in each country studied. Overall, our data indicated that the worst discrimination against trans people was in Singapore, with trans women and trans men affected to a similar extent. Cis applicants there were 81.5 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (76.5 percent more likely for cis women and 90 percent for cis men), and 107.2 percent more likely to get invited to interview, more than double (112.5 percent for cis women and 100 percent for cis men). Viet Nam was not far behind. Cis applicants were 70.1 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (68.3 percent more likely for cis women and 71.9 percent for cis men), and 45.8 percent more likely to be invited to an interview (54.4 percent for cis women and 38 percent for cis men). In Malaysia, cis applicants were 50 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (64 percent more likely for cis women and 37.5 percent cis men), and 66.1 percent more likely to be invited to an interview (72.4 percent for cis women and 60.6 percent for cis men). In Thailand, cis applicants were 24.1 percent more likely than trans applicants to get a positive response (42.2 percent more likely for cis women and 5.6 percent for cis men), and 33.1 percent more likely to get invited to an interview (44.9 percent for cis women and 20.3 percent for cis men). The study examined the experience of men and women in a number of job sectors in each country. It was possible to make 30 comparisons between trans and cis applicants in terms of the frequencies with which they were invited to interview. Evidence of discrimination was found against trans people in 27 out of these 30 comparisons. The only exceptions to this general finding were for trans men. Those trans men who were Thai accountancy graduates, Malaysian psychology graduates, or Singaporean school leavers were all as likely as or more likely than their cis counterparts to be invited to an interview. Raw data underlined the scale of missed opportunities. While the job market was challenging for all applicants, the 1500 cis applications yielded 790 positive responses, of which 507 were invitations to interview. By contrast, the corresponding trans applications resulted in only 530 positive responses, of which only 333 were invitations to interview. There were, therefore, 174 lost interview opportunities (104 for trans women, and 70 for trans men). It should be noted that the study did not examine what happens beyond the initial application stage. Anecdotal and survey data across the region suggest that trans people encounter further discrimination when they get to an interview, and when they enter employment.3 The research methodology used was \u2018correspondence auditing\u2019.1 This allowed for a randomized experimental design, which could provide direct evidence of any discrimination against trans people in job hiring practices in the real world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2403a8bf-e29b-4361-bb27-4538bb7cf38f": {"__data__": {"id_": "2403a8bf-e29b-4361-bb27-4538bb7cf38f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a48164028dfe7cedc9887ff8de9e85992f3461b755b4dff043ac6d7acc5e1b16"}, "2": {"node_id": "408aa95b-188a-4282-8158-b3b5020acb25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ad23fa669e0d7f25971fa830f1b3eb1669f9c95e33d1074fd4b72e7ce8fd3e0"}}, "hash": "1bb26b9b431a38c432f057b06bfacb288fd817043330bcebf73ff9d396876bd3", "text": "It involved sending pairs of resumes in response to entry-level job advertisements to examine how signals of gender identity (\u2018cis\u2019 or \u2018trans\u2019) affect the likelihood of receiving a positive response to a job", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c771ad0-8ab0-4d6b-9948-291c842fc60b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c771ad0-8ab0-4d6b-9948-291c842fc60b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "932d3a4933edb2315f06aca4bb3fc55fd9a7d2b90501ad131291a1ae13e3efcf"}, "3": {"node_id": "79fa8137-1178-45d8-8073-21472cb37a7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "915ad5e7082b3129c06b69c589ff7a863b9b575d49be6e004942d7b9160fef86"}}, "hash": "cfc73893deff8ac2528759ceab3d13e9b2d3875fc29909712287d3ae75a400e7", "text": "application.

Audit Research for this Study The research methodology used was \u2018correspondence auditing\u2019.61 This allowed for a randomized experimental design, which could provide direct evidence of any discrimination against trans people in job hiring practices in the real world. It involved sending pairs of resumes in response to entry-level job advertisements to examine how signals of gender identity (\u2018cis\u2019 or \u2018trans\u2019) affect the likelihood of receiving a positive response to a job application. For this study, four research assistants worked on the project over a period of six to eight months. Each research assistant lived in the country where they were collecting data and were knowledgeable about the local job market. As a first step, an advisory group meeting was held in each country with members of the trans community to discuss the local job market, job applications and ideas for possible gender identity markers. Resumes were then developed based on the feedback from the advisory group. Pairs of resumes were developed for each of the job sectors (four job sectors in Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam, and three in Singapore, see Table 1 for details). The job sectors chosen for each country took account of the job markets in each country at that time. The pairs of resumes were tested to see if they were similarly attractive in their intended job market. This was done by sending resumes out in response to job advertisements and counting employer responses. The responses came by email or phone and were coded into three types of positive response categories (\u2018call us\u2019, \u2018provide more information\u2019 and \u2018come to an interview\u2019) and two types of negative response (\u2018not interested\u2019 and no response at all). McNemar\u2019s test was used for detecting a discrepancy in the number of responses received for the two resumes.62 This enabled an assessment of whether any apparent difference in attractiveness was real or due to chance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9c79d4e-0cfd-4db2-99ea-86c015763024": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9c79d4e-0cfd-4db2-99ea-86c015763024", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca54f102c9599031c84bfff18a1250616f375326b66fa64fb53bcbc11caffac8"}, "2": {"node_id": "21f81579-af5b-4039-9b2b-b3e8a1328b48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e80c6f156a5882d5c94e2f7d81add5fbe0ab11097ffc688eafceac9c56d7c35"}}, "hash": "2d20996107a7512b21d59bca86937afb3d6ee26bf7672bdaa16ee52e05bf3d5b", "text": "Where one resume appeared more attractive than another, possible reasons were discussed, suitable changes made, and the testing process was then restarted, continuing in this way until statistical equivalence was reached (i.e. the point at which the statistics indicated a close enough", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbd3cb55-96c3-4d9c-98e3-4f2e20e68999": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbd3cb55-96c3-4d9c-98e3-4f2e20e68999", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32ebf252d8d9cef388bebd1ab706ba608bdbd2d8e806553d33019c9abdf518e3"}}, "hash": "32ebf252d8d9cef388bebd1ab706ba608bdbd2d8e806553d33019c9abdf518e3", "text": "equivalence to continue). 26 Once the resumes in each pair were deemed statistically equivalent, a gender identity marker (either trans or cis) was assigned to each resume at random. Applicants were marked as either cis or trans in two ways: by a gender/sex marker and by a name marker. Gender/sex marker: Trans applicants indicated that their gender identity differed from their sex assigned at birth. In Thailand, they did so by indicating sex and gender separately. Applicants in all other countries simply indicated \u2018trans man\u2019 or \u2018trans woman\u2019. In Viet Nam, the Vietnamese phrase for trans man or trans woman was added alongside the English term. Cis applicants simply indicated their gender. Name marker: Trans applicants indicated their legal name, with their \u2018use name\u2019 in brackets. In Viet Nam, these names were explicitly marked as \u2018full name\u2019 and \u2018preferred name\u2019. Cis applicants simply indicated their name. Singaporean and Thai resumes also carried a photo, in keeping with what was understood as common practice. The photos were of cis people. An effect of this was that the resumes communicated to prospective employers that our trans applicants \u201cpassed\u201d; that is, they appeared to be cis. Over several months, applications were sent out, being careful to allow several days between sending out the first and second application in a pair. The research proceeded in two phases. In the first phase, applications to 100 jobs were sent out in each of the job sectors targeted, pairing either trans and cis women or trans and cis men (depending on the country and job sector involved). In the second phase, another 100 jobs were targeted in that sector, but switching to the other gender. Any remaining lack of equivalence in the resumes was controlled by moving the trans and cis markers between the two resumes in a pair. Any effects arising from the order in which applications were sent out was also controlled, by sending out the application of the trans applicant ahead of the application of the cis applicant half the time and reversing the order for the other half. By the end of the study, 200 jobs were targeted in each of the job sectors chosen for each country. In all, 3,000 jobs were targeted with 6,000 applications. See Table 1 for summary.

Countries & job sectors studied The tables in Appendix 1 summarize the data collected from the four countries. They display response data for applications by cis and trans applicants (male and female) in terms of three positive response categories (\u2018call us\u2019, \u2018provide more information\u2019 and \u2018come to an interview\u2019) and two types of negative response (\u2018not interested\u2019 and no response at all). The tables also provide pooled data within each country for the three positive response types combined, the two negative responses combined, and the four job sectors combined (see final rows). 27 Findings from the Study The data showed that despite equivalent qualifications and experience, trans applicants were less likely than cis applicants to receive a positive response (being invited to contact the employer, being asked for more information, or being invited to attend an interview) across the four job sectors, with trans applicants receiving 106 positive responses compared to 159 for cis applicants to the same jobs.63 At the same time, trans applicants were more likely to get a negative response (that the employer was not interested) or receive no response at all, with trans applicants receiving 694 negative or no responses compared to 641 for cis applicants (see Figures 1 and 2). Malaysia: In Malaysia, it is clear that trans people are discriminated against when seeking employment (see Appendix 1a). Overall, the cis applicants received 50 percent more positive responses than the trans applicants (159 versus 106, respectively). The discrimination experienced by trans women was particularly severe. Cis women received 64 percent more positive responses than trans women (82 versus 50). The corresponding figure for men was 37.5 percent more positive responses (77 positive responses for cis men versus 56 for trans men).

Cis applicants, though no more 28 qualified and experienced than the trans applicants, overall received 66.1 percent more invitations to attend an interview (103 versus 62, respectively). Again, the discrimination faced by trans women was particularly severe. Cis women received 72.4 percent more invitations to attend an interview than trans women (50 versus 29). Cis men received 60.6 percent more invitations (53 for cis men versus 33 for trans men). Discrimination was evident, to varying extents, in all four employment sectors examined. Figures 4a to 4d provide, for each of the four job sectors, percentages corresponding to those in Figure 3. Discrimination was consistent and strong in three of the four sectors. The situation faced by computer science graduates was particularly severe, with cis applicants overall getting invited to attend an interview 127.3 percent more frequently than trans applicants (25 versus 11, respectively). However, there was also discrimination in two of the other sectors, with cis applicants 72.7 percent more likely to get interviews in the business administration sector than trans applicants (38 versus 22), and 58.8 percent more likely in the general sector requiring a school leaver certificate (27 versus 17). The job sector for psychology graduates offered the only comparatively bright spot in this generally dark picture, with cis applicants getting only 8.3 percent more invitations to interview than trans applicants (13 versus 12). In two of the job sectors, computer science and the general sector requiring a school leaver certificate, the discrimination faced by trans women was particularly severe compared with trans men. Cis women with degrees in computer science were 175 percent more likely to be called to interview than equivalently qualified and experienced trans women (11 versus 4, respectively). The corresponding figure for men was 100 percent (14 versus 7 interview invitations). Among school leavers, cis women were 72.7 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than trans women (19 versus 11); the corresponding figure for men was 33.3 percent (8 versus 6). Among psychology graduates, cis women were 16.7 percent more likely than trans women to receive an interview invitation (7 versus 6); for men there was no discrepancy at all. 29 The one remaining job sector showed a rather different pattern. In business administration, trans men shouldered a higher burden of discrimination than trans women. Cis women were 62.5 percent more likely than trans women to be invited to attend an interview (13 versus 8, respectively). Cis men were 78.6 percent more likely than trans men to be invited to attend an interview (25 versus 14). Finally, as a way of standing back and looking at the entire data (see Appendix 1a), it is possible to calculate the relative likelihood of a trans applicant getting specific types of response, as compared with the likelihood for cis applicants. Figure 5 shows the results of this calculation. Discrimination against trans applicants is evident across the full spectrum of possible responses. At one end of the spectrum, trans applicants were disproportionately likely compared with cis applicants to have their applications ignored by employers. \u201cAt one end of the spectrum, trans applicants were disproportionately likely compared with cis applicants to have their applications ignored by employers. At the other end of the spectrum of responses, they were, as discussed previously, less likely to be called to an interview.\u201d 30 At the other end of the spectrum of responses, they were, as discussed previously, less likely to be called to an interview. The more negative the response from an employer, the more likely it was that a trans applicant rather than a cis applicant would encounter it. The more positive the response from an employer, the less likely it was, relative to a cis person, that a trans person would encounter it. 64 31 Despite equivalent qualifications and experience, trans applicants were less likely than cis applicants to receive a positive response (either being invited to contact the employer, being asked for more information, or being invited to attend an interview) across the three job sectors, with trans applicants receiving 81 positive responses compared to 147 for cis applicants to the same jobs.65 At the same time, trans applicants were more likely to get a negative response (that the employer was not interested) or receive no response at all, with trans applicants receiving 519 negative or no responses compared to 453 negative or no responses for cis applicants (see Figures 6 and 7).

The trend towards discrimination against trans applicants was particularly evident in the case of requests to attend an interview (see Figure 8). Cis applicants, though no more qualified and experienced than the trans applicants, nevertheless received 107.1 percent more requests to attend an interview (87 versus 42, respectively). Again, trans women and trans men experienced broadly similar levels of discrimination. Cis women received 112.5 percent more invitations to an interview than trans women (51 versus 24). Cis men received 100 percent more invitations than trans men (36 versus 18). Discrimination was evident, to varying extents, in all three employment sectors examined.

The situation faced by business administration graduates was particularly severe, with cis applicants overall being invited to attend an interview 121.4 percent more frequently than trans 32 applicants (31 versus 14, respectively). Similarly, in information technology, cis applicants were 112.5 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than trans applicants (34 versus 16). The general sector requiring a school leaver certificate was only a little better, with cis applicants 83.3 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than trans applicants (22 versus 12). In two of the job sectors, business administration and information technology, the discrimination faced by trans men was particularly severe, as compared with trans women. Among business administration graduates, cis women were 90.9 percent more likely to be called to interview than equivalently qualified and experienced trans women (21 invitations versus 11, respectively). The corresponding figure for men was 233.3 percent (10 versus 3). Among information technology graduates, cis women were 85.7 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than trans women (13 versus 7). The corresponding figure for men was 133.3 percent (21 versus 9). The remaining job sector, that required a school leaver certificate, showed a rather different pattern, with trans women encountering greatest discrimination. Cis women were 183.3 percent more likely than trans women to be invited to attend an interview (17 versus 6). In a finding that went against the general pattern in Singapore (and 33 the overall pattern in the three other countries), cis men were 16.7 percent less likely to be invited to attend an interview than were trans men (5 versus 6). Again, as a way of standing back and looking at the entire data (see Appendix 1b), we calculated the relative likelihood of a trans applicant getting specific types of response, as compared with the likelihood for cis applicants (See Figure 10).66 Discrimination against trans applicants is evident throughout. At one end of the spectrum, trans applicants were disproportionately likely, compared with cis applicants, to have their applications ignored by employers. At the other end, they were, as reported earlier, less likely to be invited to attend an interview. The more negative the response from an employer, the more likely it was that a trans applicant rather than a cis applicant would encounter it. The converse was also true. The more positive the response from an employer, the less likely it was, relative to a cis person, that a trans person would encounter it. 34 \u201cOverall, the cis applicants received 81.5 percent more positive responses than the trans applicants (147 versus 81, respectively).

It is evident that discrimination was consistent and strong in three of the four sectors. The situation faced by accounting graduates was particularly severe, with cis applicants overall being invited to attend an interview 54.2 percent more frequently than trans applicants (37 versus 24, respectively). Similarly, cis applicants were 51.5 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview in the language sector than trans applicants (50 versus 33).

Among computer science graduates, cis women were 66.7 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than trans women (20 versus 12). By contrast, in a finding that went against the general patterns found in this study in Thailand and the three other countries researched, cis men were invited to attend an interview 58.3 percent less often than trans applicants (5 versus 12). 38 The remaining job sectors showed a somewhat different pattern. In the accounting job sector, it was cis men who, at least in regard to invitations to attend an interview, experienced the greatest discrimination (in comparison to cis women). They were 100 percent more likely than trans men to receive an invitation to attend an interview (14 versus 7, respectively); the discrepancy for women was only 35.3 percent (23 invitations for cis women versus 17 for trans women).

Overall, the cis applicants received 70.1 percent more positive responses than the trans applicants (216 versus 127, respectively). Trans women and trans men experienced broadly similar levels of discrimination. Cis women received 68.3 percent more positive responses than trans women (106 versus 63). Cis men received 71.9 percent more positive responses (110 responses for cis men versus 64 responses for trans men).

Cis men received 38 percent more invitations (69 for cis men versus 50 for trans men). Discrimination was evident, to varying extents, in all four employment sectors examined. Figures 19a to 19d provide, for each of the four job sectors, percentages corresponding to those in Figure 18. The situation faced by graduates in software engineering was particularly severe, with cis applicants overall getting an invitation to attend an interview 73.9 percent more frequently than trans applicants (40 versus 23, respectively). Substantial discrimination was evident in two of the other sectors, with cis applicants 56.5 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview in the hotels and catering sector than trans applicants (36 versus 23), and 43.5 percent more likely in the business administration sector (33 versus 23). The least severe discrimination was in the general sector requiring a school leaver certificate, with cis applicants getting only 14.8 percent more invitations to attend an interview than trans applicants (31 versus 27). In two of the job sectors, business administration and software engineering, the discrimination faced by trans women was particularly severe compared with trans men. Cis women with degrees in business administration were 71.4 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than equivalently qualified and experienced trans women (12 versus 7, respectively). Cis men were 31.3 percent more likely to be invited (21 responses for cis men versus 16 responses for trans men). Among graduates in software engineering, cis women were 85.7 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview than trans women (26 versus 14); cis men were 55.6 percent more likely (14 versus 9). In the other two sectors, it was trans men who experienced the greatest degree of discrimination. Among graduates in the hotels and catering sector, cis 42 men were 66.7 percent more likely than trans men to receive an invitation to attend an interview (15 versus 9, respectively); cis women were 50 percent more likely to receive an invitation than trans women (21 versus 14).

Figure 20 shows the results of this calculation. As was the case in all three other countries, trans applicants were disproportionately likely, as compared with cis applicants, to have their applications ignored by employers.

Alarmingly, this occurs even before the interview stage. Overall, trans people are significantly less likely than cisgender people to receive a positive response to a job application. Across all job sectors targeted for both males and females, the cis applicants overall received fewer negative responses, and an average 50.6 percent69 more positive responses to job applications than trans applicants. They were 54.5 percent more likely to be invited to an interview. This was despite the resumes being rigorously tested earlier to ensure equivalent attractiveness in the job market. Overall, a cis woman was 59.6 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans woman. She was 64.2 percent more likely to be invited to attend an interview. A cis man was 40.8 percent more likely to receive a positive response to a job application than a trans man, and 44.4 percent more likely to receive an invitation to attend an interview (see Figures 21 and 22). 44 By examining results for males and females across a number of job sectors in each country, 30 comparisons could be made between trans and cis applicants in terms of the frequency with which they were invited to attend an interview. Evidence of discrimination against trans people was found in 27 out of these 30 comparisons. The three exceptions all involved trans men: Thai accountancy graduates, Malaysian psychology graduates, and Singaporean school leavers. LOST OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE REGION Overall, the results indicate when a gender identity marker is added to two equivalent resumes, the resume with the trans marker is considerably less likely to receive a positive response than the one with a cis marker. This shows direct evidence of discrimination based on gender identity; it also highlights the actual lost opportunities experienced by trans people when seeking employment in the four South-East Asian countries studied. When the summary data are explored (Appendix 1a to 1e), it can be seen how many opportunities opened up for cis applicants, but not for equally qualified and experienced trans applicants. While the job market was challenging for all applicants, the 1,500 cis applications yielded 790 positive responses, of which 507 were invitations to an interview. By contrast, the corresponding trans applications resulted in only 530 positive responses, of which only 333 were invitations to attend an interview. The cis applicants received 260 more positive responses than the trans applicants. This represents 160 lost opportunities by trans women and 100 by trans men of receiving a positive response. Looking more specifically at invitations to attend interviews (the most positive of responses observed in this study), 507 cis applicants were invited to attend an interview, as compared with only 333 trans applicants. This represents 174 interview opportunities that were missed by trans applicants (104 missed by trans women, and 70 missed by trans men). It is worth remembering again that, before the gender identity markers were added, these resumes had been carefully piloted to be equivalently attractive in the job market. The jobs targeted by our applications were real jobs, and, as far as the employers were concerned, these were real applicants. Those 174 missed interview opportunities therefore represented 174 cases in which those involved in recruitment were, in effect, denying employment opportunities to applicants they believed to be trans. In any given case, while it is not possible to say whether an opportunity was clearly denied as a result of the applicant\u2019s trans identity, the general picture is clearly one of discrimination against trans applicants. 47 \u201cOverall, the results indicate when a gender identity marker is added to two equivalent resumes, the resume with the trans marker is considerably less likely to receive a positive response than the one with a cis marker.\u201d 48 Conclusion & Discussion This study revealed disturbing levels of discrimination against trans applicants in seeking employment. While it was not possible to identify discrimination related to specific job applications, or with any specific employer, the overall pattern is very clear. Across the four countries and in each of the job sectors studied, it is clear that trans women and trans men encountered far greater difficulty in being invited to attend an interview (or in even receiving a positive response) than cis applicants with equivalent resumes. It is noted again that: (a) the pairs of resumes were carefully tested at the pilot stage to ensure confidence they were equivalently attractive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4082e249-aa18-4769-8248-c6e221267705": {"__data__": {"id_": "4082e249-aa18-4769-8248-c6e221267705", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d807f01c6baf5efc2fc5a2772a82e4fd7f140af83d5cacbe5a4f4cb31add8854"}}, "hash": "d807f01c6baf5efc2fc5a2772a82e4fd7f140af83d5cacbe5a4f4cb31add8854", "text": "in the job market; (b) \u2018Applicants\u2019 were applying for real jobs, advertised in the job market; and (c) there were no indications of any employers responding to applications in an inauthentic way. It can be confidently asserted that the data from this report shows real discrimination against trans applicants in the employment market. Throughout the study, the same resumes were used by male and female applicants, whether cis or trans. Despite this, cis women overall received more positive responses than cis men did. The same was true for invitations to attend interviews. Similarly, the study suggests that there may be, in the job sectors studied in the four countries, a degree of sex discrimination in favour of cis women as compared with cis men. While the study showed discrimination in favour of cis women compared with cis men (and a similar pattern between trans women and trans men), this discrimination (cis women versus cis men) was substantially less severe than the trans discrimination identified (cis women versus trans women, and cis men versus trans men). The question arises of how discrimination relating to gender (women and men) intersects with discrimination relating to trans people (trans people and cis people). This study could not answer this question. While male and female resumes were compared in the same job markets, this was not done with the same advertised jobs (in contrast to what was done with the paired cis and trans applications). Therefore, a further study could be useful in which gender and trans discrimination might be compared directly and simultaneously (perhaps by sending four matched applications for a job (cis man, trans man, cis woman and trans woman). As found when considering intersectional discrimination, where one factor 49 compounds another, the same may be true in relation to employment discrimination where discrimination based on gender and that based on transgender status will combine to be more severe. Other limitations of this study are as follows. First, the study did not examine what happens beyond the initial application stage. Anecdotal and survey data across the region suggest that trans people encounter discrimination when they get to an interview, and when they enter employment. Second, the study examined discrimination against trans people at entry-level jobs (either for graduates or school leavers). It does not address discrimination against trans people further up the career ladder. Once again, anecdotal data suggest a glass ceiling, beyond which trans people find it difficult to progress. Third, in order to maximize positive responses, resumes were made particularly attractive in terms of qualifications and experiences. It is unknown what degree of discrimination against trans people might have been observed if the resumes used for cis and trans applicants had been weaker. Fourth, advice received in Singapore and Thailand was that it is common practice for applicants to insert photos in their resumes. This was done, therefore, in these two countries in our study. All photos used were of cis people (even those used for trans applicants). Any employer looking at photos of trans applicants would likely have noticed that they \u2018passed\u2019 in their identified gender. It is unknown what discrimination applicants would have encountered if they had not \u2018passed\u2019 so well in their photos. Anecdotal evidence suggests that trans people who are unwilling or unable to pass well find the job market particularly difficult. Fifth, the discrimination that gender non-binary persons may face while applying for a job was not explored. It can be speculated that, where they indicate their gender status at application, gender non-binary applicants may experience even greater levels of discrimination than trans women and trans men. Finally, a word of caution. Across much of the world, an increasing amount of recruitment is being done through recruitment agencies and using recruitment software, some of which makes use of artificial intelligence. Consequently, the relatively poor response rates evident for trans people in this study may reflect prejudice and discrimination in the agencies hired to recruit employees, or the programming of software being used in recruitment. In effect, a company advertising a job, and which appears at first glance to be discriminating against trans applicants, may not actually be directly responsible for the discrimination at all. Indeed, it may not even be aware that discrimination is being perpetrated. 50 Recommendations Trans people commonly report being discriminated against in relation to jobs. These personal testimonies are reflected in many of the reports already cited, including the findings of this research. As is evident from the data, discrimination is apparent even at the first step in recruitment \u2013 the application.

With employers either prejudiced or anxious about the possible reactions of co-workers and customers, trans people do not get hired. Consistent with the personal testimonies of trans people, this report\u2019s research reveals discrimination is likely to lead to trans unemployment rates consistently higher than for the cis population, with a negative impact on well-being. To better understand the impact of employment discrimination on transgender people, further research needs to be conducted (such as in this report), moving beyond trans people\u2019s personal testimonies, building on the body of evidence already provided in this study\u2019s findings, and measuring job discrimination directly on a large scale. The focus on trans people is proposed because of the frequency with which trans people report difficulty in getting jobs, and the apparent consequences in terms of emotional and economic well-being, pressure to enter sex work, and the consequent vulnerability to HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections. The following recommendations are for approaches to reduce discrimination in job hiring based on gender identity. They focus on legislatures and government agencies, labour unions, employers and the workplace environment, as well as trans communities and their allies. The report also makes recommendations for further research. LABOUR UNIONS \u2013 Develop guidelines for employers to prevent discrimination based on gender identity and expression. \u2013 Periodically review businesses to ensure that they are complying with non-discriminatory guidelines as they affect trans people. \u2013 Conduct annual job audits and release reports on hiring discrimination that affects trans people. POLICYMAKERS & GOVERNMENTS \u2013 Include gender identity as grounds for protection from discrimination in relevant anti-discrimination acts, legislation and policy. \u2013 Institute an effective monitoring and complaint mechanism to address discrimination against trans people at it relates to recruitment and other workplace issues. 51 WORKPLACES \u2013 Develop and implement a code of conduct, incorporating anti- discrimination policies regarding recruitment, promotion and evaluation criteria, compensation, dismissal, and actionable dispute mechanisms; and ensure the company policies align with fair employment practices. \u2013 Create an independent complaint committee that investigates and follows up on complaints in a confidential, unbiased and safe way. \u2013 Provide workplace training regarding human rights, discrimination and harassment, including as related to trans people, and provide diversity training for the workforce, incorporating material on gender identity and gender-sensitivity including as related to trans people. \u2013 Ask employees the gender identity they self-identify with, and the pronouns they wish to be used, and respect their wishes, and allow trans persons to express their self-identity in the workplace, such as by choice of washroom, uniform requirements and names used in email addresses. \u2013 Ensure that those involved in recruitment, whether they work in- house or for a recruitment agency, comply with a non-discriminatory hiring policy. Ensure that any artificial intelligence or other software used for recruitment operates in a non- discriminatory way. \u2013 Periodically review the hiring process as it relates to trans people, and collect candidate feedback on the process. \u2013 Implement an anonymous resume review process that does not require gender or name but instead focuses on qualifications, experience and competencies to select the best candidate for the position. \u2013 Provide a resource list of therapists and organizations that people can contact should any instance of discrimination or harassment occur due to their gender identity, expression and/or sexual orientation, with the list to be included as part of employees, induction training. \u2013 Create more social and media awareness on job employment challenges faced by trans people. RESEARCHERS \u2013 Expand research on hiring discrimination and other forms of employment discrimination, as well as its impact on the lives of trans people in Asia and the Pacific. \u2013 Conduct research to identify the basis for discrimination by employers and identify means for producing behaviour change aimed at reducing discrimination against trans people in the workplace. \u2013 Promote research on employment discrimination and trans people at academic institutions. \u2013 Disseminate the results of relevant research to stakeholders for awareness, education and action. TRANS COMMUNITY & ALLIES \u2013 Develop and promote best workplace standards and spotlight best-practice employers. \u2013 Develop, promote and conduct standards of practice for hiring that are culturally sensitive and culturally competent70 in relation to trans people. \u2013 Develop, promote and conduct trainings with groups working on fair and equal employment practices. \u2013 Create advocacy groups to address employment discrimination against trans people and provide best practice advocacy strategies, connecting with trans-competent employers. \u2013 Periodically release a list of the top trans-friendly and trans-competent workplaces. \u2013 Develop a curriculum for trans activists and advocates to deliver sensitization and awareness training, and work with", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e18e25fa-328c-4a54-aac3-95b1a3ea314a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e18e25fa-328c-4a54-aac3-95b1a3ea314a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Denied Work \u2013 An audit of employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity in South-East Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d355130b9ab8bdef49551bb0e6685797ff75bb9fb9d00c5bef8dd6fa18f2cdf8"}, "3": {"node_id": "132b848d-4a99-412e-9c3c-a788717f187f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/denied-work-%E2%80%93-audit-employment-discrimination-basis-gender-identity-south-east-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05d583dcd6efc0547ce9def2e389b30ba6d3407d95d2dbfa9d8d9a1532426ac5"}}, "hash": "cb26689d5f8db1eccb5a40d43b7aed6004fa0bfe16af1e7ce30e1df7ecdeb6a7", "text": "allies (such as corporations, employer organizations, chambers of commerce, and university preparatory programmes) to make the curriculum available to employers, both to build and improve relationships and trust between the trans community and the corporate sector and to decrease incidents of implicit and explicit bias in hiring within these companies. 52 Appendices APPENDIX 1A.

"UNDP\u2019s work on clean energy aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) on access to affordable and clean energy while it is acknowledged that energy is an \u2018intermediate\u2019 commodity: it powers appliances, equipment, and machinery as well as lighting and thermal applications. In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals in general, SDG 7 is primarily useful in that it helps to achieve other SDGs. In other words, the success of SDG 7 is a precondition for the success of many other SDGs. Especially the SDG7 goals related to energy access and clean cooking, have a direct impact on SDG1 No Poverty, SDG3 Good Health, SDG4 Quality Education and SDG5 Gender Equality. UNDP is working on improving its assessment of the social and economic benefits of its energy-access projects and the contribution of these projects towards achieving other SDGs. In 2015, UNDP conducted analysis of the non-energy benefits of its sustainable energy projects as a scoping exercise for assessing impact (UNDP, 2015).

The study reflected in this report aims to give UNDP staff and project managers tools and guidance on how to improve assessments of impacts associated with clean energy projects. Thus, the objectives of this study are: \u2022 Develop a \u2018scoring\u2019 tool that can be used by Regional Technical Advisors, country offices and project managers, for an assessment of the relation between a clean energy project (focusing on SDG7) and the SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5 goals. \u2022 Provide an indication on the degree of social and economic benefits that can be observed for different types of energy access projects. \u2022 Provide guidance for Regional Technical Advisors, country offices and project managers, on monitoring and data collection approaches to assess the social and economic benefits of their energy-access projects by doing ex-ante and ex-post analysis. Access to electricity and clean-cooking solutions UNDP defines energy access as \u201cthe need for electrical, thermal and mechanical energy for households, small and medium-sized businesses and communities, with an emphasis on clean energy for the poor\u201d. For the study reflected in this report, a distinction was made between (i) access to electricity and (ii) access to clean-cooking solutions. This study focuses on the social and economic benefits related to the following SDGs: \u2022 SDG 1\u2014No Poverty: End poverty in all its forms everywhere \u2022 SDG 3\u2014Good health and well-being: Substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination \u2022 SDG 4\u2014Quality education: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning \u2022 SDG 5\u2014Gender equality: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 2 Levels of access to electricity The World Bank recently developed a framework to categorize electricity-access projects. This framework distinguishes six tiers (levels) of access to electricity, with tier 0 representing the baseline situation with no access to electricity and tier 5 the most advanced level of access. The successive thresholds of supply (tiers) allow for increased use of end-use equipment (appliances) and hence access to energy services, which the following figure illustrates. Figure S.1: Multi-tier matrix for Measuring Access to Household Electricity Supply (ESMAP, 2015) Social and economic benefits of electricity access Ten social and economic metrics were drawn from reports in the reviewed academic and grey literature that positively correlate with the implementation of electricity-access projects and can be connected to the SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5 goals. Findings from the literature indicate that the degree of social and economic benefits gradually increases when moving to higher tier levels for electricity access. In this study, this gradual increase was translated into a scale that moves from tier 0 (situation with no access to electricity and no benefits) to tier 5 (significant benefits to be anticipated from access to electricity).

This framework was mirrored into a classification for cookstoves ranging from improved cooking solutions (tiers 1 and 2) to clean-cooking solutions (tiers 3\u20145). Figure S.3: Multi-tier Matrix for Measuring Access to Cooking Solutions (ESMAP, 2015) Social and economic benefits of access to clean cooking Five social and economic metrics were drawn from the review of the academic and grey literature that positively correlate with the implementation of projects providing access to clean-cooking solutions and can be connected to the SDG1, SDG3 and SDG5 goals. Findings from the literature show a gradual increase in the degree of social and economic benefits when moving to higher tier levels of access to clean cooking. The radar chart below shows that when, for example, a project intervention provides access to basic improved cookstoves (tier 1), moderate benefit can be expected in relation to the occurrence of accidents with cooking and small benefit can be expected from a decrease in indoor air pollutants and related diseases.

Start testing the scoring approach and collect feedback If there is no budget reservation in the project for monitoring impact, then the basic scoring approach with radar charts as presented in this study can be the minimum level of indicating expected impact and can be useful in: \u2022 Identifying the type and size of social and economic benefits associated with energy-access projects and \u2022 Indicating the importance of monitoring to free up resources for activities that need to be incorporated in the project to gather data to monitor relevant metrics. If the energy access project has limited resources available for monitoring the impact on SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and/or SDG5, then the \u201cRule of Thumb\u201d approach can help in getting an indication of impact by means of multiplying simple observations (e.g. number of households affected by the project, number of children affected by the project) with previously observed impact factors. In case of time and resources available for more serious monitoring, conduct of surveys ex-ante and ex- post project intervention can give good indications of impact of the energy access project towards the goals of the SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and/or SDG5. An example of possible content of a survey can be found in Annex A. More advanced monitoring methods comprise of modelling exercises and measurements. In case energy access projects have a project component that is specifically aiming for certain impact, e.g. improved 7 indoor climates, then it can be justified to use project budget for advanced monitoring by means of e.g. indoor air quality measurements, again ex-ante and ex-post project intervention. Four recommendations for UNDP country offices emerged through this analysis: \u2022 Promote the use of the basic scoring charts for energy-access projects to identify type and size of social and economic benefits associated with energy-access projects and the importance of monitoring impacts \u2022 Promote the use of the basic scoring charts for energy-access projects to explain the importance of realising full energy access up to Tier 5 level since only then the full benefits for other SDGs will be realised. \u2022 Identify and apply an impact assessment monitoring approach as early as the inception phase of a project to ensure that the social and economic benefits are properly monitored from the start of each project. \u2022 Gather feedback on the usefulness of impact assessment and different levels of monitoring (simple to advanced) as well as problems encountered when gathering information on the social and economic indicators for energy-access projects to further develop mechanisms for assessing the social and economic benefits of completed energy-access projects. 1 1 Introduction This chapter introduces the reason for this study, its objectives and approach. 1.1 UNDP work on sustainable energy The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has more than 20 years of experience in sustainable energy. This experience substantiates the critical role of access to sustainable energy services across the different dimensions of sustainable development: \u2022 The social dimension seeks to increase access to energy services, with focus on equity, building up resilience and addressing social inclusion. \u2022 The economic dimension aims to increase economic growth by advancing the affordability and effectiveness of energy services, with focus on efficiency and productivity. \u2022 The environmental dimension seeks to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and other negative environmental impacts while reducing disaster risks, with focus on sustainability. The UNDP work on sustainable energy aligns with the seventh Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), on affordable and clean energy. This is elaborated in the UNDP Strategic Plan 2018\u20132021, which emphasizes the agency\u2019s role in helping countries end extreme poverty, reduce inequalities and achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Strategic Plan structures actions along six signature solutions. One of these solutions is \u2018closing the energy gap\u2019 by providing universal access to clean, affordable and sustainable energy (UNDP, 2017). This is further detailed in the UNDP Strategy Note on Sustainable Energy (UNDP, 2016). 1.2 Study objective: Improve the assessment of social and economic benefits of energy-access projects UNDP\u2019s work on clean energy aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) on access to affordable and clean energy while it is acknowledged that energy is an \u2018intermediate\u2019 commodity: it powers appliances, equipment, and machinery as well as lighting and thermal applications. In relation to the Sustainable Development Goals in general, SDG 7 is primarily useful in that it helps to achieve other SDGs. In other words, the success of SDG 7 is a precondition for the success of many other SDGs. Especially the SDG7 goals related to energy access and clean cooking, have a direct impact on SDG1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12c53b27-fd57-4921-8a16-8d35fb2e0af5": {"__data__": {"id_": "12c53b27-fd57-4921-8a16-8d35fb2e0af5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23eaeacf577ed2c746583468aca1ed144b393c0d41d86d173aae1bee63b029c2"}}, "hash": "23eaeacf577ed2c746583468aca1ed144b393c0d41d86d173aae1bee63b029c2", "text": "No Poverty, SDG3 Good Health, SDG4 Quality Education and SDG5 Gender Equality. UNDP is working on improving its assessment of the social and economic benefits of its energy-access projects and the contribution of these projects towards achieving other SDGs. In 2015, UNDP conducted analysis of the non-energy benefits of its sustainable energy projects as a scoping exercise for assessing impact (UNDP, 2015). The underlying report is a next step in developing a framework that can be used to assess the impact of the social and economic benefits for a specific subset of sustainable energy projects: access to electricity and clean-cooking projects. UNDP monitors sustainable energy projects by reporting on indicators contained within each project document. Project objectives are monitored through annual progress reporting. Ideally, data gathered within the projects allow for tracking the direct and indirect benefits of energy projects across all dimensions. UNDP, however, lacks sufficient data to conduct a proper impact assessment of the social and economic benefits of its sustainable energy projects. 2 The study reflected in this report is a next step to develop a framework that can be used by UNDP country office staff and project managers to improve the impact assessment of social and economic benefits for a subset of sustainable energy projects: access to electricity and clean-cooking projects. Hence, the study\u2019s objectives centred on: \u2022 Developing a \u2018scoring\u2019 tool that can be used for assessment of potential impact of energy access projects towards SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5 by UNDP country offices (and project managers); \u2022 Providing an indication on the degree of social and economic benefits that can be observed for different types (\u201cTiers\u201d) of energy-access projects; and \u2022 Providing guidance for country offices (and project managers) on more advanced methods of impact assessment and data collection approaches to assess social and economic benefits for energy-access projects. 1.3 Report structure This report is structured as follows. \u2022 Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the field of energy access, the relationship with social and economic development goals and applied definitions for energy-access projects. \u2022 Chapter 3 describes social and economic benefits of access to electricity projects and provides a score on the degree of social and economic benefits for different levels of access to electricity. \u2022 Chapter 4 describes the social and economic benefits of access to clean-cooking projects and provides a score on the degree of social and economic benefits for different levels of access to clean cooking. \u2022 Chapter 5 provides an overview on possible monitoring approaches that can be applied to assess the social and economic benefits of UNDP energy-access projects. \u2022 Chapter 6 presents case studies for which the scoring approach developed in this study was applied to two UNDP energy-access projects. \u2022 Chapter 7 presents the conclusions and recommendations from this analysis 3 2 Defining energy access This chapter defines households\u2019 access to energy. It starts with providing an overview of the links between energy-access projects and socioeconomic development goals. It then details the impact pathway for energy-access projects, before discussing commonly used definitions and categorizations for energy-access projects. 2.1 Context: Sustainable Development Goals The United Nations member States agreed in 2014 on an agenda to eradicate poverty everywhere and to provide a better life for all people over the next 15 years: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This agenda comprises 17 goals and 169 underlying targets (Figure 1). The 2030 Agenda constitutes a network in which the goals are linked through targets that, in turn, refer to multiple goals. SDG 7 aims at realizing access to affordable and clean energy and is, directly or indirectly, linked to several other SDGs. These links were comprehensively analysed by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (2017) and Le Blanc (2015). The results of those studies along with UNDP priorities led to this analysis focusing on the social and economic benefit assessment of energy-access projects towards the following SDGs and targets (United Nations, 2018): \u2022 SDG 1\u2014No poverty: End poverty in all its forms everywhere \u2022 SDG 3\u2014Good health and well-being: Substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination \u2022 SDG 4\u2014Quality education: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning \u2022 SDG 5\u2014Gender equality: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women 2.2 Context: UNDP signature solution 5: Close the energy gap The UNDP Strategic Plan for 2018\u20132021 includes the vision to support countries achieving the 2030 Agenda.

Signature solution 5 to \u2018close the energy gap\u2019 aims at achieving access to clean and affordable energy and focuses on increasing energy access, promoting renewable energy and enhancing energy efficiency. This should be done in a manner that is inclusive and responsive to the needs of different sections of a population. Access to sustainable energy is considered an enabler of sustainable development, particularly in the areas of nutrition, transport, education, economic opportunity and reducing the impacts of indoor and outdoor air pollution (UNDP, 2017). The desired benefits are detailed in the UNDP Strategy Note on Sustainable Energy (UNDP, 2016). Figure 1 Sustainable Development Goals 4 2.3 Energy results chain: Impact pathway of energy-access projects Figure 2 depicts the impact pathway for energy-access projects developed by the World Bank, referred to as the \u2018energy results chain\u2019 (ESMAP, 2015). The energy results chain represents how investments in energy-access projects potentially can lead to social and economic benefits (impact). The model assumes that investments in energy-access projects (input) lead to project implementation (intermediate output) and the delivery of assets or policy reforms (outputs). In turn, this improves one or more attributes of energy supply (intermediate outcome), such as greater availability, improved quality or increased affordability of energy. Collectively, these attributes increase the usability of the energy supply, thus improving energy access (outcome) and, eventually, the actual use of energy services (intermediate impact). This process can subsequently contribute to the achievement of developmental goals (impact). Each step in the energy result chain can be translated into an indicator to measure progress towards reaching targeted results. Higher up on the results chain, however, it becomes harder to link investments in energy to the outcomes. This indicates that when the effects of an intervention are sought at higher levels in the results chain, which was the objective for this study, attribution of benefits becomes more difficult. This is important to keep in mind when reviewing and analysing reported social and economic benefits of energy-access projects: can the observed benefits be attributed to a single intervention (in the UNDP case, investment in the energy system) or should other causes be considered as well? 2.4 Applied definitions for energy access No single internationally accepted definition of energy access exists. The International Energy Agency defines it as \"a household having reliable and affordable access to both clean cooking facilities and to electricity, which is enough to supply a basic bundle of energy services initially, and then an increasing level of electricity over time to reach the regional average\" (IEA, 2017). UNDP includes businesses and communities in its understanding of energy access, which is thus characterized as \u201cthe need for electrical, thermal and mechanical energy for households, small and medium-sized businesses and communities, with an emphasis on clean energy for the poor\u201d (UNDP, 2016). Within its Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), the World Bank also applies a broader scope than the International Energy Agency: \u201cAccess to energy is the ability to avail energy that is adequate, available when needed, reliable, of good quality, affordable, legal, convenient, Source: ESMAP, 2015. Figure 2 Energy results chain Investments in energy Project implementation Assets, policies, regulations Attributes of energy supply Usability of energy supply Use of energy services Development goals Input Intermediate output Output Intermediate outcome Outcome Intermediate impact Impact ENERGY ACCESS ENERGY USE Result level Result parameter Input Intermediate Output Output Intermediate Outcome Metric #1 Metric #2 \u2026\u2026\u2026 Indicators 5 healthy and safe, for all required energy services across household, productive and community uses\u201d (ESMAP, 2015). The study reflected in this report assessed the social and economic benefits deriving from energy access for households, businesses and communities. This wider perspective was chosen because UNDP energy access projects support a diverse range of activities and technologies targeted at different end users. This study also accounted for differences in the type and extent of social and economic benefits with increasing levels of energy access. 6 3 Access to electricity This chapter starts with clarifying the framework developed by the Word Bank to categorize electricity-access projects. This framework distinguishes six tiers of access to electricity, with tier 0 representing the baseline situation with no access to electricity and tier 5 the most advanced level. Furthermore, the chapter presents an overview of the social and economic benefits of access to electricity projects reported in the reviewed academic and grey literature, resulting in a list of 10 social and economic metrics covering poverty alleviation, health, education and gender equality. Findings from the literature show a gradual increase in the degree of social and economic benefits when moving to higher tiers of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "700dff01-8fc5-41d8-a16c-a1933a5cf669": {"__data__": {"id_": "700dff01-8fc5-41d8-a16c-a1933a5cf669", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2775cb9009ed3bee997a41dd20c1f7ecb6cfbc21069624f85554f7ad48612d34"}}, "hash": "2775cb9009ed3bee997a41dd20c1f7ecb6cfbc21069624f85554f7ad48612d34", "text": "electricity access. This is visualized in radar charts to show the degree of social and economic benefits for different levels of electricity-access projects, as compared to tier 0. 3.1 Energy result chain for electricity-access projects Figure 3 illustrates the energy results chain (impact pathway) for interventions aimed at providing access to electricity. The inputs are the financial and technical resources that are used to stimulate 1 actual investment in energy supply systems (including transmission and distribution equipment for a grids) and provide households, businesses and communities with access to electricity (output). The output enables households, businesses and communities to use end-use equipment (appliances) that they either bought or acquired outside or through the project (outcome). By using these appliances, households get access to energy services (intermediate impact) that deliver social and economic benefits in the end (impact). 1 UNDP energy-access projects cover a range of inputs, from capacity building on the national (government) and community levels to distributing appliances and co-investing in energy production technologies. Figure 3 Energy results chain for electricity-access projects Source: Based on ESMAP, 2015. Financial and technical resources Households, businesses and communities get access to electricity by means of an energy systems: Mini grid | Off-grid | On Grid Households, businesses and communities buy/ acquire end-use equipment and start using this equipment Households, businesses and communities get access to various Energy Services Social and/or economic benefits Input Output Outcome Intermediate impact Impact 7 3.2 Levels of access to electricity \u2018Access to electricity\u2019 used to be defined in a binary approach as whether a household had electricity to use. This characterization, however, does not account for different levels of access to electricity provided to end users. Electricity, after all, is only useful if the desired energy services become available. Energy services require different levels of electricity supply in terms of quantity, time of day, supply duration, quality and affordability. Energy systems range from the most basic pico solar system, to off-grid and local mini grids to the most advanced system, with access to an integrated electricity grid. Figure 4 illustrates how investments in different energy systems result in incremental levels of access to electricity and the possibility for end users to utilize more advanced end-use technologies with increasing access levels. The World Bank (ESMAP, 2015) recently developed a comprehensive framework to measure the levels of access to electricity provided to end users, where successive thresholds of supply allow for increased use of end-use equipment (appliances). This framework defines six levels for electricity access: Tier 0 represents the baseline situation with no access to electricity and, consequently, no access to energy services. Subsequently, tier 1 represents the most basic level, tier 2 a more advanced level and, ultimately, tier 5 is the most advanced level. This framework tries to account for the multidimensional nature of access to energy and includes seven attributes. A score can be determined for each of the seven attributes to produce an energy-access diagnostic for a given geographical area. If deemed useful, a simple energy-access index can be calculated by weighing the tiers (ESMAP, 2015). Figure 5 provides an overview of the seven attributes and the way they are scored for each tier within the framework developed by the World Bank: 1. Capacity refers to the ability of the system to deliver a quantity of electricity to operate different appliances (peak capacity). 2. Duration/availability refers to the amount of time during which electricity is available (including daily and evening supply). 3. Reliability is defined in terms of frequency and duration of unscheduled outages. For example, an electricity system is scored as tier 4 with a maximum of 14 outages per week and is scored as tier 5 with a maximum of three disruptions per week, with aggregate disruption duration of less than two hours per week. 4. Quality is defined in terms of voltage. An electricity system scores tier 4 or 5 if voltage problems do not prevent the use of desired appliances. 5. Affordability refers to whether households can pay for the electricity they need. Affordable levels are defined as consumption of 365 kWh per year that costs less than 5 percent of the household income. 6. Legality is inferred by bill payment. An energy system scores tier 4 or 5 if it can be demonstrated that the bill is paid to the utility, a prepaid card seller or authorized representative. This attribute is included because illegal connections pose a significant safety risk and affect the financial sustainability of the utility. However, the user may utilize various electricity services from an illegal connection.

Health and safety is measured by the safety of the electricity system. Electricity systems are scored tier 4 or 5 in the absence of past accidents and without the perception of high risk in the future. The boundaries between the various tiers are not always as clear-cut as presented in Figure 5. They could follow a more gradual path. Figure 5 Multi-tier matrix for measuring access to household electricity supply Source: ESMAP, 2015. In addition to scoring energy systems by the seven attributes, the matrix is also used to derive an overall score for the energy systems in a geographical region, which becomes the energy- access index. This index evaluates both the extent of access (how many households have access) and the intensity of that access (the level of access that each household has). For example, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (2015) produced a comprehensive illustration of the use of the framework and determining indices for access to electricity and clean cooking for various regions in India. 3.3 Levels of access to electricity services A gradual improvement of access to electricity (a higher tier) implies enhanced opportunities to electricity services because households and/or businesses can utilize a larger and more diverse set of appliances. The World Bank developed this into a second matrix mirroring the supply matrix, which measures the access to household electricity services (Figure 6). Higher levels of energy services offer the possibility for end-users to use more and higher-powered appliances.

It is possible for a household to obtain different tier ratings across the range of access to electricity supply and access to electricity services\u2014reflecting either availability of appliances despite poor supply or inability to afford appliances despite adequate supply (ESMAP, 2015). 3.4 Social and economic benefits This section summarizes the results of this study\u2019s review of academic and grey literature on reported (i) evidence of social and economic benefits from access to electricity projects, (ii) metrics to measure these benefits and (iii) available data. The benefits are categorized along the line of the SDGs to which these benefits potentially contribute. Each section starts with a description on the anticipated impact pathway. SDG 1\u2014No poverty: Changes in household expenditure Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity influences household expenditure because the costs for traditional fuels are replaced by the expenditure on electricity and related services. Evidence from literature: Determining the impact on household expenditure is not a straightforward exercise, according to report by the Dutch Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB, 2013), for the following reasons: \u2022 Energy sources could be subsidized. \u2022 The nominal price paid for energy is not equal to the net price (the price per unit energy effectively used). The poorer households often use the most expensive fuels in terms of the price per unit of useful energy, and the poorer households tend to use less efficient devices. \u2022 Expenditure does not only rely on the price of the fuel but includes also the amortized capital costs of the equipment and the appliances needed for each energy source. Comparing \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 a project is even more complex in the case of electricity, because electricity also provides the opportunity to use new services (IOB, 2013). Different metrics are applied in comparing the applications of traditional fuel sources versus improved sources. These metrics include expenditure per kilowatt-hour (kWh), expenditure per lumen (lm) or the absolute expenditure in amount of cash spent on energy. The impact on household expenditure from gaining access to electric lighting is significant. A study in Ghana, for example, found a positive correlation between ownership of photovoltaic solar home Energy services provided TIER 0 TIER 1 Task lighting and phone charging TIER 2 General lighting and phone charging and television and fan (if needed) TIER 3 TIER 2 and medium- power appliances TIER 4 TIER 3 and any high- power appliances TIER 5 TIER", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b85a78d6-6e2c-493a-a4fc-8979d6e67ad9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b85a78d6-6e2c-493a-a4fc-8979d6e67ad9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1064e1eaa95bc97e04d129e73f050c12b380bc8c219643e398c18aed7540a46"}, "3": {"node_id": "05dc8f1f-cc3c-4dcf-a372-880e3d401a62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1149d8a2a026f14b613613556aff79e100b850492d6e6be00d21a56468e2e836"}}, "hash": "64681c5cd13fb8fc676d9e732796cffef89f63ebfe4b2efc7d5a14aeeec91b1e", "text": "4 and any very high-power appliances Possible appliances TIER 0 TIER 1 - Radio - Task light - Charger TIER 2 TIER 1 PLUS -Multi-point general lighting -Television -Computer -Fan TIER 3 TIER 2 PLUS -Air cooler -Refrigerator -Food processor -Rice cooker TIER 4 TIER 3 PLUS -Iron -Hair dryer -Toaster -Microwave TIER 5 TIER 4 PLUS -Air conditioner -Water heater -Electric cooker 10 systems and a decrease in expenditure for kerosene, candles and dry-cell batteries: 21 percent of the households accomplished savings of approximately 10 percent for lighting only. Studies in eastern Zambia came to comparable findings (IOB, 2013). SDG 1\u2014No poverty: Economic growth and increase in household income Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity provides the opportunity to develop other economic activities. For instance, more efficient electric machinery and equipment can be used for manufacturing and for raising productivity, economic growth and household income. This is only feasible, however, beyond tier level 2, because a certain minimum level of access to electricity is required to enable productive uses of electricity, such as the generation of additional income. Evidence from literature: The impact of electrification on economic activities has not been clearly established, however: \u2022 An evaluation of 23 local development projects in 14 countries (covering Asia, Africa and Latin America) revealed that only in a small number of projects was electricity applied for productive use. Even though 12 projects identified possible productive uses of energy, the number of people who used the energy to start business activities was small (Terrapon-Pfaff and others, 2014). Most evaluated projects in this study would categorize as tier 1 to 2 in the framework presented in this report, in which case, productive use is expected to be limited because no use can be made of medium- and high-power appliances (see Figure 6). \u2022 A study in Benin found that the installation of an electricity grid spurred new businesses, but, at the same time, led to a decline of profits for existing businesses (crowding-out effect). On average, an 8 percent increase in rural per capita income over a five-year period was observed (Peters, Vance and Harsdorff, 2011). \u2022 Khandker and others (2009) reported an increase in total income attributable to electrification by as much as 30 percent in Viet Nam, which sustained for as long as eight years, after which the benefits levelled off. \u2022 World Bank data from 1998 to 2003 for Ghana showed a positive impact of electrification on home-based businesses. In this period, the number of home businesses grew significantly more in communities that became electrified\u2014more than in those communities without electricity and more than those that were already electrified in 1988 (IEG, 2008). \u2022 A study in 10 African countries found that, immediately after electrification in the region, the number of newly established enterprises increased substantially. But many of those initiatives were discontinued soon afterwards (Arnold, Matto and Narciso, 2006). SDG 3\u2014Good health and well-being: Reduction of indoor air pollution and related diseases Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity leads to a reduction of exposure to indoor air pollution because households no longer need to rely on kerosene and paraffin-fuelled lamps for lighting (typically the tier 0 baseline situation) (see the next chapter for details on clean cooking). This reduction in indoor air pollution also leads to a reduction in related diseases. Evidence from literature: Indoor air pollution from the combustion of kerosene is related to catarrh and headache, with one reported situation of harmful mental development of children (measured by exposure to carbon monoxide and particulate matter (PM2.5)). This conclusion is based on four studies covering the period 2003\u20132014 (IOB, 2013). In the short term, the health benefits of replacing fuel-based lighting by electric lighting is only minor because households initially continue to use traditional lamps\u2014complementary to 11 electric lighting. A study in Ghana, for example, revealed that solar photovoltaic lighting reduced the proportion of household members affected by indoor smoke from kerosene lanterns by 50 percent, while the proportion of household members with blackened nostrils decreased by almost 30 percent (in this group, however, kerosene was still used in addition to electric lighting) (IOB, 2013).

See www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/. SDG 3\u2014Good health and well-being: Reduction of accidents Anticipated impact pathway: Legal access to electricity leads to a reduction in occurrence of accidents, along two pathways. 1. Due to access to electricity, households no longer need to use fuel-based lighting (tier 0). This leads to a reduction in occurrence of accidental fires (accelerated by spilled fuel, broken glass from lamps and use of candles) that result in burns or death. 2. Due to legal access to electricity, illegal and secondary connections to the electricity grid will diminish. This results in a decrease of occurrence of electrocution caused by poor wiring and absence of safety devices. Evidence from literature: An analysis of the impact of rural electrification projects in Mali, South Africa and Uganda in 2012 found a significant reduction in accidents due to the use of candles and paraffin (FRES, 2013). Several publications have reported on the number of victims of electrocution (see ESMAP, 2015), but no evaluations were made of the impacts of energy-access projects on the number of electrocution victims. The study in Mali, South Africa and Uganda revealed that the number of energy-related accidents (burns and electrocution) was slightly larger for respondents who had access to electricity (at 7 percent) than for households who do not have access to electricity (at 2 percent). This was somewhat unexpected and was attributed to the occasional tampering by clients with the solar installations by using converters or equipment not suited to solar home systems or mini grids (FRES, 2013). SDG 3\u2014Good health and well-being: Improved access to health services Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity improves access to health services and health care quality. This ultimately advances life expectancy. Evidence from literature: Improved access to health care materializes through several channels. 1. Access to mobile phones can be important, in theory, for getting help in medical emergencies, although no studies were found in which this benefit was quantified. 2. Access to electricity (beyond tier 3) provides the possibility to make use of a refrigerator to store vaccines (maintain the cold chain). In theory, electrification may shorten the cold chain, or make 12 it more efficient, resulting in higher immunization rates.2 The immunization rate in areas with clinics with access to electricity beyond tier 3, however, hardly differs from areas with clinics with lower access to electricity levels. This was shown by studies in Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nicaragua and Rwanda (IEG, 2008). 3. Research in 2003, although limited, revealed that communities in Bangladesh attracted more qualified health workers in areas with access to electricity and that health services with electricity had longer opening hours (IEG, 2008). 4. Access to mobile phones enables health applications and access to other communication services, such as television and computers facilitating public health education and information. No single measurement is available to monitor either access to or quality of health care services. As with access to energy, access to health care comprises a broad set of attributes,3 and it goes beyond the scope of this study to assess this in the context of access to electricity. SDG 4\u2014Quality education: Enhanced schooling Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity provides the possibility to improve the levels of illumination that enable children to spend additional time on homework after dark and providing the opportunity for more children to finish school. Evidence from literature: The number of lighting hours is not the single determinant for additional time spent by children studying at home (IOB, 2013). The quality of lighting and the brightness (measured in lumen) have an equally important role. The priority for electricity use for households with solar home systems shifts over time towards the use of appliances, mainly television, displacing electricity utilized for lighting. Over time, though, both school enrolment and years of completed schooling improve with increasing available electricity at home (World Bank, 2017): \u2022 In Bangladesh and Viet Nam and because of access to lighting, school enrolment for boys went up by 11 percent and for girls by 4 percent. \u2022 In the Philippines, children in electrified households acquired almost two years of additional education. \u2022 Grid connectivity in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic increased study time in the evening by 30 minutes for boys and 19 minutes for girls and grade completion of secondary schooling was raised by 3.6 percent points for men and 3.4 percent points for women.

This increases the efficiency of household chores. In addition, the access to lighting provides the opportunity to shift domestic tasks (usually for women) to the evening, providing room for other economic, social and educational activities, including time for radio and TV entertainment. Evidence from literature: 2 Many vaccines are sensitive to both heat and cold and need to be stored between 2\u00b0 and 8\u00b0 Celsius. In almost all countries, health authorities organize a system that keeps vaccines at that temperature between manufacturing and vaccination (the cold chain). 3 See www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/6/17-195099/en/. 13 The actual time-savings resulting from not having to purchase kerosene, paraffin, candles or batteries for lighting are not known. Because these fuels are usually available from local retailers, the time- savings are probably small (IOB, 2013). Electrification impacts the time management of households. For example, lighting provides between one and three hours of additional time for other activities (IOB, 2013). Projects in South Africa, Bangladesh and Guatemala, for example, showed an increase of 9 percent of employment of women after electrification. In contrast, employment in these projects for men did not change (K\u00f6hlin and others, 2011). SDG 5\u2014Gender equality: Increase in (perceived) safety Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity provides the opportunity to provide more and better-quality illumination (outside light) and to have immediate access to communication (charged batteries) resulting in an increase in (perceived) safety. Evidence from literature: In African countries, studies on perceived safety present a mixed picture. In some cases, perceived safety went up after electrification, whereas in other situations it went down (FRES, 2013). A study conducted in 2012 in Senegal surveyed people on the impact of lighting and compared those in the project with people who had no lighting at night. They did not find a measurable difference in sense of security, when, for example, comparing the number of robberies and attacks by snakes and scorpions. In interviews, however, people declared that lighting did affect their perceived feeling of security. No differences were found in the frequency of leaving the house after nightfall between people with and without lighting (IOB, 2013). SDG 5\u2014Gender equality: Impact on social change Anticipated impact pathway: Access to electricity provides people with the opportunity to use different means of communication (television, Internet), which can lead to changes in attitudes and behaviours. Evidence from literature: \u2022 A positive relationship was found between watching television and fertility by the World Bank in a study covering nine countries (Bangladesh, Ghana, Indonesia, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines and Senegal (IEG, 2008) and by another study in India (Jensen and Oster, 2009). This was largely attributed to better knowledge about contraceptives and health in general. \u2022 A positive relationship emerged between watching television and a decrease in the acceptance of domestic violence and a decline in the preference for having sons instead of daughters in India (Jensen and Oster, 2009). 14 3.5 Summary of social and economic benefits Table 1 summarizes the results of this study\u2019s assessment on the social and economic benefits reported in academic and grey literature due to electricity-access projects. The 10 social and economic metrics were drawn from the reviewed literature. These are metrics for which a positive correlation was found with the implementation of electricity-access projects. The metrics that were evaluated in this chapter for which no evidence was found of a positive relationship were omitted from the matrix. The matrix in table 1 provides a basic scoring based on the relationship between level of access to energy and the social and/or economic benefits. The following scoring level was applied: (0) No benefit is to be expected for this social or economic metric. (1) Degree of social and economic benefit is small, compared with tier 0. (2) Degree of social and economic benefit is moderate, compared with tier 0. (3) Degree of social and economic benefit is large or significant, compared with tier 0. The matrix shows a gradual increase in the degree of social and/or economic benefits when moving to higher tiers for electricity access. Most of the reviewed literature focused on accessing impacts up to tier 2 or 3; it is assumed that benefits fully materialize when moving towards the higher tier levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2d853be-f51a-4c0c-8ab9-916421ffbd01": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2d853be-f51a-4c0c-8ab9-916421ffbd01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54dd6c142dde9566412b62694ed1df28dc85b317c1f7435e1c60c8ed7b56ce50"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2c7aded-8444-45d5-8fff-085b5afb12d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bf172e7db5550f785c764304165760b6066baf36f57ca9c4bfc613c178fa4eb"}}, "hash": "dbeb6658999ec4e5e887b07091753ae8c28ad699bf63962cf2f00a0fac11c1bb", "text": "The results presented in Table 1 are visualized in a radar chart (Figure 7), showing the degree of social and economic benefits for different levels of electricity access projects, compared with tier 0.

This framework distinguishes six tiers of access to clean cooking, which is mirrored into a classification for cookstoves, ranging from improved cooking solutions (tiers 1 and 2) to clean- cooking solutions (tiers 3 and up). An overview is provided of the social and economic benefits of access to clean-cooking projects reported in the academic and grey literature, which led to a list of five social and economic metrics covering poverty alleviation, health and gender equality. Findings from the literature review show a gradual increase in the degree of social and economic benefits when moving to higher tier levels for access to clean cooking. This is visualized in a radar chart that reflects the degree of social and economic benefits for the different levels of access to clean-cooking projects, as compared to tier 0. 4.1 Energy results chain The International Energy Agency defines \u2018access to clean cooking\u2019 as a household primarily relying on cooking facilities, which are used without harm to the health of those in the household and which are more environmentally sustainable and energy efficient than biomass cookstoves and the three-stone fires used in developing countries (IEA, 2017). Figure 8 depicts the energy results chain (impact pathway) for interventions aimed at providing access to clean cooking. Inputs include financial and technical resources that are employed to ensure that clean- cooking systems are available and can be used in a proper way (output). The output enables households to acquire clean cookstoves and to start using them (outcome). By using the cookstoves, households reduce their wood consumption (intermediate impact), which ultimately generates social and/or economic benefits (impact).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5f4846b-0566-4353-9783-24f89c212e52": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5f4846b-0566-4353-9783-24f89c212e52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "606022312367a21ae82f9b3abdc452e6ec7f89ea9f00fd4bcf5f0c45685b2853"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d245846-c5cb-426c-afec-2fadb1fac899", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ca21c9b9831f730407660e8324ac42f852ed2ad7c5f0f632273623fc045e536"}}, "hash": "a6646a0d8909755df706c9a4ae9aac305551d3f9406f0e51cac8646ce5d78977", "text": "4.2 Levels of access to clean cooking Most households who do not have access to clean cooking (baseline) rely on the traditional use of solid biomass, unprocessed coal, kerosene and/or liquid oil.

The World Bank developed a framework that is broadly applied to measure access to clean-cooking solutions. As with access for electricity, this framework defines six levels for access to clean-cooking Figure 8 Energy results chain for access to clean-cooking and space-heating projects Source: Based on ESMAP, 2015. Financial and technical resources Producers established, retailers trained, customers made aware Households buy/acquire clean cook stoves and start using them Households reduce their need for collecting and and using wood Social and/or economic benefits Input Output Outcome Intermediate impact Impact 18 solutions. Tier 0 represents the baseline situation with no access to clean cooking, evolving to tier 5 and the most advanced level of access. The framework tries to account for the multidimensional nature of access to energy and includes six attributes. A score can be determined for each of the six attributes to produce a clean cooking diagnostic for a given area. Figure 9 provides an overview of the six attributes and the way they are scored for the different tiers within the framework developed by the World Bank: 1. Availability of the primary fuel is included as an attribute because this can be an issue regardless of the technology; if not available, it often requires the use of a secondary fuel. 2. Quality of the primary fuel refers to caloric value, moisture and combustion characteristics, or voltage (for electricity), which, if inadequate, may impact the performance of the cooking solution. 3. Affordability refers to the multifaceted interaction between the quantities of energy consumed, its price per unit and the ability of the user to pay. 4. Convenience refers to the overall time and effort involved in the process of securing and processing energy for cooking, including the time and effort involved in obtaining the fuel and preparing the fuel and stove. 5. Health4 refers to the level of indoor air and overall pollution and its adverse impacts on women\u2019s and children\u2019s health. 6. Safety refers to possible injury during use and is determined based on an evaluation of the cookstove design in terms of equipment stability, sharp edges, exposed hot surfaces and fuel containment. Figure 9 Multi-tier matrix for measuring access to clean-cooking solutions Source: ESMAP, 2015. In addition to scoring energy systems on the six attributes, the matrix is also used to establish an overall score for access to clean cooking in a geographical region, thus providing a clean-cooking index. The 4 If cookstoves are tested, the tier for health and safety can be based on measurements for indoor air pollution, overall pollution, efficiency and safety, according to the International Workshop Agreement guidelines developed by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (http://cleancookstoves.org/technology-and-fuels/standards/iwa- tiers-of-performance.html) TIER 0 TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 TIER 4 TIER 5 Availability of primary fuel Availability inadequate Available at least 80% of the year Available all year Quality of primary fuel: Variations in heat rate that affects ease of cooking Low quality High quality Affordability Primary solution not affordable Levelized cost < 5% of household income Convenience: Fuel acquisition & preparation time (hours/week) < 7 < 3 < 1.5 < 0.5 Convenience: Stove preparation time (minutes/meal) < 15 < 10 < 5 < 2 Health and safety Self-made stove Manufactured stove Biogas/LPG/electricity/natural gas stoves TIER 0 TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 TIER 4 TIER 5 Indoor air quality Overall pollution Efficiency Safety Test results 19 approach is identical to arriving at the index to access for electricity, presented in the previous chapter (ESMAP, 2015). 4.3 Classification of cookstoves The matrix for access to clean cooking can be mirrored into a classification for cookstoves.

Evidence from literature: Determining the impact on expenditure is not a straightforward task. Studies are sometimes hard to compare due to the different methodologies that were applied5 (IOB, 2013). Cost savings on fuel due to the introduction of an improved cookstove in a range of global studies varied from zero to approximately \u20ac34 per household per year.6 No or limited savings were reported in those studies because (i) often no monetary value was attached to time for wood collected and a reduction of the time spent on wood gathering has no impact on expenditure and (ii) time savings resulted in households cooking more or over a longer time period (rebound effect). A study conducted in Mongolia in 2014 reported a 47 percent reduction in fuel costs for households with improved stoves (Social Impact, 2014). The decrease in household expenditure on fuelwood, charcoal or kerosene can amount up to 40 percent due to improved-cookstove projects (Terrapon-Pfaff and others, 2014, based on a review of 23 projects in 14 countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia). The replacement of open-fire cooking by improved wood stoves may produce little savings in absolute terms. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the low-income levels of households participating in the projects, the reduction of expenditure is more important in relative terms. SDG 1\u2014No poverty: Economic growth and increase in household income Anticipated impact pathway: Access to clean cooking and electricity provides households with the possibilities to embark on other economic activities as a result of time saved for fuel collection and thus leading to an increase in household income. Evidence from literature: Freed-up time is not always spent on income-generating activities that lead to an increase in household income (see the discussion in chapter 3 on gender equality).

This reduction in indoor air pollution generates a decline in related diseases. Evidence from literature: The Dutch Policy and Operations Evaluation Department reviewed a broad range of studies, which evaluated the impact of improved cookstoves on indoor air pollution (IOB, 2013).

Indoor air pollution emanating from the use of traditional stoves is linked to respiratory disease symptoms (acute lower respiratory infections (pneumonia) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), eye infections and stunted growth of children. Studies that evaluated the health impacts of improved cookstoves found (IOB, 2013): \u2022 A substantial reduction in 2011 in Guatemala in the risk for respiratory symptoms with children and women and a reported reduction of sore eyes during cooking: a reduction of respiratory symptoms, at 48.6 percent among women and 63.3 percent among children. \u2022 Women in Mexico in 2009 reported a significantly lower risk of respiratory symptoms, eye discomfort, headache and back pain. \u2022 A reduction of 8 percent in self-reported respiratory symptoms and 10 percent in eye problems in Senegal in 2011. Most reviewed studies indicated positive health impacts, with only a minority of studies that did not find any positive effect on health indicators due to use of improved cookstoves (IOB, 2013). Available evidence suggests that health benefits most likely materialize when clean-cooking programmes focus on clean fuels, such as LPG, electricity, biogas or ethanol (Rosenthal and others, 2017). SDG 3\u2014Good health and well-being: Reduction of accidents Anticipated impact pathway: Access to clean cooking leads to a reduction in the number of accidents because households can dispense with the use of open fires, which thus leads to a decrease in burns and unintended fires. Evidence from literature: In Africa, for example, 2\u201314 percent of surveyed households were involved in energy-related accidents. Between 30 percent and 50 percent of those accidents related to the use of firewood. Electrification was expected to decrease the number of accidents due to inflammable material (firewood, candles, diesel). The possibility of short-circuits, however, presents a new risk if households are not sufficiently educated on the risks of tampering with new electric installations (FRES, 2013, based on three studies in Africa). SDG 5\u2014Gender equality: Time savings, time management and female employment Anticipated impact pathway: Access to clean cooking frees up time for other (economic) activities and raises (female) employment. Within the household, women are often responsible for cooking and fuelwood collection. Freeing up their time provides scope to increase women\u2019s involvement in income-generating activities. Time becomes available along two pathways: 1. A reduction in fuelwood consumption and, consequently, time-savings for fuelwood collection or buying at the market. 2. A reduction in cooking times. Evidence from literature: Research found that the time-savings for fuelwood collection after adopting an improved cookstove (reported in the reviewed literature) was as high as 36 percent8 (IOB, 2013, based on several studies). 7 See table 13 in IOB, 2013 for an overview of reductions and the absolute level in the various studies. 8 The Independent Evaluation Group (2008) reported daily time spent on wood collection for six countries, ranging from 3.5 hours to 0.3 hours per day. 22 However, some studies show no time-savings, even though there were significant reductions in fuelwood use. An explanation given for this discrepancy is that time spent to collect fuelwood remains the same but that quantities collected per trip reduced. As modern and renewable cookstoves do not (or hardly) require collection of fuel, these do lead to significant time saving. \u2022 How much time is saved on cooking depends on the type of improved stove and the base line. Studies reviewed by IOB (2013) in Kenya, Madagascar and Senegal found cooking time reductions ranging from 15 minutes up to 69 minutes per day. However, various other studies reported no savings or even increase in cooking time. In the reviewed studies, women spent the time they had saved in the following ways. \u2022 A study in Nepal in 2009 in which biogas digesters were introduced to improve cooking conditions, 28 percent of the women involved said they spent saved time on income- generating activities (without specifying what these activities entailed).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "706c64ab-74e4-4fab-9ead-dc0f07624d7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "706c64ab-74e4-4fab-9ead-dc0f07624d7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bb6de6d08a6892a49a334f1483f23c5f2b44d82b642ba1d623743270f18e192"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2213d86-e877-48f8-a28a-177ec54ed18c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a70d17017df086685a544aacb657e92d304bdf59840e1f65a96ab3719c3e2bfb"}}, "hash": "684bbde041b8a565203b80d6143dfb2bf80dc399533e3558c3f4e472ad41e537", "text": "Approximately a third said they spent this time on social and community activities (Katuwal and Bohara, 2009). \u2022 A study in Madagascar showed that a majority of the women involved used the saved time for other chores, like", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2080db56-bf59-42c6-817b-d6fd60ed1b0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2080db56-bf59-42c6-817b-d6fd60ed1b0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd77eb37802931f290ffa7989281aa1efcb2bfbb490622b4cb1c727d919a3e76"}}, "hash": "dd77eb37802931f290ffa7989281aa1efcb2bfbb490622b4cb1c727d919a3e76", "text": "doing more laundry, and about a third of the women spent it in their business (usually a shop or farming) (Practical Action, 2011).

The table includes five social and economic metrics that emerged from the review of the academic and grey literature. These are metrics for which a positive relationship was found with access to clean-cooking projects. The metrics that were evaluated in this chapter but for which no evidence was found on a positive relationship with clean-cooking projects were omitted from the matrix. The matrix in table 2 provides a basic scoring based on the relationship between levels of access to clean cooking and the social and/or economic benefits. The following scoring level was applied: (0) No benefit is to be expected for this social or economic metric. (1) Degree of social and economic benefit is small, compared with tier 0. (2) Degree of social and economic benefit is moderate, compared with tier 0. (3) Degree of social and economic benefit is large or significant, compared with tier 0. The matrix shows a gradual increase in the degree of social and economic benefits when moving to higher tiers in term of access to clean-cooking projects. Most of the reviewed literature focused on accessing impacts up to tiers 2 or 3, and it was assumed that benefits fully materialize when moving towards the higher tier levels. The results in Table 2 are visualized in a radar chart (Figure 11) to show the degree of social and economic benefits for different levels of clean-cooking projects. These radar charts can be useful for UNDP country office staff and project managers of clean-cooking projects because they provide, at a glance, what social and economic benefits could be anticipated based on the level (or \u201ctier\u201d) of clean cooking for their project intervention. Based on the results of this basic scoring, activities can be incorporated into the project plan to gather data to monitor the relevant metrics. 23 Table 2 Degree of social and economic benefits from access to clean-cooking projects, when compared with tier 0 (0) No benefit (1) Small benefit, compared with tier 0 (2) Moderate benefit, compared with tier 0 (3) Large and significant benefit, compared with tier 0 TIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3 TIER 4 TIER 5 Legacy and basic improved cookstoves Intermediate improved cookstoves Advanced improved cookstoves Modern fuel stoves Renewable fuel stoves #SDG Metric Indicator Indication of degree of benefit, compared to TIER 0 No poverty (SDG1) Increase in economic activity \u2022 Female employment rate \u2022 Increase in household income 0 0 1 2 3 Good health & well-being (SDG 3) Decrease in indoor air pollution due to access to clean cooking \u2022 Carbon monoxide concentration \u2022 PM2.5 concentration 1 2 3 3 3 Decrease in occurrence of diseases related to indoor air pollution due to access to clean cooking \u2022 Occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms \u2022 Occurrence of eye infections \u2022 Averted DALYs 1 2 3 3 3 Decrease in number of accidents with cooking \u2022 Occurrence of accidents 2 3 3 3 3 Gender equality (SDG 5) Increase in time for activities other than household chores \u2022 Decrease in time for fuel collection 0 0 0 2 3 \u00a7 24 Figure 11 Degree of expected benefits for SDG1, SDG3 and SDG5 of five tiers of access to clean- cooking, compared to tier 0 (traditional biomass cooking) TIER 1: Legacy and Basic Improved Cookstoves TIER 2: Intermediate Improved Cookstoves TIER 3: Advanced Improved Cookstoves TIER 4: Modern Fuel Stoves TIER 5: Renewable Fuel Stoves 25 5 Monitoring the social and economic benefits of energy- access projects This chapter provides an overview of the available approaches to monitor the social and economic benefits - beyond the basic approach of the radar charts presented in Chapters 3 and 4 \u2014 by distinguishing between simple and advanced methods that can be applied within the UNDP energy- access projects. 5.1 Introduction This chapter explores how the monitoring of social and economic benefits can be integrated into the regular monitoring cycle of UNDP energy-access projects. The analysis presented in chapters 3 and 4 allows for the most basic level of information on the relationship between energy access and socio- economic benefits. Any impact measurement beyond this basic level requires some form of data gathering through measurements to assess the real effects.

Rule of thumb: Apply a rule of thumb is a straightforward approach in which observed impact factors reported in academic or grey literature are combined with basic data gathering on the project level or making use of publicly available statistics. This entails working with average impacts resulting from projects executed in divergent circumstances. In this approach, however, calculations are surrounded by large uncertainties. Surveys:* Surveys are widely used to collect data on social and economic impacts. These can range from basic surveys, with a limited number of questions, to detailed surveys for scoring the baseline situation and project outcomes. Modelling: Modelling can, for example, be applied to assess economic or health impacts. Models include simplified or generalized benefit pathways derived from huge amounts of data. Combined with specific local or regional data, these models can be used to calculate economic or health impacts. Modelling is not a straightforward exercise because it requires running complex models and either collecting detailed data or making plausible assumptions. Measurements: Measurements are the most detailed and most precise way to determine socioeconomic benefits. Measurements, however, can be costly because they require a well-prepared monitoring protocol, installation of measuring equipment and longer-term measurements to attain reliable results. Note: *) In the ideal case, surveys are carried out twice: before (ex-ante) and after the project intervention (ex- post). Another option is to carry out a survey after project invention among the participants and compare these results with data gathered from a group of non-participants. The last option is more challenging because observed differences can be the result of other factors than the project intervention. In case the project includes a large number of households, a random sample of households should be used. This sampling needs to be carefully designed to ensure that the sample is representative for the whole group of project participants. 5.2 Monitoring approaches suitable for each impact category Table 4 provides an overview of the approaches that can be applied to monitor the social and economic benefits per impact category (see chapters 3 and 4), with further explanation in the sections that follow the table. 26 Table 4 Overview of approaches to monitoring the social and economic benefits for UNDP energy-access projects Monitoring approach #SDG Project category Metric Indicator Simple Advanced No poverty (SGG 1) Access to electricity Decrease in expenditure on lighting Expenditure on lighting (% of household income) \u2022 Measure the number of households and number of household members who got access to clean cookstoves and/or lighting equipment.

For energy- access project assessments, collect data on the number of households and the household members involved in the project who got access to clean cookstoves or lighting equipment. Intermediate monitoring method; Survey: Information to monitor expenditure on lighting, household income and employment of males and females can be gathered through surveys, in which households are questioned on their income, expenditures and their involvement in economic activities before and after the project intervention. Information on the establishment of new businesses requires collecting detailed data with businesses that received access to electricity because of the project. 5.4 Impact monitoring methods: Good health and well-being (SDG 3) Metric: Decrease in indoor air pollution Simple monitoring method; Rule of Thumb: Use a rule of thumb derived from the documented reduction in indoor air pollutant levels reported in academic or grey literature.

There is no need to collect data at the household level. Data from retailers or distributors can be used for the number of clean-cooking stoves and lighting equipment sold or distributed within the project. Intermediate monitoring method; Comparing publicly available emission levels: Another option in the case of cookstove interventions is to take emissions for specific technologies as a proxy for indoor air pollution levels. The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves maintains a database with laboratory and field-testing data on the performance of cookstoves and fuel products. This includes indoor emissions levels of carbon monoxide and PM2.5 for a large variety of cookstoves.9 These emissions data can be combined with data on emissions for the baseline to arrive at an indicator for the reduction of indoor air pollution. This approach is less accurate than modelling because the assumed emissions levels include all kinds of assumptions on cooking practices. In this case, a simple survey can be used to collect the following data on the household level: \u2022 Baseline: applied cooking fuel \u2022 Baseline: applied cooking technology \u2022 Project: distributed clean cooking technology \u2022 Project: number of households that use the technology. Advanced monitoring method; Modelling: The impact of the introduction of clean-cooking techniques on indoor air pollution can be modelled also by combining publicly available performance data for applied technologies with information gathered through surveys. The global database on the performance of cookstoves and fuel products, including indoor emissions levels, can be used. Combined with data on the baseline situation (tier 0)10 and local circumstances, the indoor concentration of carbon monoxide and PM2.5 can be calculated. This is not a straightforward exercise, however, because it requires complex calculations and either collecting detailed data or making assumption on: \u2022 Kitchen volumes \u2022 Air exchange rates 9 See http://catalog.cleancookstoves.org/stoves 10 See for example WHO Global database of household air pollution measurements. 29 \u2022 Ambient air pollutions levels \u2022 Fraction of emissions entering the room. Advanced monitoring method; Measurements: The decrease in indoor air pollution is typically expressed in terms of 24 or 48 hours mean value of indoor concentrations of carbon monoxide and PM2.5. The emphasis for clean cooking projects is on kitchen-level values. Indoor concentrations of carbon monoxide and PM2.5 can be measured among a representative group of participants, before and after a project intervention. The actual measurement of indoor air pollutions can be costly, however (see, for example, Edwards and others, 2007, and Naumhof, 2005). Metric: Occurrence of diseases related to indoor air pollution Simple monitoring method; Rule of Thumb: Apply a rule of thumb derived from documented reductions in the occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms and eye infections reported in academic and grey literature. For energy-access project assessments, data need to be collected on the number of people per household involved in the project. Intermediate monitoring method; Survey: The occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms and eye infections can be monitored using standardized surveys in which household members are questioned on the frequency of respiratory disease symptoms and the use of medication to treat these symptoms.11 Advanced monitoring method; Modelling: Health benefits can be calculated making use of an integrated exposure response model. In principle, these models use the outcome of indoor air pollution calculations described in the previous section as the input to estimate the risk to develop diseases related to indoor air pollution. For example, the online tool HAPIT can be used to calculate averted DALYs and death for five diseases (including respiratory diseases) resulting from a decrease of exposure to PM2.5 (Pillarisetti, A et al, 2016)12. Likewise, models for exposure to carbon monoxide are available. As noted in the previous section, modelling is not a straightforward exercise and can be complex and time consuming. It requires complex calculations and the collection of detailed data or assumptions. Metric: Occurrence of accidents Simple monitoring method; Rule of Thumb: Apply a rule of thumb derived from documented reductions in accidents reported in the academic and grey literature. In this case, data need to be collected on the number of households and members per households involved in the project.

This self-reporting can be shaped in various ways: \u2022 Households are surveyed before and after the project intervention on the number of children in the household attending school to provide an estimate on the amount of time the children spent on homework. \u2022 Households are approached to keep detailed time records on how members spent their time, for example, for a full week (this provides a broader picture on the way time is spent in households and not just on homework). Metric: Schooling Simple monitoring method; Rule of Thumb: Apply a rule of thumb derived from documented enhancements of school results within projects in comparable circumstances reported in the academic and grey literature. For energy-access project assessments, data need to be collected on the number and age of school-going children per household involved in the project. Intermediate monitoring method; Survey: Information on schooling can be gathered by surveying households with children attending school who are participating in the project. Information is gathered on the number of children who had enrolled and finished school and on the number of years spent at school. The impact on schooling probably will not fully materialize before terminal evaluation of the project because households probably first need to generate additional income to pay for more schooling. 5.6 Impact monitoring methods: Gender equality (SDG 5) Metric: Increase in time for activities other than household chores Simple monitoring method; Rule of Thumb: Apply a rule of thumb derived from available literature on the documented time savings resulting from access to electricity and clean cooking. For energy-access project assessments, data are collected on the number of involved households and household members. Advanced monitoring method; Detailed panel survey: Information on time spent on daily activities for various household members (with a focus on women) participating in the project is usually gathered through self-reporting, which can be shaped in various ways: \u2022 Households are surveyed at one point to provide an estimate on the daily and weekly time spent on chores, leisure and economic activities. \u2022 Households are approached to keep detailed time records on how members spend their time, such as for a full week. 5.7 Examples of monitoring approaches The following tables, Tables 5 to 9, present several examples of impact assessment where different types of monitoring approaches were used to measure social and economic benefits of electricity access and clean cooking projects. Annex A illustrates possible monitoring of social and economic benefits of an energy access project in the design of a survey for ex-ante and ex-post analysis. Table 5 Example of Basic Scoring Approach Example Description 1. Monitoring and Evaluation in Rural Electrification Projects: A Demand- Oriented Approach (World Bank, 2003) The main purpose of this report was to develop a general methodology to monitor and evaluate rural electrification projects. The four-level scoring matrices, ranging from zero to three, are used to aid the assessor/interviewer during household observations to evaluate the technical quality of electricity system installations, as 31 well as their social potential benefits including children education, health care and safety, and domestic productivity. Table 6 Examples of Rule of Thumb Approach Example Description 1. The Impact of Improved Clean Cookstoves on Households in Southern Haiti (Sagbo and Kusunose, 2015) This paper applied a simple t-test and propensity score matching methods in order to evaluate the effects of the use of improved cookstoves on household fuel expenditure in Southern Haiti. After gathering data from 146 households, the results revealed that using improved cookstove can reduce household fuel expenditure by 16.1 cents/day per household. We can use this as a rule of thumb when calculating future clean cooking projects in Haiti. 2. Gender and Livelihood Impacts of Clean Cooking in South Asia (Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, 2014) The key findings from this research showed that women spend about 4 hours a day when using traditional cookstoves; however, with improved cookstoves, they can save up to 70 minutes per day.

Table 7 Examples of Survey Approach Example Description 1. Peru: National Survey of Rural Household Energy Use (ESMAP, 2010) The national survey of rural household energy use was carried out in seven regions of Peru to gain a better understanding of the existing and potential users of electricity in rural areas. The survey provided data on rural household energy use and expenditures, use by rural households of electricity from the grid, and use by rural households of off-grid electricity. 2. Rural Electrification and Development in the Philippines: Measuring the Social and Economic Benefits (ESMAP, 2002) The study collected survey data from four regions located on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, where 28% of households in the sample lacks electricity. The survey\u2019s aim was to develop a practical method by which to measure the benefits of rural electrification, focusing on quality of life, educational effects, and other relevant factors. 3. Energy Need Assessment and Preferential Choice Survey of Matipukur Village in Bangladesh (Akter, 2015) The survey was designed to assess the rural household energy demand in Matipukur, Bangladesh. The questionnaire provided data on energy and water needs, fuel type use, energy consumption pattern, and biogas potential in the village. It was created in both English and Bengali. Table 8 Examples of Modeling Approach Example Description 1. Rural Electrification and Development in the Philippines: Measuring the Social and Economic Benefits (ESMAP, 2002) Apart from gathering data using household energy surveys, the modeling method was also applied in this study to determine the effects of rural electrification on children\u2019s reading and studying. 32 2. The Impact of Access to Electricity on Education: Evidence from Honduras (Squires, 2015) This paper examined the electrical expansion in Honduras from 1992 to 2005 in order to estimate the impact of electricity access on educational attainment. The study used a Cox Proportional Hazard model to predict the percentage of students who would drop out with and without access to electricity. 3. Rural Electrification and Female Empowerment in Iran: Decline in Fertility and Rise of Literacy (Salehi-Isfahani and Taghvatalab, 2008) This paper examined the impact of electricity expansion to rural areas on two important determinants of women\u2019s empowerment: fertility and literacy. The study used difference-in-difference (DID) and instrumental variables (IV) methods to measure the impact of the extension of electricity to rural areas on village-level child women-ratios and female literacy rates. Table 9 Example of Measurement Approach Example Description 1. Indoor Air Quality and ventilation assessment of rural mountainous households of Nepal (Parajuli, Lee, and Shrestha, 2016) Indoor air quality (IAQ) was assessed by continuous monitoring of the PM2.5 and CO concentrations for 24 hours in a sampled household in Nepal, with a total of 32 sampled measurements in 16 households. The assessment was conducted based on daily use of stove preparing three meals (2 major meals in the morning and evening and 1 short meal in the afternoon). This monitoring system was developed to find and compare general IAQ produced by both improved cookstove and traditional cookstove. 33 6 Case studies Using two typical UNDP projects in Asia, this chapter illustrates how the methodology developed in this study can be applied and how it is helpful for improving the monitoring of social and economic benefits of energy access projects. 6.1 Case 1: Development of sustainable renewable energy generation in Bangladesh Project period 2014\u20142018 Sources Project document, mid-term evaluation (November 2017) and 2017 project implementation review reports.

The mid-term evaluation included a proposed revised results framework with different numbers. Basic scoring of social and economic benefits Tier 1: Task Lighting and Phone Charging The radar chart shows that based on findings from the literature evaluated in this study: \u2022 A moderate benefit can be anticipated on poverty reduction due to a decrease on expenditure for lighting. \u2022 A small benefit can be anticipated on health due to a decrease of indoor air pollution and related diseases. \u2022 A small benefit can be anticipated on education. Available monitoring information The 2017 project implementation review report states that in total 1,230 solar photovoltaic lanterns were distributed through the project, displacing 2.6 litres of fuel monthly per household. 35 Observations and recommendations \u2022 The available information in the project file is insufficient to determine the social and economic benefits beyond the basic level. \u2022 An estimate of the decrease in expenditure for lighting by households can be determined through a rule of thumb approach. The project file states that due to the distribution of solar lanterns, households on average saved 2.6 litres of fuel per month. Combined with data on the average costs for fuel in this region of Bangladesh, the total reduction in expenditure on fuel used for lighting can be determined. However, these are average values, which do not provide insight on differences between households. And these calculations do not provide insight on the net impact on household expenditure because possible additional expenses for use or purchase of the solar lanterns were not accounted for. A more accurate insight on the benefits of distributing solar lanterns on household expenditure for lighting and the net impact on household expenditure can be gained through surveys among a cross-section of the 1,230 households who received the solar lanterns. These surveys should include questions on total household income and expenditure, expenditure for lighting and average price paid for fuel, among other topics. In the ideal case, a survey is done before and after distribution of the solar lanterns to enable comparison before and after project intervention. \u2022 Because the benefits on health are expected to be small, a rule of thumb is the most obvious approach. This requires measuring the number of solar lanterns distributed and evaluating information on similar projects reported in academic and grey literature on reductions of carbon monoxide and PM2.5 levels and a reduction on the number of accidents due to lighting. \u2022 Because the benefits on education are also expected to be small, a rule of thumb is the most obvious approach. This requires measuring the number of solar lanterns distributed and evaluating information on similar projects reported in academic and grey literature on the benefits from additional hours per day spent on homework, the number of children finishing school per year, years at school and the number of children enrolling in school per year. \u2022 In case a survey is conducted, for example, to determine impact on expenditure for lighting, questions on education and occurrence of accidents with lighting can easily be added without much additional cost.

This is equally valid for electricity access as well as access to clean cooking, although the impact will show in different ways. The analysis expressed these different levels of impact along the levels of energy access by means of \u201cradar charts\u201d, where the wedges stand for SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5. For the wedges SDG1, SDG3 and SDG4, two to four sub-segments could be identified, thereby showing a more refined analysis of impact for these SDGs. Figure 12: Degree of expected benefits for SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5 of five tiers of access to electricity-access (left) and access to clean cooking (right), compared to tier 0 (no electricity access/traditional biomass) In order to monitor the impact of energy access projects with regard to its effect on SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and SDG5, there are several approaches possible, varying from simple monitoring to advanced monitoring methods.

At the same time, more advanced monitoring will require more time and resources and thus a balance will need to be sought for each project to find an optimum within the constraints of the project. Table 10 shows an overview of monitoring approaches, varying from simple to advanced monitoring methods. 41 Table 10 Overview of monitoring approaches, varying from simple to advanced Approaches Advanced\uf0e7 \u2794 Simple Basic scoring: Apply basic scoring of expected impact with \u201cradar charts\u201d presented in this study \u2014at four levels\u2014based on observed social and economic benefits highlighted in the academic and grey literature for different levels of access to electricity and clean-cooking solutions. Rule of thumb: Apply a rule of thumb is a straightforward approach in which observed impact factors reported in academic or grey literature are combined with basic data gathering on the project level or making use of publicly available statistics. This entails working with average impacts resulting from projects executed in divergent circumstances. In this approach, however, calculations are surrounded by large uncertainties. Surveys:* Surveys are widely used to collect data on social and economic impacts. These can range from basic surveys, with a limited number of questions, to detailed surveys for scoring the baseline situation and project outcomes. Modelling: Modelling can, for example, be applied to assess economic or health impacts. Models include simplified or generalized benefit pathways derived from huge amounts of data. Combined with specific local or regional data, these models can be used to calculate economic or health impacts. Modelling is not a straightforward exercise because it requires running complex models and either collecting detailed data or making plausible assumptions. Measurements: Measurements are the most detailed and most precise way to determine socioeconomic benefits. Measurements, however, can be costly because they require a well-prepared monitoring protocol, installation of measuring equipment and longer-term measurements to attain reliable results. Note: *) In the ideal case, surveys are carried out twice: before (ex-ante) and after the project intervention (ex- post). Another option is to carry out a survey after project invention among the participants and compare these results with data gathered from a group of non-participants. The last option is more challenging because observed differences can be the result of other factors than the project intervention. In case the project includes a large number of households, a random sample of households should be used. This sampling needs to be carefully designed to ensure that the sample is representative for the whole group of project participants. If there is no budget reservation in the project for monitoring impact, then the basic scoring approach with radar charts as presented in this study can be the minimum level of indicating expected impact and can be useful in: \u2022 Identifying the type and size of social and economic benefits associated with energy-access projects and \u2022 Indicating the importance of monitoring to free up resources for activities that need to be incorporated in the project to gather data to monitor relevant metrics. If the energy access project has limited resources available for monitoring the impact on SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and/or SDG5, then the \u201cRule of Thumb\u201d approach can help in getting an indication of impact by means of multiplying simple observations (e.g. number of households affected by the project, number of children affected by the project) with previously observed impact factors. In case of time and resources available for more serious monitoring, conduct of surveys ex-ante and ex- post project intervention can give good indications of impact of the energy access project towards the goals of the SDG1, SDG3, SDG4 and/or SDG5. An example of possible content of a survey can be found in Annex A. More advanced monitoring methods comprise of modelling exercises and measurements. In case energy access projects have a project component that is specifically aiming for certain impact, e.g. improved indoor climates, then it can be justified to use project budget for advanced monitoring by means of e.g. indoor air quality measurements, ex-ante and ex-post project intervention. Four recommendations for UNDP country offices emerged through this analysis: 42 \u2022 Promote the use of the basic scoring charts for energy-access projects to identify type and size of social and economic benefits associated with energy-access projects and the importance of monitoring impacts \u2022 Promote the use of the basic scoring charts for energy-access projects to explain the importance of realising full energy access up to Tier 5 level since only then the full benefits for other SDGs will be realised. \u2022 Identify and apply an impact assessment monitoring", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7787555-06ab-4fd0-a101-20efcc7af9a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7787555-06ab-4fd0-a101-20efcc7af9a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11b047f2ee4e76986c2068047c19c6025a972f7b1bb7df9b3ee0db27325b2fdb"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3b5e578-2e06-4f22-b589-6bec462e077f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf293d9ecc5eb67c391603686ac2b9db3367ac423242894db6e79c1f905bb3c4"}}, "hash": "5648200cbe66fcebd07480b69436dae3d2076f0a12d41867b0cfc97c725c5b48", "text": "approach as early as the inception phase of a project to ensure that the social and economic benefits are properly monitored from the start of each project. \u2022 Gather feedback on the usefulness of impact assessment and different levels of monitoring (simple to advanced) as well as problems encountered when gathering information on the social and economic indicators for energy-access projects to further develop mechanisms for assessing the social and economic benefits of completed energy-access projects. 43 References Arnold, J., A.

For this project, a detailed household energy survey was developed as the preferred monitoring approach since it can capture all the necessary aspects from the multi-tier matrices based on the respondent\u2019s experience, attitude, and awareness. Moreover, many attributes of energy, which include affordability, legality, and health and safety, can only be calculated through conducting household energy surveys. The following key steps are applied in order to assess the current status of rural electrification in the project and monitor the project\u2019s degree of social and economic benefits: 1. Understand the project\u2019s baseline situation 2. Define survey objective 3. Design household energy survey 4. Collect data from rural households 5. Analyze the final survey results A.2 Survey Objective The overall objective of this household energy survey is to measure the degree of social and economic benefits as a result of the expansion of rural renewable energy services in the project. The baseline survey will be designed to assess the baseline status of rural electrification, including the demand and energy use. Once the project has been implemented, the same survey will be repeated to measure its direct benefits and productivity. A.3 Survey Design In the following example, five possible modules are presented that field interviewers need to complete for each household visit. For any real life application, a selection can be made from these five modules, depending on relevance for the particular project. Core Module 1: Interviewer Information \u2013 Interviewers play a crucial role in the data collection process. At each location, they will manage the survey by informing household members on the purpose of the visit, observing the household, asking the respondent questions, and clarifying any inquiries he/she might have. Therefore, it is equally important to obtain general information on the interviewers such as their names and supervisors, as well as the duration to complete each visit. Core Module 2: Household Information \u2013 This following module provides fundamental information on the house, household, and its household members. This includes home address and number of rooms, and name, sex, and occupation of the respondent and each of the other household members. Similar to the first module, this module should be completed at the start of the survey in order to determine who the respondent is and to whom all the other modules will apply. Core Module 3: Electricity Supply \u2013 The third module presents a series of electricity supply-related questions in order to determine the household\u2019s main source of energy. If the respondent\u2019s household is connected to grid electricity, further questions on its reliability and legality will be asked. All respondents will then go through a list of other sources of energy such as kerosene, LPG, and solar PV home systems to determine the alternatives that each household usually depends on. Core Module 4: Electricity Services \u2013 In this module, the respondent will specify all the electric 46 appliances his/her household uses on a regular basis, including a number of each item owned, its capacity rating (if possible), and number of hours used during both day and night time. This aims to determine the actual use of energy services. Core Module 5: Measuring the Impacts on SDGs - The final module\u2019s main purpose is to evaluate the social and economic benefits in terms of SDGs 1, 3 to 5 mentioned in Section 3.4, which are related to poverty, well-being, education, and gender equality. It begins with a set of questions addressing each of the indicators, followed by a number of statements to which the respondent rates his/her level of agreement in order to measure the attitude on each SDG. These act as additional monitoring information and the difference between the baseline and final surveys data will determine the direct", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ccd6ac1-3378-4147-b4c9-fc84bbaefd84": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ccd6ac1-3378-4147-b4c9-fc84bbaefd84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Energy Access Projects and SDG Benefits", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74c04ee041dd2096e365a99a39aba3f576137850bf89bdb1ddd98e0193f5a430"}, "3": {"node_id": "0163dfc3-078a-4b05-a3e3-12dfaae05e3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/energy-access-projects-and-sdg-benefits", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4782b3e5bf540f2fb51cb49de0fe4d3cc9c86d7fbee962c7e6af4e4adb3863d6"}}, "hash": "6671ebedd9fe0e9b4bf0995150424fef7e6c3969c8208f68531b2ce3f20c1a9c", "text": "benefits created by the project. A.4 Household Data Collection The next step after completing the household energy survey is to conduct it on the field. The survey should cover a sufficient and equal amount of sample size per area to represent reliable estimations of the survey population. The field interviewers, who will check and collect data from the respondent, should randomly select their samples from households that are varied in terms of size and geographical area, as well as those with and without grid-electricity access. A.5 Survey Analysis Apart from overall analysis, the total survey results can also be evaluated at a disaggregated level, or into smaller categories. This allows data analysts to examine the characteristics of each household and its energy use more closely, address possible trends, and expose any hidden deficiencies in electricity access at a specific geographic location. These indicators that can be calculated in terms of ratio or percentage are: Core Module 2: Household information - Number of household members - Female- to male-headed household - Highest education level in each household Core Module 3: Electricity supply - Households with and without access to grid electricity - Tier levels of each Attribute of electricity supply - Types of energy sources used Core Module 4: Electricity services - Tier levels of electric appliances ownership Core Module 5: Measuring the impacts on SDGs SDG 1-No poverty: - Monthly household income and expenditure by region - Types of income-generating activity - Average number of hours work per week (by sex and age) SDG 3-Health and well-being: - Smoking to non-smoking household members - Types of illnesses - Types of accidents - Number of days children missed school due to illness/accidents SDG 4-Education: - Number of children in school - Children\u2019s education level - Average hours children spent on reading/homework at night 47 SDG 5-Gender equality: - Number of hours men and women spent on chore and non-chore activities - Number of hours men and women spent on leisure activities A.6 Survey on Social and Economic Benefits of Energy-Access Project Module 1: Interviewer Information Interviewer: Supervisor: Date: Start Time: End Time: Module 2: Household Information Address: State: Number of Household Members (Total/Men/Women/Children): Education Level (Highest in Household): Number of Rooms in House: Respondent: 1.

In summary, while the challenges posed by climate change are daunting and time is short, country-driven responses\u2014as leveraged by CCFFs and their climate finance readiness plans\u2014 also present an opportunity. Namely: how to make public services and investments work better for the poorest and most vulnerable, and how to deliver them to where they are most needed to build resilience. This Guidance Note moves countries another step toward seizing that opportunity. Jo Scheuer Director for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction, UNDP\u2019s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support Foreword The impacts of climate change are being felt deeply across the world and threaten to undermine decades of hard won development gains. Beyond the threat to lives and livelihoods, the economic impacts are staggering. For example, it is estimated that by 2050 climate change could reduce GDP growth in some countries throughout South and South East Asia by up to 4% per annum. UNDP is actively supporting governments to put in place integrated, transformative development approaches that are sustainable, resilient, and inclusive. Increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of how climate finance is delivered will play a key role in how people and countries can move towards realising the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3faa247-5f11-4281-a5b6-38f70b8c57a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3faa247-5f11-4281-a5b6-38f70b8c57a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b64ceff742143f5ca86858f5135d6dfa8592575bba86b09dae4598ee4672d0c"}, "2": {"node_id": "eceb911e-0274-47ca-a8f4-4ab08d57df5b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56c920919aa90a31d505709ae64c48eb8a0c3a2e8b5a078ebb5d345c9d5ea0d2"}}, "hash": "14046ae1ef40154d0cbcf9f21dd49c0a0d2a48d2392edcf6f517bfa27deefffc", "text": "This Guidance Note serves as an introductory guide for stakeholders on how to create or refine a Climate Change Financing Framework (CCFF) \u2013 a strategic, whole-of-government plan to better manage, mobilize and target climate finance.

Indeed, a CCFF process could culminate in a strategic financing plan linked to a medium-term budget policy document. This emphasis on domestic finance reflects the imperative for a paradigm shift toward \u201cblended finance\u201d approaches to climate action, as well as the greater importance of partnerships and government co-financing for achieving the SDGs. As domestic financing for climate change increases, UNDP, with decades of experience in over 170 countries and territories around the world, is in a unique position to build capacities to resource \u201czero carbon\u201d development. This focus on providing guidance to governments underscores how UNDP is moving from a traditional donor to an advisor and provider of development services. Emerging from bottom-up experiences of working directly with governments in the Asia Pacific, this guidance note has developed processes and strategies that are globally applicable and scaleable throughout other countries, areas and regions. UNDP aims to improve how development financing can secure optimal benefits for the poor and vulnerable. Looking forward, climate financing strategies and CCFFs also present unique opportunities to integrate gender equality and other social development concerns to the mutual benefit of all agendas. Subsequent updates to this Note and accompanying technical briefs will reflect such innovative approaches. How to Navigate the Guidance Note This Note outlines the core elements, processes, workflows, and outputs of a CCFF. This is achieved by reviewing the roles and value-added aspects that a CCFF plays in facilitating a whole of government response to the challenges presented by climate change. Tailored Advice: How to best read this Guidance Note Guidance and practical tips throughout the note are tailored along the lines of the key stakeholders (i.e. the \u201carchetypal\u201d institutions most typically involved in CCFF formulation). This allows the reader to follow the process and workflows most relevant to their institution. Readers from these institutions can follow the text by scanning the guidance note for the relevant colour coding system below. These colours will occur in the text and at the side of page margins (see the left side of this page for example), marking which pages are relevant for which bodies. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The Climate Change Policy Body (CCPB) is responsible for integrated climate change governance including developing, monitoring and coordinating a national climate policy. This role is typically played either by a ministry of environment (MoE) operating independently or as the Secretariat of an inter-ministerial climate change council. In a few countries, a unit of the Ministry of Finance plays this role, or a dedicated ministry or authority has been set up. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The Ministry of Finance (MoF) takes responsibility for public revenue and expenditure and for coordinating the budget process. \ufffd\ufffd The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MOP) takes responsibility for coordinating long-term national development planning and issuing guidelines for ensuring that service delivery and investment contributes to improved livelihoods and economic opportunities for all. They can also play a key role in developing targeted programs and policies to attract green investment. \ufffd\ufffd Line Ministries (LMs) and Investment Agencies are responsible for the design and implementation of sectoral policy and for mainstreaming climate change into their sector plans and budgets. Investment agencies can be set up to facilitate PPPs and state-owned enterprises with a particular sectoral scope that is climate-relevant (e.g., renewable energy). \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Accountability Actors (AAs) are responsible to hold governments to account for their policies, actions, and budget allocation decisions related to climate change. AAs can come from within and outside government. These include parliamentarians, CSOs, the media and national audit institutions. Depending on the governance practices in each country, their role to play in the CCFF process can vary. Following Sections of the Guidance Note Section 2 outlines how data on climate impacts including risk and vulnerability assessments and economic analyses of associated damages can be used to build a better understanding of the effectiveness and targeting of past and current climate related expenditure. It then provides guidance on how to maintain and utilise this data; gives options for identifying, classifying and tracking climate-related expenditures; and, finally, illustrates how to develop a financing plan for a Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. This is particularly relevant for Climate Change Policy Bodies (CCPBs) though it also refers to responsibilities for Ministries of Finance and Line Ministries. Section 3 outlines how countries can adjust their budget processes to ensure that their national climate response plans are delivered more systematically. This requires an understanding of how climate change can be integrated into planning and public financial management across sectors and levels of government.

Section 4 provides more in-depth guidance to assist Line Ministries integrate climate change into their planning and budgeting processes. Section 4 illustrates how investment screening and appraisal tools can better include climate change; provides guidance on raising the profile of climate in budget submissions; and provides guidance on how external funding proposals for climate finance can be strengthened. Overall, the section provides an overview of how these measures can lead to improved access to budget finance and new sources of climate finance for Line Ministries. This chapter is primarily designed for Line Ministries, but should be of interest to other institutions. Section 5 reviews how existing frameworks for monitoring climate change actions can benefit from CCFFs. This monitoring is normally coordinated by the Climate Change Policy Body, but much of the information is generated by Line Ministries. As such, this section is particularly relevant for both Climate Change Policy Bodies and Line Ministries. Section 6 provides suggestions for how institutions can better coordinate an approach to the key components of a CCFF. It highlights how CCFFs can be tailored to each countries\u2019 needs. This chapter is particularly relevant for the Climate Change Policy Body (CCPB) and Accountability Actors.

Accompanying technical notes will follow this Guidance Note and will provide more detailed, step-by-step methodological advice. For instructions on how to best make use of this guide, please see the breakout box at the end of this section. This introduction will explain what a CCFF is, their benefits and rationale, where they have been carried out to date and lastly, it will outline of the contents of the Note. The Challenge of Climate Change The impacts of climate change \u2013 including increased droughts and more severe storms \u2013 are threatening lives and livelihoods across the globe. These impacts have an especially strong effect on the poor and marginalized who are more likely to suffer from rising food costs, damage to agriculture, the spread of tropical diseases and other effects of climate change. Climate change also threatens to undermine or reverse decades of development gains. The economic effects associated with climate change could reduce GDP growth in some countries throughout South and South East Asia by up to 4% per annum by 2050 (see Figure 3). For many developing countries in Africa and Asia, evidence suggests that their GDP in 2050 could be at least 25% below what it would be without climate change. These effects also increase maintenance or reconstruction costs for infrastructure, add new health burdens on the labour force, and reduce the productivity of natural resources and ecosystems. This is a distinct threat to the stability and prosperity of the region - one compounded by the fact that countries\u2019 systems and capacities, particularly those for planning and budgeting, are often ill equipped to deal with this. 1 Introduction Abbreviations ADB Asian Development Bank AF Adaptation Fund BCR Benefit Cost Ratio CBA Cost Benefit Analysis CC Climate change CCAR CC Annual Report CCBA CC Benefits Analysis CCFF CC Financing Framework CCSA CC Screening and Appraisal CCSAP CC Strategy and Action Plan CPEIR CC Public Expenditure and Institutional Review CSR Corporate Social Responsibility CTF Climate Trust Fund DRR Disaster Risk Reduction eCBA Extended Cost Benefit Analysis EIA Environmental Impact Assessment GCF Green Climate Fund GDP Gross Domestic Product GHG Greenhouse Gas LAPA Local Adaptation Plan of Action M&E Monitoring and Evaluation MCA Multi-Criteria Analysis MoF Ministry of Finance MoP Ministry of Planning MTEF Medium Term Expenditure Framework NAF National Adaptation Fund NAP National Adaptation Plan NAPA National Adaptation Programme of Action NCF National Climate Fund OBA Objectives Based Approach ODA Official Development Assistance PCCFAF Pacific CC Finance Assessment Framework PPP Public Private Partnership RoI Return on Investment SNA Sub National Authorities tCO2e Tons carbon dioxide equivalent emissions UNDP United Nations Development Programme 11 However, these challenges also represent opportunities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41f8d169-0435-400b-be70-c3f37e935ecf": {"__data__": {"id_": "41f8d169-0435-400b-be70-c3f37e935ecf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fa30624174c738c6f3e9f571be238fc1c1b151600f42d4ad99eec66bb3e55a3"}}, "hash": "1fa30624174c738c6f3e9f571be238fc1c1b151600f42d4ad99eec66bb3e55a3", "text": "if climate adaptation and mitigation finance efforts are managed effectively. In realigning development goals, promoting the green economy, and fostering more sustainable growth, follow-on social benefits beyond climate action can be accrued far into the future. Climate Change Financing Frameworks To address the grave challenges posed by climate change, domestic and international finance flows are increasingly being mobilized and directed towards climate adaptation and mitigation goals. Looking at international climate finance, for example, in 2014 multilateral and bilateral donors allocated $22 billion for adaptation activities alone. With these increasing flows comes a need for stronger systems and structures to track and manage them. At the same time, developing countries are becoming increasingly aware that both investor and donor confidence can be boosted through more transparent, risk-informed plans and budgets. Climate Change Financing Frameworks are designed to respond to this challenge. A comprehensive CCFF can be understood as a voluntary, whole-of-government process to structure a more strategic approach toward the mobilization, management and targeting of climate change finance. The process and workflows associated with a CCFF serve to align a country\u2019s climate policy framework with its budget process and to integrate climate finance into its existing public economic and financial management systems. This alignment will support the overarching goal of making financing flows more consistent with low-carbon, climate-reslient development pathways. CCFFs can serve as a key pillar to support the implementation strategies and action plans associated with national climate change and related green growth policies in developing countries. At the same time, they can be used as tool to support countries in setting and monitoring the delivery of their voluntary international commitments and unconditional targets articulated in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular, goal #13 on Climate Change as well key as results expected from the Addis Ababa Accords on Finance for Sustainable Development, and the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction. The outcomes from these processes abet more strategic and dependable implementation of climate actions and plans\u2014whether at the national or the sub-national level. As a generic framework, a CCFF is \u201cagnostic\u201d to mitigation/adaptation objectives. A country could orient its CCFF to support actions that reduce long-term climate change itself (through mitigation), or to those that can unlock new economic opportunities presented by its effects, while reducing the fiscal burden linked to them (through adaptation). Ideally it would look at both in a holistic and integrated manner. CCFF processes engage a variety of government stakeholders and accountability actors. The process would ordinarily culminate in a formal, government issued \u2018master plan for financing a climate change response\u2019\u2014called either a financial or fiscal framework\u2014 associated with a key budget or economic policy document, such as a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) or National Economic Plan. In some instances, an outcome in the sense of the latter understanding of a CCFF is an immediate action point (e.g., Cambodia, Bangladesh), whereas in other countries the Ministry of Finance elaborating a distinct framework document is a second-level goal achieved over time after a policy process initiating various reforms has been instituted and components of the interlinked CCFF process are further realised and embedded into routine public economic and financial management processes. INTRODUCTION 2 3 INTRODUCTION Once short and medium-term needs and shortfalls have been identified, the framework can then chart out ways to close the climate financing gap through policies, activities, and measures that are best placed to deliver results. Broadly, three overarching principles would underlie an approach to these CCFF driven outcomes and tools: Effectiveness Ensuring that funding flows are guided toward actions that make genuine contributions to mitigation or adaptation results, based on evidence and metrics that look at how effective they are. For mitigation, effectiveness is generally measured by the extent to which an action reduces GHG emissions at a set cost (see section 4.1). In the case of adaptation, programmes can be evaluated based on their ability to reduce the projected economic value of expected losses. In some cases, similar projects or precursor pilots can be used as a benchmark. Climate change screening and appraisal (CCSA) is used in conjunction with these analyses (see section 4.1), which in turn guides climate expenditure classification and tracking (see sections 2.2 and 2.3). Efficiency Prioritising climate actions can also be guided by efficiency metrics to ensure an optimal return on public investment. Efficiency is generally determined by dividing the effectiveness of an action by its costs. The efficiency of climate mitigation actions is expressed as a function of the cost of reducing a unit of GHG emissions (i.e., the marginal abatement cost", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6e69e0f-3700-4bed-bed9-80d49322144a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6e69e0f-3700-4bed-bed9-80d49322144a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27856c630e29ec05807c2fa58f574c5873c7b868f10e981817732e58d5993ea2"}, "3": {"node_id": "17734232-aee9-4692-a557-d531357e532c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dab5e807dd1b8336f646a8e9fbaa35e4510a03de866ef370b4e781f805d1d92d"}}, "hash": "2e81cf7f2883371990dc1969341e7fe6ba331743b831b2cfa685a1221ac30a4e", "text": "or MAC); this is usually expressed in terms of a CO2 equivalent unit cost ratio ($/tCO2e). For adaptation, efficiency can also be thought of as a ratio (see section 4.1) that measures how damage or loss expressed as economic \u2018units\u2019 could be reduced for a given amount of money or as a share of GDP. Equity Climate finance should be targeted more equitably to address imbalances in the effects and costs of climate change on different population groups, geographies, and sectors. As climate change vulnerability tends to exacerbate existing inequality and social exclusion, it is important that decisions on allocating climate funds reflect a need to reach communities that are already poor or gender unequal. Quantifying these dimensions of risk and impacts in economic terms provides a basis for setting priorities and targets in each sector, which can further guide the budget process. CCFF tools can support budget and proposal prioritization among various options and response programmes based on where funding can simultaneously address both climate and long-term development goals, such as reducing social inequality (see section 4.1). In this way, an optimal and fairer allocation of expenditure can be made (see section 2.5). CCFFs would normally consider financial planning and gaps both in the medium as well as in the longer term. For most countries, budget and fiscal policy planning processes cover short-term (i.e. annual) or medium-term (i.e. three to five year) time scales. CCFFs could, for example, aim to align with the time parameters of a country\u2019s MTEF (normally covering 3 to 5 years). At the same time, due to the long-term nature and economic consequences of global climate change, it is also important that planning and finance ministries begin the process of translating these into long-term action plans and development policy frameworks for today. INTRODUCTION 4 5 INTRODUCTION Longer-term actions could be aimed to align to international timeframes as set by various fora including the SDG process, which aims at goals to be achieved by 2030, and the Paris Agreement, which sets various dates for global reporting and stocktaking (e.g., the first expected global stock take in 2023). Since in most cases only a small portion of international climate funds will come from donors, it is vitally important that government budgeting and financing mechanisms are geared appropriately to address climate change, including developing clear fiscal incentives for private sector engagement.

In highlighting the scale of the challenge, public policy dialogue can be better informed and additional pressure brought to bear on the accountability of governments to ensure effective climate strategies are integrated into planning and budgeting (see section 5). INTRODUCTION 6 7 INTRODUCTION CCFF Components A CCFF can be viewed as a set of interrelated policy processes, components and workflows (see Figure 1) encompassing a range of technical analyses and institutional reforms. There is no standard form that all CCFFs take. Instead each is tailored to every country\u2019s needs, strengths and unique challenges. However, the key core components and associated workflows of CCFFs include: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdValuing climate change and integration in PFM systems: and integrating assessments of climate risk, vulnerability, and associated losses and damages into public financial and economic management. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdClimate Change Screening and Appraisal (CCSA): integrating the implications of climate change into overall evaluations of the effectiveness of policies/projects as well as their incremental contribution to adaptation and/or mitigation goals. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMTEF Integration and Budget Process Reforms: instituting climate budget tagging and scoring systems, and using performance monitoring and CCSA to argue for marginal changes in budget allocation. \ufffd\ufffd More evidence-based climate funding: using CCSA and budget analyses to strengthen the cost-effectiveness of fiscal instruments as well as applications for international climate funding. \ufffd\ufffd Integrating Climate Change into Planning Templates and Budgeting Annual Economic Reports. \ufffd\ufffd Tracking, including Real-Time Expenditure Reports: accounting and reporting on the level of public (and potentially private) spending that contributes to adaptation and/or mitigation and mapping how much is being spent and where. \ufffd\ufffd Climate Change Financing Scenarios: estimating future funds available, realigning action plan costings to be consistent with availability, and assessing the gap between needs and availability of finance. \ufffd\ufffd Integrating Climate Change Risk/Valuation metrics in M&E guidelines: reviewing the expected impact of climate action in reducing GHG emissions and/or the economic effects of climate change. How these CCFF-specific workflows relate to routine policy/planning processes and budgeting cycles is shown in Figure 2. Since the workflows all interrelate and ultimately interconnect in a cycle, there is no single correct \u201csequencing\u201d approach. Governments may choose which components and entry points to emphasize their efforts, as per their own existing policy priorities, needs, and capacities. Thus, while common and uniform elements of CCFFs exist, countries can and will choose a pathway and different areas of initial focus, under a structured menu approach that reflects their own context.

It found that CCFF work was completed, or is underway, in at least seven countries (i.e., Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Pakistan) and in several states of India. Other countries have undertaken work on some elements of a CCFF (e.g., Bhutan, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and several Pacific Island States). Kick-starting a CCFF is often, though not always, informed by first undertaking a Climate Change Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR) and using the results to inform a broader and more complex process. In some cases, national adaptation planning exercises (e.g., NAPs or NAPAs) have given rise to CCFF workflows aimed at prioritising key actions and ensuring more consistent financing for them. That\u2019s because these processes often serve as the basis for elaborating short and medium-term priorities and integrating them into national and sectoral strategies (e.g., poverty reduction strategic papers (PRSP), national socio-economic development plans, etc.).

The CCFF built on Cambodia\u2019s national climate change strategy, the cross-sectoral climate change action planning process and expenditure analysis (using tools such as the CPEIR).

CCFF Workflows for an Integrated, Evidenced Based Response This chapter describes how CCFFs can contribute to realising climate change strategies and action plans (CCSAPs) and national climate finance readiness through a stronger evidence-base. CCFF tools and workflows support truly integrated financing strategies, ensuring that actions can be financed in a more prioritized, rational way in line with broader sustainable development goals. This chapter outlines how climate risk and assessments of damages and losses can inform CCSAPs and their monitoring and be better integrated into PFM systems, as well as how a better understanding of climate-related expenditure can inform line ministry budgets. It is particularly relevant for climate change Policy Bodies (CCPBs) though it also refers to responsibilities for MoF and LMs. 2.1 Valuing Climate Change and Integration into PFM Systems: Climate risk, vulnerability, loss and damage assessments Most countries have conducted some scientific assessments of their overall level of climate risk and vulnerabilities. This entails cataloguing a wide range of potential effects and impact chains in different sectors associated with extraordinary events, such as severe heatwaves or glacial outburst floods, as well as slow onset changes, such as desertification, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. These scenarios are generally all linked to projected levels of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Based on such climate risk modelling, vulnerability assessments try to predict the extent of the impacts that would affect the country. They generally look at the potential magnitude of changes (exposure), the characteristics of the system (sensitivity), and the ability of people and ecosystems to cope (adaptive capacities). Capturing all these parameters in a transversal manner across ecological, social, and economic factors can be methodologically challenging. CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED, EVIDENCED BASED RESPONSE Related to climate risk assessments, vulnerability indices compare variations within and between countries. These often include or draw upon information compiled through various discrete research studies that focus on different threats, impact chains, or sectors. Loss and damages can refer to both economic or non-economic harm. This can be incurred as a result of extraordinary events such as weather-related disasters (e.g., cyclones), as well as from slow-onset events (e.g., destruction of farmland by saline intrusion due to gradual sea-level rise). In the disaster management sphere, losses refer to those impacts to tangible assets or wealth impacts that can be marketised. Impacts are generally accounted for and distinguished between direct and indirect impacts. Whereas the former refers to physical damage to properties from direct contact with the hazard, i.e. destruction of infrastructure, inventories, etc., indirect damage refers to interruptions in the flow of goods and services. Under the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), established under the UNFCCC process, the term \u201cLoss and Damage\u201d has been interpreted to refer to the irreparable harm caused by climate impacts that are permanent or irreversible, which can be expressed in economic as well as in non-economic terms. While this is not the meaning ascribed to in this guidebook, some of the methods and tools used to value climate change impacts could be applicable to informing policy discussions under the WIM. Why is this important in a CCFF context? While the findings of climate risk and vulnerability assessments are usually summarised in national (or sub-national) CCSAPs, they are rarely comprehensive. They ordinarily attempt to quantify the scale of risks (e.g. area or number of people affected by floods or drought), and analyses of past or expected loss and damages are most often expressed in physical terms (e.g., hectares of crops destroyed or kWh of electric power lost), rather than economic ones.

Capturing the macro-fiscal implications of climate change, and monetising losses and damages linked to climate impacts is a key building block of a CCFF.

This requires extensive capacity building and educating end-users at various levels on how to use this evidence effectively to make more informed planning, budget allocation, and investment decisions.

This work stream would inform others related to budget classification and coding (see section 2.2), developing costing and financing scenarios (see section 2.4), screening and appraisal (see section 4.1), and estimating the effectiveness of adaptation actions (see section 5.2). It will also require analysing changes in expenditure patterns, improving climate-proofing through more climate sensitive design and leveraging public finance through regulations and incentives that encourage more private sector finance. By translating available evidence into economic and/or monetary terms and linking this to public economic and financial management processes, a CCFF takes routine climate policy work one step further. By linking these two normally siloed work streams, a CCFF can help governments elaborate more integrated national financing strategies, including those dedicated to closing the \u201cadaptation gap\u201d. That is because the effectiveness of climate finance flows to mitigate the economic impact of specific loss and damage to sectors or sub-regions is an important factor in quantifying this gap (see section 2.4). Moving forward: Improving Data Collection In most countries, CCSAPs include a section describing overall national vulnerability and how climate change would affect regions and sectors.

There is a key role for the CCPB and the MoP to play in stock taking and aggregating various existing research. This requires pulling together the most robust elements from all sources and using expert judgement to fill knowledge gaps. In many cases, pulling information together into a more unified, coherent database will not be the only exigency, but also digitising and translating data into more user-friendly formats. Overarching guidance for this work is provided in the list of resources. More specific guidance and details regarding how this should be undertaken will be presented in a subsequent technical note.

They will thus screen and appraise various potential adaptation actions using CCSA with an eye toward ensuring that growth and development is more resilient to climate change. Scope of analysis Occasionally, climate valuation analysis also considers social and environmental dimensions related to Green GDP. While theoretically consistent with broader principles, it adds a layer of complexity to an already quite complex task. Most CCFF work to date has started by consider- ing a narrow interpretation of economic activity and \u2018conventional GDP\u2019. Capturing co-benefits of adaptation The potential co-benefits of adaptation measures typically isn\u2019t taken into account when quantifying the potential economic effects of climate change. While this is not fully accurate, it also allows for the effectiveness of all adaptation actions to be compared with some level of objectivity. Using a metric for approximating climate change relevance (CC%) can be applied to facilitate this comparison (see section 2.2). Estimating macroeconomic loss Once reliable sources and figures have been identified and triangulated, the figures must be carefully reported on, as explained in Box 2. For very fast-growing countries, projected GDP could be only 3 or 4 times current levels, instead of 5 or 6 times higher. For countries that have less potential for growth it is likely to mean that growth is impossible after twenty or thirty years. A preliminary study taking into account available information in a handful of countries begins to make such estimates. This highlights not only the methodological complexity, but also the benefits to a CCFF from having a unified measure of future macro-fiscal losses expressed in economic and monetary terms. In stock taking available data sets, it should be possible to select sources to combine in data triangulation. For an example of how this was carried out, please see Box 1. The Financing Framework for the Chhattisgarh State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPFIN) estimated that the agriculture sector would incur damage and losses from climate change equal to 24.5% of crop GDP. This was half of agricultural GDP, which made up 16.1% of total GDP. This figure was primarily based on an analysis of average yields over the last 10 years, and assumed that future yield would be best predicated by the two highest yielding years. It also assumed that losses for variable climate in bad years would double by 2050, based on the SREX report (IPCC 2012). Confidence in this result was supported by triangulation from several sources. An IAM modelling study for South Asia suggested that crop yields in NE India could decline by about 10% (Ahmed and Suphachalasai 2014). Another study that correlated climate data with spatial and temporal variations in recent crop yields concluded that output would be 10% lower by 2040 (Guiteras 2009). These studies both used average temperature and rainfall in their vulnerability analyses, which are threats likely to be at least as important than more variable rainfall. This suggests that the actual economic loss will likely be over 20%, consistent with the figure of assumed in the SAPFIN.

Much of this evidence comes from the work of specialist CSOs engaged in appraisal and evaluation work. The CCFF work funded by UNDP has helped compile and interpret this experience, notably in Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand. Many countries now have at least some evidence of each type. CCFF work typically involves searching for all sources that can be located within the time and resources available and triangulating amongst them. To ensure that the evidence is compiled and is accessible, the CCPB needs to build a library of evidence on expected losses and damage, and to support knowledge management systems that ensure that this library is widely available. The CCPB and other non-executive actors can play a strong role in ensuring that evidence on macro-fiscal losses is presented clearly to politicians, government officials, parliamentarians, and the media.

Classification is required to monitor trends in expenditure (see section 2.4) and, because it is based on an analysis of how climate change affects expenditure, it also provides the incentive for incorporating climate change into the design of programmes. Moving Forward Climate expenditure typically falls into several different categories or typologies. Most are constituted as part of the routine delivery of goods and services as they have other primary social and economic objectives. There are some large expenditures that have only small climate relevance (e.g. primary health and roads). Simply adding the expenditure of all climate related efforts means that the overall trends are dominated by a few large items that may not be the most relevant or important climate actions. This problem is addressed by classifying the climate expenditure into different degrees of climate relevance. Past work on classifying past climate expenditure3 has shown that typically at least 150 separate expenditure items have some degree of climate relevance. Some county analyses have as many as 1,000. Although, many items are often similar and can be classified as a group. Three main approaches have been used in classifying climate related expenditure, which can be considered as complementary, rather than as alternatives. \ufffd\ufffd Binomial: The most basic approach uses an initial \u2018yes/no\u2019 classification such that all expenditure judged to reduce GHG emissions and/or macro-fiscal losses is classified as climate finance. This system is used for most international climate finance monitoring, such as that by WRI, CPI and ODI (Bodnar, Brown et al. 2015). It is also used in some government CCFF work (e.g. in Odisha). \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdObjective-based: The yes/no approach to climate expenditure classification can be made more robust by distinguishing levels of relevancy, typically on the basis of an activity\u2019s explicit or implicit objectives; for example: high, mid, low and no relevance. This approach has been used for the OECD/DAC climate markers, in most early CPEIRs and in the countries where pilot budget markers have been introduced (i.e., Nepal and Indonesia). In CPEIR work, the high/mid/low categories were associated with weights (e.g. 75%/50%/25% respectively) which were used to give a single measure of total weighted expenditure. Studies that review Macro-Fiscal Losses often report the results in ambiguous ways, typically quoting figures of between 1% and 5% of GDP in 2050, but failing to state clearly what the figures refer to. The meaning of these figures depends on the analytical approach and this is not always obvious from the reports.

This may be done in a rapid and qualitative way or in a more detailed and quantitative way. The experience with CCSA has been compiled into a table that gives typical default ranges for the scores which can be used for rapid classification. While this approach is the most robust or objective, it also requires the greatest level of capacity. These methods are all useful and play different roles. Most countries have started an overview of all expenditure items, including a yes/no classification, as a screening exercise and to build awareness, and then adding an assessment of high/mid/low relevance, based on objectives. This first overview is usually undertaken by a small team of experts, with some consultation with government. In a few cases, the experts have done a rapid desk study to build awareness within government before moving on to consultation. As this work evolves, demand for more structured and mature methods of scoring are often created. These can be based on CCSA, using whatever level of detail is appropriate for the country and type of expenditure. Where weights are used, the basis for the weighting should be clarified and, if the system of weighting is changed, then adjustments need to be made to map one set of weights to another and ensure that the trends in weighted expenditure are based on consistent methods. One option is to start directly with some more detailed classification, applying CCSA methods to a small pilot sample of actions (examples of this approach include Thailand and Maharashtra). Example of Project Typologies for Climate-Relevant Weighting used in Thailand The figure below presents trends in climate change expenditure as a % of GDP based on data generated by CCFF and CPEIR work in Asia. It groups results into the three different approaches to classification outlined above. The diamonds compare the various sources, after dividing the objectives-weighted approach results by three and the unweighted results by six. These reflect a rough average conversion factor, taken across all the countries, since the most appropriate conversion will depend on the composition of expenditure and on judgements taken in assigning scores. The results suggest that Assam, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal have relatively higher levels of climate expenditures, compared to Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. This potentially reflects the higher stage of economic and private sector development in the latter set of countries.

This avoids less relevant, costly actions being outweighed in genuine importance.

Moreover, this practice would build ownership and embed practices. Line Ministries may benefit from involving CSOs, who often have new and innovative appreciation of similar programmes. This will help broaden capacity and awareness. To ensure that the classification is comparable, the CCPB could consider defining a standard national approach to classifying climate change expenditure and produce country specific guidelines for this approach. It should then provide technical support to Line Ministries and manage a system for providing quality control. 2.3 Options for Expanding the Scope of Expenditures Covered in a CCFF What is the scope of climate change expenditure covered? Most CCFF work to date has focused on public expenditure at a central and provincial or state level, usually including on and off budget expenditure from domestic and international sources. Private investments, local public investments, regulatory expenditure and expenditures with negative impacts on adaptation or mitigation have generally been excluded. Why is this important in a CCFF context? While the initial focus of CCFFs on central and provincial or state levels has been effective, it is a framework that could be equally effectively applied to other levels of government. Local governments also manage large programmes of expenditure. Moving Forward: Options for widening the scope of CCFF work includes: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLocal Government: In many countries, most climate expenditure is incurred at local levels, because this is where natural resources are managed. Some CCFFs have already made efforts to classify and estimate trends in climate change expenditure at local levels. In particular, there is interest in possibilities for changing transfers to give incentives to report on climate change related activities at the local level. Most CPEIRs also address challenges and opportunities to better track climate finance at the local level, and in some countries (e.g., Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam) CPEIRs have been conducted for local governments. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRevenue, Regulations and Incentives: There is growing global interest and recognition that the state plays a critical role in engaging the private sector to mobilize new and additional climate finance through new regulations, incentives and fiscal policies. Public funding for these, including required enforcement mechanisms, is generally reflected in the state budget, either as fiscal transfers by the MOF to private financial institutions or as \u2018negative expenditure\u2019 associated with reduced tax revenue. While the focus of these fiscal policy reforms has been mainly on climate mitigation, there has been increased appetite to develop schemes suitable for adaptation goals (e.g., through state subsidies to weather-risk insurance schemes for farmers or providing tax breaks to businesses that invest in supply chain management with positive adaptation benefits). A key focus for future CCFF work streams is likely to be on expenditure associated with these policies as reflected in budgets for line ministries and investment agencies. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdParastatals and Agencies: Many parastatals and agencies are involved in work that is affected by climate change, including those that work in water, energy, waste, environment, agriculture and some aspects of rural development and welfare. The response of these parastatals to climate change will have implications for their profitability and may therefore affect public finance, either through changes in investment requirements, or through subsidies and taxes. 23 22 CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED, EVIDENCED BASED RESPONSE CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED, EVIDENCED BASED RESPONSE CCPB LM\u2019s MoP Points to Consider \u201cLocalising\u201d of CCFF work. The level of detail and quality of public finance data is varied at the local level and officials are usually less used to formal analysis. However, local officials may be well informed about evidence on recent climate change and may already be taking these changes into account. Including Parastatals and Agencies. Parastatals are often significant sources of climate-related public expenditure, particularly in middle income countries. While important, it is often not easy to analyse the implications of climate investment at this level, as many do not provide detailed accounts and have little interest in discussing their profitability more than necessary. Maladaptation and \u2018Mal-mitigation\u2019. The political sensitivities regarding maladaptation and \u2018mal-mitigation\u2019 can be handled, to some extent, by taking a constructive approach to defining complementary activities that can offset any maladaptation and mal-mitigation effects.

This is being piloted in a number of countries, including Thailand and Vietnam. The scope of these is often limited to only the most climate-relevant sectors, due to lack of data availability or access. The OECD has also established a collaborative research group to develop methodological guidance on these issues. To the extent that data is available, the scope mainly focuses on mitigation-oriented climate finance.

However, the methodology relies upon information from financial sector activities, which is generally hard to obtain in the developing and middle-income countries where CCFFs have been undertaken. Thus, including private capital flows in CCFFs has been limited to illustrative work, that looks at: a) details of private sector investment including in national accounts; and b) evidence on leveraging ratios (i.e. the extent to which public expenditure of different types leads to private expenditure). Indonesia. The Indonesia Green Planning and Budgeting (GPB) Strategy considered the extent to which different types of fiscal policy could \u2018leverage\u2019 private expenditure on related climate actions (MoF 2014). It explored how to close climate financing gaps by adopting a phased strategy of moving from direct expenditure to transfers and, ultimately, to regulations. Building on comparative international research in the Green Investment Report and by IFC and WRI, it assumed that direct public expenditure had leverage ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e., 1 unit of public expenditure triggered less than 1 unit of private expenditure). Policies involving public transfers (e.g. tax incentives and subsidies) had ratios of 2 to 4 and engaging the financial sector in policies (e.g. loanable funds, interest rate subsidies and loan guarantees) increased the ratio to between 3 and 5. Relying on regulations could lead to much higher ratios of around 10. Bangladesh. The Climate Fiscal Framework (2014) sketched out options to drive investment in low-carbon infrastructure. These included introducing a carbon tax, modifying electricity tariffs, and removing fossil-fuel subsidies. It also reviewed mechanisms and models for crowding-in private investment through the development of new green banking operations at Bangladesh Bank. Cambodia. Cambodia\u2019s CCFF reviewed the potential leveraging effects of a range of policies, including those linked promoting CDM and REDD+ investment. It also briefly assessed potential private sector interest in solar power and industrial energy efficiency investment. China. China\u2019s Green Finance Initiative, promoted at the 2016 G20 summit is a joint venture between the state and the People\u2019s Bank of China. It focuses on establishing both regulatory policies and fiscal guidelines such as subsidies and state guarantees to green the financial system and encourage greater private investment in climate-friendly projects. The initiative outlines a series of reforms expected to increase market opportunities for a range of green financial instruments, including climate bonds. Maharashtra. As part of related CCFF initiatives, the state government of Maharashtra identified 15 different models and typical areas for potential private sector engagement in climate action, including: innovative financial instruments; channelling Corporate Social Responsibility funds; making supply chains more resilient; corporate mitigation targets; and investment opportunities for mitigation and adaptation, including in information services. The analysis has not yet led to an integrated assessment of the potential financial implications. UK. The UK Carbon Plan contains no explicit public expenditure commitments as government expected the entire cost to be borne by the private sector. However, the U.K. government subsidized a Green Investment Bank, which has in turn provided concessional finance and catalysed several successful low-carbon market transformation activities to the point where it is now at the stage of being fully privatized.

Expenditure Tracking is the analysis of past expenditure and shows changes in the extent to which governments have prioritised climate change related work while providing a sense of whether climate related spending is increasing or decreasing. Why is this important in a CCFF context? Analysis of past expenditure patterns is highlights the status of programmes and how they are influencing the underlying trend. The analysis of past expenditure also provides the baseline for future scenarios (see section 3.1). Moving Forward In most countries, analysing past expenditure trends has been done as part of a CPEIR before moving on to CCFF work, although some countries (Afghanistan, India) have combined elements of the two. Most CCFF work to date has focused on public expenditure, but there is growing interest in extending the work to other areas, including negative expenditures and private climate finance (see section 2.3). The analysis of expenditure may rely on budget figures or on accounts figures, depending largely on which is most easily available and on the practical role of the budget in the PFM practices. The challenges with presenting expenditure trends are mostly associated with classification and coding, as described in the previous section. The coding of the budget might include a yes/no tag, a high-mid-low relevance category or a score. In practice, most countries will want to rely on only one system. If scoring systems are changed (e.g. when moving from a system based on objectives to one based on CCSA) then the data from the old system will need to be adjusted to use the new scores, to ensure that the trends are consistent. Once the tags and/or scores have been defined, it is a simple matter to apply these to budget and accounts data, and so to produce virtual budget tables of past expenditure trends and future budget allocations, to assess whether climate change related expenditure has been increasing and is continuing to increase. For example, in Nepal, annex 16 of the budget statement includes climate change expenditure assessments according to function and divided into high, mid and low climate change relevance. No trends are presented in this table and it is compiled once the budget has been agreed, rather than during negotiations. Points to Consider In addition to the virtual budget tables on climate related expenditure in the budget/ accounts, it may be useful to have specific tables that report on expenditure on actions defined in climate targets and strategies (e.g., NDCs). This might form part of the budget or be included in annual reports devoted to the progress of reaching those targets (see section 5.1). Most countries will want to pilot the approach by using spreadsheet analysis, applied to tables produced by the PFM system. Once they are confident in the coding system to be used, then it may be useful to consider including the code in the budget software. This should mean that virtual budget tables of climate change expenditure can be produced automatically, in real time, as the budget is being negotiated and discussed in parliament. Parliaments should play an important role in approving budgets and accounts. Although the parliamentary budget debate will often involve a simple approval of the budget, governments will often have to ensure, in advance, that they have the support of parliament, so discussions with key members and committees of parliament will usually happen in advance of the formal budget debate. These discussions should be informed by the presentation of climate change expenditure virtual budget tables showing parliament how the budget proposals will impact on climate change. Many countries now welcome wider public debate in the budget as part of wider validation of the political choices. This can be facilitated by \u2018people\u2019s budgets\u2019 presented in easily accessible formats (e.g. wide use of infographics) and language without jargon. These budgets should include reference to trends in climate expenditure. Roles and Responsibilities The MoF is responsible for deciding how to introduce coding into the budget process, including what programme of piloting is appropriate and whether to introduce a budget marker or code into the budget software. The MoF is also responsible for producing virtual budget tables of climate relevant expenditure, both during budget negotiations (ideally in real-time) and in public accounts. To encourage consideration of climate change in the preparation of budget submissions, Line Ministries should present climate expenditure trends as part of their submissions.

A Climate Financing Plan ensures climate change actions are planned with a realistic assessment of the likely level of available resources. They draw on scenarios of total financing (see section 3.1) and on the scale of the challenge faced by sectors and projects, as described in section 2.1. They may include direct expenditure and policies that incur negative expenditure (i.e. reduction in revenue). Why is this important in a CCFF context? Sustainable financing plans are critical to ensure CCFFs remain realistic and achievable. Climate change actions within Action Plans are often \u2018costed\u2019 through a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 process that considers the resources needed to implement the action at an ideal scale. Moving Forward Most national climate strategies aim to be comprehensive, listing all the most important actions. This bottom up costing approach is valuable because it requires LMs to analyse the relationship between the level of expenditure and the benefits generated. However, it typically results in total costs that are much higher than the resources that are likely to be available Most climate change actions can be undertaken at widely varying scales. This clearly applies to recurrent costs (e.g. extension, regulatory enforcement, health care, information and incentives) but it also applies to investments, including in infrastructure and institutions. For some actions, there may be critical thresholds that must first be reached to establish viability. Most actions, however, are viable at different scales. Line Ministries therefore require a system for deciding how to define costs so that available resources are prioritised in line with needs (see section 3.1). A CCFF can encompass tools and mechanisms to use evidence to guide the allocation of expenditure to sectors and for actions, as follows. \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd expected in each sector.

Points to Consider Phasing Expenditure In practice, reducing ideal costs to fit a realistic climate change financing plan is often best done by phasing ideal expenditure, so that the least urgent is deferred until the mid or longer term. MoPs could consider several issues in this work process: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd until the impact of climate change is more severe.

Hard expenditure is easier to analyse because the benefits should be clear and relate to protection of sustainable development from climate change risks. In contrast, the benefits from soft expenditure are indirect and often extend across a variety of programmes. Although there are challenges in assessing the benefits from soft programmes, there may still be some value in taking an overview of the balance between soft and hard expenditure. For example, it might be justifiable to accept that a relatively high share of total climate expenditure (e.g. 30% to 50%) is devoted to soft expenditure in the short term, while institutions and policies are being built, and then to aim to reduce this, as the policies and institutions reach maturity and more resources can be focused safely on actions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab480fe6-d372-495a-883e-9cb26f86a645": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab480fe6-d372-495a-883e-9cb26f86a645", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "170f6a267f5c7f5bb6342a12b652ec5a68cfc6db919df1194191a75badce97f8"}}, "hash": "170f6a267f5c7f5bb6342a12b652ec5a68cfc6db919df1194191a75badce97f8", "text": "that deliver direct benefits. Distinguishing between soft and hard actions can be helpful in matching different types of action to different sources of funds. For example, in some sectors bilateral partners may have a comparative advantage in soft actions. This CCFF component may draw upon complementary tools and approaches such as UNDP\u2019s I&FF work (see Box 4). These explore the implications of various alternative expenditure plans, taking into account other changes in the sector, such as trends in private investment and wider government policies. 29 28 MoP CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED, EVIDENCED BASED RESPONSE CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR AN INTEGRATED, EVIDENCED BASED RESPONSE MoP UNDP has developed a methodology for assessing Investment and Financial Flows (I&FF) to address climate change, building on earlier work by UNFCCC that used the same title (UNDP 2009). I&FF assessments are a tool for financial planning looking at potential sources of investment funding for specific climate actions that have been costed, as well as their potential timing and likely magnitude. With UNDP support, about 20 countries have used the I&FF work tool for both mitigation and adaptation finance covering a variety of sectors, including: energy, transport, forestry, agriculture, water, health, tourism, biodiversity and fisheries. The tool has mainly been applied to illustrate the possible scenarios for future expenditure on actions, compared with a baseline scenario that ignores climate change. The I&FF methodology aims to cover both government expenditure and private expenditure (including households and corporations) in a way that avoids double counting. The methodology distinguishes between expenditure that affects physical assets (i.e. investment), expenditure on services and incentives (i.e. financial flows) and expenditure on operation and maintenance. Scenarios of future expenditure were not determined explicitly by macro-level climate finance scenarios (as described in section 3.1). The NEEDS project, which assessed the climate needs of 11 countries, also has relevant methods.7 The identification of mitigation and adaptation measures relies on national planning documents, such as NAPAs, CCSAPs and National Communications to the UNFCCC. There is no method for scoring the degree of relevance. There are several options for describing the baseline scenario, including: a sectoral simulation model (which may be part of a national model), showing how the composition of the sector is expected to evolve; a sectoral plan, if one already exists; and historical projections of recent trends in the sector. It may be useful to triangulate between some or all of them. The climate change scenario is then based on the expected additional climate actions for mitigation and adaptation, based on the climate change action plans that exist. Once an initial climate change scenario has been determined, governments then revisit their climate change action plans and revise the priorities and expectations in the plans. There is no attempt to estimate quantitatively the benefits of climate actions and so there is also no estimate of the mitigation or adaptation gap. Climate Change Policy Bodies can provide guidance on how to justify the scale of expenditure by relating it to the level of avoided damage and losses. The guidance can include some principles for phasing expenditure. LMs can use CCSA to justify allocations and phasing strategies in their financing plans for priority actions, following guidelines provided by the CCPB and/or MoPs. This will to ensure that financial allocations are balanced, and do not favour some actions at the expense of more important ones. CCPBs should provide guidance on the ideal balance between hard and soft actions (including whether this is likely to change over the mid to long term and whether different sources of finance have a comparative advantage). LMs should implement the guidance when drawing up the financing allocations for specific climate policy targets and actions. Roles and Responsibilities The CCPB usually has limited authority to request LMs to reduce their bottom-up costings, but the CCFF approach provides a system that gives some objective orientation to help government prepare rational financing plans. The graph below compares the value of marcro-fiscal losses and of GHG emissions by sector with climate budget allocations in Chhattisgarh State of India. It looks at the original SAPCC costing and a proposed revised costing. The analysis suggests that climate expenditure is high for agriculture and roughly appropriate for forestry, water and urban development. In the initial costing of SAPCC actions, forestry was given a very high allocation and water a high share. Agriculture was roughly appropriate and health was underfunded. The proposed revision in SAPCC costing attempted to rebalance the expenditure in line with the value of macro-fiscal losses and GHG emissions.

CCFF Workflows for Budget Mainstreaming This section of the guidance note outlines how to adjust the budget process to ensure a climate change response is delivered systematically across government. Section 3.1 outlines how to develop financing scenarios to guide the prioritisation of climate related expenditures; Section 3.2 articulates how the budget circular and budget guidance can be used to integrate climate change into budget formulation; and Section 3.3 provides guidance as to how budget negotiations can be strengthened through assessment of the climate dimensions of budget submissions. The chapter is particularly relevant for MoFs, though it also refers to the roles of other institutions. 3.1 Financing Scenarios: constraints to financial allocations What are Financing Scenarios? Financing scenarios indicate the level of resources (both domestic and international) likely to be available for climate change responses. These allow financing plans to be realistic and achievable (see section 2.5). Why is this important in a CCFF context? Rational planning of the government response to climate change requires some indication of available resources. There is still much uncertainty about the future of climate finance, including both dedicated climate funds and development expenditure that contributes to adaptation and mitigation. This applies to both domestic and international sources of funding. International funding purely dedicated to climate change, such as the Adaptation Fund or Special Climate Change Fund, is quite limited. And even with a funding base topping $10 billion, the Green Climate Fund will split its commitments evenly between mitigation and adaption, and these funds will be disbursed over many years. It is therefore appropriate that MoPs in developing countries construct more detailed and realistic scenarios of their funding gap at national and sub-national levels. These assessments of future financing are not \u2018projections\u2019. Using scenarios makes it explicit that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fd933be-8d16-4009-a622-586bc1b03b8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fd933be-8d16-4009-a622-586bc1b03b8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a78b92bc9fe58bdc8c2ebf797fc4f67033638ddf460550336bb0a10fdbd89d7"}}, "hash": "9a78b92bc9fe58bdc8c2ebf797fc4f67033638ddf460550336bb0a10fdbd89d7", "text": "numbers are indicative and need constant revision and updating. Developing financing scenarios also makes it possible to start assessing the potential scale of climate action and impacts in reducing climate-related losses and damages to close these gaps (see section 5). Moving Forward Domestic ceilings should be guided by the existing revenue and expenditure projections of government, as contained in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) or equivalent. A \u2018realistic\u2019 scenario might typically assume that the share of domestic expenditure in the development and recurrent budget that contributes to adaptation and/or mitigation remains constant (i.e. that climate change retains the current level of priority in government policy). This would be supplemented by estimates of spending from new domestic funds that are dedicated to climate change, if these are financed from sources other than the recurrent and development budget (e.g. through or from foreign sources of finance). A higher scenario might then assume that the growth in domestic climate finance increases by 50% more than in the realistic scenario (e.g. that governments are aiming to increase the priority given to climate change). A more sophisticated basis for defining scenarios might consider the share of climate funding in discretionary expenditure (i.e. after accounting for legal obligations in spending on debt, pensions etc.), rather than total expenditure, because this determines the \u2018fiscal space\u2019 to pursue new policy priorities. CCFFs have been used to help governments refine a policy that specifies how much of the fiscal space will be used for adaptation and mitigation (Bihar and Chhattisgarh). In most countries, a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) is the basis for estimating budget ceilings over the next three years. An MTEF is usually done on a rolling basis, updated every year. It typically starts with revenue estimates based on: a) sectoral growth projections, which provide the tax base; b) any changes in tax rates; and c) improvement in tax collection. This provides the projections of overall revenue and is then combined with policies that determine how the overall revenue will be allocated amongst the various forms of non- discretionary expenditure (e.g. statutory obligations, interest) and discretionary expenditure (or \u2018fiscal space\u2019). CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING 35 34 Box 5 - Climate Change Implications for Macroeconomic Projections MoF MoP The impact of climate change on revenue may start small, but is cumulative. For example, for vulnerable developing countries, the impact of climate change on total GDP is likely to be about 0.1% in the next year and then rise by 0.1% each year. This means that, after three years, GDP will be 0.6% lower than if MTEF projections ignored climate change. Impacts will also be felt unevenly over sectors. Various analyses suggest that the relative burden of the economic impact of climate change falls heaviest on the agriculture, forestry, and health sectors, as opposed to energy, for example. This is a small difference but fiscal space is typically limited to 2% to 3% of GDP, so climate change has a significant impact. Analyses of the economic effect of climate change included in a CCFF can encourage MoFs to incorporate these into macroeconomic growth and fiscal projects in the medium term. The overall ceiling for climate expenditure needs to be allocated to each Line Ministry, so that they can use this guidance in budget submissions. Ideally, the projections of climate relevant development assistance (ODA) will be determined by consultation with international development partners, including on their expected total levels of ODA and on the extent to which the sectoral and programme focus will lead to a change in the climate change relevance of their portfolio. In rapid CCFFs, when there is insufficient time to consult with international partners, it may be sufficient to use international projections for ODA and to adjust for any expected change in the country share of ODA and the expected shift towards climate relevant programmes. For expected inflows of international climate funds, different scenarios could be constructed taking advantage of various independent projections at the global level. For example, an optimistic scenario might first assume that the global target under the Paris Agreement is reached (i.e. a total of $100bn by 2020). Then, a country\u2019s share of this could be estimated as a function of different factors, such as the ratio of its current share of ODA, foreign direct investment, and degree of climate vulnerability as a reflection of its degree of global prioritisation for support. Other independent reports and statistics on available and projected resources of international climate funds as well as their rates of execution could also be used.

Points to Consider In general, most MoFs will be concerned about financing scenarios that show a strong increase in climate expenditure. Their concerns may be partly addressed by focusing on actions that involve the \u2018climate change smartening\u2019 of existing expenditure. It may also be possible to identify policies that create savings (e.g. subsidy reforms) or additional revenue (e.g. taxes and fees) that offset additional expenditure. However, MoFs will focus on reserving any savings or revenue for climate change expenditure, as they will normally want to put these resources into the central pot, to be prioritised through the normal budget process. Given that funds each have different eligibility and allocation criteria it would be wiser for countries to adopt conservative, rather than optimistic, scenarios in their planning. According to WRI, public international climate funds are accessed for most countries through multilateral development banks (MDBs) and UN agencies. Statistics on co-financing rates from previously approved projects of these funds, the average amount of new project approval by fund, as well as average time for accreditation of intermediaries or national implementing agencies can also be used as input to scenarios of likely future climate funding. As a rule, policy makers generally find it difficult to absorb more than two scenarios. So it is normally best to limit the analysis to a \u2018realistic\u2019 and an \u2018optimistic\u2019 scenario. The realistic scenario is the one considered most likely and the optimistic one provides the basis for allowing Line Ministries to plan to be more aspirational in their objectives. The climate finance scenarios should not be confused with the scenarios for climate change itself, such as those defined in the IPCC climate change projections. Roles and Responsibilities In order to ensure that macroeconomic planning takes climate change into account, MoPs could adjust growth projections and calculations of investment needs as part of national economic plans. Similar work could also happen at the LM level to value climate change impacts in each critically affected sector. On this basis, the MOF could generate guidance on climate budget ceilings for each sector, taking into account estimates of the total resources available as well as available evidence on the diverse sectoral and beneficiary incidence of climate change impacts. It can also undertake performance-budget reviews and other measures to ensure that Line Ministries budget and execute financial allocations to agreed climate actions in a consistent manner. To inform that process, the Climate Change Policy Body can support these actors by providing more coherent and robust analysis of the economic impact of climate change for different geographies, demographic groups, and sectors. This information can support in determining a more equitable allocation of total available climate finance. To further broaden awareness and improve the quality of the analysis, CSOs with experience in climate change and economics should be consulted. A CCFF needs some estimate of the likely future access to international climate finance and the Ministry of Finance should be responsible for providing this estimate, in consultation with the Climate Change Policy Body and international funders. 37 36 CCPB MoF MoP LM\u2019s AA\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING Moving Forward To help boost attention to climate change, MOFs could include a fixed paragraph or section on climate change in their key budget guidance documents. This approach has been adopted as part of CCFFs in both Nepal and Pakistan. Once fully mainstreamed into budgeting processes, a separate thematic section could eventually be omitted. Suggested target levels or ceilings for each ministry with respect to climate spending could also be indicated. Guidance documents on how to classify and weight climate expenditure and on how to undertake climate screening and investment appraisals would need to be cross-referenced in these documents. Points to Consider As budget circulars typically change only marginally from year to year\u2014except during periods of major reforms\u2014the forms embedded in the guidance documents could be revised over time to include more and more climate budget information as awareness and institutional capacity matures. For example, some countries have added a field for classification and/or scoring the degree of climate change relevance of each organisational budget unit or programme, along with some brief notes on the basis for the assessment. MOFs must carefully consider how negative expenditure is treated in the Budget Circular. Climate actions may be proposed and managed by Line Ministries that could lead toward negative revenue performance at a central level, yet not reflected in respective Line Ministry budget allocations or budget performance metrics.

It may seek advice of the CCPB on what to include in this section, so that it refers to the scale of the challenge and the approach taken by government in addressing the challenge, including the way in which CCSAPs are being managed. Legislators and CSOs might also be consulted in the process of integrating climate change into budget guidance documents to build public ownership and accountability. To help Line Ministries take climate change into account when preparing budget submissions, MoF could set expenditure ceilings or suggest a target for each sector based on desirable levels of climate spending. The MoP could propose guidelines and adjust planning templates for LMs and support capacity on how this box is to be filled in. Together with the CCPB it could work with MoF to revise budget submission forms to reflect the results and evidence of Climate Change Screening and Appraisal, typically undertaken at sector level. Climate actions that will impact on fiscal revenue (e.g. regulations and tax incentives) will require close policy collaboration between the relevant LM and the MoF in the budget formulation process. The table below presents the first of two climate finance scenarios prepared for the Cambodia CCFF. Global funds were estimated on the basis of projected global totals and Cambodia\u2019s share of ODA flows. Dedicated in-country funds were based on an assumed growth rate, after consulting with key donors. For integrated funds, the estimates were based on assumed growth rates. Figure 6 - Examples Climate Financing Scenario from the Cambodia CCFF Source: Cambodia CCFF 3.2 Adjusting Budget Guidance to Include Climate Change What are key budget guidance documents? Annual budget cycles typically start with a policy directive in the form of a Budget Strategy Paper. This lays out the broad principles for the upcoming budget, including current political priorities and the latest updates on development policies. A Budget Circular further outlines detailed instructions to guide line ministries on how to prepare their budget to align to these. The Budget Circular, prepared either separately or in conjunction with the Budget Strategy Paper, typically provides guidance on sectoral expenditure ceilings. It will also provide Line Ministries with the forms to use in submitting their budget proposals. Why is this important in a CCFF context? Since facilitating the integration of climate change into plans and budgets is at the heart of the CCFF, it is critical that these budget guidance documents consider how to reflect climate change and climate finance as a core macro-fiscal issue. A CCFF process requires that MOFs and other budget institutions understand the importance of more evidence-based appraisal of climate change expenditure (see section 4.1) and are accountable for the sound management of state resources through the budget negotiation process (see section 2). 39 38 CCPB MoF MoP LM\u2019s AA\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING 3.3 Budget Negotiation and Approval: respecting climate change benefits What is Budget Negotiation and Approval? Budget negotiations start with submissions by Line Ministries, following the instructions in the budget circular (see section 2). This is usually followed by a first round of discussions to ensure that the instructions have been properly followed and to pick up on any problematic submissions. When all submissions meet the required standards, there is a negotiation over which budget proposals are to be approved. Why is this important in a CCFF context? Budget negotiations and decisions should be informed by evidence on resource flows that will best promote climate compatible sustainable development. CCFF tools and related processes can build capacity and the evidence base for such decisions to be informed by climate change risks, costs and benefits. Moving Forward The first round of discussions following LM budget submissions should include an assessment of the quality of the way that LMs have filled in the section in the forms that deal with climate change issues, including any proposed tagging and/or scoring (see section 2.2). Negotiations should be informed by virtual budget tables that show the sectoral and total climate change expenditure that would be undertaken, if the budget proposals were accepted. These tables should inform the overall budget negotiations. A CCFF can apply tools and approaches informed by other thematic approaches to virtual budgeting (see Box 6 below).

MoF should ensure that any tagging or coding submitted by Line Ministries, and approved by the Climate Change Policy Body, is reflected in the way budgets are entered in the budget software or are included in additional spreadsheet analysis (see section 2.2) During the first phase of the budget negotiation process, MoF can require Line Ministries to explain why their total climate change expenditure is above or below the ceiling/target provided in the budget circular. If the explanation for any deviation is not sufficiently clear, then Line Ministries will be required to strengthen or revise their submissions. There is a long tradition of gender budgeting, which is based on assessing whether the benefits to women are higher than average. Gender budgeting seeks to provide policy makers with evidence on whether the policy choices they are making within the budget are narrowing the gender welfare gap. The experience with gender budgeting also extends to accountability actors (i.e. audit, legislature, civil society and media), including both a change in systems to welcome their participation and providing information and capacity amongst those accountability actors to take that role. During the 1990s, international efforts to make macroeconomic policy more poverty sensitive led to the requirement for all countries with IMF programmes to have Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). However, there was increasing concern that these strategies were too general and not rooted sufficiently in evidence. As a result, PRSPs were often supplemented by Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) that adopted methods of beneficiary incidence analysis to estimate the extent to which key policies benefited poor households. PSIAs were then used to guide the refinement of PRSP programmes. Using similar methods to a CPEIR, UNICEF is promoting countries to undertake child-focused expenditure reviews, covering both expenditure patterns and institutional processes. The approach includes developing budget markers, scores and \u201cvirtual budget tables\u201d in the information systems, in real-time. The reviews adopt weights based on beneficiary incidence analyses. These tools aim to facilitate budget negotiation and allocations processes. BIOFIN, a global partnership coordinated by UNDP is addressing the biodiversity finance gap in a similar, comprehensive manner. Like CCFFs, it supports countries to review institutional responsibilities and recent expenditure related to biodiversity. The classification and scoring scheme it applies relates mainly to the share of total programme expenditure devoted to biodiversity and thus most closely matches the objectives- approach. BIOFIN also considers the potential costs of implementing biodiversity action plans and possible financing sources. 41 40 Box 6 - CCFF work and other virtual budget initiatives CCPB MoF LM\u2019s AA\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR BUDGET MAINSTREAMING Once the MoF is satisfied that the budget proposals meet the standards and guidelines described in the budget circular, the budget proposals are then submitted to the cabinet for final negotiations and approval by government.

CCFF Workflows to Mobilize Funds This section provides more in-depth guidance on how climate change can be integrated into budget formulation. Section 4.1 outlines how tools for screening and appraisal of investments can include climate change; Section 4.2 provides guidance on how to raise the profile of climate change in budget submissions; and Section 4.3 provides guidance on how proposals for funding from external sources of international climate finance can be strengthened. The section provides an overview of how, by following these measures, Line Ministries will have improved access to both budget funds and new sources of climate finance. The chapter is primarily designed for Line Ministries, but should be of interest to other institutions. 4.1 Climate Change Screening and Appraisal (CCSA): justifying climate expenditure What is Climate Change Screening and Appraisal? At the heart of all planning and budgeting is the appraisal of actions and programmes. Climate Change Screening and Appraisal (CCSA) consists of a series of steps to first filter investment options by their level or degree of risk to climate change and or the sensitivity of their bankability to the impacts of climate change. It then uses standard risk and economic evaluation tools to ensure that incremental risks, costs, and benefits associated with climate change are included in the appraisal for the most relevant projects or investments. This ensures that resources for more complex and detailed studies are directed to those cases where climate change is a \u201cmaterial\u201d factor from the vantage point of either the beneficiary or the investor (e.g, the Treasury, State Development Bank). The primary role of CCSA is to ensure that those responsible for designing and managing actions take account of climate change in their work, so that expenditure is as effective as possible, and that equity and pro-poor targeting considerations are taken into account at the design phase of an investment programme. Why is this Important in a CCFF context?

This will typically be determined by: a) the level of expenditure involved in the service or investment; and b) the extent to which the benefits of the action are affected by climate change, especially where critical thresholds may be reached.

An example of maladaptation would be expanding low-income housing developments in lowland coastal areas prone to storm surges or at risk of destruction from land erosion. Mainly this has been due to lack of time, given that tracking adaptation and mitigation spending is already a complex task and some aspects of maladaptation and mal-mitigation are difficult to estimate. Moreover, as institutional capacities need to be built over time to carry out this work, and it is politically more sensitive, these classifications have typically been omitted. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd in the appraisal of development actions.

There has been increasing interest in CCFF work in the \u2018hybrid\u2019 grey area between multi-criteria analysis and cost benefit analysis which recognises that detailed cost benefit analysis is not practical but that multi-criteria analysis is problematic unless it is carefully structured.

Roles and Responsibilities In most planning systems, Line Ministries are responsible for undertaking appraisals. CSOs may also play an important role, either in undertaking independent appraisal or in providing advice to Line Ministries as part of stakeholder consultation and expert opinion. MoF provides guidance and quality control on routine development appraisal. For climate-related appraisal, the central economic ministries need support from the CCPB in the form of guidance on how to integrate climate change into the appraisal and check the quality of how this guidance has been applied. 47 46 CCPB MoF LM\u2019s AA\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS CCSA work as an adjunct to climate planning and budgeting has been undertaken throughout Asia and with specific CCFF-relevancy in Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Thailand.

It is common practice to use carbon markets as an indication of the value of carbon because these reflect the potential financial gains from GHG reduction. Until recently, carbon markets were dominated by the European Trading System (ETS), which initially traded at over $30/tCO2e. However, the ETS has suffered from over-supply and verification problems and prices have dropped to about $5 /tCO2e. The ETS now accounts for only about a third of global carbon trading and there are numerous regional and national schemes, with a very wide variety of prices, covering about 13% of total global GHG emissions (ECOFYS and World Bank 2014). The commitments announced in COP21 in Paris, in 2015, should help to strengthen markets. Taking this more optimistic view of the mid-term prospects for the carbon market, a market price of about $20/tCOe would be reasonable. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is determined by dividing the total expected loss and damage by the total projected GHG emissions. It gives an approximate indication of the indirect economic cost of global GHG emissions. Various studies have attempted to estimate this figure. The Stern Report suggests that $50/ tCO2e would be a conservative estimate. Other studies suggest a value over $100.

Rarely are nationally or regional-appropriate figures estimated, due to political sensitivities involved as well as limited data on damages and losses at this level. Countries acutely vulnerable to climate change may well justify using a higher SCC when undertaking CCSA and in driving budget allocations toward priority mitigation programmes. 4.2 Budget Submissions: raising the profile of climate change in the budget What are Budget Submissions? Budget submissions are a key tool in effective expenditure allocation. A budget process typically begins with a macroeconomic review including taxation and revenue estimates by PFM entities. Based on these economic and fiscal projections, the national budget and permissible public spending is estimated. Ministries then prepare a framework document or sectoral approach paper and in some cases a first version of their budget bids in parallel with the preparation of revenue estimates. These budget submissions are the way in which Line Ministries influence budget negotiations. Why are these important in a CCFF context? Pre-budget climate change planning sessions can be used as part of the CCFF process to screen policies, programmes, sub-programmes, and investment activities for climate risk and to generally integrate climate change adaptation and proofing measures into their design. Moving Forward The budget submission forms for each organisational budget unit will include a box for declaring the climate change relevance of the budget. This may involve a simple yes/no tag, a high-mid-low relevance classification of a CC% score, using the principles of CCSA and applying the degree of detail appropriate for the nature and scale of the action (see section 2). Line Ministry budget submissions should also include tables adding up the total proposed expenditure for the Line Ministry, including all organisational budget heads. These tables should include a supplementary virtual budget table showing the total climate expenditure, using the coding and scoring in the budget software. This virtual budget table should show trends over the last 3 years, as well as the proposed budget, and the proposals should be guided by the ceilings/targets proposed by MoF. CCSA and climate change coding/scoring can typically provide the evidence required to make a rough quantitative estimate of the expected impact of expenditure in reducing or avoiding future costs. The analysis will be illustrative only and provide a broad indication of which expenditure makes the largest contribution. In this way, CCSA can promote more informed decision-making by taking into account how climate change affects activities and sectors differently. It also supports the identification of the conditions that need to be met for the expected impact of response measures to be sustained into the mid and long term. Points to Consider In practice, many actions are included in the budget after several years of debate and preparation. CCSA needs to be integrated into the whole of this design phase, rather than bolted on at the end. In the first years of climate sensitive budgeting, Line Ministries will therefore have limited experience with CCSA and the evidence in the climate change box in the budget", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0136544a-0452-47bf-95f8-dc0f6bea7b71": {"__data__": {"id_": "0136544a-0452-47bf-95f8-dc0f6bea7b71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9864d66d47f3de6f6e12f6747daa3d21e339ec61ea87022f42f55fc64ed91769"}}, "hash": "9864d66d47f3de6f6e12f6747daa3d21e339ec61ea87022f42f55fc64ed91769", "text": "submission forms will be of mixed quality. Budget submission forms should request information on the plans for raising funds from other sources. This needs to be guided both by general principles about the comparative advantage of different sources and by some indication from the overall CCFF of how much funding is likely to be available from each source, so that LMs have realistic expectations of their sectoral share of the scenarios of total funds available (see section. 3.1) There is also increasing interest in the possible role of co-financing by the private sector, through public private partnerships (PPPs). Roles and Responsibilities As part of their budget submission, Line Ministries will need to fill in this box, based on the guidelines provided by Climate Change Policy Body and the latest evidence on the importance of climate change for the budget unit. If a budget coding system is in operation, Line Ministries should also enter the contents of this box into the coding space in the budget software, to make sure this is up-to-date. In order to demonstrate their growing commitment to responding to climate change, Line Ministry budget submissions should present virtual budget tables totalling the climate expenditure in each of their departments, divisions and other organisational budget heads. Budget submissions provide an opportunity for Line Ministries to present an estimate of how they expect climate change expenditure under their management to contribute to reducing macro-fiscal losses. To maintain credibility in the climate change planning and budgeting system, the Climate Change Policy Body should provide quality control for Line Ministry submissions and provide an estimate of total impact across all Line Ministries. CSOs can play a useful role in reviewing the analysis. In particular, they may comment on the extent to which the conditions for impact are likely to be sustained, especially if or when they involve institutional reform. As part of their review of budget integrity, the MoF can check whether the claims in Line Ministry budget submissions for expected financing are consistent with the financing scenarios in the CCFF. In many countries, policies that aim to influence the private sector involve bodies outside MoF, which may be another ministry (e.g. in charge of investment) and/or an agency dealing with private investment. Where Line Ministries are justifying policies and expenditure by claims of leveraging potential private sector co-financing, they need to have consulted closely with the private sector and with the government bodies responsible for coordination with private investment. 51 50 CCPB MoF LM\u2019s AA\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS 4.3 Increasing Access to International Climate Finance What is International Climate Finance? While the public budget remains the primary source of climate finance in many countries, some countries, particularly least developed countries and small island developing states, still rely heavily on international sources of climate finance. In these countries, international climate funds are an important source of finance. These include: the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF), Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), Climate Investment Funds (CIFs), Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), and various other multilateral and bilateral climate adaptation and mitigation focused funds and facilities such as NAMA Facility. Information on the scope and criteria of these funds can be found in the resources section. Why is this important in a CCFF context? A CCFF aims to more strategically inform the mobilization, management, and targeting of all forms of climate finance in an integrated manner. This includes an examination of the potential sources and uses for both international and domestic sources of funding, as well as their areas of comparative advantage. Parties to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which became international law in November 2016 committed to mobilizing at least US$100 billion of new and additional climate finance per year by 2020. International climate funds have their own unique rules, practices, guidelines, and selection criteria. Applications commonly have at least one section that demands an assessment of how the proposed expenditure will contribute both to climate adaptation/mitigation and to development. In theory, the guidelines usually request some estimate of the scale of the contribution. In practice, most applications provide this information in a qualitative form and without cross-reference to any national system for assessing the benefits of the expenditure. Much of the information required involves justifying the economic rationale for the action by quantifying the climate and social co-benefits of an activity or investment against the status quo. Other sections require explaining how programme and project outputs will be monitored, reported and/or independently verified which also relate to aspects", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ce707e6-c1ea-43d8-8903-ae2948029bee": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ce707e6-c1ea-43d8-8903-ae2948029bee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c08663ed5e2c5c2eb40a85b6a3c397136d8029f2c13b202bf78e7d84aa8bbd51"}}, "hash": "c08663ed5e2c5c2eb40a85b6a3c397136d8029f2c13b202bf78e7d84aa8bbd51", "text": "of a CCFF. The need to institutionally embed climate change into PFM systems is also accentuated by the increased international climate funding available. To be able to attract more international funding, governments should be able to demonstrate the transparency and effectiveness of their own country systems\u2014including those for budget accountability and macro-fiscal policy management. In developing and implementing CCFF workflows throughout the public and economic management system, greater levels of fiduciary trust and confidence can be built vis- \u00e0-vis international actors including vertical climate funds and transnational CSOs. Moving Forward: As part of the CCFF objective to mobilize climate finance more strategically, CCFF-related workflows can contribute to Readiness Plans by developing new methods for determining the relative scale of the contribution of different programmes which can be used to inform the prioritisation of funding for international climate finance. Checklists and systems of quality control for funding applications could also be developed to strengthen the evidence-base for more prioritised funding. Points to Consider Some CCFFs include a section that explicitly identifies the comparative advantage of various funding sources, including international climate finance actors and national climate funds. This is an important strategic step to help governments minimise duplication and ensure that the role and expected scale of operations of each source of funds is clear. Data generated by climate expenditure reports could be used to help build a case for, and to establish financial baselines for measuring government\u2019s financial commitment to proposed policies and measures, for which international funding support is requested. This is also a means by which to establish the credibility of government\u2019s own commitment and contribution to climate actions, including Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). 4.4 Accessing Climate Finance through National Funds What are national climate funds? National climate funds aim to facilitate the collection, blending, coordination, and accounting of climate finance toward projects and programmes that support the transition toward a zero-carbon economy and/or increase climate resilience. Dedicated funds come in many shapes and sizes; while a common set of services is delivered by most of them, exact financing structures and the components to deliver these vary greatly. Why is this relevant to CCFFs? Many countries in Asia-Pacific have already established national climate change funds with regular public funding or concessional finance. CCFFs can provide a more rational basis for the targeting of national climate fund investment, ensuring that they understand the most effective options for reducing macro-fiscal losses and GHG emission and that the scale of funding matches the level of vulnerability and potential macro-fiscal losses and/or potential contribution to mitigation. It can support prioritisation and more robust applications for smarter investment made by national funds that links to targeted vulnerable groups. Many countries have one or more national climate funds, which may be funded from the budget, from cesses and other forms of dedicated revenue and/or from international sources. These funds may be operated as competitive grants and loans for new projects, as sources of top-up funding to existing funds or as virtual funds that do not manage expenditure directly but help provide an overview of expenditure trends (see Box 9). CCFFs can also catalyse thinking around the most efficient capitalization of national funds and their sustainability. It could also encourage the development of criteria and M&E indicators by which domestic financial actors and funding resources can best leverage international climate finance through flagship programmes and partnerships. 53 52 CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS Indonesia established the Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund in 2010, with funding mainly from donors and management by UNDP. Funding has been for institutional readiness and the moratorium on forest concessions, with some pilot mitigation activities. Bangladesh has two climate change funds: the climate change Trust Fund (BCCTF) and the climate change Resilience Fund (BCCRF). The Ministry of Environment and Forests provides Secretariat services for both funds. The BCCTF is funded entirely by government whilst the BCCRF is funded by donors. Both funds have been through some challenging periods. The Cambodia Climate Change Alliance (CCCA) is a donor trust fund providing project finance with management support from UNDP, under the Ministry of Environment, acting as secretariat to the Cambodia Climate Change Council. The Philippines created a People\u2019s Survival Fund (PSF) in 2012, located in the Department of Finance, with wider participation. The PSF is funded from the budget and funds climate change actions at local level. Disbursement has been slow, mainly because of limited local capacity.

The fund covers mitigation and adaptation, including both studies and investments. Projects are implemented by a development banking institutions. Rwanda established the National Fund for Environment and Climate Change which started in 2013, with funding from government and DFID. The Fund is a challenge programme, inviting proposals from government, NGOs and the private sector. Vietnam and Pakistan both have also been planning to establish a climate fund. Mexico\u2019s new Climate Change General Law refers to the possibility of establishing a Climate Change Fund, but the details of how this will be done have not yet been established. The ASEAN Ministers of Economy and Finance have discussed the possibility of creating a climate fund for the region. There are also several national funds that address specific sectors of climate change, notably associated with forestry (e.g. in Brazil and Guyana) or energy (e.g. in China and Thailand). In addition, there are a range of donor trust funds that have been developed with government cooperation (e.g. in Ecuador and the Maldives). Pakistan and Tanzania are also now considering a national climate financing mechanism that could work as a virtual fund. Points to Consider There are three key ways in which a CCFF can ensure that national climate funds are successful: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIntegrating Financing Strategies. A CCFF can help ensure that national climate funds are not used to create parallel funding mechanisms that compete with development funding. Actions critical to broad general development are optimally funded in the development budget. Climate funds can be channelled using top-up funding to cover any additional or incremental climate benefits of routine development projects. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdConsistent Appraisal. Most national climate funds approve projects using criteria that include both direct climate benefits and development co-benefits. CCSA techniques can provide a more objective basis for assessing the relative importance of these. This can enhance the targeting of climate funds to actions and beneficiaries (see section 4.1). \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdFinancing Scenarios. Realistic levels of potential support that existing or future national climate funds could provide to priority targets and actions should be incorporated in national climate finance scenarios, so that its relative importance is clear (see section 3.1). It can also take its pipeline into account vis-\u00e0-vis other flows including private climate capital. A key to bridging the adaptation finance gap is to incentivize the private sector to invest the business case for investing in mitigation (for example through renewable energy systems or improved energy efficiency) is often more obvious, donor organizations and governments alike can help incentivize private sector investment through (a) ensuring that actionable information on potential climate impacts is accurate, reliable and widely available, (b) promoting systems and mechanisms that reduce risks for private investors (such as risk insurance schemes and other market-based instruments) and (c) leveraging large-scale private investment through public investments in de-risking policies, programmes and mechanisms. Roles and Responsibilities National climate funds are typically managed with some degree of independence, but also with some supervision, both financial and technical. Technical expertise is coordinated by the CCPB, but may include some specialist sectoral expertise. The MoF will be involved in supervising the financial management of national climate funds, to ensure that standards of accountability and transparency are maintained. Both institutions will be involved in supervising the quality of CCSA work. LMs are often involved in the design (including CCSA) and the management and monitoring of actions funded by national climate funds. 55 54 Box 9 \u2013 National Level Climate Funds CCPB MoF LM\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS Key Sources for Chapter 4 Screening and Appraisal.

CCFF Workflows for Monitoring and Evaluation This chapter considers how a CCFF adds value to existing frameworks for monitoring climate change actions. It does not consider the monitoring of the CCFF programme of work itself, which is dealt with in section 6. The monitoring work will normally be coordinated by the Climate Change Policy Body, but with much of the information generated by Line Ministries. 5.1 Regular Monitoring: indicators to assess expected impact What are Indicators used to Assess Expected Impact? Most countries have included targets for GHG emissions in their NDCs, under the Paris Agreement. Many have also included adaptation contributions, usually in the form of their latest commitments to climate change actions. The NDCs are now one of the most powerful policy drivers and monitoring of the CCFF needs to be fully integrated with of NDCs. Why is this important in a CCFF context? A CCFF will normally culminate in a \u201cwhole of government\u201d strategic financing plan, which could be an annex to, or fully integrated into an MTEF. This would consider whether and the degree to which mitigation and adaptation financing gaps are effectively being closed. It can be also partly based on predictions for how effective planned climate actions would be reducing GHG emissions and macro-fiscal losses. Having robust indicators to monitor changes in the evidence base that determines these results are crucial for this CCFF workflow. For example, the adequacy and effectiveness of existing climate budget expenditure is one such key performance indicator. CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR MONITORING AND EVALUATION 57 56 CCPB LM\u2019s CCFF WORKFLOWS TO MOBILIZE FUNDS Moving Forward To consolidate monitoring, it is useful for AAs to push for strong political commitment for regular monitoring reports and clear institutional responsibility for producing them. Most CCFFs call for annual progress reports, produced shortly before the budget cycle to help draw attention to climate change in the budget. Ideally, these annual reports will also be used in conjunction with the measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) on NDCs which are typically compiled by CCPBs. These will include monitoring of expenditure (see section 2.4) and of expected impact, including the following activities: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdA CCFF may improve the understanding of or interpretation of the impacts of annual climate events. Projections of climate change itself rely on evidence from historical trends as well as climate models. For shorter to mid-term projections (i.e. one or two decades), historical trends are at least as informative as models, and the most important contribution of models is for the longer term, when they can pick up possible discontinuities and switching points (e.g. in ocean currents). Historical trends are also the source of evidence most easily understood by the general public and policymakers. It is therefore valuable to monitor annual climate change and show how this affects historical trends (e.g. a hot year will marginally increase a historical upward trend and a cool year will marginally reduce it). \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd (e.g. forest cover, industrial output and applying standard emissions factors.

In fulfilling this responsibility, the Climate Change Policy Body needs to ensure that the monitoring happens in a well-planned manner, covering all the key variables and locations in the country. The Climate Change Policy Body also needs to ensure that funding is available to Line Ministries and CSOs to make the evidence available in a form that is accessible to officials and the wider public, both at national and local levels. As described in section 2.4, MoF generally takes lead responsibility for monitoring expenditure. The government audit institutions also have a role in validating the evidence and some wider public involvement in that monitoring may be possible if budget processes allow for public engagement during negotiations. Monitoring and interpreting recent climate data and trends will normally be undertaken by specialist government agencies or CSOs involved in climate research. It may involve some scientific monitoring and could also include participatory research. Climate Change Policy Bodies may have a role in ensuring that evidence on individual climate events is interpreted in the context of historical trends. The monitoring of indicators that determine expected impact will be coordinated by the Climate Change Policy Body and will include the inventory of GHG emissions and the reporting on adaptation expenditure and expected impact. This evidence will be used both for national reporting and for submissions to the UNFCCC as the measurement, reporting and verification on NDCs. The nature of NDC reporting on adaptation is still being determined. It is likely to include some form of reporting on the physical progress of climate change actions. The UNFCCC is unlikely to require reporting on effectiveness. The reporting on indicators affecting the sustainability of impact will benefit from consultation with CSOs in the sector and from review and support from the parliament. Countries may also report separately on the level of international support received and the evidence on the effectiveness of the actions. The evidence for this will normally come from MoF, using budget coding/scoring systems, when these are available. Figure 10 - Examples of CCFF Conclusions on the Adaptation Gap Source: CCFF work in South Asia 5.2 Evaluation: more in-depth analysis on key issues around impact What is in-depth Analysis and Evaluation? Evaluation provides an opportunity for learning lessons and improving the evidence base that can be used to improve the effectiveness of a response. Why is this important in a CCFF context? The overall objective of a CCFF is to help governments manage their response to climate change and their ability to protect the country\u2019s sustainable development from the risks of macro-fiscal losses from climate change. At present, the evidence base for this is still weak, especially in developing countries. A CCFF should provide the framework within which to assess priorities for evaluation work and to assess the results. Moving Forward The impact of public expenditure on GHG emissions is conceptually straightforward but requires evidence on key variables, like emission factors and marginal abatement costs (MACs). The available evidence on these variables should be regularly updated by occasional evaluation, focusing on the areas where the evidence is considered most important and weakest.

In most countries, the evidence on how these indicators can be used to infer expected impact requires research and evaluation is very weak. As such, a sustained effort in ex-post and ex-anti evaluation and research is required to build evidence. This evaluation work raises awareness of the severity of the challenge and the potential solutions and leads to revisions in CCSAPs, to take account of the latest evidence. Roles and Responsibilities The Climate Change Policy Body can take the lead in requesting and facilitating evaluation work, ensuring that available resources are allocated to the issues that are most important. The work on evaluating the impact on equity is usually done by CSOs, including research institutes or consulting firms. This ensures independence and government bodies are less able to do the work because it involves occasional activities that are difficult to accommodate within the busy schedules of government institutions. CSOs can also play an important role in providing a knowledge management platform and the parliament and media may also play an important role in disseminating the results of evaluation work. Line Ministries are usually responsible for contracting evaluation work and the Climate Change Policy Body can play a useful role in supporting applications for funding and ensuring that the results of evaluations feed back into strategy revision. 61 60 CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR MONITORING AND EVALUATION CCFF WORKFLOWS FOR MONITORING AND EVALUATION CCPB MoF LM\u2019s AA\u2019s CCPB LM\u2019s AA\u2019s Key Sources for Chapter 5 Monitoring Climate Change.

Coordinating a CCFF Programme of Work This chapter describes how to coordinate various CCFF components and workflows. It aims to demonstrate that, while there are some common elements to CCFF work, each country will choose a different path to reflect its priorities and practices. 6.1 Managing a Programme of CCFF Work Most CCFF related work has been led and managed by the institutions that are already responsible for coordinating climate change strategies. As the body responsible for coordinating climate policy, the Climate Change Policy Body normally provides oversight to the CCFF process. Most Climate Change Policy Bodies are supported by a secretariat, which is usually either a dedicated climate change unit or is the Line Ministry responsible for climate change, which is often the Line Ministry responsible for environment (e.g. Cambodia, Thailand). In some countries, the MoF has taken the lead responsibility, working either largely on its own (e.g. Indonesia) or with other bodies (e.g., Nepal, Afghanistan). In other countries, a Line Ministry has been appointed to take the lead, without a Climate Change Policy Body (e.g. India). Other stakeholders can add weight to their climate financing and budget oversight by engaging the Parliament and the media, building more public awareness and political will. Approaches and Sequencing There have been three broad approaches to managing CCFF workflows to date: A. The more comprehensive CCFF overview covers all components and involves reasonable levels of consultation and some capacity building, both within government and outside. This approach typically takes at least 9 months, as described in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ad1b335-e90b-4cba-91b9-6e410bb4059d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ad1b335-e90b-4cba-91b9-6e410bb4059d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hard Choices Integrated Approaches", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/hard-choices-integrated-approaches", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b1c9fe901453031eac6b79cd844af424d0dfac53a876a741ff46c2f55246106"}}, "hash": "3b1c9fe901453031eac6b79cd844af424d0dfac53a876a741ff46c2f55246106", "text": "Figure 10. This is the approach taken in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Indonesia. Annex A provides an outline for a ToR for this approach. B. An overview can also be done more quickly, with less consultation, as an illustrative exercise to build awareness and help plan a more substantial programme of activity. This is the approach taken in most Indian States and in Afghanistan. COORDINATING A CCFF PROGRAMME OF WORK 63 62 AA\u2019s COORDINATING A CCFF PROGRAMME OF WORK RELATED CCPB MoF LM\u2019s AA\u2019s C. Some governments have started with a focus on one or two components, without an overview. Usually, this has happened because the institution that is leading on climate change does not yet have wide engagement from other government institutions. For example, in both Thailand and Maharashtra, the focus of the early work has been on improving appraisal, to help justify climate change actions. Similarly, the CCFFs in Assam and Bihar gave more emphasis on rationalising budget allocations to climate actions, using simpler appraisal options. Many countries have combined the three approaches, starting with an overview, then moving on to more detailed work that would encompass a stronger overall framework as well as more detailed sector analyses with pilot Line Ministries. The most appropriate sequencing will often depend on the status of work on CCSAPs and specific ways that CCFFs can to improve financing plans for them. Every country will follow a different sequence of activities, starting first on those that are most important and least well developed and gradually bringing all activities to the same level of completion. The diagram below gives one example of a ten-year programme of bringing all components to \u2018formalisation\u2019. Figure 11 - Example Sequencing of CCFF Activities Technical Resources In all cases, the early phases of CCFF work have involved a significant additional burden and so have been contracted out by government. While most of the work has been done by consulting firms, some research institutes have been involved, but they have mostly been operating as consulting firms, responding to a terms of reference agreed by the government. Additional financing has usually been provided by international institutions. The consulting teams have generally involved a group of national experts, plus one or two international experts. Some wider consultation has taken place, but most of the consultation has been within government. Maintaining Momentum Initial CCFF related analyses, coupled with a clear advocacy strategy, often play an important awareness raising role, explaining the scale of the challenge, the breadth of the effort already taking place and giving some indication of the nature of the response. Experience suggests that this does not automatically lead to strong commitment in Line Ministries or in MoF. It needs to be followed up by several further phases of work, to build confidence that the response is credible. It can be useful for the Climate Change Policy Body to plan a medium term commitment to several phases of CCFF work and to have realistic expectations of how quickly Line Ministries and MoF will become committed. The more that senior political leadership of the country (i.e. leaders, cabinet, parliament) provides support for the CCFF process, the more robust and effective the resulting outcomes will be. Policy oversight mechanisms could be linked to the implementation of international commitments, such as the INDCs/NDCs. The Philippines provides a good example of strong political leadership (see Box 10). The MoF in Indonesia has also played a very active and formative role, over a sustained period. In Nepal, strong support from the MoF has been important, although there is also good interest and initiative across government. In Bangladesh, there has also been sustained political leadership, but this is spread fairly evenly across all government institutions, without the requirement for a leading institution. Cambodia has also benefited from strong and sustained leadership from the National Council for Climate Change, supported by its secretariat, which has led to the widening of interest from other bodies. Political leadership in the Philippines is provided by a strong Climate Change Commission (CCC), created by a Climate Change Act (2009), chaired by the President and supported by a National Panel of Technical Experts, and Advisory Board (including representation from local government, civil society and the private sector) and a Secretariat (the Climate Change Office). The budget process is relatively transparent, compared to other countries in the region, according to the Open Budget Index. There are various hubs and portals that enable CSO engagement and the budget is subject to public hearings. There are Climate Change Committees in both houses of parliament.

CCFF work requires collaboration across many government bodies and benefits greatly from an inter-ministerial coordinating body that is dedicated to climate change (i.e. a Climate Change Policy Body). Most CCPBs are supported by a Secretariat, usually the ministry in charge of environment. 2. Progress with elaborating a CCFF is greatly facilitated if supported by the ministries responsible for planning, economic development and finance. Engagement with and support from Parliament and the Cabinet in driving the process can also be a strong mechanism for political buy-in and accountability. However, in some countries these central institutions have been sceptical of climate change and have participated only as observers, at least initially. If a Climate Change Policy Body does not exist and the central bodies are cautious about being engaged, then early leadership may fall to the ministry in charge of environment. 3. Selected Line Ministries (e.g. agriculture, water, forestry, energy, health, housing, urban planning) would ideally be consulted by the coordinating institution to ensure that they were comfortable with the nature and level of their engagement in the CCFF work programme. Typically, this would include the formation of LM working groups and participation in the Climate Change Policy Body. 5. CCFF work normally requires some external expertise to supplement the expertise in government. This includes expertise in climate science and economics, in public finance and in planning, including methods of appraisal and prioritisation. The level of expertise required varies depending on the CCFF process and scope but it is likely to benefit from some international expertise as the approach is still relatively new. The external expertise should work jointly with officials. 6. CCFF work aims to integrate the strategic management of new funding and of existing expenditure within the budget and wider development assistance. In countries that are heavily dependent on international partners, the main interest may be on raising new funds and providing a sound basis for applications to funds. However, even in these countries, CCFF coordination should ensure that new funding is complementary to existing development work, since the largest contributions to mitigation and adaptation usually come from existing development actions. Despite the complexity of the CCFF process, policymakers can take comfort in the fact that there is a growing cohort of countries that have embarked upon or are refining a CCFF from which to draw practical lessons. Annex A Action Points to Consider: Advise all government actors and Accountability Actors on how Climate Change Strategies and Action Plans (CCSAPs) will be resourced and what to include in key budget documents. Ensure the quality of risk, vulnerability and loss and damage assessments (Section 2.1). Define a standard national approach to the classification of climate finance, working in collaboration with Planning and Investment Ministries. Give guidelines and technical support to all relevant actors to apply a coherent approach (section 2.2). Estimate total impact of climate spending across all Line Ministries and Investment Agencies, and provide further guidance to them on ways to justify programmes for public funding in relation to CCSAP priorities and avoiding/mitigating future economic impacts (Section 2.5 & Section 4.2). Provide guidance on balance between \u2018hard\u2019 and soft\u2019 actions within financing plans. (Section 2.5). Support other actors by providing analysis of the economic impact of climate change and building a library of evidence. Support knowledge management systems to ensure information is widely available (Section 2.1 & 3.1). Provide quality control to Line Ministries submissions for climate change related programmes (including proposals for classification and coding) as part of budget preparation and negotiation cycles. Suggest further work if necessary (Section 3.3 & 4.2). Coordinate monitoring of indicators related to impact of climate spending and financing. This could include cost effectiveness of mitigation strategies and reporting on how well existing adaptation expenditure reduces economic losses and damages in different time scales. This may require providing funding or expertise to Line Ministries and NGOs to generate evidence for monitoring and oversight purposes (Section 5.1). Coordinate technical expertise on increasing access to climate finance as part of routine budget and programme monitoring. Support applications for funding and ensure results of evaluations feed back into strategy revisions (Section 4.3 & 5.2).

It assumes that the country has an existing Climate Change Action Plan, but with imperfect costing of actions. In practice, countries are likely to emphasise some components over others. Introduction Description of the development situation and the vulnerability of the country to climate change along with any existing work on climate change strategies and action plans. Objectives The wider objectives of the CCFF work is to reduce macro-fiscal losses for people and ecosystems either directly (through adaptation) or indirectly (through mitigation). The immediate objectives are: a) better understanding of the full range of climate change related expenditure; b) better understanding of how climate change affects the performance on public expenditure; c) optimizing resource allocation; and d) changes to planning and budgeting processes. Activities and Outputs The work will be divided into 4 phases. Inception Phase. Some preparatory desk analysis, covering: a) evidence on vulnerability and potential climate change impact; and b) evidence on existing financing. Finalising the work programme and the scope of the CCFF report, in consultation with government. Phase 1: Initial Scenarios and Consultation.

ANNEX B 73 The above work will be compiled into an Interim Report and a workshop should then be held to discuss the initial \u2018policy neutral\u2019 allocations. Line Ministries will be invited to refine the allocations to actions within their responsibility, adjusting the levels and/or the phasing of the actions. Phase 2: Refinement and Draft Report. The input from Line Ministries will be incorporated into a Draft Report that reflects the priorities and phasing. It will also include refined estimates of potential impact of spending in reducing macro-fiscal losses and/or GHG emissions. It will also include a chapter proposing next steps for institutional management of financing for CCFF implementation. The Draft Report will be discussed by all relevant government bodies. This may include some refinement of the allocations between Line Ministries to reflect the latest policy priorities. Phase 3: Final Report. A Draft Final Report will be produced that reflects the input from the central ministries and this will be checked with these institutions. When the Government is happy with the Draft Final Report, it will be presented for validation at a final workshop including Line Ministries. The content of the final reports will be refined during Inception, but may include the following chapters. 1. Background and methodology 2. Vulnerability to climate change and expected loss/damage 3.

The support provided has focused primarily on cross cutting elements of the 2030 Agenda, such as disaster risk management (DRM), which do not neatly fit under the remit of a single government ministry. To support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)1, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub, in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of Canada provided financial support, through Global Affairs Canada, to the ADB-managed Integrated Disaster Risk Management Fund.

Credit: UNDP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Responsibility for managing disaster risks is cross-sectoral; and the benefit of disaster resilience impact a wide-range of ministries and agencies. While many ministries and agencies play a role, the DRM-PEIRs undertaken in Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam, found that in practice, and in terms of expenditure, only about six to eight ministries and agencies in each country are responsible for the majority of DRM-related public expenditure through national budgets3. However, as disasters impact all sectors of an economy, strong, clearly defined and well-coordinated policy and planning should be required for all relevant agencies. The three countries reviewed demonstrated extensive and cross-cutting institutional structures and processes for DRM. Weaknesses in these structures were observed in relation to the following factors: \u2022\ufffd Multiple\ufffdagencies\ufffdwith\ufffdoverlapping\ufffd responsibilities, interests and agendas may be involved in aspects of DRM, most notably at the relief and subsequent stages of recovery and reconstruction. However, responsibilities for disaster risk reduction and preparedness interventions in advance of a disaster striking, are often not well planned, responsibilities are not clearly defined or practiced in advance, and this can lead to a less than optimum response for those most affected. \u2022\ufffd Legislation,\ufffdmandates,\ufffdregulations,\ufffdstandard\ufffd\ufffd operating procedures and responsibilities are not always clearly defined and kept up-to-date as institutions evolve and disasters as institutions evolve and disasters continue to manifest due to poorly planned development interventions. There is a need to improve detailed planning measures for DRM and address the duplication of responsibilities, uncertainty and gaps. \u2022\ufffd Institutional\ufffdstructures\ufffdfor\ufffdthe\ufffdmanagement\ufffd\ufffd of DRM often exist on paper but may not be established in practice, especially at provincial and lower administrative levels. This could be the result of insufficient financial or capacity resources: it is often a combination of the two. \u2022\ufffd There\ufffdis\ufffdpoor\ufffdcoordination\ufffdand\ufffdcooperation\ufffd between, and sometimes within responsible ministries and agencies. \u2022\ufffd Financial\ufffdmanagement\ufffdsystems\ufffdand\ufffd financial regulations could be strengthened to improve timely access to resources in post-disaster situations, especially for the transferal of resources from central to provincial administrations. Consequently, DRM is not fully mainstreamed or prominent in sector priorities. Planning and implementation for DRM policies, investments and responses be improved.

As the expenditure analysis indicates, DRM-related expenditure is often embedded as a minor component in other investment projects, and cannot therefore be explicitly identified. The allocation of expenditure between pre- and post-disaster activities is also complicated by the fact that DRM-related expenditure on disaster risk reduction and preparedness is often embedded as a component in larger interventions.

Classification of expenditure on DRM therefore relies on consultations with budget-owners, project managers and general local knowledge. It is recognised that there is likely to be some subjectivity in allocating classifications and it is intended to reach a consensus with project or budget line owners on the classifications wherever possible. The level of budget line detail available for analysis varied considerably between the three countries. In Thailand, budget lines contained considerable detail, enabling a more systematic assessment of DRM-relevance. In Vietnam, the budget information available for analysis was pre-screened for relevance to climate change adaptation (as an input into the Vietnam CPEIR). In Lao PDR, the descriptive detail available in the budget line to assist the analysis of DRM-relevance was very limited. Much more reliance was therefore placed on consultations with project managers in Lao PDR than in the other two countries. Identifying monitoring and tracking tools for DRM-related expenditure 8 Aggregate Expenditure for DRM The DRM analysis of available budget data in the three countries evealed the below findings: DRM-relevant expenditure by ministry In order to assist in overcoming these constrains to classification and analysis it is recommended to introduce a \u201cbudget tagging\u201d system into: 1) National budgeting and financial management information systems; and 2) National budget and public investment planning cycle. DRM-relevant expenditure relative to GDP Over the four-year periods that4 budget data was analysed; A) in Lao PDR, total DRM-relevant expenditure for both government and provincial budgets was estimated at 1.9 percent of GDP. This included 1.7 percent for central government expenditure and 0.2 percent for provincial expenditure. B) In Thailand, provincial budget data was not included in the detailed analysis. At the central level, government expenditure relevant to DRM was estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP5. C) In Vietnam, where only limited \u201cclimate adaptation\u201d data was available6 for DRM analysis, the proportion of DRM-relevant expenditure was estimated to at 0.2 percent of GDP7. DRM-relevant expenditure relative to total government budgets In Lao PDR, it is estimated that DRM-related expenditure accounted for an average of 5.6 percent of total combined ministry and provincial budgets over the four years. This comprised an estimated 7.1 percent of total ministry expenditure and 2.1 percent of provincial expenditure. In Thailand, the comparable central government expenditure was estimated at 4.6 percent of total budget expenditure. In Vietnam, estimated DRM-relevant expenditure in relation to the central government budget was estimated at 8.9 percent. For the three provinces analysed in Vietnam, DRM-relevant expenditure was estimated at 22.3 percent of the combined total expenditure. 4 FY2010/11-2013/14 5 FY2011-2014 6 The data covered five ministries and one province from the CPEIR 7 FY2010-2015 Disaggregating expenditure by ministry indicated that in all three countries only a few ministries manage the DRM-relevant expenditure. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and Ministry of Transport and Construction in the two countries respectively accounted for around half of all DRM-relevant expenditure. In Thailand, the Ministry of Interior contributed the largest DRM-relevant expenditure at 17 percent. Over the analysis period, Thailand\u2019s DRM-relevant expenditure was dominated by the Central Fund, which provides support in post-disaster situations. Severe flooding during the review period resulted in significant expenditure on relief and recovery to this flood event. The ministries of agriculture were also a primary source of DRM-relevant expenditure in all three countries. In Vietnam this ministry ranked the highest at 39.4 percent of all DRM-relevant expenditure; in Lao PDR the agriculture ministry recorded 18.4 percent of total DRM expenditure and in Thailand 10.1 percent of total DRM expenditure. Aggregate Expenditure for DRM DRM-relevant expenditure by ministry 9 DRM expenditure by budget line type The analysis indicates that most DRM-relevant expenditure was allocated to budget lines focusing on disaster risk reduction and preparedness, primarily through capital invest- ment expenditure. Projects and investments of this type (A4)8 accounted for 87.6 percent of all estimated DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR, 43.1 percent in Thailand and just over two-thirds in Vietnam. There were no budget lines or projects specifically focused on DRM policy and institutional development in Lao PDR and only 0.3 percent of DRM-related expenditure was recorded for these activities in Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2734c371-95f9-42cd-8f25-e3480b591e25": {"__data__": {"id_": "2734c371-95f9-42cd-8f25-e3480b591e25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b02d1fdeec4c78abb5d370acdb6e50430d9b152e617d6f2898de365075661163"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a96017d-4525-462d-8223-d0abf912acc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a0336304691fba999a20c8e3ee23edf2da51f44b215301c759d49602812c278"}}, "hash": "06d66543ef4fb728d75b48f3ad7ea5329bb5aababab17d3741851015b3304beb", "text": "In Vietnam, DRM investment focus was recorded at 6.6 percent of the expenditure.

The high expenditure in Thailand was a response to severe flooding in 2011. A lack of specific investment focused on awareness, capacity building and research may indicate low priority of DRM in policy, planning and budget cycles. DRM Expenditure by Functional End-Use The final level of analysis assessed the functional end-use of the DRM-relevant expenditure. In Lao PDR, it was estimated that approximately three-quarters of DRM-relevant expenditure was focused on physical infrastructure investment (functional type A4), two-thirds in Vietnam and less than half in Thailand. Additionally, Thailand allocated 8.2 percent of DRM-relevant expenditure to disaster relief (functional category B1) and 27.3 percent to recovery and reconstruction. DRM-relevant expenditure by type and function DRM-relevant expenditure by type and function The ministries of natural resources and environment contributed 2.4 and 3.1 percent of total DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR and Thailand. In Vietnam, this ministry contributed 10.1 percent to the total DRM-relevant expenditure. Within the ministries of agriculture it was estimated that 28.3 percent of the ministry budget in Vietnam was relevant to DRM. In Lao PDR and Thailand, the DRM-relevant share of the agriculture ministry budgets was estimated at with 20.1 percent and 14.8 percent respectively. The ministries of natural resources and the environment record the next highest proportion of DRM-relevance in their budgets. In Lao PDR and Thailand, 12.1 percent and 12.2 percent of their budgets were relevant to DRM. In Vietnam, the proportion was 26.5 percent. The ministries responsible for public works and construction had the third highest levels of DRM- relevance within their own budgets. In Lao PDR, ministries related to transport and construction recorded 16.4 percent of the combined budgets as having DRM-relevance, with Thailand and Vietnam recording 6.2 percent and 6.8 percent relevance to DRM in their respective ministry budgets. 10 8 Figure 1: Classification by Type and function of DRM-relevant expenditure, page 25 9 Figure 1: Classification by Type and function of DRM-relevant expenditure, page 25 In Lao PDR and Vietnam, allocation to functional categories of expenditure was 11.3 percent and 7.7 percent respectively. Although no budget lines or investment projects focused specifically on policy and institutional development for DRM, it was estimated that 2.5 percent of DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR, 0.3 percent in Thailand and 6.7 percent in Vietnam, contributed to building policy and institutional capacities. These activities would have been embedded in other larger projects. The other two categories of pre-disaster functional type (A2 & A3)10 accounted for an estimated 8.3 percent of DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR, 1.1 percent in Thailand and 19.0 percent in Vietnam. Summary findings and recommendations for DRM-relevant expenditure Summary findings and recommendations for DRM-relevant expenditure DRM-PEIR found that expenditure in support of DRM appears to be low in Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam in relation to GDP. Expenditure on DRM-relevant activities is concentrated few government ministries and agencies with similar areas of responsibility across each of the three countries. These ministries include those responsible for agriculture, irrigation, natural resources, environment and construction. None of the three countries has a specific DRM ministry, and the agencies that have nominal responsibility for disaster policy and management have limited authority or financial resources. The ministries that host the DRM policy mandate therefore need easier access to funds for significant DRM interventions. DRM-relevant expenditure is principally comprised of small, embedded components within other projects, investments, or recurrent budget lines. These are concentrated in physical infrastructure investments. DRM components and impacts need to be more clearly defined. It is recommended to build capacity on the role of DRM in the project cycle and performance- based budgeting in ministries of finance and in sector ministries and agencies. This will assist in improving cross-sectoral linkages and benefits of disaster resilience investments, helping minimise unforeseen post-disaster costs. Sector ministries could strengthen their performance-based budget submissions, ensuring that DRM measures are fully incorporated and clearly identified in all new policies, activities and projects. It is also recommended to revise project planning cycles and appraisal processes to ensure that DRM is considered in the performance budget process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a00869dc-46a1-4753-8b3f-77cf55722ae3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a00869dc-46a1-4753-8b3f-77cf55722ae3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d083306f43299d4fa960a63290c9ecd7f3cbe3c1df35cec2e67d03a183f6e38a"}, "2": {"node_id": "367ef952-b67e-40b2-bdd6-59b2358d4ca1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ded3183c1eadc4bbe40981370a73a0d5a49152c8107d3e3a1f531622c8e0f55"}}, "hash": "fe37255ec7249dba4e8813a7457113f0ab9c28e2b94ae39d3ee0e23d1278a9bb", "text": "For example, each budget submission or capital investment proposal should include an outcome/output matrix indicating the contribution of the Credit: Istock.com/Gargolas 11 10 Figure 1: Classification by Type and function of DRM-relevant expenditure, page 25 1.

Ministries of finance could then rank priorities for allocating budget resources. Recognising that there are significant overlaps between DRM interventions and climate change adaptation measures, it is recommended to integrate DRM and climate change expenditure reviews where DRM-PEIR and/or CPEIR have not previously been undertaken. DRM-relevant expenditure on activities including DRM policy, community awareness, capacity building, early warning and research is limited. With a rise in the frequency and intensity of natural hazards arising from climate change, and the increasing vulnerability of the rural poor, it is recommended to prioritise investment in DRM. All sector ministries and agencies should be made aware of the cross-cutting role of DRM, and the importance of incorporating and mainstreaming DRM components into all investments to ensure resilience and sustainability. Recognising that rural poor are most vulnerable to natural hazards, it is recommended that disaster risk reduction and preparedness, including awareness raising, early warning systems and capacity building for disaster response, as well as community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM), should be mainstreamed at the provincial level. Additionally, it is recommended that the funding needs of CBDRM should be separately identified in DRM budget tagging and/or monitoring system. It is recommended to establish specific \u201cdisaster/emergency\u201d funds at all levels of government with legislative authority and the ability to access the funds at the appropriate times, meeting the needs of the vulnerable efficiently, transparently, and with accountability. As capacities for disaster risk financing evolve, it is recommended to institute disaster insurance cover for damage and losses caused by natural hazards to public infrastructure and other assets, business, crops, and homes. UNDP is working with target governments in Asia and the Pacific to consider the implications for national and sub-national planning and budgeting processes of the recently agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2030. This support focuses on cross-cutting elements of the 2030 Agenda, which do not neatly fall under the remit of any one government ministry. For example, budget reforms aiming to mainstream climate change and biodiversity considerations within public investments across different sector ministries. In support of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)11, UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub, in partnership with the Asian Development Bank, and UNDP Country Offices in the region, are supporting Disaster Risk Management Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (DRM-PEIR). These reviews draw on UNDP\u2019s work on Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews (CPEIR), which have been undertaken in more than thirty countries globally, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Samoa, Thailand, Vietnam and in the Asian-Pacific region. The DRM-PEIRs provide recommenda- tions for further budget reforms supporting mainstreaming DRM into national policy, planning and budget systems. These efforts 1. Context 12 are expected to lead to a greater awareness and prioritisation of DRM across the public investment portfolios of participating countries. It is expected that such developments will also contribute to the implementation of Agenda 2030, and in particular, to the achievement of the SDGs relating to sustainability, resilience and climate change, as well as providing strong support to poverty reduction. The DRM-PEIR undertaken in Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam assessed the institutional basis for disaster risk management at the national and provincial level through an analysis of institutional structures, strategic policies and action plans for DRM. The reviews also provide an assessment of the levels, types, functions and objectives of public expenditure on related activities. The DRM-PEIR covers natural hazards including floods and landslides, tropical cyclones and storms, forest or grass-fires, droughts, hazards from unseasonal or extreme cold weather, earthquakes and building collapse and tsunamis as well as human epidemics, smog, insect infestations and animal diseases12. Many of these natural hazards overlap with climate change risks. In Vietnam, this is demonstrated by the fact that the data analysed for the DRM-PEIR was drawn from the \u201cclimate adaptation\u201d component of the CPEIR. 2.1. Introduction Building on country-level CPEIR studies in climate finance, the three DRM-PEIRs have adapted and refined a methodology for classification of, accounting for, and tracking of recurrent expenditure and capital investment for DRM. The reviews also include assessments of the institutional framework/ institutional structures for DRM-related activities within each government.

DRM-PEIRs DRM-PEIRs have added an additional level of analysis to include assessments of the project- type and functional-nature of DRM-related expenditure with specific reference to the four Sendai priorities.

Institutional framework and expenditure priorities for DRM Global commitments to disaster risk reduction are encapsulated in the four priorities for action in the Sendai Framework for DRR which was endorsed in early 2015. DRR and DRM-related policies and expenditure should therefore aim to achieve one of these four priorities (see Box 1). Building resilience and sustainability are central to the achievement of the SDGs and Agenda 2030. The poor are disproportionately impacted by disasters and climate change and therefore mainstreaming DRM, together with climate change, must be central to successfully realising poverty reduction strategies. Many poverty reduction interventions will be targeted at improving livelihoods and public services to the poor. To achieve their fullest impact, these interventions need to include measures to build resilience against external shocks and the impacts of natural hazards. Expenditure on DRM can therefore contribute significantly to ensuring that poverty reduction achievements are sustainable. Within the SDGs and Agenda 2030, the poverty reduction goal (Goal 1) is the primary outcome to be achieved. Through building resilience in livelihoods, DRM contributes to this goal. DRM also contributes to interventions primarily aimed at ensuring the sustainable management of water, infrastructure and cities, terrestrial and marine eco-systems and resilience to the impacts of climate change13. These interventions require DRM to be mainstreamed if they are to be realised effectively. Incorporating DRM interventions explicitly into policies, planning and budgets can therefore assist governments to better understand, monitor and evaluate the importance of DRM in national socio-economic development. 13 Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts 14 2. DRM-PEIRs BOX 1 SENDAI FRAMEWORK FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION Priority 1: Understanding disaster risk: Policies and practices for disaster risk management should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics and the environment. Such knowledge can be leveraged for pre-disaster risk assessment, for prevention and mitigation and for the development and implementation of appropriate preparedness and effective response to disasters. Priority 2: Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk: Disaster risk governance at the national, regional and global levels is of great importance for an effective and efficient management of disaster risk. Clear vision, plans, competence, guidance and coordination within and across sectors, as well as participation of relevant stakeholders, are needed. Strengthening disaster risk governance for prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery and rehabilitation is therefore necessary and fosters collaboration and partnership across mechanisms and institutions for the implementation of instruments relevant to disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. Priority 3: Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience: Public and private investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction through structural and non-structural measures are essential to enhance the economic, social, health and cultural resilience of persons, communities, countries and their assets, as well as the environment. These can be drivers of innovation, growth and job creation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d2540cc-f992-4ae7-9ab3-4531ddcf3bce": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d2540cc-f992-4ae7-9ab3-4531ddcf3bce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "defb63c18ac4359df6f73d71bb7a48d7c9c9b5a3c9287e381e4cb8e2b85d846c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0335a63-c8cd-44a6-bf8e-5b46298e89a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5a691bd086a46f76dc10b76065d61b6c9db547ff21dd76b060f89b0e862a92d"}}, "hash": "4d04f1c6d0fb730e27338a341ab58cfffdeffcf5a95f34e11d8e171c34bde2f8", "text": "These can be drivers of innovation, growth and job creation.

Data Entry Points for the DRM Expenditure Analysis The DRM-PEIR process extends the approach used in the global CPEIRs to address DRM activities and to examine the links between: \u2022\ufffd Institutional\ufffdstructures\ufffddeveloping\ufffdand\ufffd\ufffd channelling DRM policy \u2022\ufffd National\ufffdDRM\ufffdpolicies,\ufffdstrategies\ufffd and investment \u2022\ufffd Resource\ufffdallocation\ufffdwhere\ufffdpublic\ufffdfunding\ufffd\ufffd (both national and international) is made available for the implementation of DRM-relevant projects and programmes A challenge in the review of DRM-relevant recurrent expenditure and investment projects is that expenditure related to DRM is not clearly identified or linked to specific DRM objectives under the present planning and budgeting systems in any of the three countries. While many DRM-relevant projects might be categorised as climate change adaptation relevant investments (and vice versa), there are many other areas of recurrent and investment expenditure that implicitly contribute to DRM. Current budget processes should more clearly identify these projects or expenditure items to enable tracking of DRM spending. The DRM- PEIR methodology used in the three reviews helps establish a simple process for identifying and classifying DRM projects/expenditure as an integral step in the planning and budgeting cycle. Establishing an effective DRM monitoring and evaluation (M&E) reporting system will require strengthening project design procedures, appraisal processes and the full mainstreaming of DRM into project documentation. It will potentially have wider implications for budget formulation and expenditure tracking. Each of the three countries included in the DRM-PEIRs have separate data entry points as follows: Lao PDR: State Budget Revenue and Expenditure Implementation Reports for the Fiscal Years 2010-2011 through 2013-2014 are obtained from State Budget Department, Ministry of Finance. At the national level, 23 line ministries and agencies are responsible for implementing the National Budget. Data is also included in the State Budget Reports for the 17 provinces and the capital city14. The budget reports for each ministry and province follow the same chart- of-accounts (COA) and budget line coding systems. Each ministry/ provincial budget has over 200 identical budget lines of which 32, under four budget divisions, were identified as likely to include DRM-related expenditure. It is estimated that seven ministries accounted 92.6 percent of all DRM-related expenditure. More information and data are needed regarding the specific outputs expected from each budget line. As a result, the assumptions used in disaggregating and analysing the expenditure for DRM-relevance and function, relied on the experience gained from the Thailand and Vietnam analyses and on consultations with ministries and agencies responsible for the expenditure. 2.

A key institutional issue challenging governments is the coordination of all the involved agencies. It is recommended for governments to resolve or clarify overlapping mandates, which in some cases may be unavoidable, and to clearly set out responsibilities and chains- of-command related to decision-making and budget allocation processes. Strengthening coordination could support more effective implementation before, during, and post-natural hazards, providing more effective access to relief funds. Sufficient financial allocations made from the central government level would help support implementation. Lao PDR is working to improve coordination, but many of the decrees and regulations on DRM are in a draft form and define broad mandates and functions. These decrees and regulations could assign clearer responsibilities and specific mandates or standard operating procedures, to address coordination and management responsibility challenges. 3. Institutional Systems for DRM 3. Institutional Systems for DRM 15 Only Chang Rai Province was selected for analysis and thus only central government expenditure is discussed in detail. 16 Vietnam Climate Public Expenditure and Investment Review Report, June 30, 2014, Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Credit: Istock.com/undefined Credit: Istock.com/lovingyou2911 17 All three governments have established comprehensive DRM planning and policy frameworks, which could be updated to reflect the current circumstances and underlying institutional mandates and responsibilities. In some instances, there may be overlaps between responsibilities for DRM and for climate change effecting the implementation process. For example, recently, DRM was reassigned from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) back to the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MLSW); from where it was originally located. In Thailand, the government structure is compartmentalised, and high-level inter-agency cooperation and coordination should be improved to make management and coordination of DRM-activities more effective. Institutional weaknesses experienced during Thailand\u2019s floods in 2011 suggest that more attention should be given to building disaster resilience into investment projects, and that disaster-resilience components should be explicitly identified. 3.2. Recommendations for strengthening institutional processes for DRM These recommendations aim to improve the institutional framework for DRM and achieve mainstreaming, coordination and cooperation between ministries and agencies: \u2022\ufffd Governments\ufffdshould\ufffdundertake\ufffdreviews\ufffd and assessments of their respective institutional processes for DRM with the objective to strengthen coordination and communication between government entities that have been assigned responsibilities for activities related to disaster risk management; this would include those responsible for communicable disease control as well as other disasters, and other government departments as well as with civil society organisations and the international community. \u2022\ufffd Update\ufffdor\ufffddevelop\ufffdoverarching\ufffdlegal\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd instruments to enhance the coordination and effectiveness of the institutional framework for DRM. \u2022\ufffd Regularly\ufffdreview\ufffdlegislation,\ufffdregulations,\ufffd\ufffd policies, plans and related documents to ensure clear lines of responsibility, communication and resource allocation, at all levels. \u2022\ufffd Establish\ufffda\ufffdfull-time\ufffdand\ufffdhigh-level\ufffdDRM\ufffd\ufffd coordinator or focal point with a clear mandate, and with sufficient authority to: \u203a Lead and strengthen overall coordination, planning and management of DRM, including the establishment of a network of DRM-focal points across all stakeholders. \u203a Lead, guide and support work on main streaming for DRM across all government (central and local) and private sector agencies. \u203a Lead, guide and support advocacy on DRM risks across all levels and stakeholders, including public and private sector through innovative communication tools and the development of DRM-fo cused policy briefs on DRM-issues. \u203a Monitor DRM-related expenditure and provide analytical reports in support of the panning and budget process. \u203a Support the development of public-private partnership initiatives for DRM. \u203a Research national hazard risks, DRM needs, policies, strategies, financing options and gaps. 3. Institutional Systems for DRM 18 4. Financial Management for DRM 4.1. Summary of findings The three DRM-PEIRs found that identifying DRM-relevant expenditure was challenging, most especially in Lao PDR where budget line detail in the published budget expenditure documents was very limited. In Thailand, improvements to annual planning, budgeting and monitoring processes to better identify and implement priorities and policies for DRM (climate change and other sectoral areas) could be achieved through modifications to the various national financial management information systems. One way to achieve this would be through the introduction of budget tagging procedures for DRM-relevant expenditure tracking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "860a7339-cfe2-432f-84f4-0240a6f16433": {"__data__": {"id_": "860a7339-cfe2-432f-84f4-0240a6f16433", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8796b52a29cd96b9f6b0586f5180bc668868045321546786567e7afe2a835192"}, "2": {"node_id": "c173584b-9003-4e24-ab7f-f82b0bb732da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e277e2a95aedcbf0644452aa112b1b4c1edae8cc81ca44b1d4ed9f2e4ebc0e47"}}, "hash": "b311f93044eae1aebd923c327303ab06f014f0a23490f431e410d123fa447070", "text": "Budget tagging for specific policy areas, including gender, climate change and poverty has been introduced in some countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh.

A starting point for the introduction of budget tagging could be the development of an output/outcome-based planning and budgeting system. This would require that ministries/ agencies 1) Define their programmes and activities in relation to their objectives and outcomes, including DRM and other priority sectors, and 2) Establish verifiable expenditure and progress monitoring indicators, for example relevant DRM-related SDGs or nationally identified indicators in line with the global Sendai priorities. Incorporating a DRM-expenditure tagging system into the annual planning and budgeting procedures could facilitate improved identification and coordination of DRM priorities. In recent years following the fiscal challenges caused by the global economic and financial crisis, many governments introduced performance-based budgets in an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure, in terms of both the recurrent and capital budgets. However, the practicalities of implementation have often failed to deliver on the expectations of improved budget performance outcomes. Ministries of Finance is in need to build capacity on results-based management systems in a way that actively adjusted resource allocations according to performance. Results-based financial management can be difficult to operate effectively even within a single ministry or focused sector.

Financial Management for DRM 19 is their cross sectoral implications. Natural hazards and climate change effect all aspects of the socio- economy of a nation. These issues are a concern for every ministry, but no single ministry or agency has total responsibility for all DRM outcomes including disaster risk reduction, preparedness, relief, recovery and reconstruction. If DRM is to be fully mainstreamed into national planning and budget systems a cross-sectoral approach must be implemented. In India for example, DRM screening of government investments is required. The Ministry of Finance made it mandatory in 2009 for all project proposals in excess of Rs. 1 billion ($16 million) to include a disaster impact assessment. Related risk reduction measures are required to be included in the project costing17. An alternative, could be through the use of EIAs, as they are required by legislation and are standard components of policy analysis, budget and project planning cycles in most countries. Additionally, climate-proofing of investment expenditure is now becoming a common requirement in project design. Many governments require expenditure and investments to consider potential environmental impacts and incorporate climate-proofing. Separate legislation could consider amendments to existing EIA legislation to providing consideration of DRM within the scope of the EIA itself. There are two clear entry points: \u2022\ufffd Ministries\ufffdof\ufffdfinance\ufffdshould\ufffdstrengthen\ufffd their appraisal capacities so that their performance and results-based budget systems work effectively. \u2022\ufffd Secondly,\ufffdsector\ufffdministries\ufffdand\ufffdagencies\ufffd\ufffd should strengthen their policy, planning and budget-development systems to ensure that DRM (as well as climate change, environment and other similar cross-cutting issues) are mainstreamed into policies, plans and budgets. Providing greater detail on DRM in budget and investment submissions could help raise awareness to hazard risks and their implications on poverty. Drought, floods, cold weather and insect infestations in the three countries have demonstrated the direct links between the occurrence of natural hazards and increases in poverty. Greater attention to disaster resilience, coupled with effective relief and support for those affected can reduce the impacts of disasters on the lives and livelihoods or the poor. Mainstreaming DRM into the project and budget cycle can therefore also assist in poverty reduction strategies. 4.2. Recommendations for improved financial management for DRM The DRM-relevant expenditure analysis has identified that there are only limited budget allocations for specifically for DRM, most DRM-relevant expenditure is embedded into other infrastructure investments and activities. This is particularly the case for DRM-relevant expenditure in disaster risk reduction and preparedness. Often only expenditure for post-disaster relief, recovery, and reconstruction can be clearly identified as wholly relevant to DRM. In order to improve the ability to analyse DRM-relevant expenditure the DRM-PIER identified the following recommendations: \u2022\ufffd Introduce DRM budget-tagging to monitor DRM-expenditure more effectively 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8911456c-6e15-4609-8fc6-9429c3f7cecf": {"__data__": {"id_": "8911456c-6e15-4609-8fc6-9429c3f7cecf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ecd27e344c75a0ab103654eddb3270723b3ff4d5da888df9fdb0c96b767d1a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3185a02-9dde-4991-8006-12007d30fe7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bd6e9d6ee4d5e4da32b617068ce7125d27d5a56c6b46da111e0066bc95bdc32"}}, "hash": "f97baf9589d65d2e1dd70a901ceb226b387117394beee44fa489119f7dde30ec", "text": "Financial Management for DRM 17 Dhar Chakrabarti, Prabodh G; Understanding Existing Methodologies for Allocating and Tracking DRR Resources in India; UNISDR in collaboration with ADPC under the IAP project Regional Stocktaking and Mapping of Disaster Risk Reduction Interventions for Asia and the Pacific, January 2012. 20 \u2022\ufffd Introduce and include a cross-cutting issue matrix in all budget and project submissions to indicate, in broad-terms, the relevance of the expenditure to the selected cross-cutting issues. \u2022\ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6910e5b8-b90d-47c1-81fa-ceb919cf95e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6910e5b8-b90d-47c1-81fa-ceb919cf95e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d9c830a6f9fdb9ad9f3d8c196eaed47392e05a081de4755b8d06372f59856ca"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f7eff34-5ead-41c9-b504-ef90c0ffc21a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1690236444a9add82268213a7095a930a95621efbff8ceb231b69f2dab95f661"}}, "hash": "bff27ad26a82e3c8b250ba1b538a5356ab78502a70634d18ae10d06fef78a071", "text": "Clearly state criteria and processes governing access to immediate post-disaster needs for easy implementation. \u2022\ufffd Develop DRM focused activities including preparedness, awareness raising, early warning systems and capacity building for DRM response.

In Vietnam, central government and local administrations are required to allocate between 2 percent to 5 percent of total annual expenditure into a contingency fund which can be used for a range of unforeseen events, including natural hazards. In other countries, these allocations are not always consistent from year-to-year and specific resource targets, either in terms of annual allocations, or minimum/maximum balances, for the funds are not always identified.

DRM-relevant expenditure in national & sub-national budgets 5.2. Relevance to DRM The expenditure analyses conducted in the DRM-PEIR follow a three-step methodology: The first step is to assess if the budget line available for analysis is relevant to DRM. In Lao PDR, 32 of approximately 200 budget lines would be included in the analysis. In Vietnam, CPEIR filtered this stage in respect of climate change adaptation. In Thailand, a more systemic approach was taken using a \u201cmultiple key-word\u201d filter to identify those budget lines that would be included in the second step. A selection of the key words is included in Box 2. Once the primary filter identified budget lines to have DRM-relevance, they were examined to determine their level of DRM-relevance.

Thematic Expenditure Analysis: Methodology The decision on which classification to be applied to each discrete expenditure line was determined on a review of project documentation, consultations with implementing agencies, and with the local knowledge and research on how similar projects and programmes may have been classified in other DRM-PEIR, or in CPEIR where relevant. It is recognised that there is likely to be some subjectivity in allocating classifications and the objective has been to reach a consensus on the classifications wherever possible. A model for assessing the secondary level DRM-relevance classification is in Box 3. The third level of classification for DRM-relevance captures the type of investment, and its purpose or the functional nature of the expenditure in relation to DRM. The classifications are separated into six categories under two principal heads: disaster risk reduction (primarily pre-disaster expenditure) covering disaster risk reduction adn preparedness, and post-disaster relief, recovery and reconstruction. The six categories were identified to assist in reporting towards the priorities of the Sendai Framework (See Box 1). BOX 3 GUIDELINES FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF DRM-RELEVANT BUDGET EXPENDITURE Level of DRM Relevance DRM Relevance Index DRM Relevance Expenditure Weighting Relevance Criteria Complete/ Very High 5 100% Objective of the intervention is to: a) reduce disaster risk or strengthen preparedness; or b) meet expenditure for relief, recovery and reconstruction.

Classification of DRM expenditure by project or investment type and function Within these classifications the final step is to identify broad project types and the functional classification of expenditure. Disaggregation of expenditure by type and functional classification are intended to provide a basis for reporting on progress towards the four Sendai priorities described earlier. Using these criteria, DRM relevant expenditure is disaggregated in two ways: \u2022\ufffd Firstly, the primary purpose of the expenditure in the budget line focuses on policy (type A1), advocacy (A2) or research and early warning (A3); or it is a budget line that involves capital investment and infrastructure spending (A4). For post-disaster expenditure the classification is for immediate relief (B1) and for recovery and reconstruction, including build-back-better components (B2). \u2022\ufffd The second disaggregation takes each of the first categories of expenditure by type, and then applies weights to identify the \u201cfunctional classification\u201d of expenditure within each of the types. This is done by ranking each type of disaster-relevant project/programme or recurrent budget item according-to the matrix as in Figure 1: Classification by Type and Function of DRM-Relevant Expenditure. It is predicated that in most of the selected budget lines there would be components of policy, advocacy and research that could contribute to the overall design and implementation of DRM. These aspects may not always be clearly identifiable, even in detailed budget documentation, but are intuitively present at some stage. For example, every DRM-relevant investment or activity must have some basis in policy and a decision making process (Functional Classification: A1); almost every investment project will involve some element of advocacy, awareness and/or capacity building, if only for the beneficiaries of the project (A2); almost every DRM-relevant project will also involve some consideration of disaster risk research and assessment, contributing to project design (A3); and the main capital investment will be clear (A4). For post-disaster expenditure classification B1 expenditure is deemed to be completely for immediate relief. In Classification B2, expenditure is disaggregated across the functional classifications in a similar manner as for the pre-disaster categories.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c386c918-b9de-40c5-94f1-a0912a59537b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c386c918-b9de-40c5-94f1-a0912a59537b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "DRM CPEIR for Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f78bd34e9666c6a089415db948cdbec0832f426e7f60560e914d921f438abd91"}, "2": {"node_id": "16c81ef8-26be-4203-9e79-78eccaf50486", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/drm-cpeir-lao-pdr-thailand-viet-nam", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d67a872486527273de664b47d85cb63b13d32b2620860a6ee5f2b628df26672a"}}, "hash": "bfdb5dbc0850385f329b5a3fe0c5cf8fb5ef504fd5940a6bfafe4c124168a8cc", "text": "How the three components of a) level of relevance, b) type of expenditure and c) functional classification of the expenditure come together in the analysis of the Lao PDR budget data is illustrated in Figure 2: Lao PDR: DRM-Relevant Expenditure Classifications in Ministry Budgets. 5.

DRM-relevant expenditure: National comparisons As explained in Section 2.4, the underlying time periods and scope of the budget data available for analysis varied across the three countries. The inter-country analysis of DRM-relevant expenditure should therefore be interpreted as a guide only. The level of DRM-relevant expenditure in relation to GDP in the three countries in illustrated in Figure 3. In Lao PDR total DRM-relevant expenditure for both government and provincial budgets was estimated at about 1.9 percent of GDP. This was comprised 1.7 percent for central government expenditure and 0.2 percent for provincial expenditure. In Thailand, the central government expenditure relevant to DRM was estimated at 0.9 percent of GDP22. In Vietnam, the proportion of DRM-relevant expenditure was equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP23. If whole-of-government expenditure was available for analysis Vietnam\u2019s figure would likely have been higher. Note: Vietnam five ministries and three provinces only 6.

DRM Expenditure Analysis Table 1: DRM-Relevant Expenditure by Assessed Level of Relevance 6.2. DRM-relevant expenditure by relevance The aggregate levels of DRM-relevance assessed for expenditure across the three countries for their respective review periods is indicated in Table 1: DRM-Relevant Expenditure by Assessed Level of Relevance. In Lao PDR, only 10.3 percent of estimated DRM-relevant expenditure was related to expenditure that was \u201ccompletely/very-high/ highly\u201d related to DRM activities. In Thailand, the comparable figure was estimated at 49.4 percent. In Vietnam expenditure was 23.5 percent for the five central government ministries and 6.9 percent for the three provinces. The difference in this categorisation of relevance relates to the detail available in Thai and Vietnam datasets. In Thailand, the three levels of detail in the budget lines enabled a high level of granularity to be determined for each expenditure line. In Vietnam, the pre-selection of the dataset through the CPEIR meant that the basic data was previously assessed as relevant to climate change adaptation. In comparison, the CPEIR also found that the majority of climate change response projects under implementation (58 percent on average) and 42 percent of annual climate change response allocations could be characterised as \u201clow\u201d or \u201cmarginal\u201d relevance to climate change response, as classified by the Typology of Climate Change Response Expenditure.

DRM-relevant expenditure by ministries The following section analyses the level of total DRM-relevant expenditure across all ministries, and within the respective budgets of the individual ministries. The various ministries and their respective mandates/ responsibilities, are not identical across the three countries, thus the expenditure recorded in the following analyses are indicative and not directly comparable. Disaggregating the expenditure by individual ministries/agencies indicates that in all three countries a small number of key ministries account for a significant majority of DRM-relevant expenditure. (See Table 2: Total DRM-Relevant Expenditure: Percent by Key Ministries). In Lao PDR and Vietnam, the ministries of public works & transport, and transport and construction respectively accounted for around half of all DRM-relevant expenditure in the two countries.

The ministries of natural resources and environment contributed 2.4 percent and 3.1 percent in Lao PDR and Thailand respectively. In Vietnam, this ministry contributed 8.4 percent of total DRM expenditure. Almost the same ministries record the highest proportion of their own ministry budgets being DRM-relevant as illustrated in Table 3: DRM-Relevant Expenditure: Percent of Key Ministry Budgets. The ministries responsible for agriculture are all recorded as having amongst the highest proportions of their budgets relevant to DRM. In Vietnam, it was estimated that 28.3 percent of the agriculture ministry budget had some relevance to DRM. Lao PDR and Thailand reported similar figures with 20.1 percent and 14.8 percent respectively. The ministries of natural resources and the environment record the next highest proportion of DRM-relevance in their budgets, in Lao PDR and Thailand having 12.1 percent and 12.2 percent and Vietnam 26.5 percent of their budgets relevant to DRM. The ministries generally responsible for public work and construction had the third highest levels of DRM-relevance within their own budgets. In Lao PDR, the ministries of transport and construction recorded 16.4 percent of the combined budgets as having DRM-relevance with Thailand (ministry of interior) and Vietnam (transport and communications) at 6.2 percent and 6.8 percent relevance to DRM in their respective ministry budgets. It may be noted that agencies with nominal responsibility for disaster policy and management tend to have limited authority and access to funds. 6.

Projects/ investments of this type (A4) accounted for 87.6 percent of all estimated DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR, 43.1 percent in Thailand and just over two-thirds in Vietnam. There were no budget lines or projects specifically focused on policy and institutional development (type A1) in Lao PDR and only 0.3 percent of DRM-relevant expenditure was specifically focused on this project type in Thailand. Investment in type A1 was, however, recorded at 6.6 percent in Vietnam. The other two categories of pre-disaster project type (A2 & A3) awareness, capacity building and research, early warning systems and hazard mapping together accounted for only 1.6 percent and 1.1 percent of expenditure in Lao PDR and Thailand respectively. In Vietnam, an estimated 18.3 percent of expenditure was of these types. Projects and budget lines specifically focused on post-disaster activities (types B1 and B2) accounted for about 10.8 percent of DRM-expenditure in Lao PDR, and 6.3 percent in Vietnam. In Thailand, the major post-disaster expenditure on flood relief, recovery, and reconstruction boosted expenditure in these types of investment to account for 55.5 percent of all DRM-related expenditure. Much of this expenditure was incurred in FY2011; 96 percent of all post-disaster expenditure came through the \u201cCentral Fund\u201d, and this accounted 53.9 percent of total DRM-relevant expenditure over the four years. 6. DRM Expenditure Analysis Credit: Istock.com/sutiporn 33 Table 5: DRM-Relevant Expenditure by Functional Purpose (Sendai Priority/Function) illustrates the analysis of the functional purpose of the DRM-expenditure providing an indication of expenditure directly related to the four Sendai priorities. In all three countries the largest proportion of DRM-relevant expenditure is estimated to have been allocated to disaster risk reduction and infrastructure investment (type A4). These types of functional investment may cover a wide range of sectors but, as seen in Section 6.3 above, the expenditure is centred on a small number of ministries. In Lao PDR, approximately three-quarters of DRM-relevant expenditure focused on physical investment (functional type A4); in Vietnam, the proportion was two-thirds, while in Thailand it was estimated at 37.1 percent of total DRM-relevant expenditure.

DRM Expenditure Analysis 34 (functional type A4) was lower in Thailand as expenditure on post-disaster activities was much higher in response to flood relief at 28.2 percent of expenditure (functional category B1) and to recovery and reconstruction (functional category B2) at 24.6 percent of DRM expenditure. This totaled 52.8 percent of all DRM-relevant expenditure in Thailand. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, the amounts being allocated to these two post-disaster functional categories of expenditure were much lower at an aggregate of 11.3 percent and 7.7 percent respectively. As seen in the previous Table, only a very small number and amount of budget line or investment expenditure was identified as being wholly focused on policy and institutional development for DRM (functional expenditure category A1). However, it was estimated that 2.5 percent of DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR, 2.7 percent in Thailand and 6.7 percent in Vietnam, would have made some contribution to building policy and institutional capacities. The other two categories of pre-disaster functional type (A2 & A3) accounted for an estimated 8.3 percent of DRM-relevant expenditure in Lao PDR, 7.4 percent in Thailand and 19.0 percent in Vietnam.

Expenditure on DRM-relevant activities is concentrated in a small number of similar ministries and agencies across each of the three countries. These ministries include those responsible for agriculture, irrigation, natural resources, environment and construction. Agencies that have nominal responsibility for disaster policy and management tend to have limited authority to implement DRM measures, such as in agricultural livelihoods, or infrastructure, or in the delivery of emergency assistance, that are frequently under the mandates of other ministries and agencies. Additionally, accessibility to funds for major DRM interventions by those DRM- policy agencies is limited. DRM-relevant expenditure generally comprises small, embedded components within other projects/investment or recurrent budget lines. DRM-related expenditure is also concentrated in physical infrastructure investments. 6.6. Summary findings and recommendation relating to expenditure for DRM 6. DRM Expenditure Analysis Credit: Istock.com/NJPhotos 35 DRM-relevant expenditure specifically focused on activities related to DRM policy, community awareness, capacity building, early warning and research is very small. Where expenditure in these areas has been identified it has comprised of embedded components in other projects and investments. While expenditure on similar DRM-relevant activities at the provincial levels appears to be higher in relative terms, it is lower in absolute terms than in central government budgets. With the increasing risks and frequencies of natural hazards, there is a need to better assess DRM in all major projects, investments and budget lines. As the costs resulting from disaster impacts and recovery/reconstruction increase there is a need to pre-emptively finance disaster risk reduction. However, hazard risk analysis, developing early warning systems and building resilience require investment and cooperation across all sectors. It is therefore recommended to: \u2022\ufffd Provide\ufffdcapacity\ufffdbuilding\ufffdopportunities\ufffd on all aspects of the project cycle at the ministries of finance and in sector ministries and agencies. Ministries of finance should have a clear understanding of the cross-sectoral linkages and benefits of DRM investments that build resilience, thereby helping to minimise future post-disaster costs. Sector ministries should have capacity building to ensure that DRM measures are fully mainstreamed and incorporated into all policies, activities and projects. \u2022\ufffd Conduct\ufffdresearch\ufffdto\ufffddetermine\ufffdthe\ufffd appropriate level of DRM expenditure in relation to national hazard risks; this would include analysis of regional and global DRM expenditure; identification of best practices from elsewhere for allocating resources to DRM; and better understanding how DRM expenditure are measured and monitored. \u2022\ufffd Revise\ufffdproject\ufffdplanning\ufffdcycles\ufffdand\ufffdappraisal\ufffd\ufffd processes to ensure that DRM is considered. For example, each budget submission or capital investment proposal should include an outcome/output matrix indicating the contribution of the expenditure or investment to a range of cross-cutting issues, including DRM, climate change and the environment. This could be incorporated into a standard EIA submission. Using a matrix, ministries of finance could be supported with capacity building to devise a weighting system to assist in ranking priorities for allocation of scarce budget resources. \u2022\ufffd Introduce\ufffda\ufffdbudget-tagging\ufffdsystem\ufffdfor\ufffd\ufffd DRM into the annual budget process. With the increase and frequency of natural hazards resulting from climate change, and the consequences that this could have for the livelihoods of the rural poor, it is further recommended to: \u2022\ufffd Prioritise\ufffdinvestments\ufffdin\ufffddisaster\ufffdrisk\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd reduction. This would support the achievement of the Sendai priorities and would also contribute to the achievement of Agenda 2030 by focusing on the resilience and sustainability of all aspects of livelihoods and coping strategies for the poor. 6.
