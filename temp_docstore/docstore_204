The left-hand figure shows how the income of the person at the twentieth percentile has changed over time, while the right-hand figure shows the geographic location of the poorest 20 percent of people. The poorest 20 percent of people face deprivations in multiple areas of sustainable development, highlighting the interconnectedness of the 2030 Agenda and complexity of the challenge of leaving no one behind. Figure 1.3 shows how women among the poorest 20 percent face reduced access to health care (highlighted by the presence of a skilled attendant at birth) and education (highlighted by the number of women who have no education or preschool only) in each country. While the extent of overlap between the variables displayed varies, in almost all cases the women who face deprivation in one area are more likely to in another area as well. And while these indicators are for education, health care and low incomes, the situation is similar when looking at overlapping deprivations in other areas too. 15 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda This highlights the interconnections in the 2030 Agenda \u2013 without education, it is much more difficult to access decent employment; without access to health care, a period of sickness may bring a family into poverty. To achieve and sustain progress in leaving no one behind, it shows that progress is needed on many fronts at once. Mobilising and stimulating the financing necessary to make progress on multiple aspects of the sustainable development agenda at once, including targeted support for the people and communities that are most vulnerable to being left behind, will be a critical determinant of the extent to which the vision of no one left behind is realized in practice.

Total gross domestic product (GDP) grew from US$1.5 trillion in 2005 to $2.4 trillion in 2015, an average annual growth rate of 5.2 percent. The ASEAN economy is the third largest in Asia and the seventh largest in the world.37 Some projections estimate that by 2050 it could be the fourth largest in the world.38 Following the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community at the end of 2015, and with ever-increasing economic integration, there is significant potential for continued economic development. Gross national income (GNI) per capita levels are rising, and have grown for the region as a whole from $1,669 per person in 2005 to $4,011 in 2015. There are overall positive trends in all countries (Figure 1.4; note Brunei and Singapore are not shown). With Cambodia\u2019s GNI rising above the lower-middle-income threshold in 2014, all ASEAN countries are now classified as middle or high income. Figure 1.4.

LIC = low-income country; LMIC = lower-middle-income country; UMIC = upper-middle-income country. The drivers of the 10 ASEAN economies vary widely, however, as do the policy challenges that will determine the extent of future economic development \u2013 and the impact of that development on SDG outcomes. The economies of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar are largely factor driven, while others such as Viet Nam are progressing rapidly into higher value-added productivity. For Thailand the challenge is escaping a middle-income trap. 37 ASEAN Secretariat, ASEAN Economic Community 2015: Progress and Key Achievements, ASEAN Secretariat, Jakarta, 2015. http:// asean.org/?static_post=asean-economic-community-2015-progress-and-key-achievements-2 38 Vinayak HV et al, Understanding ASEAN: Seven things you need to know, McKinsey. http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/ public-sector/our-insights/understanding-asean-seven-things-you-need-to-know 17 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Economic growth is driving rising wages and a falling proportion of employed people living in poverty, highlighting the potential impact of inclusive growth (Figure 1.5). Rising wages in some contexts also highlight part of the challenge for policymakers. Thailand is in a middle-income trap where rising wages are reducing the competitiveness of its established industries relative to other countries in the region, yet it does not have a sufficient critical mass to make an economy-wide move to higher value-added industries. Mobilising the private finance that can help the country move out of this middle-income trap is a key challenge.

More than half (53 percent) of ASEAN\u2019s population primarily use clean fuels and technology for cooking.44 Lao PDR, Myanmar and Cambodia rely the least on clean fuels and technology for cooking at less than 5, 9 and 13 percent respectively. Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore both have over 95 percent population that primarily relies on clean fuels and technology in cooking. SDG 13 is about climate action.45 Six ASEAN countries46 have had an increasing trend in emissions per unit of GDP since 1990.47 As a region, however, emissions per unit of GDP have slowly but consistently fallen since 2005. The most recent available data (2013) puts Malaysia and Viet Nam as the two heaviest emitters per capita (0.31 and 0.29 kg per unit of GDP respectively). This places them 37th and 40th internationally, although still below the world average of 0.33 kg per unit of GDP.48 The lowest regional emitter by a distance is Myanmar (0.06 kg per unit of GDP, 2012 data), placing it joint lowest in the world. The global share of emissions from ASEAN nations has increased steadily since 1990, more than doubling from 1.6 to 3.5 percent based on latest data available. The need for financing to underpin and support the transition to greener models of development is essential if ASEAN countries are to fulfil their commitments on climate action. SDG 15 focuses on life on land. There are mixed trends in forest areas as a proportion of total land area.49 Though they are increasing overall, and the previous MDG target was met in Lao PDR, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, in five other countries forest areas are reducing. The greatest increase was in Viet Nam (30 percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2015). The greatest decrease was in Cambodia (73 percent in 1990 to 54 percent in 2015).

The economic objectives of the AEC are to create a more integrated regional economy that supports sustained and inclusive economic growth which narrows the development gap, ends poverty and maintains a rising middle class. The fourth characteristic of the AEC is building a resilient, inclusive, people- oriented and people-centred ASEAN. This includes strategic measures related to strengthening the role of micro, small and medium enterprises; strengthening the role of the private sector; and using of PPPs as a tool to strengthen economic and social development. It also includes objectives on narrowing the development gap, which focus on the CLMV countries through the Initiative for ASEAN Integration policy. This policy, also known as the \u2018Narrowing the Development Gap\u2019 policy, is designed to support the region\u2019s four poorest members \u2013 the CLMV countries \u2013 to integrate into the ASEAN community and expedite progress toward the objectives of Vision 2025. The other six ASEAN countries and the ASEAN dialogue partners provide support through research, training policy and implementation assistance. Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda There are significant parallels and common priorities between the ASEAN regional Vision 2025 and the global 2030 Agenda and its results framework, the SDGs.54 These parallels exist in both the principles and overarching objectives of each agenda, and at the level of specific goals and targets. There is a common drive toward balanced economic, social and environmental development. The people-centric approach to Vision 2025, outlined in the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community blueprint, complements the cross- cutting emphasis on leaving no one behind in the 2030 Agenda. Both agendas emphasise resilience as 54 UNESCAP, \u2018Statement at the Developing Complementarities between the 2030 United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development and the ASEAN Community Vision 2025\u2019, delivered at UNHQ, New York. http://www.unescap.org/ru/node/13627 21 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda a cross-cutting theme and outline steps to move toward sustainable consumption and production. The development of regional and trans-border infrastructure called for by the SDGs aligns closely with the ASEAN drive toward greater connectivity and infrastructure. Beyond these examples of alignment in the agendas themselves, there is commonality in several priority actions \u2013 such as improving and harmonising data systems, promoting regional integration and investing in environmental infrastructure. Finally, both agendas recognize the cross-cutting nature of many sustainable development priorities and the need therefore for integrated solutions in response. Sustainable development challenges and policy priorities The sustainable development outlook for the ASEAN region is mixed, with strong positive trends sitting alongside significant outstanding challenges. The pace of progress will need to be maintained and expedited in some areas if the region is to achieve the SDGs. In particular, realising the vision of leaving no one behind will require substantial concurrent progress across a range of connected areas for the poorest and most vulnerable people. The pace of progress in reducing extreme poverty has been a key success for ASEAN countries, though vulnerability remains high and there are many working \u2018poor or near-poor\u2019. The middle class is growing though many people face limited access to services \u2013 being too wealthy to meet the criteria for interventions designed for the very poorest but not wealthy enough to afford paid-for services in a context of rising prices. In nutrition and aspects of health and education the region lags behind others. While economic growth has been an important driver of progress, many countries are at key junctures in their economic development paths. How far countries such as Thailand succeed in escaping the middle- income trap or CLMV countries develop higher value-added economic activities, and the manner in which this is achieved, will have a significant bearing on the sustainable development results the region is able to realize. Demographics will also affect ASEAN\u2019s sustainable development progress. For younger populations the rising numbers of people of working age in coming years could spur on innovation and development, or exacerbate tensions. For ageing populations rising dependency ratios will place rising demands on healthcare, pensions and related services.55 ASEAN is also among the most disaster-prone regions of the world and the impact of climate change and natural disasters disproportionately affects the poorest people, and can derail progress more widely.

Finance of all types \u2013 public and private, domestic and international \u2013 will be critical in driving forward the investments, spending and service delivery through which countries will address these challenges. This chapter presents an overview of the finance landscape across the region and the diversity of contexts that the 10 ASEAN member states face individually. It outlines key ongoing and future trends, unpacks the complex mix of resources and finance modalities at work in the region and analyses the policy challenges and opportunities faced by its countries. Building on the analysis of the sustainable development outlook in chapter 1, this analysis will feed into later discussion about how governments can strengthen their policy and institutional structures to mobilize the necessary scale, mix and sequence of resources to achieve the SDGs. Regional finance trends The overall volume of resources available in the ASEAN region is growing rapidly. Total finance grew from an estimated $855 billion in 2007 to $1.3 trillion in 2015. All major forms of financing have grown in aggregate across the ASEAN region (Figure 2.1), with domestic resources growing particularly rapidly. Domestic public and private finance grew by around $200 billion each between 2007 and 2015. Rapid growth in finance highlights the potential to drive sustainable development progress 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 US$ billions Domestic public Domestic private International public International private Source: Authors calculations based on national and international sources. See Annex, data notes Notes. All figures are constant 2015 US dollars prices. 23 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda This growth in the finance available offers significant potential to drive regional progress toward Vision 2025 and the SDGs \u2013 if it can be mobilized and channelled in ways that will yield sustainable development results. Domestic public finance, for example, grew from an average $700 per person in 2007 to $940 per person in 2015, yielding additional resources for governments to invest in services and infrastructure that can drive social, environmental and economic progress. Anticipated future growth in investment from China will offer significant additional funds for infrastructure in particular (see chapter 4). Yet more finance brings more complexity. There is a growing array and diversity of finance instruments, mechanisms and actors at work across the region, all of which could contribute to sustainable development progress \u2013 or detract from it. These trends amplify the need for governments to develop coordinated approaches to stimulating impact from all resources, through the institutions they establish and policies they deploy. It heightens the need for integrated frameworks that stimulate the investments that can unlock and accelerate progress, alongside the spending that supports it and underpins service delivery. Within the region, the challenges and opportunities faced at the national level vary from country to country. The total volume of resources ranges from less than $1,000 per person each year in Cambodia to over $20,000 in Singapore. In four of the ten countries domestic private finance is increasing most rapidly,56 in another four international private finance is and in two domestic public finance is. Unpacking resources into individual flows (Figure 2.2), domestic public finance is the largest resource flow for the region, accounting for almost a third (32 percent) of all finance in 2015. Next comes domestic commercial investment, which accounts for 31 percent. Yet this mix varies significantly: among CLMV countries, domestic private finance accounts for only just over one fifth of finance while government revenues account for 38 percent of financing. FDI actually accounts for a higher proportion of total finance in CLMV countries than others in the region, at 16 percent of the total in 2015 compared with 9 percent.

Meanwhile indirect taxes are levied on goods and services and can be more regressive as they relate to the price of the good or service \u2013 though this depends crucially on how they are structured and which basic goods are excluded.64 Indirect taxes are also often viewed as quicker wins because they do not require as comprehensive an infrastructure to establish and enforce as direct taxes.

Beyond revenues, governments borrow to make up the deficit between income streams and spending. Borrowing is a core part of most public finance models in the region, accounting for at least 10 percent of the budget in six ASEAN countries since 2005 on average (Figure 2.5), though with significant fluctuations year on year in most countries. Borrowing enables governments to make investments that would otherwise take longer to fund, working on the basis that greater public investment stimulates development that will generate returns that can be used to repay debts. Many governments have regulated limits to how much they can borrow. Following the East Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s some countries such as Thailand have also emphasized borrowing from domestic sources over international sources to mitigate currency risks. Governments should assess the long-term prospects for increased revenue mobilization and ask whether their tax and financing systems can provide the resources needed to support the public investments they need to yield the sustainable development results they are striving toward. Tax Inspectors Without Borders Tax Inspectors Without Borders66 (TIWB) is a joint initiative between the OECD and UNDP. Launched in July 2015, it seeks to support developing country taxation administrations in developing tax audit expertise and skills, aiming to assist in building administrative capacity through improving the quality and consistency of audits. TIWB offers two main programmes. The full programme involves experts working with local officials directly on current audits and audit-related issues while a partial programme, for those countries not yet ready to adopt the complete partnership agreement, organises technical workshops to provide expert advice on anonymous company audits. By April 2017, 3 TIWB programmes had been completed, 21 were 65 The 2016 Law on Financial Management 66 See http://www.tiwb.org/ Figure 2.5.

The TIWB Annual Report67 estimates that increased taxation revenue, directly attributable to either TIWB full or partial programmes, was over $278 million. Two countries in the ASEAN region, Cambodia and Viet Nam, have used the partial anonymized support programme, while Viet Nam has also applied for a full TIWB programme that will commence in 2017. Illicit finance and BEPS Illicit finance is a significant issue for many countries across the region68 and has costs in terms of lost revenue for government and investment for the economy. Given the international nature of the issue, international institutions are coordinating efforts to address the problem. The base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) package developed by the OECD and G20 includes 15 actions for governments to combat BEPS. Six ASEAN countries69 are members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework, and Singapore is also a member of the steering group. Implementation of the steps proposed by BEPS is at an early stage, though ASEAN countries have implemented some. Thailand and Viet Nam are considering \u2018thin capitalization\u2019 rules designed to limit base erosion via interest deduction and other payments. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are implementing transfer pricing rules, and Viet Nam is considering doing so. Thailand is also considering introducing controlled foreign company rules and Viet Nam is taking steps to prevent the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status. Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have signed the OECD-led initiative, the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports.70 Bond markets A number of countries in the region have bond markets which both governments and corporate entities use to borrow money. At national level, bond markets are important tools for converting national savings into finance that can be used to fund investments. Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore have the three largest local currency bond markets (Figure 2.6; data are converted to US dollars for comparability). In all ASEAN countries, government bonds exceed corporate bonds in scale, though the latter are significant in Malaysia and Singapore in particular. 67 TIWB, Tax Inspectors Without Borders Annual Report 2016/17.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dda707d-24de-4b97-af62-1997ae3e48e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dda707d-24de-4b97-af62-1997ae3e48e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a8741ef7ba1ab8d71bdb9a799ffb3b5c4914800273e20230243310d5decf76d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b64323b8-9449-48b4-8d13-e36f551e0297", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0288cc5530a2f4733bc5eaa1d170b4d58b3f605f6da1024f2b5636ce1258aca8"}}, "hash": "cffb9c7129325238be15b177584c0e91a88f29eaad35cfccbd289cf3ff9c99c0", "text": "67 TIWB, Tax Inspectors Without Borders Annual Report 2016/17. http://www.tiwb.org/resources/publications/tax-inspectors- without-borders-annual-report-2016\u20132017-WEB.pdf 68 Due to the illicit and deliberately unrecorded nature of these flows it is difficult to assess their exact magnitude, and efforts to estimate their scale have proven fraught with methodological and data challenges.

Commercial actors small and large are a key part of all ASEAN economies and how they create jobs, develop skills, treat the environment, drive innovation and stimulate growth affect the development paths that countries ultimately follow. Philanthropic organizations play a critical role in providing services and as advocates for the poorest and most vulnerable communities, people and environments. Migrant workers and the remittances they send are vital for many communities across the region. Understanding the scale and nature of private financing is critical for considering the role that different private actors can play and, from the perspective of government, what partnerships, policies and interventions are needed to realize those roles. Across the region, private investment is rising, having doubled in real terms from $305 billion in 2005 to $609 billion in 2015 (Figure 2.8). This is equivalent to an increase from around 14 percent of regional income in 2004 to 22 percent in 2015.75 71 The data show public or publicly guaranteed external debt meaning that the public sector is not always the borrower, but has at least provided a guaranteed of repayment. 72 Cambodia (59 percent of total), Indonesia (52), Lao PDR (58), Myanmar (86) and Viet Nam (60). 73 Lao PDR (36 percent), Thailand (36), Indonesia (35) and the Philippines (33). 74 Comprehensive data are only available for private borrowing from international sources, see Annex, data notes. 75 Calculated as total private investment for the region as a whole divided by the sum of GNI for all countries in the region. 31 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda At the national level the picture is mixed. Five countries have seen rises equivalent to a five percentage- point increase in national income or more while in two countries, private investment has increased by more than 10 percentage points. One of these, Indonesia, experienced very rapidly rising investment levels from the late 2000s, with total private investment rising from less than $100 billion a year before 2008 to more than $200 billion a year in 2012. Since then this growth has slowed, though investment levels remain high at over $240 billion in 2015, or around 28 percent of GDP. In other countries, investment levels are growing in absolute volume but have plateaued relative to the economy. In Thailand private investment has been between 16 and 21 percent of GDP every year since 2005. In Viet Nam, it has remained relatively consistent in absolute terms at around $32 billion to $39 billion a year since 2007,76 but has fallen as a proportion of rising national incomes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc69f617-01b6-449f-a3d4-06855023a154": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc69f617-01b6-449f-a3d4-06855023a154", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac220ae5974b7e552bc654a25a03d041c49c205ec909caa8fae0f95ff76f3d6e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2fa2fd4-4be7-47e5-8392-8fc8a5a5efc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e97f9e19453df3eb5bb8d0e02d7c13524dbe38db066f4b614fa6297d9c3e530b"}}, "hash": "c8ef4eeb4499f35a76aae411a4da577274a76aa683b576291c6fe69c17ed154a", "text": "Lao PDR and Myanmar have had fluctuating levels of private investment; both have seen two periods of high investments.

Looking ahead, the prospects for continued growth in FDI are strong, given likely increases in investment from the two largest sources of FDI: the United States and Japan. A US Chamber of Commerce survey showed that 87 percent of participating US companies expect their level of trade and investment with the region to increase in the next five years and almost half (49 percent) expect to increase their workforce in ASEAN within a year.77 Almost three quarters (73 percent) of Japanese firms plan to expand in ASEAN too.78 Singapore attracts half of all FDI to the ASEAN region Singapore 70.58 Cambodia 1.72 Lao PDR 1.08 Brunei Darussalam 0.17 Philippines 5.64 Thailand 9.00 Viet Nam 14.50 Myanmar 9.48 Malaysia 11.12 Indonesia 16.64 Source: Author\u2019s calculations based on national statistics offices and UNCTAD One country dominates FDI receipts: Singapore (Figure 2.9). Despite accounting for just 1 percent of the ASEAN population it accounts for half of FDI to the region. Almost two thirds of the growth in FDI over the last 10 years was increased investment in Singapore.79 Its role as a regional financier is important in attracting investment both nationally and in its ASEAN neighbours (see box). Beyond the scale of private investment alone, the way it is invested matters for the type of national development path a country follows. The types of industries and jobs created, the skills demanded and nurtured and, particularly around foreign investment, the links with local businesses made can determine the extent to which national productivity and economic growth rises, but also have much wider impacts on incomes, society and the environment. This is well recognized by governments across the region, who are themselves investing heavily in policy, services and infrastructure designed to stimulate types of private sector development that can help the 77 U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \u2018ASEAN Business Outlook Survey 2017\u2019, 2016. https://www.uschamber.com/report/ asean-business-outlook-survey-2017 78 \u2018JETRO FY 2015 Survey on the International Operations of Japanese Firms\u2019, quoted in ASEAN and UNCTAD, ASEAN Investment Report 2016, ASEAN and UNCTAD, 2016. http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/unctad_asean_air2016d1.pdf 79 Regional FDI grew by $67 billion between 2005 and 2015; growing FDI to Singapore accounted for $46 billion of this. 33 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda country move on to the next stages of its development. Many governments are targeting investment in certain industries or sectors, or encouraging investment in particular locations within the country (see chapter 5).

One important mechanism through which this occurs is the tax incentives, breaks and holidays offered to investors. These directly reduce the revenues that government receive, thereby limiting the benefit of investment on public finances and reducing the volume of funds available for public services and investment. There is evidence that much of this tax competition is harmful and unnecessary. Countries in the region regularly offer tax incentives, such as exemptions, that are among the most harmful.81 And surveys from the region and beyond show that tax is often a lower priority for determining where investors will invest than other issues such as the business environment, infrastructure, utilities and availability of skilled labour.82 Other regions around the world have developed or are developing codes of conduct to reduce the most harmful elements of tax competition and six ASEAN countries are members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework which includes actions on harmful tax practices. ASEAN could develop a region-wide code of conduct that builds on these initiatives (see recommendations). 80 One widely used classification groups countries according to whether they are largely factor driven, efficiency driven, innovation driven or wealth driven. 81 Oxfam Novib, Race to the bottom \u2013 tax incentives in South East Asia, Oxfam Novib, The Hague, 2017. https://maketaxfair.net/ race-bottom-tax-incentives-south-east-asia-2/ 82 Ibid.

It grew from $16 billion in 2010 to $24 billion in 2016, also rising as a proportion of total FDI from 15 to 25 percent over the same period. Singapore is the largest source of intra-regional investment followed by Malaysia (Figure 2.11). Singapore accounted for over two thirds of intra-regional FDI in 2015, some $14.5 billion. Malaysian investment in other ASEAN countries totalled $3.5 billion, 16 percent of the total. Singapore is the largest ASEAN investor in six of the other nine countries; only in Lao PDR and Cambodia are its investment levels low. In Myanmar, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam it is the largest investor of any country, accounting for 55, 53 and 31 percent of total FDI respectively. Malaysia is the largest ASEAN investor in Viet Nam, as well as in Singapore. Thailand, the third largest source of intra-regional FDI, is a major investor in Myanmar, with FDI totalling $538 million in 2015. Figure 2.11.

International public finance International public finance plays an important role supporting countries across the region in various ways. It still provides important volumes of financing in some contexts: for example in Lao PDR international grants account for a significant proportion of total revenue while in Cambodia over 70 percent of public capital investment is funded internationally. In general it is declining as a proportion of total finance, though international financing in key areas such as vaccinations remains important for many countries. Many donors are playing a more catalytic role, for example in providing technical expertise, transferring technology or knowledge and financing pilot projects, for instance UNDP is helping promote energy efficiency in a commercial buildings programme in Thailand.83 While declining as a proportion of total financing, the volume of international public finance is on an upward trend. Official development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF) are rising (Figure 2.14), while the growth of South-South cooperation and climate finance, and the emergence of new development finance institutions are opening the door to further increases in the future. ODA rose from $7.7 billion in 2005 to a peak of $13.6 billion in 2013, falling to $10.1 billion in 2015. This peak and subsequent fall relates to Myanmar: ODA rose from less than $500 million a year before 2013 to over $4 billion in 2013. OOF rose from less than $7 billion before 2009 to $15 billion in 2015, with a significant increase of over $6 billion in 2015 to Indonesia. This means that for the first time, non-concessional finance from the donors that report their figures to the OECD exceeded concessional finance. 83 UNDP piloted a scheme that demonstrated the benefits of improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings that has since been taken up and expanded by government, who is establishing an on-budget matching fund. 37 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Beyond these flows, investment from China and institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank are expected to grow and become an important source of finance, particularly for infrastructure, in the future. ASEAN and China have committed to achieving two-way investment totalling $150 billion by 2020,84 covering a mixture of public and private finance (see chapter 3). The AIIB has to date committed $441 million to three projects in Indonesia and is considering a $20 million project in Myanmar and a $208 million proposal from the Philippines (see chapter 2).85 Viet Nam is the largest recipient of ODA in 2015, receiving 37 percent ($3.9 billion) of the regional total (Figure 2.15). Lao PDR and Cambodia were the second and third largest; these three countries together accounted for 68 percent of ODA to the region. Concessional loans accounted for 52 percent of ODA in 2015, followed by mixed project aid and technical cooperation at 18 and 12 percent respectively. Indonesia and Viet Nam are the largest recipients of technical cooperation. Governance and security, and education were the largest sectors for technical cooperation in the region. Indonesia was the largest recipient of OOF in 2015, receiving 59 percent of the regional total. The Philippines and Viet Nam received $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion respectively. OOF to these three largest recipients represented 92 percent of total OOF to the region.

Thailand has the most developed programme, though Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia all provide cooperation as well. Following a Cabinet decision in 2003 Thailand decided to become a provider of assistance and to scale back its own receipt of concessional finance. Thai ODA has three components: soft loans disbursed through the Neighbouring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency; training, scholarships and other capacity building assistance through the Thailand International Cooperation Agency; and funding for international organizations. Thai ODA in 2015 totalled $79 million, of which 82 percent went to other ASEAN countries. The vast majority of finance went to neighbouring countries: $41.2 million to Lao PDR (of which $34.6 million was concessional loans) and $18.5 million to Myanmar. One explicit aim is to support the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (see chapter 1). Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia have all established programmes focused on human resource and capacity development. The Singapore Cooperation Programme offers training based on its own developmental experience, with a focus on support for others in the ASEAN region. Under the Initiative for Asian Integration it established training centres in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. The Malaysia Technical Cooperation Programme also focuses on technical cooperation, alongside scholarships that focus on sharing its development experience too. Part of Malaysian cooperation is also explicitly linked to the Initiative for ASEAN Integration; Malaysia provided support for 33 capacity building projects under its first work plan. Indonesia has a programme of cooperation focused on technical cooperation rooted in the Jakarta Commitment of 2009.86 A range of ministries and departments provide technical cooperation with partners in the region and beyond within a framework designed to support Southern countries to achieve \u2018collective self-reliance\u2019, and to support Indonesia\u2019s own foreign policy objectives.87 ASEAN Infrastructure Fund The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund is an innovative mechanism that aims to use countries\u2019 own savings to promote infrastructure development across the region in line with the ASEAN Master Plan on Connectivity. It will issue debt that is targeted for purchase by ASEAN central banks who hold foreign exchange reserves. Following the East Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s many countries hold significant reserves, which total over $700 billion across the whole region. Currently these are largely invested outside the region, but the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund offers an avenue to use them in the region while helping meet its need for infrastructure. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund aims to provide loans of around $300 million a year to finance infrastructure investment projects in the transport, energy, water and sanitation, environment and rural development, and social infrastructure sectors. It is administered by the Asian Development Bank, who invested in core equity alongside ASEAN member states. The Asian Development Bank will also provide technical assistance, for example in offering due diligence support for projects and pipeline development or conducting dialogues and consultations among stakeholders for consensus building.88 86 Asia Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility, Asia-Pacific Effective Development Cooperation Report 2014, UNDP, 2014. http:// www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/library/democratic_governance/effective-dev-cooperation-report-2014.html 87 Ministry of National Development Planning/BAPPENAS and UNDP, \u2018South-South and Triangular Cooperation Stocktaking and Strategic Review\u2019, BAPPENAS and UNDP, 2014. http://www.asia-pacific.undp.org/content/dam/rbap/docs/dg/dev-effectiveness/ UNDP-IDN-DG-2014-SSTC-Strategic-Review-of-Indonesia.pdf 88 Asian Development Bank, ASEAN Infrastructure Fund, 2016. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/221281/aif- brochure-2016.pdf 39 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Public climate finance Climate finance covers spending on mitigation and adaptation activities that cut across aspects of all public and private, domestic and international resources. While systems are being strengthened (see for example chapter 4 box on climate budget tagging) there are still challenges to understanding the landscape of climate finance overall. Data are most readily available on international public and, in some countries, domestic public climate finance.

The financing outlook for the region is mixed. Rapid growth in the availability of finance for the region offers significant potential to drive regional progress toward Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda \u2013 if it can be mobilized and channelled into investments that will yield sustainable development results. Yet despite growth in the scale and diversity of finance available at the regional level, the picture is uneven at the country level and key finance flows remain scarce and are growing very slowly for some countries. Left unchecked, this will constrain the ability to achieve SDG results. Low levels of domestic revenue mobilization mean governments are less able to fund services and public investment: six countries in the region raise revenues of less than $600 per person each year. In Cambodia over 70 percent of public investment is funded from international sources. Stimulating sufficient quantities of quality investment will be critical and several countries are at a juncture in their economic models as they attempt to transition to higher value-added economic structures that can help drive sustainable development progress. Using international public finance catalytically, while planning ahead for reductions in concessional finance in particular, is important for maximising its contribution. Most of all countries must find effective ways of mobilising the right mix and sequence of all resources. This means creating mechanisms or incentives that encourage the use of public and private financing instruments according to their comparative advantages in each area of sustainable development. It means developing holistic policy that addresses the wider impacts of each type of finance \u2013 for example maximising the societal and environmental contribution of private investment beyond economic gains alone. And it means finding the mix of resources that can leverage the synergies between them.

Managing finance strategies in such a way requires holistic, integrated approaches from government that address policies toward all resources in a coherent framework. The following chapter uses the lens of an integrated national financing framework to explore the policies and institutional structures that governments have in place to address the challenges and opportunities of the finance landscape and to develop approaches that generate the mix and sequence of resources that can realize the visions of the 2030 Agenda and Vision 2025.

China is an increasingly significant source of investment across the region: by some estimates its investment has grown almost 100-fold in the last 10 years.90 The relationship is set to grow and deepen further as China expands its global presence, particularly as the Belt and Road Initiative is implemented in the region.

While figures specific to the ASEAN region are not available, data on Chinese investment globally shows that state-owned enterprises accounted for just over half of the total in 2015 (50.4 percent). Non-state enterprises accounted for the rest. Yet within these non-state figures are provincial collectives which are significant worldwide and likely to play a proportionally larger role in investment in ASEAN given its close geographic proximity to three provinces in particular: Guangdong, Guangxi and Yunnan. Investments by private enterprises then are a minority of overall Chinese investments worldwide and this is likely true of Chinese investments in ASEAN, though they are likely to remain significant in volume. However, there is also private involvement in the investments of state-owned enterprises and provincial collectives. The structure of over 80 percent of Chinese state-owned enterprises is one that involves both public and private financial resources and both state-owned enterprises and provincial collectives regularly engage in PPPs when investing abroad.94 As such these Chinese investments cut across the international public and private categories used elsewhere in this report though it is not possible to know the exact breakdown in the ASEAN region.

Chinese investment in Indonesia has historically centred on the country\u2019s natural resources, particularly oil, gas and mining. But the focus is starting to shift toward investment in infrastructure. China is a key player in Indonesia\u2019s first high-speed rail project, for example, and is investing significantly in the electricity sector. Indonesia is followed by Viet Nam and Lao PDR as the third and fourth largest destinations for Chinese investment, at $560 million and $517 million respectively in 2015. Three sectors (leasing and business services, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade) account for 76 percent of total Chinese investment in ASEAN in 2015 (Figure 3.4). 95 Ibid 45 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda From Going Global to the Belt and Road Initiative China\u2019s increasing presence on the international financing stage and in the ASEAN region has been guided by what can be seen as a series of \u2018going global\u2019 initiatives. The original \u2018going global\u2019 initiative was proposed in 2000, focusing on sectors such as natural resources and energy. Following the global financial crisis in 2007\u20132008 this focus broadened to sectors such as manufacturing and the construction of infrastructure and saw increasing participation of private companies in the \u2018going global\u2019 approach. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is designed for a new phase of \u2018opening up\u2019 and international activity. First proposed in 2013, it consists of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st century Maritime Silk Road and is designed to focus on connectivity and cooperation. It combines domestic and international imperatives. Domestically, it will help stimulate the economies of inland Chinese provinces, and provides an outlet for the industrial overcapacity in China.96 Internationally it aims to boost the connectivity of many of China\u2019s partners and support greater involvement in global value chains.97 The framing of China\u2019s financing policy toward ASEAN under the BRI, and before it, is primarily grounded in foreign affairs. This contrasts with other regions, such as Africa, where there has been a more prominent focus on the MDGs and now the SDGs in the relationship. Nevertheless, there are significant overlaps between the BRI and the 2030 Agenda in ASEAN, and the agreement to formulate a joint vision for the relationship to 2030 that links to the SDGs may place them more centrally in the ongoing relationship.98 Infrastructure is a central theme of the BRI and this emphasis, with the anticipated volumes of financing behind it, could significantly impact sustainable development in the ASEAN region. The most direct contributions are likely to be in SDGs 7 and 9, affordable and clean energy, and industry, innovation and infrastructure. There is significant overlap between the emphasis in the BRI on energy infrastructure connectivity, clean energy technology, green and low carbon infrastructure and telecommunication cooperation and the corresponding SDGs, among other areas. Ongoing investments show the potential contribution. Many investors from Yunnan province, for example, focus on industrial capacity and infrastructure and the provincial strategy for contributing toward China\u2019s larger going global approach has focused on these sectors in the five ASEAN countries in the Greater Mekong region.99 Investments from the province in these countries totalled $582 million in 2013 and included projects to build a power station in Yangon that will increase the city\u2019s energy capacity by one third, and to develop industrial development zones in Lao PDR and Myanmar and an international airport in Cambodia that will help stimulate growth and investment. Financing from various funds and other financial institutions will also include a significant focus on infrastructure among other issues.

A $40 billion Silk Road Fund, which is open to ASEAN countries but has a wider geographic focus, has started investing funds.100 A RMB 50 million annual fund was launched in 2013 to support the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response.101 The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a multilateral institution that was initiated by China and in which China will continue to play an important role. While still in its early stages, it has already approved or is considering a number of infrastructure projects in the ASEAN region. In Indonesia, projects to improve the operations and safety of dams, upgrade urban infrastructure and services in poorer communities and operationalise a regional infrastructure development fund that will lend to local governments have been approved. A gas-fired power plant in Myanmar is under consideration and the Philippines have submitted a proposal to improve flood management in Manila by improving pumping station and waste management infrastructure. Moving forward The BRI was established fairly recently and many of the details of the initiative are still being developed. Given its prominence, however, alongside the specific commitment to scale up two-way China-ASEAN financing, and the generally important role of state-owned and state-linked organizations in Chinese investment in ASEAN, it is likely to have a substantial impact on the nature of this investment in the future. The contribution of BRI and Chinese financing to ASEAN\u2019s sustainable development is, then, likely to be significant. By way of comparison, some estimates of the infrastructure financing gap in Southeast Asia estimate it to be around $150 billion a year.102 While Chinese investments cover a range of sectors beyond infrastructure alone, they could help the region make a substantial contribution toward closing that gap. While there are unknowns, what is known is that the BRI will follow a principle of \u2018jointly consult, jointly construct and jointly enjoy (results)\u2019, highlighting the room that exists for ASEAN countries to work closely with China on the nature of the initiative and implementation plan as they are established.103 In this light, the early stages of the BRI are an important time to install principles that will guide its implementation into the future. Of particular importance is the need to align plans for Chinese investment in the region with regional and national strategies, and to establish strong monitoring and review frameworks.104 Alignment between strategies for Chinese investment in ASEAN, particularly the BRI, will help ensure it maximizes its contribution to the results the region is targeting. Alignment can occur on at least three levels: 1) aligning BRI strategy and activities with the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 and the 2030 Agenda; 2) aligning relevant strategies of Chinese provinces, namely Guangxi, Yunnan and 100 Initial investments by the Silk Road Fund have focused on countries outside the ASEAN region, such as Pakistan, Russia and Saudi Arabia. However, the fund is open more widely to investment in countries including ASEAN members and initial discussions have been held with countries such as Cambodia (see: http://www.silkroadfund.com.cn/enweb/23809/23812/32722/index.html). 101 Remarks by HE Ambassador Xu Bu at the ASEAN-China Seminar on Disaster Management & Emergency Response, February 2015. http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/t1336920.shtml.

Rapid growth in financing in some areas offers significant potential to drive regional progress toward Vision 2025 and the 2030 Agenda \u2013 if it can be mobilized and channelled into investments that will yield sustainable development results. But for many countries the level and trajectory for key finance types remain low and there is an urgent need to expedite growth in the resources available, while ensuring they are used effectively. The challenge of sustainably expediting the growth in government revenues, and ensuring that these resources are invested effectively, is critical for improving service delivery and infrastructure that can directly impact the lives and environments of citizens across the ASEAN region. On private finance, the challenge for government is to develop policies and partnerships that can stimulate greater volumes of investment in priority areas, while ensuring that it contributes positively to all aspects of sustainable development without prioritising economic progress at the expense of social or environmental progress. And on international public finance, a key challenge for government is to build partnerships with relevant actors in areas where they can be a catalyst for sustainable development progress, while developing the skills, capacity and resources to be able to continue implementation after international public finance declines. Overall the challenge for governments is to develop and implement a policy and institutional framework that can tackle these challenges in parallel, leveraging the synergies between them and ensuring that investments across all aspects of the financing landscape contribute toward sustainable development results. This chapter uses the lens of an integrated national financing framework to examine the policies and institutional structures that governments have in place to manage their approach toward all types of financing. It takes the six building blocks of an integrated national financing framework and highlights examples where ASEAN countries are making progress. The concept of an integrated national financing framework can support governments as they tackle this challenge. This is recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which states that \u201ccohesive nationally- owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of our efforts\u201d.105 105 UN, \u2018Addis Ababa Action Agenda\u2019, 2015, paragraph 9. http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AAAA_ Outcome.pdf 49 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda An integrated national financing framework is a holistic, integrated system of policies and institutional structures that government has in place to manage its financing strategies across all resources in a coordinated, aligned manner (Figure 4.1). The concept is built around six building blocks that are designed to help governments evaluate their existing structures holistically and determine what reforms can strengthen the functioning of the system as a whole. The six building blocks of an integrated national financing framework are:106 1. Leadership that facilitates coherence across government: leadership from the highest levels of government to bring together key actors and build an integrated, aligned approach to mobilising the investments necessary to achieve the country\u2019s goals. 2. A clear vision for results: the foundation of an integrated national financing framework is clarity on the direction and desired sustainable development outcomes that the country wants to achieve in the long term. This may link to the regional Vision 2025 agenda or the international 2030 Agenda and may include estimates about the costs of the investments needed to realize it. 3. An overarching financing strategy: an overarching strategy for mobilising, channelling and investing the resources needed to make the vision for results a reality that incorporates the contributions that all resources (public and private, domestic and international) can make to sustainable development outcomes. 4. Aligned financing policies: the annual and medium-term plans that build on the financing strategy to invest public finance and mobilize and stimulate financing from other actors. This covers a range of policies such as medium-term expenditure frameworks, tax revenue strategies, industrial development strategies, small and medium enterprise strategies, national aid strategies among many others. 5. A strong monitoring, review and evaluation system: an integrated system for planning for and monitoring the contributions that different types of financing can make toward sustainable development outcomes. 6. Participatory processes for accountability and dialogue: mechanisms to build the trust necessary to mobilize contributions from stakeholders outside government, to make sure financing policies are designed and delivered effectively, and ensure a voice for citizens, civil society, business, development partners and other actors in financing sustainable development progress. 106 Based on: Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility, Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda: Progress in Establishing Integrated National Financing Frameworks, UNDP AP-DEF, 2016.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77c3226d-9d0f-4aa5-ba95-3bea2126dce8": {"__data__": {"id_": "77c3226d-9d0f-4aa5-ba95-3bea2126dce8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c063087660dfe8a872c9df1d63d32f160c176166b395bfbd6fe752bc3c88085c"}, "3": {"node_id": "57fe3453-3c50-44f0-87cf-fb7d71978a8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cee974de27bcb2f8ad641731e1d2082be42864b529e9c83adf608d7149c251c5"}}, "hash": "89444dab1db7a7e3d9bc924d683fd4f912e03eb8f04e0e33b792d17c11f7e694", "text": "http://www.asia- pacific.undp.org/content/rbap/en/home/library/democratic_governance/achieving-the-sustainable-development-goals.html Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 50 Figure 4.1: An integrated national financing framework for delivering sustainable development results 1 Leadership and institutional coherence 2 Vision for results Government infuence over investments Government action Investment outputs Investment outcomes Results Less direct More direct Private sector International community Civil society Long-term vision Link to SDGs Medium-term development plans Annual results plans Costed targets International private fnance Domestic private fnance Domestic public fnance International public fnance 5 Monitoring and evaluation 3 Overarching fnancing strategy 4 Financing policies for speci\ufb01c \ufb02ows 6 Accountability and dialogue Source: Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, AP-DEF, 2016107 1. Leadership and institutional coherence Leadership over financing strategies from the highest levels of government is necessary to bring all actors together with a common vision of how financing will contribute to results and drive forward implementation. In Malaysia a Performance Management and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU) was established in 2009 to implement key aspects of the National Transformation Plan. It was set up by the Prime Minister as a standalone team to ensure the delivery of key priorities for the government, using the Prime Minister\u2019s authority to find ways to overcome any challenges. With a focus on a limited number of headline priorities, PEMANDU has succeeded in ensuring delivery of projects across government. This success is derived in the authority it has from the Prime Minister, the defined set of priorities it works toward (it focuses on a small subset of the national development plan) and finding a balance between its top-down drive and feedback from colleagues in the implementing arms of government. In the Philippines two Cabinet-level committees, one of which is chaired by the President, review budget proposals for the annual development budget. They scrutinize the outputs of these proposals to ensure there is clear alignment to the medium-term plan.108 107 Asia-Pacific Development Effectiveness Facility, Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in the era of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda: Progress in Establishing Integrated National Financing Frameworks, UNDP AP-DEF, 2016. http://www.asia-pacific.undp. org/content/rbap/en/home/library/democratic_governance/achieving-the-sustainable-development-goals.html 108 Ibid. 51 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Such leadership is necessary for an integrated national financing framework if it is to effectively incorporate policies for all types of financing into a coherent overall system. Implementation involves ministries and agencies from across government working together with a clear sense of the overall direction and a shared understanding of delineated responsibilities and objectives. These ministries and agencies must understand the desired impacts from the finance they focus on and where their role fits in the larger picture. They must also have effective mechanisms for coordinating with each other. Sustainability in the private sector: maize farming in Thailand Charoen Pokphand Group is one of Thailand\u2019s largest companies and has played a leading role in developing and implementing sustainability principles in the private sector in Thailand. The company has installed \u20183-Benefit\u2019 sustainability principles that underpin its business models, by aiming to create benefits for the country, community and company.109 These include targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption by 10 percent, and to reach 100 percent responsibly sourced materials and supply chain management by 2020. The company has been an active member of the UN Global Compact since 2003. The company is Thailand\u2019s largest producer of poultry and as such also the largest purchaser of maize. Maize farming supports over 400,000 households in Thailand and over 5 million tonnes are produced annually.110 However certain practices in the industry have negatively impacted biodiversity, contributed to air pollution and contaminated water. Land degradation is a further issue, particularly farming on steep slopes in Thailand\u2019s mountainous northern areas. In response to this issue, Charoen Pokphand Group developed a policy of only purchasing maize that could be proven to have been grown on slopes with an incline of less than 30 degrees. The aim was to encourage farming on flatter land, thereby reducing the erosion and degradation of land on steeper slopes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57fe3453-3c50-44f0-87cf-fb7d71978a8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "57fe3453-3c50-44f0-87cf-fb7d71978a8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c063087660dfe8a872c9df1d63d32f160c176166b395bfbd6fe752bc3c88085c"}, "2": {"node_id": "77c3226d-9d0f-4aa5-ba95-3bea2126dce8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89444dab1db7a7e3d9bc924d683fd4f912e03eb8f04e0e33b792d17c11f7e694"}}, "hash": "cee974de27bcb2f8ad641731e1d2082be42864b529e9c83adf608d7149c251c5", "text": "While there were some problems with the initial implementation of this policy, which had been announced suddenly, the company is now working with the government and farmers to identify and move relevant farmers onto flatter land. 2.

Established in 1991, it has underpinned three 10-year plans and six medium-term plans. The challenges outlined in Vision 2020 have informed the priorities of the 10-year plans which in turn inform the strategic thrusts of the medium-term plan. Annual budgets are linked to the medium-term plan on a rolling two-year basis. This cascading planning hierarchy has produced a consistent foundation that is balanced with a system of mid-term reviews of the medium-term plans that allow for adjustments in the policy. The system is credited with playing an important role in driving the significant progress that Malaysia has achieved since Vision 2020 was established.112 Figure 4.2.

The Philippines has recently introduced its first ever long-term vision, AmBisyon Natin 2040, which will form a foundation for the existing system of six-year, term-based national development plans (Philippine Development Plans). The 2040 vision113 is the result of a consultative and participatory process which began in 2015, guided by an Advisory Council composed of representatives from government, private sector, academia and civil society, and led by the National Economic and Development Authority. Focus group discussions targeted at poor and marginalized groups were used to initiate the process and their results formed the basis of a survey that was shared across the country and to which around 10,000 people responded. Alongside identifying the aspirations of the Filipino people, the consultations sought to explore the means of implementation to achieve them. With support from the Asian Development Bank, thematic studies were undertaken to ascertain the constraints and possibilities of attaining the goal.114 112 UNDP, Integrating Sustainable Development Goals in Development Planning: Malaysia case study, UNDP, forthcoming 113 The long-term vision formulated in AmBisyon Natin 2040 is two-faceted; it includes both a vision of Filipinos for self and one for the country, slides 2 and 12 respectively. http://2040.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Realizing-the-Vision.pdf 114 FAQs: \u2018How did NEDA come up with AmBisyon Natin 2040?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1870457b-0ff6-451d-8cde-b2207f97885b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1870457b-0ff6-451d-8cde-b2207f97885b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2b17bf24241d66650d6f054f885d8f18366ab7f2cda5228ba9ef83277ec3bcf"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9995b8c-f3d0-4350-bb8d-190d373565d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c34e6b74facd70f988e42cfbfbd49519cc5e32a9abd67db9bde2e5a8312e553"}}, "hash": "1475bf45279d652206d1501f2ea20636278eb26a488ec2409090db0e33270a17", "text": "What was the process behind it?\u2019 and \u2018Were all stakeholders involved in the visioning process?\u2019 http://2040.neda.gov.ph/faqs/; http://2040.neda.gov.ph/2016/04/05/hello-world/ 53 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda These vision documents provide clarity about the longer-term sustainable development pathway that a country wants to follow and are crucially not just paper documents, but represent a shared understanding of and buy-in to a vision of the country\u2019s future. On this basis they can act as a foundation for policymaking over the short and medium term. They outline tangible results to strive toward and can provide a basis for balancing the trade-offs between competing priorities. The examples from Malaysia and Indonesia show how a long-term vision for results can cascade into medium and short-term planning, with greater detail at each level. The experience of the Philippines in establishing AmBisyon 2040 highlights the importance of building a shared sense of national priorities and ownership over the development plan. These examples may have relevance for countries whose development plans will be renewed in coming years or who want to deepen the ownership over their national development plan. 3.

It outlines the comparative advantages of each resource in the national context, and guides policymakers on which aspects of the national development plan it can contribute toward. It provides a basis for managing trade-offs between debt and non-debt instruments and addresses changes of a more structural nature that need to be implemented to unlock new sources of finance. No countries in the ASEAN region have established overarching financing strategies, though some countries are taking steps toward them or have established policies with elements that are useful for understanding the concept and how it could be applied more broadly \u2013 such as Indonesia\u2019s Green Planning and Budgeting Strategy. This aims to support more strategic management of the country\u2019s natural resources in order to move to a more sustainable economic growth model characterized by reduced pollution and natural resource degradation. The Green Planning and Budgeting Strategy presents a framework that offers insights into establishing a financing strategy that applies a wide range of financing types to a diverse set of policy challenges. It cuts across and relates to many of the objectives of Indonesia\u2019s medium-term development plan for 2015\u20132019. While it is not an overarching financing strategy for the medium-term plan as a whole, it relates to many important aspects of it, covering policy in areas from education to energy, urban planning and agriculture. The strategy envisages using an array of financing instruments and applying these to specified policy challenges (Figure 4.3). The financing instruments covered range from direct government expenditure to tax incentives, loan guarantees for finance institutions among others. These (alongside other policy instruments) are applied to 21 priorities under 6 policy clusters. Developing the Green Planning and Budgeting Strategy involved several steps. Initially estimates were made of the scale of the challenge and investments needed to address it.115 The most important policy and programme areas for the green economy overall were identified. A review of existing instruments was 115 Referred to in the policy as the \u2018green economy gap\u2019. Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 54 undertaken to understand the impact and leverage ratios116 that they offer.117 This was used to determine which instruments should be applied to each policy priority. Finally, sequencing of instruments was agreed, and the strategy emphasises public finance in the early stages of the policy, moving toward greater emphasis on leveraging private finance over time. In this way the strategy has clear parallels with the structure of an overarching financing strategy, which identifies the scale and types of investments needed across a national development plan as a whole. Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand have all developed estimates of the scale of financing needed to realize their medium-term (4\u20135 year) plans.118 These include varying degrees of detail on which to delineate responsibilities and objectives into targets and policies for different types of finance. The core features of an overarching financing strategy that would be new in most countries contexts can be summarized as: \u2022\ufffd Establishing long-term finance goals. A finance vision should also propose quantitative targets for mobilizing the resources needed to provide financial feasibility to the national development strategy. \u2022\ufffd Widening the scope of finance planning to cover both public and private resource mobilization. The vision should recognize that the resources to be mobilized may be public, for which government has direct control, and also private, where government may incentivize their development and align them with national priorities. \u2022\ufffd Projecting structural transformations. The long-term finance strategy should project the strategic transformation of the existing finance base and changes of the relative weight of individual flows in the economy (public and private, domestic and international), with the aim of mobilising a wider variety of resources, using them more efficiently or aligning them with national results. \u2022\ufffd \u2018Back-casting\u2019 and forecasting. The approach proposed is different and complementary to the macro framework forecasts currently in use that project current finance into the future. This additional procedure starts by \u2018backcasting\u2019119 from a desired status of the economy \u2013 the one that would provide general feasibility to the national plans \u2013 to the present state and defining the main stages in this process, key milestones and specific targets for individual finance flows. 116 The ratio by which public expenditures leverages or stimulates private expenditure or investment. 117 For the full methodology see Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia \u2018Green Planning & Budgeting Strategy for Indonesia\u2019s Sustainable Development 2015\u20132019\u2019, Ministry of Finance of Republic of Indonesia, 2015. http://fiskal.depkeu.go.id/pkppim/ en/public/2000/studies/download/GPB%20Update%202015.pdf 118 Source: Development Finance Assessment papers for each country respectively. 119", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa6dabef-4fa8-4344-85b1-874624d4b9f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa6dabef-4fa8-4344-85b1-874624d4b9f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18f97344fef08ed9b701eb44882e73349605bbf263ff53ccb39de830f1825fde"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4536604-4c20-4b7c-a3ab-0f7378cbc5b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95cc4b81c1fbed354d68bffca58d980cfc0e41e3612814dfea65a924539778a8"}}, "hash": "75eadf49b98e94654647409b02e5f2ec8d4f5836f8f26b1777f03041929d0bc4", "text": "A planning method that starts from the desired goal and works backwards to identify steps to connect the goal with the present. 55 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Figure 4.3: Priorities, financing instruments and responsibilities in Indonesia\u2019s Green Planning and Budgeting Strategy Priorities Policy Instruments Direct govt expendture Govt to firms, SOEs, CSOs Via finance institutions Regulatory controls and promotion Investment budget Recurrent budget Special allocations (Prov/Dist) Gants (investment/services) Operating subsidies (e.g. VGF) Data/information Tax incentives Interest rate subsidies Loan guarantee Loanable funds Licenses Price controls (incl.

Financing policies From the perspective of government, financing is raised, mobilized and catalysed, and spent and invested through a complex network of policies that are implemented by actors across government and its agencies. While an overarching financing strategy can provide guidance on the scale and types of investments to be mobilized, implementation happens through policies focused on individual types of finance. Different ministries and agencies, or the departments within them, specialize in particular types of finance. With such an array of resources and financing instruments that can contribute toward sustainable development, there are many such specialized units focused on extracting the maximum impact from the particular instruments they focus on. This presents a two-fold challenge for the integrated national financing framework. Government must design policies for each type of financing that are efficient in mobilising and maximising its impact. And it must build mechanisms to ensure coherence and alignment vertically, between policies and longer- term objectives, and horizontally, between policies focused on different types of financing. Domestic public There are two sides to policy governing domestic public finance: how funds are raised and how they are spent. On the revenue and financing side, governments raise revenue from taxes and non-tax income, through state-owned enterprises and natural resource royalties, and borrowing. On the spending side, the annual budget sets out government policies, programmes and public investments to be made (though the latter is sometimes laid out in a separate development budget). State-owned enterprises also raise revenue and invest and have a major impact on economic, social and environmental progress in many ASEAN countries. Revenue Revenue mobilization is critical to the impact public finance can have on sustainable development results. It provides the major source of funding for most ASEAN governments120 to provide services, infrastructure and investments for sustainable development. Yet beyond the volume of revenue, the way in which revenues are raised can impact the delivery of sustainable development objectives. Different types of taxation have varying impacts on the distribution of income in a country. In general indirect taxes are often more regressive than direct taxes, which are proportionate to the ability to pay (though the extent of progressivity depends crucially on the exact configuration of a particular direct or indirect tax policy). They can also create powerful incentives for private actors to behave or invest in a particular way; indeed many governments actively forego tax revenue in certain industries or locations to try and attract private investment. Yet in most instances tax or revenue authorities do not develop strategic plans beyond a short-term horizon \u2013 Malaysia and Cambodia are exceptions in the ASEAN region.121 And the performance 120 For 7 of the 10 ASEAN countries taxes accounted for most government income in 2015 (see chapter 2, domestic public finance section). 121 Asian Development Bank, A comparative analysis of tax administration in Asia and the Pacific: 2016, Asian Development Bank, 2016. https://www.adb.org/publications/comparative-analysis-tax-administration-asia-pacific-2016.

The strategy aims to achieve these reforms through a programme of strengthening the revenue administration, improving aspects of the policy framework and strengthening monitoring and evaluation. The indicators by which the strategy will be monitored are all revenue targets, meaning it will be difficult to understand the impacts of the policy and revenue collection in general on income distribution or other aspects of sustainable development. Timor-Leste\u2019s Petroleum Fund Timor-Leste124 has benefitted from strong management of its natural resource revenues by a sovereign wealth fund. It established the Petroleum Fund in 2005 to manage the revenues from its oil fields and act as a buffer between oil revenues, which fluctuate significantly with changes in global prices, and the fiscus. The fund invests the revenues it receives from oil extraction, generating a return on the more- than $16 billion worth of assets it had built up by 2015. On an annual basis the government withdraws an amount of money to fund government spending. An estimated sustainable income, equivalent to 3 percent of the value of the Petroleum Fund\u2019s assets125 sets the level of withdrawals that would be sustainable indefinitely.126 In practice the government has established a policy of frontloading which sees withdrawals above this level in the short term to fund investments that can stimulate economic diversification and growth in the medium to long term. Nevertheless the Petroleum Fund has successfully helped Timor-Leste manage its resource wealth and protect the budget from fluctuations in revenues as commodity prices rise and fall. Spending The extent to which public spending follows the objectives of the national development plan is critical to its realization, both because of the scale of public finance and because of its demonstration effects. If government is not clearly aligning its own investments with long-term objectives then other actors will be less inclined to do so either. In Malaysia, the government uses a review mechanism to ensure that budget spending is aligned to the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and, as of 2017, to the SDGs. During the budget preparation process, ministries submit their proposed costed projects to the Economic Planning Unit of the Prime Minister\u2019s Department 122 Asian Development Bank, A comparative analysis of tax administration in Asia and the Pacific: 2016, Asian Development Bank, 2016. https://www.adb.org/publications/comparative-analysis-tax-administration-asia-pacific-2016.

By influencing the business environment and creating incentives to invest in certain areas (geographic or sectoral), many governments aim to encourage and stimulate a private sector that can create jobs and drive growth, innovation and environmental sustainability.

In addition, the legislation creates tax incentives and other benefits for businesses that invest in the poorest regions, using a definition developed by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. The government is also considering opening up legislation to allow foreign investors to take stakes in domestic companies. In Thailand, the Board of Investment offers a similar incentive structure, known as the Merit on Decentralization.

The Ministry of National Development Planning (BAPPENAS), the planning Ministry and the Ministry of Finance share responsibilities in relation to PPPs. BAPPENAS is in charge of prioritising projects to be implemented through this funding modality, while the Ministry of Finance provides options for the financing schemes that can be offered to interested private sector actors \u2013 usually guarantees, viability gap funding or viability payments throughout the life of the project. Thus the process by which PPP projects are identified for implementation is to some extent linked to longer-term development plans, through the involvement of BAPPENAS, which is also responsible for managing the national development plan. But the framework that sets out the context in which PPPs are to be used does not directly relate to national development plans or broader financing processes. The Philippines has long had a programme of PPPs in the infrastructure sector (see chapter 2), yet is moving away from this model to one in which ODA and local finance are favoured in order to speed up implementation. International public The role and context of international public finance varies widely from country to country in the ASEAN region. In countries such as Lao PDR and Cambodia it accounts for a significant proportion of total resources, while in others it has declined in volume and is characterized by offering specific support or catalytic assistance in niche areas. Increasing South-South cooperation, the BRI and growing international climate finance are emerging trends. These contexts raise a range of policy challenges for governments looking to maximize the impact of international public finance and plan in advance of likely changes to its scale or composition. Cambodia is the third largest recipient of ODA in the ASEAN region, receiving an estimated $1.3 billion in 2015 (see chapter 2).131 The country has had significant success working with its development partners to align this development cooperation with the aims of its national development plan. The Development Cooperation and Partnership Strategy 2014\u20132018 has a primary objective of maximising the effectiveness and impact of development cooperation on the goals set out in the national development plan. It deploys four strategic tools to achieve this.132 Programme-based approaches emphasize comprehensive, coordinated planning among all partners in a given thematic area, within each technical working group. Results frameworks are encouraged in each group to strengthen the monitoring of outputs, outcomes and impact, beyond inputs and activities alone. A series of 20 joint monitoring indicators that are linked to the indicators of the national development plan is used to guide dialogue across the technical working groups.

These concerns featured alongside others in areas less directly related to financing, such as access to US and EU markets. To mitigate these risks the Samoan government developed a smooth transition strategy which built directly on its national development plan. A core feature of this strategy was a joint policy matrix which the government and most of its development partners agreed to use as the basis for performance-linked development cooperation. The strength of this matrix has helped ODA levels since graduation to remain stable, without a significant decline in grant financing and even an initial increase in general budget support. In parallel the government has been able to improve its fiscal position by rationalising spending and increasing revenue by 1.5 percent of GDP from 2014/15 to 2015/16. Over time it is likely that the grant\u2013loan mix of international public finance will shift but the strategy has helped to manage this transition and allow time for necessary wider adjustments. This experience may offer lessons for the ASEAN countries graduating from LDC status134 or managing other transitions such as the loss of eligibility for International Development Association funding. Following Thailand\u2019s \u2018graduation\u2019 to upper-middle-income country status in 2010,135 its access to international climate finance was reduced. International official climate finance fell from a peak of $590 million in 2009 to $26 million in 2014. Development partners shifted their approach away from providing large-scale finance toward providing technical assistance and supporting pilot projects designed to test and catalyse domestically-led climate initiatives. Thailand has relatively high volumes of domestic finance and capacity and there is strong national commitment to the sustainability agenda. This is rooted in the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy that underpins national planning and which played a role in influencing the international sustainable development agenda. Yet even in this context, the reduction of international climate finance has impacted the delivery of climate change initiatives. The government is in the process of establishing an on-budget climate fund which will be operational from 2019. Technical capacity is a larger constraint. Many of the initiatives previously funded internationally were supported by international expertise. Some technical cooperation continues and the government has developed a body of training, courses and qualifications. Yet it will take time to build a significant body of people with the technical knowledge and understanding to be able to drive forward climate adaptation and mitigation programmes on an increasing scale. 5. Monitoring and review In the Philippines, a series of results matrices are used to monitor progress against the medium-term plan and support a results-based management approach to implementation. The results matrices track indicators in a hierarchy. The top tier tracks progress against the headline target of the development plan, while indicators related to two intermediate goals sit below it.

The Eleventh Plan includes targets related to family incomes, as well as a \u2018Malaysian welfare index\u2019 that has been established to assess the impact of economic growth on the welfare of the population. Strong monitoring systems are an essential part of an effective approach to financing for sustainable development results. Such systems monitor financing itself, the outcomes it generates and the contribution those outcomes make toward sustainable development. They collect data on what is being invested, how, where, by whom and with what objectives. And they collect data on the outcomes that this finance generates and the contributions those outcomes make toward the sustainable development objectives of the national development plan. In this way an effective monitoring system will build up data, information and evidence over time that allows an understanding of what works and what does not. As such strong monitoring systems are conducive to more effective policymaking \u2013 policymakers can take more informed decisions about which types of financing instruments are best suited to a policy priority. And they are conducive to more targeted policymaking, which is informed by a more precise understanding of sustainable development trends and trajectories that enables more specific measures of success. Beyond the structure of a monitoring framework, the availability and quality of data for the indicators it includes is crucial to it success. In Myanmar the government is taking steps to strengthen transparency related to private finance. Under the new Myanmar Investment Law, domestic and international companies must report to the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration on a quarterly basis with investment data (focusing on job creation, the size of investment and machinery imports) and a full dataset will be available in 2018. This is a new process and will strengthen transparency and quality of data on investments and FDI. The central bank of the Philippines (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) has an advanced system for collecting data on remittances, which are a key feature of the Philippines\u2019 financing landscape. It publishes data monthly with flows disaggregated by the country from which they were sent and by the source (land- based, sea-based) of those funds. It has followed this data publication model since 1989. The Central Bank informs and maintains this database through the International Transaction Reporting System, which collects information on settlements and transactions between banks, enterprises and households.137 136 The six components are health, warm and loving family, community empowerment, democratic society with good governance, surroundings and ecological system, and economic strength and equity. 137 For more information see UN Statistical Division, \u2018General description and purpose of the international transactions reporting system\u2019, UN Stats, 2017. https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/M2CG/B.++General+description+and+purpose+of+the+internat ional+transactions+reporting+system Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 62 Monitoring frameworks and the policies they inform can only ever be as strong as the data and information on which they are based. These examples provide lessons for other countries in the region wanting to strengthen their own systems for collecting data and monitoring the contributions of financing to inform more effective policymaking. Climate budget tagging Climate budget tagging138 is a budget tool for monitoring and tracking climate-related expenditures in national budget systems. It establishes a system for gathering comprehensive data on climate-relevant spending that allows governments to make informed decisions and prioritize climate investments. It also has important transparency and accountability benefits, as it enables public scrutiny on government and donor spending toward addressing climate change issues. Such a system generally consists of four steps: defining then classifying climate activities, weighing their climate relevance and designing the tagging procedure. The Philippines mandated climate budget tagging in national budget submissions for all government entities in 2015, through its Climate Change Expenditure Tagging framework. This provides definitions of climate change and a common method for tagging and linking budget allocations and national climate policy priorities. For the 2015 budget, 53 national government agencies prioritized and tagged their budget proposals for climate change spending. The Philippines then piloted climate tagging in its Annual Investment Plan for local government units before scaling up to all units in 2016. Since 2014, Indonesia has used mitigation budget tagging in key ministries to track resources spent to achieve the national emission reduction target of 26 percent by 2020.139 This has been implemented through its Low Emission Budget Tagging and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f260f84f-d475-4e6e-8f02-1dc306b1c219": {"__data__": {"id_": "f260f84f-d475-4e6e-8f02-1dc306b1c219", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f26fc3dd127c9d6fcfa21a45f5ee8e61b02923e2aea1e380fece853677fd79e"}, "3": {"node_id": "c92618b9-4e27-4881-9b44-bb5d622e63e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4385cecea0740ca0a25ee39787fa1ebe183e8142d47dc28040cb75a0f3e0bda0"}}, "hash": "e8e4bbac5c33558aaf41500b06e55afa1fb365192a8691c2d10fb5ce0341e3f1", "text": "Scoring System (\u2018LESS\u2019), which was also implemented in three central provinces to pilot mitigation expenditure tagging at the local level.

This expenditure tagging gives clarity on what resources are being used, improving the governments\u2019 ability to achieve climate-related targets. 6. Accountability and dialogue To effectively mobilize the financing and contribution of a wide range of actors toward sustainable development requires strong dialogue on priorities, challenges and progress with those actors. In Malaysia, the Prime Minister\u2019s delivery unit, PEMANDU, developed an innovative system of \u2018Labs\u2019 to design and build shared ownership around key deliverables within the country\u2019s 10-year National Transformation Programme. These consultative processes involve a range of actors who work together over a 6-to-9-week timeframe to design actionable policy objectives and key performance indicators that speed up progress toward the objectives of the National Transformation Plan. Their outputs become official policy and have successfully developed a sense of shared ownership around these key actions. 138 This box is informed by the report UNDP, Climate Budget Tagging, Country-driven initiative in tracking climate expenditure, UNDP, 2015. https://www.climatefinance-developmenteffectiveness.org/sites/default/files/documents/27_08_15/4%20Climate%20 Budget%20Tagging%20_Draft.pdf 139 This target is articulated in Indonesia\u2019s National Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (\u2018RAN GRK\u2019). 63 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda In Myanmar a Private Sector Development Committee has been established to coordinate dialogue between the government and private sector. It is a platform for structured dialogue and played a role in creating key private sector development policies including the Private Sector Development Framework and Action Plan (2016) and the Myanmar Investment Law (2017). In Lao PDR, a roundtable process is used to facilitate coordination between government and development partners. The process has evolved around the cycle of five-year national plans and has adapted to the changing global focus on aid and development effectiveness. Over time the process has deepened, moving from a focus on mobilising resources to incorporate advocacy and knowledge sharing toward more holistic discussions about policy with a wider range of actors, including participants from the private sector and non-profit associations. The process is structured around annual meetings that take stock of progress achieved toward the National Socio-Economic Development Plan and set priorities for the coming year, with 10 sector working groups that convene more regularly. It is co-chaired by government and development partners. The examples from Malaysia, Myanmar and others show how countries can establish and configure platforms for dialogue with non-governmental actors. Effective participatory processes for dialogue are essential for building the trust and shared ownership needed to mobilize contributions from stakeholders outside government and ensure that financing strategies are designed and delivered effectively. Dialogue is important for refining government\u2019s understanding about the real constraints to greater private investment, for example, and for developing realistic objectives about what levels and types of investments may be possible. For private or international actors outside government it helps to build an understanding of government\u2019s priorities and ability to act in addressing different challenges. Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver sustainable development results The overarching challenge for governments on financing is to develop a policy and institutional structure that can cohesively mobilize and stimulate investments from a diverse range of actors, while working to maximize the impact of each one on sustainable development outcomes and ensuring the synergies between them are identified and leveraged. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda calls for countries to establish integrated national financing frameworks to help them achieve this. All ASEAN countries are making progress in establishing and strengthening the building blocks of an integrated national financing framework, yet there are also areas for all countries where further reforms could strengthen the system as a whole. The extent of leadership and coordination over financing within government varies widely. In many cases there are mechanisms for managing public finance investments in sustainable development, but there are few examples of this extending to policy toward private sector development. Most countries have clear visions for results in national development plans, but the degree of understanding and consensus about them among key stakeholders differs markedly.

Finally, platforms Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 64 for public\u2013private dialogue could be strengthened in most contexts as a means for developing more responsive and targeted policy for stimulating impactful private sector development. Building on these findings about the strength of integrated national financing frameworks, the following chapter applies the lens to two key policy areas for the SDGs: leaving no one behind and private sector development. The report then closes with recommendations about how to improve integrated national financing frameworks and take steps to mobilize finance for the SDGs in the region. 65 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Chapter 5: Integrated national financing frameworks for key policy areas Previous chapters have shown the scale and complexity of the sustainable development challenges that countries face as well as the finance that is or could be available to address those challenges. Using the lens of an integrated national financing framework, the report has examined the policies and institutional structures that governments have in place to manage their financing strategies. This chapter focuses on two issues at the heart of the Financing for Development Agenda and the 2030 Agenda \u2013 leaving no one behind and stimulating private sector development. Leaving no one behind is an imperative of the global agenda and needs concurrent progress on a number of issues, thereby requiring an integrated financing response. The way the private sector develops will be an important factor in determining progress across many aspects of the 2030 Agenda. These two issues are of major significance and thereby warrant further analysis in their right. Hence this chapter shows how the lens of an integrated financing framework can be applied to specific policy priorities to analyse their comprehensiveness and integration into the wider financing framework. Private sector development Mobilising the right scale and kinds of private sector development will significantly impact many countries\u2019 progress toward the SDGs. The private sector can create jobs, drive innovation and develop skills and capacity. It thus has a far-reaching impact on society and the environment. Attracting and stimulating the private investment that leads to progress in these areas is therefore a central financing challenge for governments. Leadership and institutional coherence are especially important for policy toward private sector development, given the range of policy areas that influence the business environment. Cambodia launched its Industrial Development Policy in 2015. The policy aims to stimulate high levels of sustainable and inclusive growth, particularly in manufacturing and rural development. It builds on lessons from the success of the \u2018rice policy\u2019140 introduced by the Prime Minister in 2010.141 This was characterized by a clearer focus, greater degree of coordination and higher-level leadership than previous policies. It had a headline target for the paddy surplus to \u201creach over 4 million tonnes a year\u2026and at least one million tonnes of rice for export\u201d. Strategically, it focused on particular communities rather than spreading resources too thinly and was clearly associated with the leadership and authority of the Prime Minister, whose office directly supervised its implementation by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.142 The rice policy did not fully achieve the ambitious headline target but succeeded in making significant progress toward it \u2013 in 2016, 542 tonnes of milled rice was exported to 26 countries. Some challenges and bottlenecks that 140 Formally the \u2018Policy on the Promotion of Paddy Production and Rice Export\u2019 but commonly called \u2018the rice policy\u2019. 141 The Role of Development Finance in Economic Transformation: Cambodia\u2019s Industrial Development Policy and the Modernisation of the Rural Economy, 2017, forthcoming. 142 UNDP, Building Integrated National Financing Frameworks: A compendium of country experiences, UNDP, 2017, forthcoming. Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 66 were faced in implementing the policy, such as a shortage of capital and high energy prices, pointed to the need for a more comprehensive approach to the rural economy that considers wider aspects of the business environment. The Industrial Development Policy was designed to build on this experience, and innovates further in particular by bringing together some of the more structural reforms that affect private sector development under a single policy. The breadth of the vision that governments have for private sector development is important for developing holistic policies that maximize its impact on all aspects of sustainable development. The way in which the private sector develops impacts on many aspects of social progress and environmental sustainability, as well as on economic development.

Thailand, for example, has recently launched a new economic model, \u2018Thailand 4.0\u2019, in which the private sector has a central role. It targets the development of 10 \u2018future industries.\u2019143 In doing so it aims to overcome three identified \u2018traps\u2019 the country faces \u2013 an economic middle-income trap, a social inequality trap and an environmental imbalanced trap. While it is an economic policy with private sector development at its core, its four objectives cut across the dimensions of sustainable development. The goal of reaching economic growth of 5\u20136 percent within five years sits alongside targets to leave no one behind by reducing inequality, raise Thailand\u2019s Human Development Index ranking to be among the top 50 countries in the world and become a liveable, low-carbon society with an economic system capable of adjusting to climate change.144 Explicitly recognising these wider impacts and articulating targets related to society and the environment provides a broader foundation on which more holistic policy toward private sector development can be created. Governments develop and implement a wide range of policies and projects to try to directly or indirectly stimulate private investment. Improving the business environment is often a central concern and may involve interventions from reducing the bureaucracy around business registration and reporting to improving infrastructure to boost access to markets and supply chains. Special economic zones are used throughout the ASEAN region, and increasingly at a sub-regional level, with countries collaborating on zones to boost regional value chains (see box). And an increasing number of countries are using PPPs as a way to directly mobilize private investments. Improving the business environment is a key way that governments aim to reduce the cost of setting up or doing business, thereby making investments more attractive. Malaysia has established two bodies to help with this. A Special Task Force to Facilitate Business (\u2018PEMUDAH)\u2019 is a joint effort between the government and the private sector that aims to improve regulatory frameworks, reduce business licensing requirements and encourage the use of IT by government agencies. The National SME [small and medium- sized enterprise] Development Council, which is chaired by the Prime Minister, builds on targets in the national development plan (Eleventh Malaysia Plan) to increase the contribution of SMEs to GDP. It formulates a range of policies and strategies to facilitate the overall development of SMEs. 143 Five of these build on existing industries, improving innovation and research and development, while the other five are new industries, which are higher value-added and focused on more advanced technology. 144 Royal Thai Embassy, Washington DC, \u2018What is Thailand 4.0?\u2019 http://thaiembdc.org/thailand-4\u20130-2/. 67 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Special economic zones Many countries in the region use special economic zones (SEZ) as part of their policies to attract private investment, particularly as part of strategies to stimulate and accelerate industrial development. While each SEZ framework differs, they generally aim to improve competitiveness by providing investment incentives, enhanced infrastructure and an improved business climate. In general, SEZ programmes aim to upgrade and diversify the industrial export base of the economy and stimulate human capital development over the long term, while creating jobs over the shorter term. This is achieved by attracting export-oriented investment, with an historic focus on processing manufacturing. However, many countries are using SEZs now to expand into wider industries. For example, agro-processing is seen as an important objective in Cambodia, Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia; IT services in the Philippines; electronics in Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand; and high-technology in Malaysia. While the objectives of SEZs are rarely articulated in relation to the SDGs, there are clear links to SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, and SDG 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure. There are also implicit links to a number of SDGs, in particular SDGs 1 and 12 (zero poverty and responsible consumption and production). While SEZs are often discussed with overarching objectives in mind, tangible or quantifiable objectives are rarely stated. The financing of SEZs differs between countries, and both publicly and privately developed zones exist in the region. In Cambodia, the Philippines and Viet Nam, zones are largely privately developed, while Thailand and Lao PDR have both public and private zones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "295174c0-cb33-4fb8-946b-808ace0666a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "295174c0-cb33-4fb8-946b-808ace0666a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1048d2b20dcddfdc350b4e0eaf4ecac97e81d19cca5af2f9f77ac922b7ccea67"}, "2": {"node_id": "51b7166e-d4bc-4b9d-866a-329fb0a16ea1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83d42d0c9bef067b279929558939c7ded7a003dabc00eaacfb7e909e75c9efe4"}}, "hash": "df51dfcf7bc982200300a09279a6739456cf42f7302ea2dbe9da45cab863a219", "text": "With respect to public responsibility for SEZs, three roles in particular are significant: public development and operation of zones; public administration and regulation of privately-run zones; and public external infrastructure investment external to zones.

While a share of the operating costs can be expected to be covered by service charges and fees, it is rare that these will cover the overall ongoing costs of operation. The balance of financing between central and local government is also rarely published. In other countries the extent of public investment is unclear, especially around external infrastructure provision. The monitoring and evaluation of SEZs across the ASEAN region is largely internalized. The most frequently reported statistics focus on three main categories: public investment, foreign direct investment and investment outcomes, typically limited to employment and exports. While these provide overviews of the performance of zones, they tend not to be reported consistently; few zone programmes provide annual reports. Public monitoring and evaluation efforts are likely to be reduced by the long-term nature of SEZs, given the estimated 5-to-10-year incubation period145 and the volatile and unpredictable nature of investment. Many SEZs in the region do however involve certain stakeholders in ongoing monitoring efforts. Private sector representatives are frequently members of the committees responsible for zone performance. For example, in the Philippines the board of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority has one labour and one investor/business representative on a board of 13 people. Yet in a wider context, 145 Farole T, Special Economic Zones in Africa: Comparing Performance and Learning from Global Experience, The World Bank, 2011. Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 68 there is significant room for improvement in incorporating civil society actors and concerns within zone operation. On a regional level, SEZs offer opportunities but also risks. They have already begun to be used in efforts to promote cross-border cooperation through the use of border zones. One example is the use of SEZs in supporting sub-regional projects, such as those used in the Greater Mekong Subregion where SEZs are strategically located along designated economic corridors.146 By reducing frictions to trade, SEZs also enable improved integration in regional production networks; indeed, continuing to deepen these remains an explicit objective of a number of SEZ programmes. However, the use of SEZs does come with risks as cross-border competition for investment is often seen as a zero-sum game. Cross-border cooperation in the context of SEZ frameworks is thus essential for the future. Many ASEAN countries have PPP programmes or are establishing them. They are typically used to mobilize private finance into investments in areas such as infrastructure, which are often themselves part of wider strategies to attract greater private investment by improving the ease of doing business. While countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have established PPP programmes, others such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Lao PDR are in the earlier stages of establishing or exploring the potential to set PPP programmes. Systems for monitoring the success of private sector development strategies and the contribution of private sector development toward national priorities are generally less developed. In Lao PDR, the monitoring framework for the national plan, the 8th National Socio-Economic Development Plan, includes indicators to track private sector development. These include monitoring the volumes of FDI and other investment projects as well as certain indicators of the quality of investments linked to financial, economic and environmental impact assessments. Yet there are issues with data collection. Many other countries in the region do not directly incorporate monitoring of financing beyond government finance in their central monitoring frameworks in a way that enables understanding of their contribution to national results. Some countries have established formal mechanisms for public\u2013private dialogue. In Cambodia, the Government-Private Sector Forum has been supporting public\u2013private dialogue since 1999. Launched by the Prime Minister with support from the International Finance Corporation, the forum enables private sector actors to raise and resolve problems with the Government of Cambodia and discuss both long-term policy issues and day-to-day operations to support private sector development. It is coordinated by eight business associations and the Chamber of Commerce. The forum has been credited147 with driving forward reforms to improve the business environment, yet the private sector requires further strengthening of its advocacy capacity, coordination and analytical skills. Lao PDR established its Lao Business Forum, which is chaired by the Prime Minister, over a decade ago. Myanmar has recently established a forum for public\u2013private dialogue, while Indonesia has an informal platform that was initiated by the private sector. 146 Asian Development Bank, Role of Special Economic Zones in Improving Effectiveness of GMS Economic Corridors, GMS Secretariat, Asian Development", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f286672f-a88d-4b1e-987f-1798a1f8e669": {"__data__": {"id_": "f286672f-a88d-4b1e-987f-1798a1f8e669", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f4313068b7711d745092bc8ade631a8c08f42a1a4a10e36053e9237809dfbdd"}}, "hash": "8f4313068b7711d745092bc8ade631a8c08f42a1a4a10e36053e9237809dfbdd", "text": "Bank, 2016. 147 World Bank, Review of World Bank Group Support to Structured Public-Private Dialogue for Private and Financial Sector Development, World Bank, 2009. 69 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda Private sector development offers significant potential to contribute to and be a driving force behind progress in many aspects of the 2030 Agenda. To realize this governments can take steps to enhance and broaden their policy toward private investment and integrating this area of policy within the wider integrated national financing framework. Some countries are starting to explicitly plan for the impact of private sector development on a wider range of sustainable development outcomes and some are taking steps to bring together interventions into a single policy framework under senior leadership. Countries are establishing a range of policies to attract or stimulate private investment, though some policy areas, such as SEZs, could be strengthened by deepening their integration into wider national planning. Monitoring and evaluation systems, as well as dialogue platforms, could be strengthened in many cases. Leaving no one behind Leaving no one behind is a fundamental imperative of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It cuts across all aspects of the agenda as it is the poorest and most vulnerable people who typically benefit least from growth and who are most exposed to its risks. It is a complex and overlapping imperative that cannot be simplified into a single sector as the most vulnerable people often face multiple, interlinked deprivations (see chapter 2). Leaving no one behind is therefore a wide-ranging policy agenda and as such this section looks at examples of relevant policies from the region rather than attempting a comprehensive overview of the financing challenges for leaving no one behind. It applies the lens of the integrated national financing framework to these examples. On national visions for results, while localization of the SDGs is still in its earlier stages, explicit commitments to leaving no one behind are just beginning to feature in national development plans as they are refreshed and renewed.148 Nevertheless all countries have priorities whose objectives relate directly to leaving no one behind and which will contribute to advancing the agenda in practice. In Indonesia such principles are mainstreamed throughout the national development vision, plans, programmes and processes. Three of the priorities in the government\u2019s nine-priority agenda \u2018NAWA CITA\u2019 relate to leaving no one behind149 and align to the equity pillar150 of the five-year plan. Specific programmes also reflect government\u2019s integration of this principle in its approach to poverty and inequality reduction. These include the national health insurance scheme, which provides health insurance for the poor; the Conditional Cash Transfers programme; and the new rural electrification programme, which aims to improve access to electricity across the whole country. Elsewhere, in Malaysia and Thailand, there is a strong commitment to the poorest 40 percent of people \u2013 both countries have established headline targets to raise the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of people by 15 percent. No countries have a holistic financing strategy for leaving no one behind, given the wide ranging and cross-cutting nature of interventions in this area. Yet countries are considering and adapting their financing models in key aspects of their policy response. This section looks at two examples: efforts to implement universal health coverage and an innovative use of PPPs designed to reach the poorest people. 148 For example, the Thailand 4.0 policy launched in 2017 makes reference to leaving no one behind under the social well-being heading, see: http://thaiembdc.org/thailand-4\u20130-2/ 149 The three priorities are headed \u2018Developing Indonesia\u2019s rural areas\u2019, \u2018Improve quality of life\u2019 and \u2018Strengthening the spirit of \u2018unity in diversity\u2019 and social reform\u2019. 150 This is one of three pillars of the five-year plan: \u2018RPJMN 2015\u20132019\u2019. One of the macro targets of the plan is to reduce the Gini index from 0.41 in 2014 to 0.36 in 2019. Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 70 Universal health coverage Universal health coverage is one important aspect of social protection that, when achieved, disproportionately benefits the poorest people in society and therefore makes an important contribution toward leaving no one behind. As in other areas of social protection, the design and configuration of the financing model used affects how successfully the policy reaches the poorest people, expands the range of services on offer and reduces the costs they face.

Myanmar has recently introduced a new National Health Plan that promotes universal healthcare. Thailand introduced its universal coverage system funded primarily by taxation in 2001. This replaced a subsidized voluntary contributory health insurance system. The contributory scheme had been characterized by challenges around the collection and enforcement of contributions, particularly from the informal sector. Importantly it was significantly less progressive than the new one.152 Coverage of the population was lower: as Thailand moved to a system funded by taxation, coverage increased from under 70 percent of the population in 2001 to over 90 percent in 2002. By 2012, 99.8 percent of the population was covered,153 and the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures reduced. Public finance is a key driver of increased access to health care for the poorest and most vulnerable people, as well as an emerging middle class that still struggles to afford private healthcare. This highlights again the central importance of sufficient levels of domestic revenue mobilization for achieving the SDGs. Public finance allows risk to be pooled across an entire population as opposed to the proportion that contributes to a health scheme; or it can provide the funds to increase coverage of those outside contributory systems (as is the case in Singapore). This is vital for reaching people who work in the informal economy. Evidence shows that systems driven by private sources of financing are often characterized by households foregoing care, or facing the risks of catastrophic health expenditures.154 Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam have social health insurance systems which are based on contributions or mixed systems based on contributions combined with full or partial subsidies for the poorest people or other groups such as young children.155 Coverage ranges from around 60 percent in Indonesia and Viet Nam to just over 80 percent in the Philippines.156 Steps are being 151 International Labour Organization, The state of social protection in ASEAN at the dawn of integration, ILO, 2015. http://www.ilo. org/jakarta/whatwedo/publications/WCMS_428982/lang \u2013 en/index.htm 152 International Labour Office, \u2018Thailand\u2019s Universal Health-care Coverage Scheme\u2019 profile. http://www.social-protection.org/ gimi/gess/RessourcePDF.action;jsessionid=SGhFYGBKtvwXThkGDMdjnZ4GTp9RgsJW79ySxv62rpnCRn95xJV3!79209976?re ssource.ressourceId=54059 153 Ibid. 154 World Health Organization, Raising revenues for health in support of UHC: strategic issues for policy makers, WHO, 2015. http:// www.who.int/health_financing/documents/revenue_raising/en/ 155 This is the case in Viet Nam, for example.

Hence the data collection and management system is designed to ensure that all poor households are recorded and eligible for access to social protection programmes. While there is scope to improve the process and integrate its use more widely across government, the database itself is an important step to ensuring that no one is left behind. Without knowing who and where the poor are, and what their needs are, it is not possible to understand if people are being left behind or provide support for those most in need. Leaving no one behind is a cross-cutting challenge that will require the right scale and adaptation of financing models across a wide range of sustainable development policy. These examples highlight something of the way in which it can be mainstreamed across development visions, examples of how financing models can be adapted to reach the poorest and most vulnerable people, and the role of disaggregated data in monitoring. 157 85% of revenues goes toward funding universal health care, upgrading medical facilities and training medical professionals.

Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 72 PART IV \u2013 RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations and follow-up ASEAN countries are making rapid progress in many areas of sustainable development but face significant challenges ahead in achieving the 2030 Agenda. Mobilising the right scale and mix of finance, and ensuring that the synergies between different flows are leveraged, will be essential. This report has examined the challenges and opportunities that the finance landscape in ASEAN presents and the policy and institutional structures that governments have in place to manage their approach to financing. It has identified a range of recommendations that could be implemented to strengthen the ability of countries and the region to mobilize and maximize the impact of finance on sustainable development results. Recommendations to mobilize greater volumes of finance \u2022\ufffd Establish a regional code of conduct for competition on tax incentives to avoid unnecessary harmful competition and losses of tax revenue Countries in the region often compete with one another to attract foreign investments in key industries. One aspect of this competition is offering investors generous terms on their taxation via lower corporation tax rates or tax breaks and holidays. This can often be a harmful practice, while evidence shows that taxation is not typically a primary reason for investors to choose a destination, with taxation coming behind factors such as the business environment, infrastructure, utilities and skills in many surveys.159 Yet it can cost governments significant volumes of foregone revenue. This report recommends exploring the potential to establish an ASEAN code of conduct to reduce the harmful element of intra-regional tax competition. Such a code would be agreed at the regional level to remove this element of competition from all countries competing for investors that want to locate in the region. It could cover the most harmful elements of tax competition and be designed to remove this competition from within ASEAN without lowering the competitiveness of ASEAN countries relative to competitors elsewhere in Asia and beyond. Other regions have developed or are developing similar guidelines. The EU established a code of conduct for business taxation in 1997 that recognises the benefits of many aspects of tax competition, but also established a framework for removing tax practices that were identified as harmful.160 The criteria for potentially harmful tax competition measures include: effective levels of taxation which are significantly lower than the general level in the country concerned; tax benefits reserved for non-residents; tax incentives for activities which are isolated from the domestic economy and therefore have no impact on the national tax base; granting of tax advantages even in the absence of any real economic activity; the basis of profit determination for companies in a multinational group that departs from internationally accepted rules, in particular those approved by the OECD; and lack of transparency. More recently, the East African Community has developed a draft code of conduct against harmful tax competition. This code will freeze the current provision of harmful tax incentives 159 See for example Farole T, Special Economic Zones in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f23daf3-a491-4790-97ce-551d45b56d16": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f23daf3-a491-4790-97ce-551d45b56d16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fca20f35c039d92ff50b92ac465498561786de51b5f02f86ce3722ea797b809b"}, "3": {"node_id": "46d17f34-3e46-4b85-80ce-7f4c4b5dfb5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0838c2264de27481d2b1c9f69ce89c8d2dc7341a1dd8243908e941e32745f813"}}, "hash": "676f1d63975b003695204249d95e93852c192cdb7f839b9fcf9cf37ebcd4ad9b", "text": "Africa: Comparing Performance and Learning from Global Experiences, World Bank, 2011. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/2268/600590PUB0ID181onomic09780821386385. pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y; Asian Development Bank, The Role of Special Economic Zones in Improving Effectiveness of GMS Economic Corridors. 2013, Asian Development Bank, Mandaluyong City, Philippines, 2016. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional- document/214316/role-sez-gms.pdf; and UN Industrial Development Organization, Africa Investor Report 2011: Toward evidence-based investment promotion strategies, UNIDO, 2011. https://www.unido.org/fileadmin/user_media/Publications/Pub_free/AIS_Report_A4.pdf 160 See European Commission, \u2018Harmful tax competition\u2019. http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/ harmful-tax-competition_en 73 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda so new ones are not introduced. Six countries161 are members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework which includes actions on harmful tax practices and a process whereby incentives offered by these countries will be reviewed by a Forum on Harmful Tax Practice to ensure a level playing field internationally. ASEAN countries are active in their competition with one another for attracting foreign investments.162 There may be benefits to much of this competition, if it creates incentives that help drive forward improvements in infrastructure and services, for example. Yet aspects of this competition are a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 in which increasingly generous tax incentives are offered with significant cost in terms of lost revenues. Establishing a region-wide code of conduct, perhaps building on the BEPS initiative which six countries are already committed to, could help remove this practice. \u2022\ufffd Strengthen the capacity of tax authorities to raise revenue with support from Tax Inspectors Without Borders The ability to develop, implement and enforce effective tax policy is limited by low capacity in tax or revenue authorities in some countries. This has an impact on the revenues that countries are able to collect. In 2015 the OECD and UNDP launched the Tax Inspectors Without Borders initiative to meet the need in many countries for capacity building support. Two countries in the region, Cambodia and Viet Nam, are already engaging with the initiative; others could consider doing so too. \u2022\ufffd Reduce the cost of sending intra-regional remittances to 5 percent or less Remittances play an important role in many communities across ASEAN and intra-regional migration is rising. Yet the cost of sending remittances varies considerably between different corridors in the region, from less than 3 percent in some to more than 14 percent in others. At the regional level, ASEAN countries could commit as a group to reduce the cost to a maximum of 5 percent (without increasing costs where they are currently lower than 5 percent). Among the top five corridors where costs currently exceed 5 percent alone, this could save migrants over $240 million a year. This commitment would be in line with a similar commitment made by the G20 in 2014.163 \u2022\ufffd Establish a regional framework for coordinating to reduce illicit finance Illicit finance is a major drain on resources, impacting public revenues and reducing investment levels. Some countries in the region have signed up to international initiatives such as the base erosion and profit shifting initiative. Yet not all ASEAN countries are active in this agenda and implementation of measures to reduce illicit finance is at an early stage. To expedite this and broaden coverage across the region, ASEAN countries could consider a regional agreement to implement certain measures such as the automatic exchange of tax information and sharing of country-by-country reports within the region as a first step. Recommendations to maximize the impact of specific types of finance on sustainable development outcomes \u2022\ufffd Establish monitoring/targets that link private investment to its impacts on all aspects of sustainable development Private investment has important contributions to make toward sustainable development beyond just the economic gains and job creation that are typically targeted and monitored.

Other countries could learn from Cambodia\u2019s approach toward its Industrial Development Policy in this regard. \u2022\ufffd Develop a jointly managed monitoring framework for the 2030 Vision of China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership, and ensure this aligns with ASEAN regional and national priorities The recent agreement to develop a joint vision for the China-ASEAN strategic partnership to 2030 and work toward two-way investment between China and ASEAN to $150 billion will offer significant sources of additional finance for infrastructure and other aspects of sustainable development. The agreement included the establishment of a vision document that would frame many aspects of the relationship. Building a strong, jointly managed monitoring framework into this agreement would be a key way to monitor and maximize the impact of this financing, ensuring it is invested effectively. ASEAN counterparts should work with China to ensure this vision and the implementation of the BRI in ASEAN aligns with regional and national development plans and infrastructure strategies. The joint vision for 2030 could also consider measures to channel investment to the ASEAN countries most in need of infrastructure and other investment. \u2022\ufffd Monitor and set targets for the sustainable development impact of revenue mobilization strategies The way that revenue is mobilized has important impacts on sustainable development beyond just raising funds for government to invest. The progressivity and sustainability of different revenue models can impact income distribution significantly. It can also create incentives that affect the way businesses and other actors operate which in turn may impact on sustainable development outcomes. As a first step, revenue authorities should establish mechanisms for monitoring the impact of their tax models on income distribution and other aspects of sustainable development, and incorporating this into monitoring systems for national development plans. Countries may also want to consider establishing explicit targets for this wider impact that sit alongside more common targets focused on raising certain amounts of revenue. Ultimately some governments may want to adjust the mandate of their revenue authorities to combine responsibility for raising revenue with managing the impact of revenue models on sustainable development. \u2022\ufffd Plan ahead for reductions in international concessional finance As countries graduate from LDC status or lose eligibility to borrow from multilaterals such as the International Development Association, the reduction in international concessional finance can affect investment and service delivery. This is true even in upper-middle-income contexts such as Thailand, related to international climate finance. Building the case and political consensus to allocate domestic public finance to areas previously funded internationally is one key challenge. Having sufficient domestic technical capacity can be another significant constraint. It can take years to build up a critical mass of people domestically with the relevant knowledge and experience to be able to drive forward an agenda where international experts previously played an important role. Countries should plan ahead for likely reductions in international concessional finance and in particular 75 Strengthening integrated national financing frameworks to deliver the 2030 Agenda should work with development partners in the short term to put in place any education, skills development programme or other interventions that will make the transition smoother once it does happen. Recommendations to strengthen integrated national financing frameworks \u2022\ufffd Estimate the cost of national development plans Few countries have estimated the cost of their national development plans and where estimates of the scale of resources required exist they are typically based on a projection of existing resource trends into the future. Establishing broad estimates of the resources \u2013 the investments and ongoing spending \u2013 needed to realize the vision of a national development plan is an important basis for a structured approach to mobilising the necessary scale and mix of resources. Such estimates should account for the synergies and trade-offs between investments in interconnected areas of sustainable development. \u2022\ufffd Develop clearer long-term plans about the scale and mix of resources needed to realize national development plans in an overarching financing strategy An overarching financing strategy is a critical component of an integrated national financing framework as it provides a foundation on which to implement policies related to each type of finance. Based on estimates of the cost of the investments required to realize a national development plan (see previous recommendation), the financing strategy provides guidance about the mix and scale of resources that government should aim", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "901be13d-a1e7-4f46-b28d-9267c35c5cc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "901be13d-a1e7-4f46-b28d-9267c35c5cc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2972a4afbb8ba17ba3130ed78d46b5695e47bc10c3cdcbcdca6387e0bbe3299"}}, "hash": "c2972a4afbb8ba17ba3130ed78d46b5695e47bc10c3cdcbcdca6387e0bbe3299", "text": "to mobilise. It outlines the finance instruments that will be used and the comparative advantages of all instruments and resources in different aspects of the national plan. It provides a foundation for managing trade-offs and balances, for example between debt and non- debt based instruments. And it addresses changes of a more structural nature that may need to be implemented to unlock new sources of finance. \u2022\ufffd Integrate finance into central monitoring and evaluation systems Finance is an important driver of sustainable development results, yet few countries have monitoring systems that are capable of tracking the outputs and outcomes generated by different types of finance. To fully understand the contribution that different types of finance, or different finance instruments, make toward the SDGs, countries could incorporate stronger and more comprehensive indicators that monitor the impact of all resources. For example, some countries have hierarchical monitoring frameworks that link government policy and programme outputs to outcomes, and outcomes to headline national development targets. Incorporating finance into such frameworks, and ensuring the scope is wide enough to monitor the impact of private finance as well as public, could help governments to better understand the contributions that different finance instruments can make. \u2022\ufffd Establish stronger platforms for dialogue with non-state actors Dialogue is essential for building the trust and shared ownership between government and its partners. Establishing platforms for systematic dialogue with partners \u2013 business, civil society, development partners and others \u2013 about the roles they can play in national sustainable development, and about how government can support them, is an important way to build consensus and mobilize the contributions of different actors. Dialogue is important for refining government\u2019s understanding of the real constraints to greater private investment, for example, and for developing realistic objectives about what levels and types of investments may be possible. For private or international actors outside government, it helps to build an understanding of government\u2019s priorities and ability to act in addressing different challenges. Financing the SuStainable Development goalS in aSean 76 \u2022\ufffd Complete full development finance assessment processes The development finance assessment and integrated financing solutions process has been designed to help governments identify areas for strengthening their management of all resources for the SDGs, using the lens of the integrated national financing framework. The development finance assessment offers a \u2018big picture\u2019 perspective that aggregates and assesses analysis across all types of finance and the policy and institutional structures used to govern them. This can be followed by ongoing support for priority reforms designed to generate and realign resources, avoid future expenditures, deliver better and strengthen transparency and accountability.164 Regional mechanisms to facilitate knowledge sharing \u2022\ufffd Establish an ASEAN integrated national financing framework peer review mechanism All countries in the region have lessons they can share about their finance policies and institutional structures \u2013 and could learn from the experience and knowledge of their regional neighbours. There is strong demand for the knowledge sharing that a peer review mechanism could support (see box for further details). \u2022\ufffd Adapt existing and planned ASEAN data platforms to develop a knowledge sharing platform on financing for sustainable development Regional data hubs are an important mechanism for sharing information between stakeholders and for facilitating knowledge exchange among officials. The AEC has established an online data platform165 and the ASEAN Social-Cultural Community is also planning to do so. These could be brought together and combined with data on integrated national financing frameworks in a financing for sustainable development platform. Such a platform could help meet the demand for information about common financing and policy challenges that other countries in the region face and the policy and institutional responses they have developed to address them. It could be designed to present data and analysis on these issues in a way that facilitates dialogue and exchange between officials working on these issues. To do so it could draw together the financing data collected by the AEC platform with the sustainable development progress and SDG data that will be collected by the planned ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community platform. These could be combined with data from the integrated national financing framework index being developed by UNDP that aggregates information from existing assessments to give an overview of the status and steps toward establishing an integrated national financing framework. The platform could also bring together relevant policy and institutional analysis and research to stimulate discussion on the reform processes and best practices countries in the region are following. Such a platform would therefore provide a focal-point for learning and knowledge sharing about the policy and institutional reforms that can be undertaken to strengthen governance of finance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2447bf92-8701-466f-ba19-bd26fc3ab391": {"__data__": {"id_": "2447bf92-8701-466f-ba19-bd26fc3ab391", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ASEAN-China-UNDP Financing the Sustainable Development Goals in ASEAN", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60bf8f8fbd00e69dd0a06a6e308737016170206c93427e48c42c4429ec975ec4"}, "3": {"node_id": "bff321b4-1873-42ec-ba15-b578aa0e2ed8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asean-china-undp-financing-sustainable-development-goals-asean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da1c9f0b659e51d676c41d89b30f3455ad7ad30dea446632eee7430fa8ddd948"}}, "hash": "237bc1415405993ccda08c2c70603cba783d8970c25cd9dcd2ba48b156cb642d", "text": "for sustainable development results. Establishing an ASEAN integrated national financing framework peer review mechanism The examples and case studies highlighted throughout this report and the country papers that sit alongside it highlight an important message about the value of knowledge sharing within the region.

There is strong demand for this knowledge. In the process of developing this report and the country papers that support it, many governments directly requested information about how their regional neighbours had approached a similar challenge or policy priority. Bringing these points together, there is a strong case to consider setting up a process for systematically sharing knowledge across the region: a peer review mechanism. Peer review mechanisms are used globally in various contexts and have contributed to significant improvements in policy and institutions over time. For example, the OECD supports peer reviews among members on budget reforms,166 and the system includes engagement with Asian countries. The OECD also has a peer review mechanism for development cooperation agencies.167 The African Peer Review Mechanism is a specialized agency of the African Union that offers an assessment process focused on governance to support political stability, high economic growth, sustainable development and accelerated sub-regional and continental economic integration.168 And Pacific Islands countries use a peer review mechanism that focuses on public financial management and development effectiveness as part of the Forum Compact.169 Drawing on the experiences of peer review mechanisms elsewhere alongside the needs and opportunities in the ASEAN region, an ASEAN integrated national financing framework peer review mechanism could be established with some of the following characteristics: \u2022\ufffd A voluntary system: governments would request peer reviews on a periodic basis, ideally timed to coincide with windows of opportunity for reform in their own national planning cycles, for example to feed into the development of a five-year plan. \u2022\ufffd Countries may aim for a review every five years or so. This would allow sufficient time for reforms from previous reviews to have been established and would fit with many countries\u2019 five-year planning cycles. For the region as a whole it may mean undertaking roughly two reviews a year in order for all countries to be reviewed in a five-year period. \u2022\ufffd Reviews would use the lens of the integrated national financing framework to assess the strength of a country\u2019s financing system and identify reform priorities. They could use an adapted version of the development finance assessment methodology. \u2022\ufffd Reviews would be practically focused: designed to produce recommendations about tangible steps that the government under review could take to strengthen their systems. \u2022\ufffd Peer review teams would include specialists from a number of other countries in order to allow lessons to be shared widely across the region. \u2022\ufffd Peer review teams would include senior specialists in each area of the integrated national financing framework and be led by someone who is able to take a \u2018big picture\u2019 view across an integrated national financing framework as a whole. In the first few reviews this may be someone who has led a development finance assessment oversight team. 166 The Working Party of Senior Budget Officials includes budget directors and senior officials from Ministries of Finance and Treasuries across the OECD. The group undertakes periodic reviews of budgeting systems in member or partner countries. Via the OECD-Asian Senior Budget Officials engagement, reviews of a number of ASEAN countries have been completed, including: Indonesia (in 2009), the Philippines (2010), Singapore (2006) and Thailand (2006). See more at: http://www.oecd. org/gov/budgeting/workingpartyofseniorbudgetofficialssbo.htm 167 Peer reviews of OECD DAC members are undertaken around every five years to help the country think about how it can improve its development strategy and structures to increase the effectiveness of its investments. The process typically takes around six months.

Data from national sources reported in national currencies was converted into constant US dollars using exchange rates and GDP-based deflators following normal practice. Domestic public finance Domestic public finance refers to government resources that originate domestically. It covers government revenue (excluding any grants received, to avoid double counting with international resources) and government borrowing from domestic sources (i.e. domestic financing). Both series were sourced from national budget documents where available, with data from International Monetary Fund Article IV Reports used to fill gaps, where needed. Domestic private finance Domestic private finance refers to investment by the domestic private sector in the country. Few countries produce data on domestic commercial investments directly so gross fixed capital formation is used as a proxy, with capital expenditure and FDI deducted to obtain a figure for domestic private investment alone. Gross fixed capital formation data excludes certain types of investments such as land sales and purchases and all kinds of financial assets, and it does not make any deductions for depreciation of fixed assets. These estimates should therefore be treated as estimates of the general trends and scale of this financing. International private finance International private finance includes FDI, portfolio equity, private borrowing from international sources and remittances. FDI data are based on national sources for all countries. Portfolio equity and remittances were based on national sources for countries with enough coverage, or World Bank data otherwise. Portfolio equity data based on national sources was sourced from the liabilities line of portfolio investments (equity component) in balance of payments tables. Private borrowing from international sources refers to commercial debt (both long- and short-term) and is based on international data from the World Bank International Debt Statistics for all countries. This was done for consistency across the country papers and due to patchy coverage and availability of data on this type of finance in national sources. International public finance International public finance includes official development assistance (ODA), other official flows (OOF) and government borrowing from international sources. ODA is sourced from OECD DAC data. OOF data are sourced from OECD DAC Table 2B for all countries as comprehensive data on this type of finance is not readily available from national sources. Government borrowing refers to lending from bilateral and multilateral institutions and private entities received or guaranteed by the state.

Integrity pact. A transparency and accountability tool\u2014legally binding\u2014developed by Transparency International for preventing corruption in public contracting. It includes an integrity pledge, between the government agency offering a contract and the companies bidding for it, that both parties will abstain from bribery, collusion and other corrupt practices for the extent of the contract. A third party, such as a civil society organization, monitors the integrity pact to ensure compliance. Integrity violations in procurement. Facets of corruption, which includes bribery, kickbacks, nepotism, cronyism and clientelism; fraud and theft of resources, for example through product substitution during delivery, resulting in lower quality materials; bid collusion and bid rigging; abuse and manipulation of information; discriminatory treatment in the public procurement process; and waste and abuse of organizational resources. Objectivity in public procurement. Procurement decisions based on the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment and proportionality for providers, namely that they should be based solely on commercial grounds without taking into account any irrelevant considerations. Transparency in public procurement. Publicity of procurement opportunities and the disclosure of the rules to be followed; undertaking procurement processes publicly and visibly, according to prescribed rules and procedures that limit the discretion of officials; and the provision of a system of monitoring and enforcing applicable rules. Public procurement. Process of identifying what is needed, determining who is the best person or organization to supply this need, and ensuring what is needed is delivered to the right place, at the right time, for the best price, and that all this is done in a fair and open manner. Risk assessment. The overall process of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation (UNDP, 2016). Terms and definitions ix Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Foreword Public procurement is big money. The funds spent by governments on buying goods and services and building infrastructure such as roads and hospitals account on average for 15% to 20% of the gross domestic product in developing countries (World Bank, 2015). At the same time, it is estimated that between 10-30% of the investment in publicly funded construction projects may be lost through mismanagement and corruption (COST, 2012). Governments looking for ways to finance the Sustainable Development Goals, or simply looking for efficiency gains, will get a high return on investment if they tackle integrity risks in government contracts. Tackling these risks not only contributes to better quality of services for the people and stronger infrastructure, but also enables substantial government savings, resulting in increased domestic resources. This Guidebook on Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific is designed as a practical methodology to help countries diagnose integrity risks in the public procurement system and processes, as well as to indicate proper actions to mitigate them. In addition, the Guidebook is designed to help governments in the region upgrade their procurement systems during the Second Review Cycle of the UN Convention against Corruption (2017-2021). This Guidebook was developed building on the experience of UNDP in the region with helping governments mitigate integrity risks in procurement. The methodology was successfully piloted in 2014 upon the request from the Government of Thailand to assess integrity risks in public procurement to help reform its public procurement system and step up its efforts against corruption. Three years after the risk assessment, the Thai Government introduced the first public procurement law in Thailand, accelerated the upgrade of its e-procurement system and piloted Integrity Pacts in major infrastructure projects. Over the last few years several governments in Asia-Pacific have approached UNDP to share the lessons learned at international level with mitigating integrity risks in public procurement, most recently during the South-to-South Dialogue on Mitigating Integrity Risks in Government Contracts in October 2016. Accordingly, this Guidebook builds on the lessons learned from various countries around the globe and provides a user-friendly point of reference to navigate through existing international standards, good practices and tools prepared by international organizations, such as UNDP, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the World Bank, and Transparency International (TI). The United Nations Development Programme stands ready to support governments\u2019 efforts in this important reform area, building on this well-tested methodology as well as its long-standing experience with capacity-building and curriculum development through the UNDP Procurement Services Unit.

Engaging in the virtuous cycle of combating corruption to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1. Introduction Public procurement is the process through which governments buy goods, services and infrastructure, and is at the heart of delivering public services. Sound public procurement systems can reduce costs, ensure quality and produce timely results, while poor practices, often tampered by corruption, can lead to delays, missed service delivery and a waste of public money. Government contracts account for a big portion of the national gross domestic product (GDP), both in OECD and in developing countries. For example, general government procurement in 2013 accounted for 16.22% of GDP in Japan, 12.8% in Korea and 14.56% in New Zealand (OECD, 2015). In developing countries, public procurement accounts for an estimated 15-20% of the GDP and up to 50% or more of total government expenditure (World Bank, 2015). The extensive volume of business transactions that take place between private and public sectors, as well as excessive bureaucracy, makes procurement particularly vulnerable to corruption.1 Estimates show that 20-25% of the procurement budget is drained through corruption (OECD, 2013). Red tape and corruption constitute significant risk factors for service delivery because they lead to excess costs and inefficiency, as well as to distortion of the competitive environment, with severe consequences for the fundamental functions of a society. The total amount lost by developing countries to corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion each year, according to United Nations estimates, costs some US $1.26 trillion.2 As governments face the challenge of finding resources to finance the Sustainable Development Goals, which will cost developing countries around US$2.5 trillion annually (UNCTAD, 2014), they often overlook the resources that can be unlocked by mitigating waste and corruption in public procurement. Governments struggling to finance the SDGs, or simply looking for ways to achieve efficiency gains at a time of rapidly building debt across the region, will find that strengthening procurement systems triggers a virtuous cycle. It not only contributes to better quality of services and stronger infrastructure, but also enables substantial government savings, resulting in increased domestic resources that can be invested in development programmes. 1 The costs of corruption are substantial. Although these costs are hard to measure, a sense of the size can be gauged from bribes paid every year in both developing countries and advanced economies. A recent estimate put the annual cost of bribery alone at about $1.5 to $2 trillion (roughly 2 per cent of global GDP) . The overall economic and social costs of corruption are likely to be even larger since bribes constitute only one aspect of the possible forms of corruption. 1. Introduction The total amount lost by developing countries to corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion each year, according to United Nations estimates Funds developing countries would need annually unitil 2030 to achieve their SDGs US$1.26 TRILLION US$2.5 TRILLION As governments are looking for ways to finance the Sustainable Development Goals, they often overlook the resources that can be unlocked by fighting corruption.

A sound procurement system is vital for continued regional integration and remains an important trigger for economic growth in the region. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for almost 37% of world trade. More than half of trade in the region is inter-regional (UNESCAP, 2014). Over 50% of the Asia-Pacific preferential trade agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), have included measures targeting government procurement (UNESCAP, 2015).3 It is particularly timely for governments in Asia-Pacific to mitigate risks in public procurement since, commencing in 2017", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fec14f34-3394-4e0a-9237-0316441eb0f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fec14f34-3394-4e0a-9237-0316441eb0f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6be3085a8ef9cd828e1c0741fb5296a536d7c791604d222a8267a57e79e53a75"}}, "hash": "6be3085a8ef9cd828e1c0741fb5296a536d7c791604d222a8267a57e79e53a75", "text": "and covering the following four years, their systems will be reviewed in the context of the Second Review Cycle of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). States Parties to the Convention (181 States Parties as of December 20164) will undergo reviews to assess their compliance with Chapters II and V of the UNCAC, regarding Preventive Measures and Asset Recovery, respectively. In the recent Regional Conference on Fast-tracking Implementation of UNCAC For Economic and Social Development in Southeast Asia,5 around 200 delegates from both government agencies and civil society organizations agreed on a series of priorities in order to effectively implement the UNCAC provisions. Extensive discussions focused specifically on public procurement and on how to make it more transparent and efficient. Some of the most pressing priorities include building the capacity of all stakeholders involved in procurement to effectively implement procurement legislation and/or regulations at all stages of the procurement process. This ranges from contract management and administration, through targeted national training initiatives; and building the capacity of procuring entities and oversight bodies to prevent and detect irregularities, to periodically engage in procurement fraud and corruption risk assessments, as well as to take mitigating actions on the identified risks. Objectives In response to this call, UNDP has developed this Guidebook, which specifically intends to help governments: \u2022 Introduce risk management measures in their public procurement systems and processes in order to map existing corruption risks and initiate actions aimed at strengthening their public procurement systems accordingly. These risk management measures will be considered at the system, organizational, process and/or individual levels, depending on the specific country context. \u2022 Organize consultations on how to improve their public procurement systems before the country undergoes the Second Review Cycle. This continues the support that UNDP provided in the First Review Cycle with the methodology \u201cGoing Beyond the Minimum\u201d, which encouraged governments to involve a wide range of stakeholders at different stages of the Review Cycle. This Guidebook draws on the analytical framework of MAPS (the Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems) developed by the OECD/Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and the World Bank. This is a familiar analytical tool to many procurement policy and law makers in Asia and the Pacific. However, this Guidebook does not provide an assessment tool, which is an integral part of the MAPS methodology, where the aim is to measure and determine the standard and quality of a national public procurement system against a set of baseline indicators. Instead, this Guidebook provides a logical structure for the identification of integrity risks in procurement and also provides guidance for governments to devise a capacity development action plan. This Guidebook also aims to be a useful analytical tool during the Second Review Cycle of UNCAC. 3 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 1. National system level 2. Organizational level 3. Procurement process level 4. Individual level 1. Introduction 6 An overview of the main international standards and guidelines on integrity in public procurement is available in Annex 1. This Guidebook builds on the findings from the integrity risk assessment that was conducted in Thailand in 2014 and 2015, as well as on existing guidelines and checklists, to help countries \u201ctake the necessary steps to establish appropriate systems of procurement, based on transparency, competition and objective criteria in decision-making that are effective, inter alia, in preventing corruption\u201d (UNODC, 2004). These guidelines were prepared by several international organizations,6 such as UNODC, UNCITRAL, OECD, and TI. The main source of guidance for countries aiming at conformance with the UNCAC Article 9(1) on procurement is the UNODC Guidebook on anti-corruption in public procurement and the management of public finances (\u201cGood Practices in Ensuring Compliance with Article 9 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption\u201d). In addition, UNDP\u2019s \u201cPublic Procurement Capacity Development Guide\u201d provides a user-friendly reference for engaging stakeholders in developing capacity development plans on procurement. Target audience This Guidebook is targeted mainly at anti-corruption agencies that are, in most countries, the focal points for the UNCAC Review process, as well as at public procurement agencies responsible for procurement policy and regulatory initiatives. However, this report is also directed at other important stakeholders, such as ministries and other major procuring entities. The responsibility of developing integrity risk management policies and action plans at the national level normally rests with various government agencies, and ultimately with the political leadership. On the other hand, the implementation of integrity policies at the level of the procuring entities will become the responsibility of those entities\u2019 managements.

The analytical framework provides guidance on why, what, by whom and how to improve (i) the regulatory framework and the central institutional structure and capacity (system-level); and (ii) the market functionality and operational performance (organizational and process levels), as well as the integrity position of public officials (individual level). Thus, integrity risk management mechanisms in public procurement are designed to identify and manage integrity risks at four levels of a public procurement system, namely: 4 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific This Guidebook also addresses the specific integrity risks attached to the respective levels. The combination of proposed reform actions is seen primarily from an integrity perspective. However, a sound public procurement system cannot be established unless the performance and efficiency of the system is economic, and \u201cvalue for money\u201d is secured in parallel. The overriding goal of public procurement, as expressed by the new World Bank procurement framework policy, is to \u201cachieve value for money with integrity for sustainable development\u201d. This Guidebook will identify international good practices and standards in all these contexts, and provide practical guidance on appropriate preventive measures with specific reference to the requirements under Article 9 of the UNCAC on public procurement.7 7 Art. 9 of the UNCAC is available for consultation in Annex 2. It should be said that while the review of compliance with the UNCAC Article 9(1) is focused on defining gaps in the public procurement system and identifying needs for technical assistance, the overall assessment of the system will additionally provide information and guidance on the general performance status of the public procurement system, including in terms of \u201cvalue for money\u201d outcomes. 5 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Box 1. How to read this Guidebook The analytical approach used in this Guidebook builds on international experiences and practices, such as those undertaken by the OECD, the World Bank and the UNDP, on how to assess public procurement systems at different levels. The review of the public procurement system at the national system level is modelled on the Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems (MAPS). At all the other levels, the assessment approach also draws on international experiences and practices, but is structured in a way as to reflect the requirements under the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) Second Review Cycle. Chapter 2 provides the rationale and background for fighting corruption and fraud in public procurement, and includes an overview of important international agreements and commitments. Chapter 3 presents the overall analytical framework and provides guidance on how the countries could organize and conduct the assessment. Chapter 4 addresses integrity risks at the national system level (1) using the MAPS methodology and the four-pillar analytical approach, with each pillar discussed separately. Chapter 5 analyses and discusses integrity risks at the organization level (2) of procuring entities, covering specific issues related to procurement function, decision-making and capacity development. Chapter 6 analyses integrity risks at the process level (3), covering the pre-bidding phase, bidding phase and post-bidding phase. It includes a presentation on how to identify integrity risks by using red flags and measures for the prevention of said risks. In addition, Annex 3 provides a comprehensive checklist on how to identify and mitigate integrity risks in the procurement process. Chapter 7 covers integrity risks at the individual level (4), with the purpose of addressing matters related to the integrity of the procuring entities\u2019 staff, such as codes of conduct and the declaration of assets. References are made to Article 9(1) of UNCAC. Chapter 8 illustrates how to design and implement a capacity development action plan, following the integrity risk assessment, to mitigate these risks. Finally, Chapter 9 summarizes key takeaways and emphasizes how countries can use this Guidebook to prepare for UNCAC\u2019s Second Review Cycle. These Annexes complement this Guidebook: Annex 1.

Carasca/MINCODE 7 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 2. Mitigating risks in public procurement in Asia-Pacific Procurement is a crucial pillar of service delivery for governments, which requires identifying what is needed, selecting the supplier, and delivering goods and services in a fair, economical and open manner. Due to the extensive volume of business transactions that take place between the public and private sector, procurement is among the functions most prone to corruption in the public sector. Subsequently, engaging in an integrity risk assessment in public procurement can be an important first step in reducing public sector corruption. In addition to being an important strategic governance tool for the achievement of a number of political priorities, an integrity risk assessment offers information on the performance of the public procurement system and enables governments and parliaments to improve the quality of the service delivered. Undertaking an integrity risk assessment can offer vast benefits, as illustrated by the experience of Thailand (see Box 2). 2. Mitigating Risks in Public Procurement in Asia-Pacific: Rationale and International Agreements Rationale \u00a9 Shutterstock 8 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Box 2. Public procurement risk assessment in Thailand to advance reform From 2014-2015, UNDP Thailand, together with the Office of the Public Sector Development Commission, the Office of Public Procurement Management, the Comptroller General\u2019s Department, the Ministry of Finance, the Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand, the State Enterprise Policy Office, as well as other key stakeholders, established the Project on Mitigating Risks to Integrity in Public Procurement. The main objective was to undertake an integrity risk assessment in public procurement to identify gaps and provide recommendations for improvement and capacity development. Using MAPS, the analytical approach developed by the OECD and World Bank, as well as desk reviews, interviews and surveys with several stakeholders from government, the private sector and academia, a twenty-point action plan was proposed. It included, among others, the following recommendations: \u2022 Develop and adopt a coherent, sound and modern public procurement law (PPL). \u2022 Continue the development of an e-procurement system. \u2022 Support and invest in the professionalization of the procurement function by developing a national training and career development strategy in public procurement. \u2022 Increase transparency and accessibility to public records and documents. \u2022 Develop a risk indicator system with red-flags that could signal potential problems in the procurement process. As a result of the integrity risk assessment, the Thai Government set up a sub-committee on procurement as part of its National Reform Council, and initiated a training of government officials on the UNDP Checklist on how to mitigate corruption risks. Trainings were also conducted on international instruments, such as the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Integrity Pacts were introduced in big infrastructure projects to mitigate risks to integrity. In 2015-2016, UNDP continued providing technical assistance to the Thai Government in order to develop the first Public Procurement Act, based on international models with the aim to maximize value for money, enforce integrity standards and set up a coherent public procurement system. In 2016, UNDP proactively advocated for the adoption of the law, engaging with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office, as well as with parliamentarians. On 15 December 2016, the Public Procurement Act was approved by the Parliament of Thailand. The law was announced in the Royal Gazette of Thailand on 24 February 2017. The law covers the whole public sector (public organizations and state-owned enterprises) at national, provincial and local levels, and includes provisions on framework agreements, the professionalization of public procurement functions, transparency, and citizen monitoring of public procurement functions. In 2016, the Government, with the support of UNDP and in partnership with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), is developing secondary regulations and guidance on implementing framework agreements, as well as designing a procurement curriculum as part of the professionalization of public procurement functions This project was supported jointly by UNDP and the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign & Commonwealth Office. 9 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 2.

It outlines the UNCAC\u2019s scope and objectives, as well as introduces other international agreements. United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) The UNCAC is the most comprehensive and only legally binding international treaty on anti-corruption. Its objectives are to promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat corruption more efficiently and effectively; to promote, facilitate and support international cooperation and technical assistance in the prevention of and fight against corruption, including in asset recovery; and to promote integrity, accountability and proper management of public affairs and property. In the Asia-Pacific region, all countries are States Parties to the UNCAC with the exception of Japan (signatory), Niue, North Korea, Samoa and Tonga.8 The UNCAC, Article 9(1), requires each State Party, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, \u201cto take the necessary steps to establish sound and appropriate systems of procurement, 8 The updated list of States Parties to UNCAC is available at https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/signatories.html 10 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific based on transparency, competition and objective criteria in decision-making, that are effective, inter alia, in preventing corruption\u201d (see Box 3). Such systems, which may take into account appropriate threshold values in their application, shall address: (i) the establishment of a sound procurement system; (ii) transparency in procurement; (iii) objective decision-making in procurement; (iv) domestic review (or bid challenge) systems; (v) integrity of public officials; and (vi) soundness of public records and finance (Article 9(3)). Box 3. UNCAC requirements for sound and appropriate systems of procurement \u2022 The public distribution of information related to procurement procedures and contracts, including information on invitations to tender, and relevant information on the award of contracts, allowing potential tenderers sufficient time to prepare and submit their tenders; \u2022 The establishment of conditions for participation in advance, including selection and award criteria as well as tendering rules and their publication; \u2022 The use of objective and predetermined criteria for public procurement decisions, in order to facilitate the subsequent verification of the correct application of the rules or procedures; \u2022 An effective system of domestic review, including an effective system of appeal, to ensure legal recourse and remedies in the event that the rules or procedures are not followed; \u2022 Where appropriate, measures to regulate matters regarding personnel responsible for procurement, such as a declaration of interest in particular public procurements, screening procedures and training requirements; and \u2022 The necessary administrative measures to preserve integrity in accounting books, records and financial statements. \u00a9 Ma.

The first five-year cycle, which started in 2010, reviewed compliance with Chapters III and IV (enforcement of the Convention), while the second five-year cycle, which starts in 2017, will review compliance with Chapters II and V (prevention and asset recovery, respectively).9 9 The country pairings for the UNCAC second review can be found at <https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/ Review-Mechanism/CountryPairingSchedule/2016_07_14_Country_pairings_SecondCycle.pdf>.

The second purpose is to support the harmonization of procurement regulation internationally, and to consequentially promote international trade. Reference is made to the UML under the UNCAC Technical Guide for Article 9, describing it as an excellent model for all States Parties to use in their programmes in order to modernize their public procurement laws and make the regulatory framework compatible with the UNCAC requirements, as well as with other international agreements such as the WTO/GPA. World trade organization government procurement agreement The GPA is a multilateral agreement within the framework of the World Trade Organization, meaning that not all WTO members are parties to the agreement. It currently has 47 members and 29 observers. The fundamental aim of the GPA is to mutually open government procurement markets among its parties. It establishes rules requiring that open, fair and transparent conditions of competition be ensured in government procurement. The revised GPA was adopted in 2014. OECD recommendation on public procurement The \u201c2015 OECD Recommendation on Public Procurement\u201d supports an important shift from an administrative and compliance-based approach to a more strategic and holistic one in order to realise government policies. In addition to delivering goods and services necessary to accomplish the government\u2019s mission in a timely, economical and efficient manner, governments might also use procurement for secondary objectives, such as sustainable green growth, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, or broader industrial policy objectives. When designing reforms, governments should keep in mind the broader goal of value for money with integrity, to avoid narrowly focusing on corruption control. Otherwise there is a risk that this narrow focus may generate negative impacts on the efficiency of the procurement system without providing any definitive evidence of reduced corruption, and can lead to a \u201cdouble failure risk scenario\u201d, by which neither of the policy goals of the public procurement reform will be achieved. \u00a9 Shutterstock 13 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 2.

Opportunities and challenges of joining international trade agreements: The case of Viet Nam On 4 October 2015, Viet Nam, together with 11 other countries (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and the United States), concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations. Even though the US announced its withdrawal on 23 January 2017, the TPP, while pending other governments\u2019 endorsements, is still expected to be a high-standard trade agreement that will promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty; promote transparency and good governance; and enhance labour and environmental protections in TPP countries. These long-term benefits are the main drivers for Viet Nam to join TPP negotiations and consider signing this historic trade agreement.

The Government Procurement Chapter sets high quality standards for public procurement to be transparent and allow suppliers to participate fairly in the processes. These are the obligations that Viet Nam, like other TPP countries, will have to follow: 1. Non-discrimination against foreign suppliers when assessing tenders and awarding contracts. 2. Encourage the use of electronic means to increase transparency, predictability and certainty. 3. Non-application of offsets, according to which Viet Nam cannot apply favourable measures facilitating national goods and suppliers. 4. Establishment of an independent administrative review mechanism which is not a judiciary authority to handle claims, challenges and appeals from contractors. Despite the opportunities, Viet Nam will face challenges by joining the TPP, which include: 1. Aligning domestic law to the requirements and obligations of TPP. This will require dissemination and training of key stakeholders on TPP commitments. 2. Enhancing capacity of domestic bidders and procurement entities to become international market players (technical and professional improvements). 3. Dealing with the negative short/medium term effects on local industries in case a large proportion of government contracts is carried out by foreign suppliers. Viet Nam will benefit from international assistance, training and good practice exchange to successfully overcome these challenges and maximize the positive impact of ratifying the TPP.

Integrity risk assessment of public procurement This Guidebook is a tool for governments in Asia-Pacific to set up a process for identifying integrity risks and capacity gaps in their public procurement systems. Based on the results, governments are called to devise an action plan to build their procurement capacities and upgrade their systems during the UNCAC\u2019s Second Review Cycle. 3. Integrity Risk Assessment of Public Procurement: Process, Stakeholder Management and Analytical Frameworks \u00a9 Shutterstock 16 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific The risk assessment process\u2014which aims at evaluating potential risks and establishing procedures to minimize negative impacts\u2014needs political commitment at the highest level and a strong, well-anchored assessment organization and consultation process. Process The following steps are recommended for identifying integrity risks in public procurement and for developing an action plan:10 1. Obtain a high-level commitment from executives to embark on a public procurement integrity risk assessment; 2. Decide the goals, objectives, and procedures\u2014including the timetable\u2014for the procurement integrity assessment and appoint a high-level official to coordinate the process; 3. Establish the organization and consultation mechanism; 4. Decide on the scope and direction of the assessment; 5. Conduct the assessment process in accordance with goals and objectives decided by government; 6. Present the findings, integrity risks and preliminary recommendations to be validated by the key stakeholders; 7. Prepare a draft action plan as an input to public procurement and anti-corruption reforms; 8. Organize a consultation among key stakeholders on the proposed action plan; 9. Approve and implement the action plan; and 10. Monitor and evaluate the action plan against the agreed objectives. More specifically, applying a systematic methodology of risk mapping is a good approach for conducting the assessment process and mitigating integrity risks. The UNDP Integrity Risk Management methodology stresses the most risky phases and indicates the measures for reducing these risks. The main objectives of the methodology used for mapping the risks are: \u2022 Identifying the risks in order to put in place efficient means to prevent fraud and corruption; and \u2022 Identifying risks to investigations to make them more efficient, done by concentrating the efforts on sensitive processes, methods or persons.11 Process and stakeholder management 10 A proposed outline of the report on national public procurement integrity risk assessment is available in Annex 7. 11 UNDP has published a number of sector analyses of integrity risk management (for example in health and education).

Public procurement policy, regulatory and monitoring authorities, including other important stakeholders such as main purchasers and private sector associations, need to be closely involved in the development of the action plan on integrity in procurement. A systematic approach should be taken to identify and map stakeholders prior to commencing procurement capacity development processes so that an appropriate stakeholder communication and engagement strategy can be applied throughout. One approach may be to identify the stakeholders and map them according to their relative influence and importance, bearing in mind that this may vary at different stages of the process (UNDP, 2010). An example of such a stakeholder mapping is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. An example of stakeholder mapping 3.

The risk assessment is based, at the system level, on the analytical framework of MAPS to determine the standard, integrity and compliance of national public procurement systems with international good practices. MAPS was originally developed by OECD and the World Bank in 2003. MAPS covers public procurement in all its aspects and offers a set of indicators that allows evaluation on how well a public procurement system works or where reforms are needed. The present integrity risk assessment uses the 2010 version of MAPS. However, a stakeholder group of MAPS users (countries, international institutions and experts) launched a revision process of the methodology in 2015 to reflect new developments within public procurement, such as e-procurement, strategic public procurement and an increased focus on performance. A first draft was published for consultation in 2016. While the indicators have been revised substantially, the basic structure of MAPS has remained the same. In order to make the assessment of a public procurement system at the national level manageable, it is necessary to identify and include areas directly associated with public procurement, and deliberately exclude areas of less direct influence. Four key areas (pillars) have been identified, in broad terms, to constitute the basic components of a national public procurement system: 1) legal and regulatory framework; 2) institutional framework and capacity; 3) operational capacity and market functionality; and 4) control structure and integrity mechanisms. Integrity has to be granted throughout the entire public procurement process, through measures aimed at reducing corruption and enhancing transparency in all the pillars. The MAPS analytical framework, however, applies only to the assessment at the national system level. For the organizational, process and individual levels, other approaches will be used, which will be described in detail in the respective chapters. Analytical frameworks Figure 6.

Legal and regulatory framework The regulatory instrument governing public procurement should be a public procurement law (PPL) complemented with an appropriate set of secondary legislation, implementing regulations and guidance documentation. However, some countries may still rely on government regulations, which generally constitutes a problem in terms of compatibility with international standards and often provides weaker legal certainty and enforceability for procuring entities and bidders. Further information on the design of the legislative and regulatory framework is available in Annex 6. It is important to note that a comprehensive examination of the legal and regulatory framework should not be limited to the tender process alone. Depending on the particular country context, the legal and regulatory framework of related arenas\u2014such as budgeting, appropriation, contract execution and management\u2014should also be considered. Pillar 2. Institutional framework and management capacity To establish a sound and efficient public procurement system, institutional structures and arrangements should be in place to ensure an effective implementation of policies and the proper functioning of the regulatory system. It should be noted that while it is not explicitly stated in the UNCAC under Article 9(1) that a State Party would need to build an efficient institutional infrastructure, institutional aspects are addressed under other articles of the UNCAC. According to the UNODC Technical Guide on UNCAC, it is good practice to establish either an independent agency or commission for the organization and execution of public procurement procedures. The functions normally associated with these central public procurement institutions are as follows (OECD, 2007): \u2022 Responsibility for developing primary legislation and regulation; \u2022 Preparing and issuing secondary legislation (implementing regulation and operational guidelines); Box 5. Checklist questions on the legal and regulatory framework To support governments in undertaking a risk assessment, this Guidebook proposes a set of generic questions that can be used for references. These questions should be tailored to the specific context of each country. Is public procurement regulated by law or regulations? Are all procuring entities and contracts covered by the regulatory framework? Which entities and contracts are exempted from the regulatory framework? Is open competitive tendering the default method and are there other available procurement methods based on clear justifications, and do they follow the principle of transparency? Is the design of technical specifications clearly laid down in the procurement law, based on standards, leaving no room for biased descriptions? Are there clear rules on the qualifications of bidders and their selection (eligibility, technical and financial capacity, and debarment)? Are the award criteria clearly described in the law, such as lowest evaluated price or most economically advantageous tender? Is the provision and format of tender documentation sufficiently described in the law? Are there clear rules for publication of tender notices and sufficient minimum time limits for the submission of tender; normally between 10-40 days? Is the opening of tenders done publicly in accordance with law? Is the tender evaluation process clearly described in the law? Is there a complaint procedure laid down in the law? 3. Integrity Risk Assessment of Public Procurement: Process, Stakeholder Management and Analytical Frameworks 20 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific \u2022 Oversight and monitoring of public procurement with the right to attend or access information on any part of the procurement process; \u2022 Advisory and operational support to contracting entities; \u2022 Developing integrity strengthening policies and instruments; \u2022 Collating intelligence on procurement fraud and corruption, including (i) receiving all complaints, (ii) creating a confidential telephone \u201chotline\u201d, (iii) reviewing publicly available debarment lists, and (iv) ensuring the effective exchange of relevant information with other parts of the government involved in contracting with the private sector, as appropriate; \u2022 Developing and overseeing integrity pacts; \u2022 Monitoring specific awards, such as single source procurement; \u2022 Promoting freedom of information legislation and access to information; \u2022 Promoting specialist training, codes of conduct and asset declaration requirements for procurement staff and auditors; \u2022 Developing and managing an e-procurement system, including publication and information functions; \u2022 Professionalization and capacity building; \u2022 Operational development and coordination; and \u2022 International cooperation. Central public procurement functions are exercised by central bodies that may be organized with a variety of reporting lines. Commonly these central bodies are organized within or subordinated to: \u2022 The Ministry of Finance or the Treasury; \u2022 The Ministry of Works; \u2022 The Ministry of Regional Development; \u2022 The Office of the Prime Minister/Chancellor/President as a subordinate body; \u2022 The Council of Ministers; \u2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a5d0681-2b7e-4724-b0e7-5c9a384a0012": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a5d0681-2b7e-4724-b0e7-5c9a384a0012", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90a854dfe650d2c327e421e5ebd82efc80a316bcc6d0662b673e427efe8c35de"}}, "hash": "90a854dfe650d2c327e421e5ebd82efc80a316bcc6d0662b673e427efe8c35de", "text": "Parliament; or \u2022 The Competition Authority or another public body.

The establishment of a forum for consultations with important stakeholders on policy development and integrity is a key ingredient within the institutional structure. Box 6. Checklist questions on institutional frameworks and management capacity To support governments in undertaking a risk assessment, this Guidebook proposes a set of generic questions that can be used for reference. These questions should be tailored to the specific context of each country. Which ministry or body is responsible for policy coordination and the regulation of public procurement, support, monitoring and oversight with regards to public procurement? Are the main functions and responsibilities of this body clearly laid out in the procurement law? Is this body sufficiently organized and staffed to undertake its duties effectively? Does the body operate a web portal for the publication of tender notices and the opportunity to upload and download tender documentation? Is the body responsible for e-procurement development? Does the body have a sufficient mandate to carry out its monitoring responsibilities effectively, e.g. the right to collect information and data from the contracting entities? Does the body have the right to propose or even issue interpretive and implementing guidelines? Does the body have the right to issue and manage debarment lists? Does the body take any regulatory initiatives to prevent corruption and fraud in public procurement? Does the body provide any training in public procurement for procuring entities and bidders? 21 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Pillar 3. Operational capacity and market functionality The integrity risk management of the public procurement system should cover the quality and capacity of the procurement function, including the purchasing organization, processes, and procurement managers and staff. The identification of main integrity risks at the national level covers the following areas in particular: \u2022 Professionalism of the procurement function: A cornerstone of an efficient public procurement system is the availability of a professional procurement function within procuring entities. It is important that this function can produce \u201cvalue for money\u201d for its users by acting professionally, cost-effectively and with integrity within all key aspects of the procurement processes. Professionalization cannot be limited only to training in public procurement for procurement managers and staff. Equally important are the organization and decision-making structures within the procuring entities that need to be tackled simultaneously and comprehensively. \u2022 Market functionality: The public market\u2019s attractiveness to the private sector depends on many factors, such as potential economic gains, costs of participation, the complexity of tender and contract documentation, the fairness and relevance of qualifications and award criteria, the availability of de- briefing and a complaints mechanism, etc. The market should also be free from trade barriers and other technical or commercial hindrances for participation. \u2022 Availability of modern procurement systems: Successful public procurement operations strongly benefit from the use of tools that modernize and generate more efficient and cost-effective public procurement operations. They are powerful means to reduce transaction costs; provide more competitive prices; simplify tendering and contracting for contracting entities and tenderers/suppliers; increase transparency; improve the collection of procurement data; enhance monitoring and controlling capacities; and generally mitigate integrity risks in the procurement process. These modern systems include e-procurement systems, framework agreements and central purchasing. For more information about modern procurement instruments, refer to Annex 5. Box 7. Checklist questions on operational capacity and market functionality To support governments in undertaking a risk assessment, this Guidebook proposes a set of generic questions that can be used for reference. These questions should be tailored to the specific context of each country. Is there systematic or institutionalized training in public procurement available? Is the position of procurement manager and staff defined within the public administration? Is there a certification system for procurement officers in place? Is the procurement profession recognized? Are there clear rules laid down in law or regulations on the authorization to make procurement decisions? Is the overall competitive position in the market for public contracts satisfactory?

Control structures and integrity mechanisms Control of public procurement is exercised at different levels, with a mix of aims and objectives, and a broad spectrum of actors within the society. Within the government environment, external audits, financial control, public expenditure management and budget processes normally constitute the main control functions. The integrity risk management analysis should preferably cover the following main components: \u2022 External audit: External audits of procurement procedures play an important role in verifying both compliance with the rules and the performance of the procurement operations (value for money). Compliance criteria, against which the process is to be assessed, are based on the regulatory framework applicable in the particular context of a country and generally include the \u201cthree E\u201d criteria\u2014economy, efficiency and effectiveness. \u2022 Anti-corruption organizations: Under Article 6 of the UNCAC, States Parties need to establish specialized, preventive anti-corruption bodies (UNODC, 2009). Furthermore, these bodies are often the designated Lead Agencies for the UNCAC Review process. Such bodies shall be given the task of developing, maintaining, revising and monitoring the implementation of effective, coordinated anti- corruption policies. The success of anti-corruption bodies rests on a number of key conditions, including political support from a broad array of national political leaders, political and operational independence to investigate all levels of government, access to documentation and the power to question witnesses, and leadership with great integrity.13 With respect to public procurement, it is important that the anti- corruption body has a clear mandate for its operations and that this mandate coincides with the legal and institutional foundation for public procurement\u2014particularly for procurement law\u2014as well as the oversight and monitoring responsibilities of the central procurement institutions. \u2022 Specific control instruments: Control in public procurement is primarily aimed at ensuring that public funds are used for the purposes intended. There are also special control instruments, legally and institutionally, designed to minimize the risk of irregularities in public procurement, as well as specialised bodies and instruments that are given responsibility for combatting corruption and fraud. Some examples of these instruments are: o Price control mechanisms: The practice of reference or standard prices is not only for guidance. Reference or standard prices also tend to operate as ceiling prices not to be exceeded by the tenderers. The positive impact of standard price control mechanisms on integrity enhancement is debateable, while the negative effects on market functionality are more clearly demonstrated. o Rules on conflict of interest: Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Model Law mandates a code of conduct for officers or employees of procuring entities. The code of conduct shall address, inter alia, the prevention of conflicts of interest in procurement and, where appropriate, measures to regulate matters regarding personnel responsible for procurement. This includes declarations of interest in particular procurements, screening procedures and training requirements. o Whistleblower protection: A whistleblower protection act should be put in place and provide sufficient protection to whistleblowers. o Integrity pacts initiatives: The Integrity Pact consists of a process that includes an agreement between a government or government agency (\u2018the authority\u2019) and all bidders for a public sector contract, setting out rights and obligations to the effect that neither side will pay, offer, demand or accept bribes; nor will bidders collude with competitors to obtain the contract or bribe representatives of the authority while carrying it out. A third party, Civil Society, monitoring mechanism is a pre-requisite. 3.

The review and remedies system, established by procurement legislation, should provide speedy, effective and competent handling and resolution of complaints, including comprehensive publication of judgments and their rationale. Globally, the main methods of enforcement used involve different forms of: (i) direct supervision, (ii) complaints made to administrative review bodies, (iii) complaints made to independent review bodies, and (iv) complaints brought before judicial authorities. o Risk management initiatives: An example of a risk management initiative is where external professional observers under the public procurement law may have access to the procurement process during the tendering process with the right to express opinions and to request remedial actions, such as the \u201cUK Gateway Review.\u201d Box 8. Australia and the gateway review process One example of a successful control structure is the United Kingdom\u2019s Office of Government Commerce (UK OGC) Gateway Review ProcessTM (Gateway). Gateway is a project assurance methodology that uses short, intensive interviews during the project cycle to: \u2022 Assess the project against its stated objectives at a particular stage in the project life cycle; \u2022 Provide early identification of areas that may require corrective action; \u2022 Validate that the project is ready to progress to the next stage; and \u2022 Meet with relevant actors\u2014including the sponsoring unit (Project Manager and Project Team), Gateway Unit, Gateway Review team and other project stakeholders\u2014at each Gateway Review. In November 2005, the Australian Government endorsed and adopted the Gateway mechanism. Gateway applies to new projects under the Financial Management and Accountability Act of 1997 and to projects above the financial threshold of $10 million for IT projects, and $20 million for other procurement and infrastructure projects.

Box 9. Checklist questions on control structures and integrity in the public procurement system To support governments in undertaking a risk assessment, this Guidebook proposes a set of generic questions that can be used for reference. These questions should be tailored to the specific context of each country. Is there an independent external audit institution set up by law? Has the external audit institution been designated a clear role and mandate in the auditing of public procurement operations? Has any specialized anti-corruption body been established by law? What are the main responsibilities and powers of such an anti-corruption body? Is there a specialized complaint review mechanism established by the procurement law? What are the mechanisms in place to handle complaints in relation to collusion? Is there a law on conflict of interest? Is there a law on whistleblower protection? Are there any integrity pact initiatives? Are there any risk management strategies or control mechanisms set up in public procurement? 27 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 4. Integrity risks at the system level This chapter addresses the main integrity risks that may occur as a consequence of weaknesses and gaps identified in the overall structure, with reference to international good practice benchmarks. Using an analytical framework and approach modelled on the MAPS methodology, the integrity risks of public procurement at the system level are those included in the following table. The system level refers to the overall national public procurement system as defined under the MAPS methodology covering the four pillars: legal and regulatory framework, institutional framework and capacity, operational capacity and market functionality, and control structure and integrity mechanisms. 4.

Integrity risks in public procurement at the system level 29 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific The absence of a sound and modern public procurement law that covers the public sector in the country, including utilities companies, and is compatible with international requirements and models, constitutes an overriding integrity risk.14 A poor legal base constitutes risks of fragmentation, weak enforceability and coverage, lack of legal certainty for the bidders, insufficient protection for procurement staff, opportunities for unjustified exemptions, and misuse of discretion. A well-functioning and sound public procurement system is not only dependent on its own core legislation and institutional structures, but is also highly reliant on how well and to what extent the surrounding regulatory framework manages to address the specific needs of the public procurement system. This environment is made up of external audits, financial control, budget rules and planning, administrative and civil service laws, competition law, commercial law, and environmental legislation, in addition to the law on conflict of interest and the law on whistleblower protection. Furthermore, integrity risks in the regulatory framework can be exacerbated by procedural deficiencies. Some procedural deficiencies are: \u2022 Unclear scope of application for public procurement law and unjustified exemptions to the regulatory framework; \u2022 Unjustified use of direct contracting and other non-open tender procedures, such as limited tendering or negotiated procedures; \u2022 Biased technical specifications or specifications that are not based on industry standards; \u2022 Lack of clarity in the rules and implementing regulations on bidder selection and qualification criteria, particularly when in breach of the principles of proportionality and fair and equal treatment; \u2022 Lack of clarity in the rules and guidance documentation concerning the evaluation process, as well as poor rules on how this process should be managed and controlled; \u2022 Unclear rules on aggregation of contract values and abuse of time limits for submission of tenders; \u2022 Unjustified lack of public bid opening, especially where regularity and transparency requirements are not met by other proper means; and \u2022 Unclear regulation on how the proposed award should be communicated and managed. Central regulatory bodies (public procurement authorities) play an important role in developing policies, ensuring effective implementation of the regulatory frameworks and policies, developing technological tools (such as e-procurement), providing support to procuring entities and the private sector, monitoring procurement in the country, collecting procurement data and statistics, and preparing and issuing guidance documentation. A central regulatory body with an unclear and insufficient mandate, low credibility, politicized structure, inefficient capacity, and insufficient financial resources poses significant integrity risks. Box 10 illustrates the virtuous experience of the Public Procurement Service of the Republic of Korea in setting up an efficient e-procurement system. Integrity risks in the legal and regulatory framework Integrity risks in central institutional structure and capacity 14 A common problem of significant complexity is how to deal with state-owned enterprises outside the group of utilities companies. Corruption is a prevalent phenomenon within this sector in many countries. The main issue is to determine under which conditions state-owned enterprises should be covered by the procurement law or, alternatively, are in the position to decide their own procurement rules. 4.

E-procurement as a tool for transparency and accountability: The model of KONEPS (Republic of Korea) An example of a modern procurement instrument that enhances system capacity is the e-procurement system in South Korea. Launched in October 2002 by the Public Procurement Service, Korea\u2019s Central Government Procurement Agency, the Korea On-Line E-Procurement System (KONEPS) provides a web-based procurement platform for 120,000 private businesses and 37,000 public organizations. The online system addresses the entire procurement process\u2014 including procurement requests, bids, contracts and payments. There are many benefits to using an e-procurement system. E-procurement systems improve market access and competition, promote integrity, reduce costs, and increase access to information (Luijken and Martini, 2014). Additionally, e-procurement systems are economical and efficient. Since its establishment, KONEPS has saved the public sector USD$1.4 billion and the private sector USD$6.6 billion. KONEPS has also reduced the time needed to process bids from an average of 30 hours to 2 hours (de Swardt, 2015). Additionally, e-procurement is a tool used in the fight against public sector corruption. By automating processes, e-procurement systems essentially minimize direct human interactions between bidders and procurement personnel, the very interactions that are one of the main sources of corrupt behaviour in public procurement. Furthermore, e-procurement allows for easy data generation and data management, a requirement under Article 9(3) of the UNCAC. As illustrated by KONEPS, e-procurement systems can be an important technological tool for enhancing institutional capacity and helping countries achieve the goals of transparency and accountability under UNCAC. The capacity and professionalism of the procurement function within the procuring entity plays a decisive role for the efficient outcome of procurement operations. Its function and status within the administration, the level of professionalism of management and staff, the way procurement processes are organized and managed, and issues such as staff recognition, development and training support are of significant concern. Authorization, approvals and decision-making rules should be well prescribed in the regulatory framework. Additionally, insufficient confidence with the procurement function and low professionalization are serious integrity risks. With regards to market functionality, the main integrity risks are linked to the competitive position in the market as a whole, as well as in individual market segments. Legal and/or technical obstacles and other means of discrimination for participation in public tenders strongly affect the attractiveness of the public sector market to the private sector. In fact, collusive practices might actually be inspired by technical and legal hindrances to fair and open competition. Domestic preferences are another negative factor to the functionality of the market. Foreign companies, which are bound by strong international commitments to act with integrity,15 generally improve competition. Important indicators on market functionality are public market statistics concerning participation rates on tenders and types of procurement methods used.

Key weaknesses in the control structure and integrity mechanisms include unclear mandates and low credibility of the control bodies, as well as a lack of coordination and cooperation between the main actors within the procurement system. Furthermore, integrity risks in public procurement need to be analysed and tackled by the control structure at different levels in a society and in different aspects. For example, bid collusion and systemic corruption are areas which need to be tackled by other measures outside the direct sphere of public procurement (this topic is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6). A number of questions needs to be addressed, such as: \u2022 What are the most common collusive bid-rigging schemes and how can they be prevented? \u2022 How to spot bid rigging in the pre-contract stage? \u2022 What are the most common bid suppression schemes? \u2022 How to create indicators that will help to identify collusive behaviour? \u2022 How to counteract bid rotation schemes? \u2022 What are the best practices and prevention techniques to avoid bid rigging? \u2022 How to determine whether a subcontracting form fulfils the criteria of bid rigging? \u2022 Why is it essential to have an in-depth knowledge of the market and price level? 33 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 5. Integrity risks at the organizational level An integrity risk management system at the organizational level needs to cover a number of important aspects of procurement operations and processes within the procuring entities, including in central purchasing organizations. The mapping and prevention of integrity risks should be based on a solid understanding of the risk areas within the operational structure, the availability of appropriate analytical tools, the way an integrity risk management policy and action plan is designed, and the goals and methods to ensure effective implementation and sound practices. While the integrity risk assessment of a country\u2019s public procurement system at the system level uses the four-pillar approach, the identification and prevention of integrity risks at the contracting and organizational level, though linked to the overall situation and status of the preventive infrastructure, requires a different analytical approach. Using a performance measurement system, the integrity risks of public procurement at the organizational level are those described in the following table. The organizational level is where procurement transactions take place and where the final outcome of the procurement operations will be determined and measured in terms of \u201cvalue for money\u201d. The areas of specific importance for addressing integrity risks are: the capacity and quality of the procurement function and staff, and how procurement decisions are made and accountability secured. 5.

Integrity risks in public procurement at the organizational level 35 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 5. Integrity Risks at the Organizational Level Many procuring entities have designated procurement departments with specialized procurement staff, although many other expert staff outside the procurement department are involved in all steps of the procurement process. The procurement department should play an important role in all phases of the procurement cycle, from the point of defining the needs until the closure of the file. It acts, or should act, as the main organizer of procurement processes and as the internal knowledge centre for the procuring entity. The size and role of the procurement department will vary depending on the nature of the procuring entity. A major risk identified is that procurement departments operate more as service units for the tender committees, providing a clerical function. The procurement departments should preferably be \u2018driving\u2019 the process and relying on the committees to carry out specific tasks. Other integrity risks relate to the operational function and mandate of the procurement department. It should be used as a strategic function within the operations of the procuring entity, but this is often not the case. Experiences often indicate that training and capacity building of procurement staff and functions are insufficient and would need stronger attention and support. The procurement profession frequently lacks recognition, appreciation and attractive career opportunities, which in turn makes it difficult to recruit and keep procurement staff. An important pre-condition and factor for enhanced professionalism in procurement rests very much on official recognition of the procurement profession within civil service regulations, with clear job descriptions for different positions and salary levels. The nature of the profession might also be different if the position deals with the procurement of goods, services or works contracts. Consequently, any official recognition of the vocation should offer sufficient flexibility in order to accommodate the wide variety of tasks and responsibilities at hand within the procurement cycle. The lack of recognition is not only a formal matter of a regulatory nature, it also constitutes a perception problem of how the procurement profession is viewed from the outside. Additionally, there is often no institutionalized professional training at the academic level or certification schemes of procurement staff available. Equally important is that procurement staff members are offered the right opportunities to acquire knowledge and skills on the job.

UNDP procurement training and certification The United Nations Development Programme offers specialized procurement training and certification to staff from the UN system, governments, non-governmental organizations and international development financing institutions and their borrowers. UNDP/CIPS cooperation on procurement training and certification UNDP procurement certification courses are fully accredited by CIPS, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, assuring compliance with high-quality international standards. All training and certification courses are tailored to reflect UN and public procurement rules, policies and procedures. Each certification level provides a tailored set of student training materials, references and work books, case studies, exercises, and an assessment process leading to a qualification accredited by CIPS. Included in the package for each level is a one year student membership to CIPS, providing access to a world-wide community of procurement professionals, as well as access to 36 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific the CIPS knowledge portal. All the courses will be followed by a written work-based assessment. Assessments are optional for participants but are a requirement to achieve full CIPS qualification. The final course certificate is issued by CIPS directly to the participants, ensuring full compatibility with CIPS qualifications. All training courses employ modern, adult participatory learning methods. Each training module commences with an overview of the rules, procedures and/or theory of the subject in question, and is then followed by case studies, group discussions or exercises. This creates a forum for participants to apply theory and methods to real cases and to foster productive knowledge sharing. Why procurement training and certification? Procurement certification is relevant for several reasons. There has been massive growth in procurement volume and an increase in the risk and complexity of procurement transactions that require new skillsets and competencies.

Integrity Risks at the Organizational Level The Objective of the UNDP/CIPS Certification Course The objective of the UNDP/CIPS certification courses aims to provide faster, economical, and better customized procurement certification that reflects public procurement procedures, policies and practices. In this programme, UNDP oversees: curriculum development/management, training and exam opportunities, student registration, training logistics/administration, and evaluation and statistics. CIPS focuses on: accreditation, issuing of CIPS membership cards, verification of marking, and distribution of the final UNDP/CIPS course certificates. The certification programme is helping to create a cadre of professional procurement staff, it links delegation of procurement authority to staff certification level and aims to establish a license for procurement recognized across organizations and locations. More than 8,200 staff were trained in the last seven years. More information is available on the UNDP procurement site, as well as the CIPS platform. Figure 8.

Figure 9. Staff trained with UNDP/CIPS curriculum up to August 2016 Procurement regulations usually include in the management of the procurement process, the need to establish committees to prepare tender documentation, arrange tender openings, and conduct evaluations and award contracts, as well as to lay down rules on authorization or approval at different administrative levels. The extensive committee approach is a typical feature in many countries. Built on the \u201cfour eyes principle\u201d, where administrative decisions should always involve more than one person in order to ensure the legality and effectiveness of the decisions, this \u201ccollegial or collective approach\u201d could have negative implications on issues such as management efficiency, accountability and responsibility. For the purpose of accountability, it is important to define the point of responsibility correctly within the line organization. Strict dependency on committee decisions has a tendency to dilute responsibility, which might undermine the possibility of establishing accountability in cases of poor performance, as well as make it more difficult to act in cases of suspected irregularities in public procurement. While the formation of tender committees is done with the good intentions of improving both the quality and integrity of procurement decisions, it also offers management an opportunity to hide behind a committee decision and blame the committee if something goes wrong. There is a clear line between tender committees that have the authority and obligation to make a procurement decision and those with the authority to make recommendations only. The latter approach is recommended.

Preventing corruption by promoting trust: Insights from behavioural science Some of the approaches to corruption prevention are built on distrust towards officials and employees, who are seen as potentially corrupt actors. Recent criticism of these methods, which are even seen as having little effect in countering corrupt behaviours\u2014both in the public and private sector\u2014rely on evidence from behavioural science.

Does the \u201cfour eyes principle\u201d perform well? The \u201cfour eyes principle\u201d is the idea that one can improve behaviour by having people in teams of two monitor each other. A second employee must verify and sign off on the decisions of his or her colleague before they are implemented. Subjecting individual decisions to this type of peer review is a standard organizational method, aimed at avoiding individual mistakes. Having a second, independent person supervise a decision is seen as an insurance that a control mechanism is in place. It often has been suggested that the four eyes principle qualifies in limiting corruption. Reports on anti-corruption in the public sector often make reference to the four eyes principle as a method for containing corruption. Successfully bribing two, it is widely believed, is far more difficult and less likely than bribing just one decision maker (Six et al., 2012). However, the behavioural science evidence shows that this approach not only fails to reduce corruption, it might even increase corruption (Schikora, 2010; Li et al., 2015), since groups of people are often more selfish than individuals (Charness and Sutter, 2012). The four eyes principle brings together two people who form a group, develop sympathy for and solidarity with each other. Due to their solidarity, one official may feel inclined to turn a blind eye to an infraction by the other and consequently becomes entrapped in a corrupt network. The principle also diffuses responsibility by providing employees and officials with excuses and justifications, as it might be considered justifiable to take something as long as the second employee does not intervene. While the four eyes principle appears intuitive to the layman, it has been critically challenged by an increasing amount of laboratory experiments. Distrusting employees and inventing methods for reducing their discretionary power can easily backfire. The reason is that the diffusion of responsibility diminishes a sense of individual responsibility for ethical conduct. The atmosphere of distrust that such control mechanisms create can reduce interpersonal trust, intrinsic motivation and the self-esteem that people get from contributing to public goods and working responsibly. Does limiting discretion effectively curb corruption? Another standard approach to preventing corruption is to limit discretion. In the case of procurement, officials are often required to base their decisions only on objective and predetermined criteria. This is supposed to make it harder for corrupt officials to manipulate the procurement process. But this approach also means that honest procurement officers cannot use their experience for selecting high-quality and not corrupt suppliers. 40 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Moreover, the impulse to eliminate discretion often requires procurement officials to pick the lowest price offer, completely disregarding issues of quality. Quality is supposed to be then guaranteed by complex tender documents, easily more than 100 pages long, which specify all relevant details, but can also act as a deterrent to bidders, generating inefficiencies and suffocating competition (Kelman, 2003). Procurement officials\u2019 tasks are then reduced to checking that bids comply with the tender documents. Some argue (Bandiear et al., 2009; Wells, 2014) that procurement officials should be given more discretion to choose the most appropriate approach and justify their decisions, rather than remaining saddled with an over-simplified and bureaucratic system. According to behavioural science, procurement officials are likely to be intrinsically motivated and take pride in procuring good quality goods and services, and are therefore deserving of some level of trust. Adapted from: Preventing Corruption by Promoting Trust \u2013 Insights from Behavioral Science, Johann Graf Lambsdorff, 2015. In the procurement context, the issue of a conflict of interest might arise whenever public officials\u2019 decisions can be influenced by their private interests at various stages of the procurement process.16 Internationally, the regulation of procurement-related conflicts of interest is done in different ways. Some countries rely only on the general laws regarding conflict of interest and might possibly include some provisions with direct bearing on public procurement, while others include specific conflict-of-interest rules into the public procurement laws or regulations. The following parts of the procurement process can be considered most vulnerable: Planning and tender preparation \u2022 Projects and budget allocations are designed and decided by public officials with specific private interests and relationships in those sectors; \u2022 Technical specifications are prepared by officials with their own private interests or relationships in the product or service area; \u2022 The committee for the preparation of technical specifications is composed of members with private interests in the products and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a09d2ae2-6d92-4f7d-af70-95df43cf676e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a09d2ae2-6d92-4f7d-af70-95df43cf676e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bf262c531d80ffe33437e927856796a8d70c8a168e27fb753bc3e7116d44ba4"}}, "hash": "5bf262c531d80ffe33437e927856796a8d70c8a168e27fb753bc3e7116d44ba4", "text": "service areas; and \u2022 Qualification requirements are set to favour a certain supplier in which a public official has an interest. Evaluation and award of contracts The evaluation and award of contracts can be affected if the evaluation committee is composed of public officials with an economic interest, or other type of interest, in any of the bidding firms. Such interests can be shareholding, relatives or friends working in the firm, previous employment in the firm, or offers of future employment. It also might have political reasons, such as firms providing party financing support and other types of benefits to the political system. Contract execution and management Contract implementation can be affected by conflicts of interest on the same grounds as the planning and evaluation phases, but not necessarily with the same officials. The awarded firm might be controlled and supervised by officials with private interests in the company working in the inspection or finance departments, which might lead to the improper acceptance of errors and other cases of poor contract performance. Conflict of interest 16 It should also be understood that a conflict of interest is not the same as corruption. Sometimes there is a conflict of interest where there is no corruption and vice versa. Despite this however, there are potentially links between the two. Thus, it would be wise to consider conflict of interest prevention as part of a broader policy to prevent and combat corruption. Situated in this context, conflict of interest policies are an important instrument for building public sector integrity. 41 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 5. Integrity Risks at the Organizational Level Additionally, the use of consultants in the tender preparation can create conflicts of interest for the following reasons: \u2022 When consultants are engaged in the preparation of projects and tenders, such as preparing feasibility studies, project design and even drafting the terms of reference, public purchasers have to make a decision with respect to conflict of interest. Are those consultant firms eligible to take part in the following tender or will their participation constitute a conflict of interest? Generally, the policy is that those firms are not allowed to participate in a tender in which they have had a significant prior involvement. \u2022 Ownership or economic ties might lead to a conflict of interest in the bidding process. Bidding firms or subcontractors might appear under a common ownership or financial umbrella, but act as individual firms under different names. It might also be the case that the manufacturing firm owns wholly, or partly, a consulting firm that has prepared the tender (terms of reference or TOR) where the manufacturing firm participates in the bidding. \u2022 Bidders might have the same possibilities as public officials to have personnel with interests and background in the public administration, which might affect the impartiality and cause a conflict of interest in the procurement process. The level of discretion in a public procurement system is determined by the application of rules and procedures; the authorization and decision-making rules and instruments; and the design, capacity and independence of the structure for control and legal enforcement. In the absence of natural incentives and control mechanisms, as in the private sector (profit drivers), a regulatory and institutional framework is put in place so that the political system can assume accountability for public sector decisions and operations. In a politically corrupt procurement context and environment, the legal and institutional frameworks operate in opposite directions to allow for excess discretion and exemptions from competitive tendering, as well as to minimize the impacts of the accountability instruments. Such an environment is often characterized by a weak legal and institutional framework, politicized management structure of the bureaucracy, undue executive or influential power to politically appoint non-merit based managers in the public procurement process, lack of necessary corrective means in the control structures, and a lack of an independent and adequately powerful judiciary. This can lead to incorrect procurement decisions, excess costs, loss of credibility and weakened competitiveness and market attractiveness. As discussed in this Guidebook, an excessively stringent rule-based approach deprives procurement organizations the amount of flexibility needed to achieve the best economic results (the \u201cpolicy choice dilemma\u201d). The challenge is to strike the right balance between different, or even conflicting, policy objectives in the design of the regulatory framework. It is important to analyse to what extent the current authorization rules are adequate for the purpose or need to be changed. Political and administrative accountability, together with transparency, is key in developing strong procurement capacity (Beke", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c124fd96-5def-468d-9c91-8f1bfec09e31": {"__data__": {"id_": "c124fd96-5def-468d-9c91-8f1bfec09e31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b88477a5f2e6a477f7f7ca1bca436b40604996666ee932c4c70238730688f2a6"}}, "hash": "b88477a5f2e6a477f7f7ca1bca436b40604996666ee932c4c70238730688f2a6", "text": "et al., 2013). Institutions should establish a clear and comprehensive set of rules and responsibilities for their procurements that include a clear division of roles between: (i) elected officials; (ii) senior management officials responsible for establishing and enforcing compliance with procurement rules; and (iii) front- line procurement professionals responsible for running specific projects. The regulatory framework should also address any loopholes or vagueness with respect to how procurement decisions are made and in terms of exemptions to competitive tendering. Lastly, the procurement organization should be strengthened by training and increased professionalism. Discretionary power 42 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Political interference should be defined as undue political influence on the decision-making processes within public procurement.17 Integrity problems occur when the political power of the administration, together with the managerial power, violate the fundamental principles of an efficient and sound state apparatus, as well as the overriding goal of public procurement, namely to deliver public services on the basis of \u201cvalue for money with integrity\u201d. Political influence over public procurement can be direct, with politicians interfering in the process in order to secure their personal, party or indirect interests (Trepte, 2005). Procurement officials will often take balanced decisions that not only include their own objectives (i.e. efficiency, value for money, competition, etc.), but also their political objectives (i.e. economic sector-specific or electoral interests). Nonetheless, the interactions between political actors, the private sector and public administrations are complex and the efforts to seek influence could balance between legality and illegality. Political interference 17 The dilemma is that the political system has a legitimate interest to be involved in public procurement in many key aspects, such as formulating policies on how procurement should be used as a strategic tool for the realization of political priorities and making investment decisions in infrastructure, health, education and environment. Subsequently, the political system even has a responsibility to ensure that the public administration executes policies in accordance with political decisions in all phases of the tendering processes. Political interference should therefore not be confused with legitimate political influence. Good examples of integrity risk management systems at the organizational level are found in Slovenia and the Netherlands (see Boxes 13 and 14). It should be noted that those integrity risk management systems do not directly focus on procurement organizations, but on the public administration in general. \u00a9 EJ John Nick T. Macasa/REACH Foundation 43 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 5. Integrity Risks at the Organizational Level Box 13. Self-assessment integrity tool for public institutions in the Netherlands Corruption risk assessment is obligatory in the Netherlands for all public sector institutions (ministries, provinces, water boards, municipalities, etc.). Corruption risk assessment is not based on a law. Instead, public sector institutions agree in writing to conduct these analyses (the agreement, although not a law, is considered to be binding). There are no sanctions for non- compliance with the agreement to conduct corruption risk assessment. However, if a public sector institution gets involved in an integrity breach and if internal integrity systems or control mechanisms turn out to be of poor quality, then the management will face consequences. The most used corruption risk assessment tool developed in the Netherlands for public sector organizations is the Self-Assessment Integrity or SAINT. This tool enables public sector organizations to assess their vulnerability and resilience to integrity violations and provides recommendations on how to improve integrity management. SAINT is designed to identify the main integrity weaknesses and risks, to significantly increase awareness of integrity, and to strengthen the organization\u2019s resilience in the face of identified shortcomings (therefore, the tool is not aimed at detecting and punishing concrete integrity violations). Being a self-assessment tool, SAINT demands that the organization itself take the initiative to test its integrity, which means that the assessment is based on the knowledge, opinions, ideas and recommendations of the staff. They receive methodological advice at a one-day workshop where they learn how to consider vulnerability and risk, as well as how to develop recommendations on minimizing them. The end product of the workshop is a concrete management report/action plan with recommendations on where measures must be taken to strengthen the organization\u2019s resilience in response to integrity violations. SAINT is based on the five-steps methodology: Step 1: Identification and assessment of areas of vulnerability inherent to the activities and processes of the organization (this can include contracting, document issuing, legislative activities, law application, relationships with the private sector, management of state property, etc.).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64151785-b9fe-4956-bf0a-5d3a129590c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "64151785-b9fe-4956-bf0a-5d3a129590c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebaf843462a3e1cbfd8ae60dc31a84b49b4a5bc67a3d974c0e5f45f130945c8f"}}, "hash": "ebaf843462a3e1cbfd8ae60dc31a84b49b4a5bc67a3d974c0e5f45f130945c8f", "text": "Step 2: Assessment of the factors increasing vulnerability (such as increasing complexity of work, rapid legal or other changes, management and personnel).

The integrity plan as a tool to establish and assess integrity in Slovenia In Slovenia, the integrity plan is a tool for establishing and verifying the integrity of public sector organizations and institutions. It is a documented process for assessing the level of vulnerability of an organization and its exposure to unethical and corrupt practices. It is devoted to: identifying relevant corruption risks in different working fields of an individual organization, assessing what kind of danger the corruption risks might pose to an individual organization, and determining measures to reduce or eliminate corruption risks. The main objective of the integrity plan is to systematically and comprehensively implement national and international standards, principles and objectives in the prevention of corruption. Furthermore, the integrity plan is used by institutions to determine their exposure, as well as the exposure or vulnerability of their organizational conditions, processes and employees, to corruption and other illegal and unethical behaviour. The idea of an integrity plan is based on the fact that the process of identifying risks and planning and implementing adequate measures to eliminate those risks should strengthen integrity and an anti-corruption culture in the public sector. Given that the integrity plan identifies and eliminates the causes of corruption, the rule of law and people\u2019s confidence in the institutions are consequently enhanced. In 2010, a new Integrity and Corruption Prevention Act was adopted and offered a new approach in drawing up the integrity plans by: introducing an obligation to draw up the integrity plans for more institutions than the previous act; providing a new and more descriptive methodology; providing a more detailed process of drawing up integrity plans (assessment of exposure, indicators for dividing into groups, etc.); and securing more transparency, given that it prescribes publication of the integrity plans. In particular, the integrity plan must consist of: \u2022 An assessment of corruption exposure of the institution. \u2022 Personal names and work posts of persons responsible for the integrity plan. \u2022 A description of organizational conditions, staff and typical work processes, as well as on corruption risk exposure. \u2022 Assessment and proposed improvements regarding: o The quality of regulations, management, administration, etc. o The integrity of staff and institution. o Transparency and efficiency of processes. o Measures for timely detection, prevention and elimination of corruption risks. o Other parts of the plan defined in the guidelines prepared by the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (CPC) of the Republic of Slovenia. The integrity plan implementation methodology, as prescribed by the Integrity and Corruption Prevention Act, was developed by CPC in the form of guidelines based on international conventions, standards and principles for fighting corruption transposed into the national legislation.

Integrity Risks at the Organizational Level 46 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific \u00a9 Ma. Khristine A. Fullante/UNDP 47 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 6. Integrity risks at the process level The process level refers to the pre-bidding, bidding and post-bidding phases. A comprehensive checklist on the identification and prevention of integrity risks in the procurement process is available in Annex 3. 6. Integrity Risks at the Process Level At the process level, a corrupt scheme in procurement can take various forms, ranging from a demand for or offer of payment, fraud to cover up the scheme, bid rigging, or a combination of these. \u2022 Demand for or offer of payment: A government official demands a bribe or kickback from a firm or individual, or a firm or individual offers a bribe, in exchange for a contract award. In most cases, the corrupt official will permit the bribe payer to inflate the price to cover the bribe and preserve its profits. Different types of corrupt payments include monetary payments, facilitation payments and additional indirect payments. \u2022 Fraud: To recover the cost of the bribe and to exploit the corrupt relationship, the firm, usually with the knowledge and complicity of government officials, inflates prices, bills for work not performed, fails to meet contract specifications or delivers substandard products during implementation. This often requires further corrupt facilitation payments to inspectors or auditors. \u2022 Bid rigging: To ensure that the contract will be awarded to the bribe-paying firm (whose prices are now inflated to cover the cost of the bribe), the actors manipulate the bidding process to exclude other (presumably cheaper) competitors. There are several different types of bid-rigging agreements, such as cover bidding, bid suppression, bid rotation, market sharing and price fixing (see Box 15). Bid-rigging conspiracies can remain undetected for many years, resulting in higher costs for goods and services, and depriving government purchasers\u2014and consequently taxpayers\u2014of the benefits of true competition. Although bid rigging can occur in any sector, some markets are more susceptible than others due to particular features of the product or market. The presence of the following factors, for example, might increase the need for vigilance: 48 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific \u2022 A small number of bidders: The fewer the bidders, the easier it is for bid rigging to occur. This is particularly so when you have the same bidders involved in repeated procurements. \u2022 Little or no new entry to the bidding market: A lack of new entrants into the bidding market might facilitate existing bid-rigging efforts. \u2022 Simple or identical products: If the goods or services being purchased are standardized, simple and do not change over time, it is easier for competitors to reach an agreement on price and to make that agreement longstanding. \u2022 Few substitutes: Where there are few, if any, suitable alternative goods or services, companies and individuals wishing to rig bids have the comfort of knowing that their efforts to raise prices are more likely to be successful. \u2022 Regular and recurring bidding: Regular bidding for the same product or service allows cartel members to allocate contracts among themselves. It also allows the cartel to credibly threaten to punish a member that acts against the interests of the cartel by targeting bids originally allocated to that member, and in that way, minimize deviations from the cartel agreement. \u2022 Existence of trade associations or other forums (professional or social) in which competitors are given the opportunity to get together and discuss matters face to face, coupled with predictable demand: A constant flow of demand tends to increase bid-rigging arrangements, whereas significant changes in demand or supply conditions can upset existing arrangements. Box 15. Types of bid-rigging agreements Cover bidding: Competitors agree to submit a bid that is higher in price than that of the cartel\u2019s designated winner, or the bid contains terms that are unacceptable to the purchaser. Such an agreement ensures that the bid of the designated winner is selected by the purchaser, while still giving the impression of competition. Bid suppression: Competitors agree not to submit a bid, or to withdraw a previously submitted bid, so that the cartel\u2019s designated bid will be selected.

Contracts might be allocated equally among competitors by volume or value, or the division might correspond to the respective sizes of each company. Market sharing (or market allocation): Competitors agree to divide up markets among themselves. This could be through the allocation of customers, products or geographic regions to particular members of the cartel. Following such an agreement, cartel members will rig bids to ensure that the winning tender is submitted by the party to whom that customer/product/region had been allocated. Price fixing: Competitors agree to raise, fix or otherwise maintain the price of a good or service by setting a minimum price, eliminating or reducing discounts, adopting a formula for computing prices, increasing prices or holding prices firm.

Integrity risks in public procurement at the process level 6. Integrity Risks at the Process Level The planning and preparation of the procurement process, including the design of tender documentation and contracting strategies, essentially determine the quality (value for money) of the outcome of the tendering process. The starting point is the preparatory phase with the annual and multi-annual budget exercises, including investment and feasibility studies, and the approval of the procurement plan with the attached budget and procurement strategy (procurement method). At this stage, integrity risks are found in possible political interference, expressed in terms of biased project selection, as well as investments made to satisfy a specific political interest, region, city or even a particular group of firms. Integrity risks might also occur in connection to the approval of diverse financing schemes, including public-private partnerships. At this stage, conflicts of interest are often a typical ingredient. Pre-bidding phase Source: World Bank, 2014 50 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Bidding phase The main purchasing activities at the bidding phase include the invitation of tenders with the publication of tender notices; clarification of tenders; receipt and opening of tenders; request for clarifications, qualification and evaluation of tenders; possible negotiations; and making award decisions. After the award decision is made and the contract concluded, information and debriefing of unsuccessful tenderers should be carried out. The tenderers should respond to the invitation of tenders by requesting the qualification or tender documentation, and if so requested, confirm its interest to participate. Other steps include planning and organizing the preparation of tenders, and reviewing the tender documentation (in particular the technical specifications), instructions to tenderers and draft contract conditions. All these actions are done in order to conclude to what extent the firm has the possibility of submitting a technically and contractually responsive and competitive tender. The preparation work also comprises of discussions on whether the firm should act on its own or form joint ventures with other firms, as well as the need for engaging sub-contractors, depending on the nature and size of the tender. Other important internal tasks would imply deciding the pricing strategy, agreeing with the bank on tender security, collecting qualifications and technical documentation, and finally, compiling the tender and making it ready for submission at the time and place stipulated. In case an e-auction will take place, the tenderers will need to decide on the pricing tactics. On the more operational side of the preparatory phase, the design and decision of the procurement plan, including the contracting strategy, represents one important integrity risk area.

The integrity risks might occur in all these steps, but the main risks are found in the modification of contract conditions. These include, in particular, the modification of prices and substitutions for products or services that are neither commercially justified nor in accordance with the applicable rules, as well as on non-delivery or non-fulfilment of contract obligations by the main contractor or sub-contractors. Incorrect approvals and execution of payments are other important integrity risks. Falsification of reports and files are often needed in order to cover illegal actions. Efficient external audit and financial control mechanisms are important tools to detect irregularities. Integrity risk indicators assess the presence of integrity risks in procurement. These indicators will not prove fraud, but will only highlight that the number of \u201cred lights\u201d or \u201cred flags\u201d is too high and that further investigation might be needed. In other words, red flags act as countermeasures to detect risks. More red flags indicate a higher chance of corruption, but say nothing about actual corruption in an individual case. Post-bidding phase 51 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 6. Integrity Risks at the Process Level Procurements with lots of red flags\u2014and thus a high chance of corruption\u2014might be non-corrupt, while procurement with no red flags\u2014and thus a low chance of corruption\u2014might still turn out to be corrupt. While chances of corruption and its actual presence might be misaligned in individual cases, the chance of corruption does allow estimates of the total number of corrupt cases in a large group. A checklist for the identification and prevention of integrity risk is included in Annex 3. Additionally, a list of risk mitigation actions to prevent and address conflicts of interest and bid rigging is presented in Annex 4. \u00a9 Shutterstock 52 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Box 16. How citizen monitoring promotes integrity in contract implementation: An experience from the Philippines In 2016, the Department of Education in the Philippines partnered with UNDP to implement the Department of Education Computerization Program, which aims to provide public schools with appropriate technologies to improve student learning and equip them with the knowledge and skills to be globally competitive. Under a national acceleration partnership,i using resources from the Department of Education, UNDP was tasked to procure, deliver and install computer packages worth about PhP2.8 billion (est. US$60 million) in almost 5,000 schools throughout the country, including in remote and disadvantaged areas. UNDP manages procurement activities by adhering to the general principles of best value for money; fairness, integrity and transparency; effective international competition; and the interest of UNDP and its partners. To ensure the highest standards of transparency and accountability, and to minimize corruption risks during the contract implementation phase, UNDP established a citizen monitoring system which allowed civil society organizations (CSOs) to use technology- based tracking of delivery and installation of the equipment. For this endeavour, UNDP partnered with CSOs that have a track record of monitoring the implementation of government contracts. These CSOs trained community-based monitors who were deployed to inspect four aspects: 1) school readiness, 2) product delivery to schools, 3) product installation, and 4) responsiveness of school management to citizens\u2019 feedback on readiness issues. School \u201creadiness\u201d in this instance meant having a room available for the computer laboratory, with adequate electrical outlets and wiring, desks and chairs, air conditioning or electric fans, and security grills and locks. The CSOs built coalitions in their regions to organize, prepare and mobilize community- based volunteers. They involved a variety of community representatives, including faith-based organizations; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) groups; parents and teacher associations; students and alumni; and marginalized sectors such as fisherfolk and persons with disabilities. UNDP and the CSO-partners developed simple online and mobile-based tools using open platforms in order to enhance the monitoring", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c10184f-b397-44aa-b4cf-fb3419f23cd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c10184f-b397-44aa-b4cf-fb3419f23cd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ace0578f4a505b3b1975d0d77f46301f18296fe0880a41e16e6132d9fd7b47e"}}, "hash": "8ace0578f4a505b3b1975d0d77f46301f18296fe0880a41e16e6132d9fd7b47e", "text": "process.

For instance, Google My Maps was used to build a \u201cOne Map\u201d showing the location of the beneficiary schools, as well as additional information, such as the readiness of information and photos from the delivery and installation. The information provided by the citizen monitors proved useful for UNDP and the Department of Education in managing the delivery and installation of the computer equipment, which included adjusting the schedules to give the schools ample time to prepare. The community-based monitors also went the extra mile to bridge the schools\u2019 needs with their local government units and other stakeholders.

Integrity Risks at the Process Level \u00a9 King Mark Baco (video screen grab)/UNDP The citizen-monitors also sent timely information to the Department of Education and UNDP on the quality and timeliness of delivery and installation, and reported on damaged or incomplete items, as well as on unforeseen events that hampered the process (such as a typhoon in the Bicol Region and an earthquake in the Caraga Region). Having external and impartial citizen monitoring helped avoid corruption and inefficiency risks and ensured that the goods procured reached the intended beneficiaries. At present, the Department of Education, UNDP and the CSO-partners are preparing for the mobilization of citizen-monitors for Lot 4 of the partnership,ii which covers the delivery and installation of information and communication technology equipment and solar power systems to nearly 4,000 energy-deficient schools nationwide. The Department of Education is also considering ways to strengthen citizen participation in procurement and public financial management. II The partnership is composed of four (4) lots: 1) computer laboratory packages for 184 stand-alone senior high schools; 2) computer laboratory packages for 889 specialised senior high schools; 3) desktop computers and laptops for 209 school division offices of the Department of Education; and 4) computer equipment and solar power systems for about 3,700 energy-deficient schools.

Poor understanding or awareness of management of integrity risks in the procurement process; 2. Lack of integrity risk management plans in general within the procuring entities; 3. No or insufficient guidance documentation on procurement integrity risks; 4. No training of staff available on integrity risks; 5. Insufficient internal control mechanisms in place; and 6. Insufficient follow-up or negligence of external audit decisions. 55 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 7. Integrity risks at the individual level The individual level refers to the specific requirements of the UNCAC under Article 9 where implementing states should take measures to regulate personnel matters of importance in order to secure the integrity of the individuals involved in the procurement process, such as declarations of interest and assets, and the adoption of a code of conduct. 7. Integrity Risks at the Individual Level \u00a9 Shutterstock 56 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Article 9(1) of the UNCAC suggests that implementing states should undertake \u201cmeasures to regulate matters regarding personnel responsible for procurement, such as declarations of interest in particular public procurements, screening procedures and training requirements\u201d in the course of establishing appropriate systems of procurement. In general, this clause refers to ethics regulations for officers and employees of procuring entities. Such regulations usually require procurement personnel (including public officials) to pursue ethical, fair and impartial procurement procedures in line with applicable legislation and tendering rules for a particular procurement. Article 8 of the UNCAC regarding codes of conduct for public officials has direct relevance to public procurement, including to procurement personnel. In paragraph 5, it refers in particular to \u201cmeasures and systems requiring public officials to make declarations to appropriate authorities regarding, inter alia, outside activities, employment, investments, assets and substantial gifts or benefits from which a conflict of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c2b5e9a-f58c-4dc1-9aab-bc402717cc22": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c2b5e9a-f58c-4dc1-9aab-bc402717cc22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "003a5d2a2fb6a6a5f6ec59be56fc6ab9ae64fced11052fcdee8d491d619270d0"}}, "hash": "003a5d2a2fb6a6a5f6ec59be56fc6ab9ae64fced11052fcdee8d491d619270d0", "text": "interest may result\u201d. Additionally, Article 9(1) of the UNCAC suggests instituting screening procedures for public officials. A comprehensive integrity risk assessment at the individual level must include not only the individuals directly involved in the procurement process, but also those individuals that indirectly participate or influence public procurement and might not be subject to the controls of the procurement system. These actors can include planning and budgeting officials, contract execution and management officials, and other key decision-makers. The following questions help identify integrity risks of public procurement at the individual level for all relevant personnel. Does your country\u2019s system of public procurement lay down any measures regulating matters regarding procurement personnel? Are there any screening procedures regarding procurement personnel? If so, do such screening procedures apply during the selection of the personnel and/or throughout their employment? Are there any requirements as to the training of procurement personnel? Does this training cover how to award contracts in line with the relevant public procurement legislation or how to award a contract in line with the relevant anti-corruption laws? Are procurement personnel required to declare any interests in a particular public procurement (e.g. due to a possible conflict of interest)? Are codes or standards of conduct for correct, honourable and proper performance of procurement personnel required by law? Box 17. Checklist questions on integrity risks in public procurement at the individual level The public procurement officials screening procedures could be used to assess prospective employees during the appointment process. Furthermore, it is suggested that entities address training requirements and that public officials concerned with procurement should have to declare any interest they might have in a particular procurement. 57 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 7. Integrity Risks at the Individual Level Summary of the main integrity risks at the individual level 1. No or insufficient regulation of ethical standards and behaviours for procurement management and staff; 2. No or undeveloped recruitment policy and career development for procurement officials; 3. Lack of institutionalized training in public procurement; and 4. Lack of screening procedures. The lack of professionalism and managerial accountability are the main integrity risks at the personal level. Unskilled, underperforming and unmotivated procurement managers and staff represent a huge problem in many national contexts, from both an integrity and performance perspective. Institutionalized training, better career opportunities and better working conditions for procurement officials need to be included in a national procurement development strategy. The ethical standards of the procuring entity staff, including the procurement staff, should be secured by a professional recruitment and development plan, as well as with the adoption of a code of conduct, proper rules on conflicts of interest, asset declarations when appropriate, and the signing of a declaration of impartiality during individual procurement processes. 58 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific \u00a9 Shutterstock 59 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 8. Addressing the integrity risks: Capacity development action plan 8. Addressing the Integrity Risks: Designing and Implementing a Capacity Development Action Plan The integrity review of the national public procurement system, based on the analytical framework and approach as described in this Guidebook, will help governments to identify strengths/weaknesses and critical capacity gaps in the public procurement system. The assessment exercise should not be seen as a stand-alone activity, but should result in the establishment of a priority framework, adopted by the government, for long-term public procurement integrity reform\u2014reflecting the specific country context\u2014 covering key aspects and components of the public procurement system, including all requirements under UNCAC. The priority framework, including a strategy and capacity development action plan for strengthening the integrity and the functionality of public procurement systems, would normally address first the regulatory and institutional frameworks, and secondly, the need of operational capacity development. A menu of options is presented below: governments can select those more suitable to their country context. 1. Ensure the adoption of a coherent, sound, and modern public procurement law\u2014with a full set of secondary legislation, guidance and model documentation\u2014covering all public sector entities (government, regional and local authorities, as well as utilities companies), meet the UNCAC requirements, and be compatible with international standards such as UNCITRAL, WTO GPA requirements and international good practices. 2. Ensure availability of a well-functioning and sufficiently resourced central institutional structure and capacity by clarifying responsibilities, functions and statuses of a Public Procurement Authority under a public procurement law. 3. Ensure the functionality and attractiveness", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02c0e8c5-5e9e-4c47-8065-848f0e78518d": {"__data__": {"id_": "02c0e8c5-5e9e-4c47-8065-848f0e78518d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a292e2ad0434e8bb45f415fa9da3c3eec59405f4495a7c3ea68d7a622eebe3d"}}, "hash": "8a292e2ad0434e8bb45f415fa9da3c3eec59405f4495a7c3ea68d7a622eebe3d", "text": "of the public procurement market, characterized by open and fair competition with no legal or technical discriminatory barriers for participation. \u00a9 Shutterstock 60 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 4. Develop e-procurement techniques to strengthen transparency and efficiency, and create the basis for developing statistical and monitoring systems. It should be linked to the budget, expenditure and payment systems. 5. Develop an effective statistics and reporting system that includes data on integrity risk indicators. 6. Consider implementation of centralized purchasing arrangements and framework agreements to increase efficiency and integrity. Centralized purchasing and framework agreements, correctly implemented, will generate better prices due to aggregation benefits, lower transaction costs, simplification, increased legal and contracting certainty, and compatibility and standardization gains. In addition, those instruments will also reduce the number of tenders (risk mitigation) and improve oversight, which might positively affect the integrity dimension of procurement operations. 7. Invest in the professionalization of the procurement function, management and staff, including strengthening the credibility of the procurement profession by developing a national training and career development strategy in public procurement and other capacity building measures (i.e. certification). 8. Establish an effective complaints review and remedies mechanism in compliance with the UNCAC requirements under the public procurement law. 9. Establish a procurement integrity consultation forum where the main stakeholders, such as the main purchasers, private sector organizations, civil society, budget and financial control, audit, and other controlling bodies of the procurement community, can be represented for exchanges of information and dialogue on important integrity matters. 10. Develop a performance measurement and indicator system based on the OECD/DAC methodology (need for an efficient data collection system). 11. Prepare a guideline on how to mitigate integrity risks in the public procurement process. 12. Prepare a guideline on how to specifically prevent and detect collusive practices. 13. Develop a special training system and materials on mitigating integrity risks in public procurement. 14. Strengthen the rules on conflicts of interest by adopting a code of conduct for both the public and private sector. 15. Introduce a secure whistleblower mechanism in order to give sufficient protection to actors. 16. Implement an integrity pact between the private sector and the contracting authorities to promote integrity in the tendering process, which should be reflected in the tender form for submission (part of the tender documentation). 17. Develop a management procurement integrity risk system, including for conflicts of interest, within contracting entities, covering key aspects of the procurement process, addressing the recruitment of procurement staff, the composition of tender committees, decision-making procedures, contract implementation, etc. 18. Increase transparency and accessibility to public records and documents. Engage civil society to scrutinize public procurement. 19. Initiate research on the extent and costs of corruption and fraud in the country by engaging universities and international organizations. 61 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 20. Prepare and implement awareness raising campaigns on integrity in public procurement should be prepared and implemented. 21. Develop a risk indicator system with red flags, which could signal potential problems in the procurement process. 22. Consider introducing a specific ex-ante control mechanism for tenders of important national interest. Ex-ante control refers to contexts where the intended procedure or process by the procuring entity is checked for compliance, budget control and financial viability, or other key aspects prior to or during the procurement process, and before any decision can be made by the procuring entity. 23. Other options would be to form special observatory mechanisms where external professional observers, under the public procurement law, have access to the procurement process during the tendering process, with the right to express opinions and to request remedial actions.18 Ultimately, the success of the procurement review by governments depends highly on how well the assessment exercise has been planned and managed, as well as consulted on with the wider national and international community. Box 18. Recommendations from the ASEAN Regional Business Integrity Conference During the ASEAN Regional Business Integrity Conference, held on 6-7 March 2017 in Singapore, UNDP organized, together with the ASEAN Corporate Social Responsibility Network, a workshop on \u201cMitigating risks in public procurement: tools and good practices\u201d.

Participants stated that a wide variety of stakeholders need to be involved to make sure that public procurement is conducted fairly and efficiently in a competitive and clean environment. 8. Addressing the Integrity Risks: Designing and Implementing a Capacity Development Action Plan 18 See the Public Procurement Authority in Romania for an example <www.anap.gov.ro> 62 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific A series of actions were recommended by participants to the different actors involved in the process (governments, private companies and civil society) to ensure that the public procurement system is fair, effective and free from corruption, as illustrated in the following figure. Figure 10. Stakeholders\u2019 actions to build a fair and effective public procurement system \u2022 Adopt e-procurement systems. \u2022 Design specifications fairly and involve third parties. \u2022 Tender lots so that SMEs can participate in competition for contracts. \u2022 Ensure sufficient time for preparing bids. \u2022 Review bids to identify red flags and collusion. \u2022 Set up a competition authority to avoid the creation of cartels. \u2022 Set up independent review and protest mechanisms. \u2022 Empower and motivate public officials through training and rewards. CIVIL SOCIETY GOVERNMENTS PRIVATE SECTOR \u2022 Train citizens to monitor public contracts. \u2022 Cooperate with the private sector to hold governments accountable. \u2022 Set up collective platforms among companies. \u2022 Put in place corruption prevention mechanisms along the supply chain. \u2022 Have multi-national companies train the SMEs on supply chain integrity and compliance with international standards and regulations. \u2022 Adopt integrity pacts and involve CSOs as monitors. \u2022 Adopt open government initiatives. 63 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific 9. Conclusions 9. Concluding Remarks This Guidebook is one of the responses offered by UNDP to the demands of governments in the region to improve their procurement systems in order to promote value for money with integrity, as well as ensure that public services are effectively delivered. It provides a pioneering methodology for working with a variety of stakeholders in identifying and mitigating integrity risks at the system, organizational, process and individual levels. This methodology was successfully piloted at the country level in Thailand and provided a basis for developing a roadmap for reforms based on a capacity development action plan. This Guidebook is published at a time when governments are preparing for the second UNCAC review cycle to support them in their efforts to upgrade their procurement and anti-corruption systems. We hope that governments will find it a user-friendly guide to navigate through the variety of existing procurement and integrity standards, measures and tools. Procurement is not just a process, but also a key instrument in a nation\u2019s development strategy. Tackling integrity risks in government contracts can trigger a virtuous cycle of ensuring higher quality public services, as well as pursue broader development results. In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, governments should consider investing in sound and corruption-free procurement systems that will lead to savings and thus unlock resources for financing development projects. UNDP stands ready to support governments in building sound public procurement systems to ensure that people are provided with the best infrastructure and services, and contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. 64 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Annexes \u00a9 Shutterstock 65 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement UNODC Guidebook on anti-corruption in public procurement and the management of public finances UNODC Legislative Guide on UNCAC UNODC Technical Guide on UNCAC 2015 OECD Recommendation on Public Procurement MAPS (Methodology for Assessing Procurement Systems) developed by the OECD/DAC and the World Bank UNDP Public Procurement Capacity Development Guide, 2010 Transparency International (Kuhn and Sherman), A", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f2b3411-e677-4b3f-b59e-abf5c628ab52": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f2b3411-e677-4b3f-b59e-abf5c628ab52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a982f231b023f30275f776017934a4cfde04f1da9f3ddb68985f9761e71d020"}}, "hash": "9a982f231b023f30275f776017934a4cfde04f1da9f3ddb68985f9761e71d020", "text": "Practical Guide for Curbing Corruption in Public Procurement, 2014 Annex 1.

Each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, take the necessary steps to establish appropriate systems of procurement, based on transparency, competition and objective criteria in decision-making, that are effective, inter alia, in preventing corruption. Such systems, which may take into account appropriate threshold values in their application, shall address, inter alia: (a) The public distribution of information relating to procurement procedures and contracts, including information on invitations to tender and relevant or pertinent information on the award of contracts, allowing potential tenderers sufficient time to prepare and submit their tenders; (b) The establishment, in advance, of conditions for participation, including selection and award criteria and tendering rules, and their publication; (c) The use of objective and predetermined criteria for public procurement decisions, in order to facilitate the subsequent verification of the correct application of the rules or procedures; (d) An effective system of domestic review, including an effective system of appeal, to ensure legal recourse and remedies in the event that the rules or procedures established pursuant to this paragraph are not followed; (e) Where appropriate, measures to regulate matters regarding personnel responsible for procurement, such as declaration of interest in particular public procurements, screening procedures and training requirements. 2. Each State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, take appropriate measures to promote transparency and accountability in the management of public finances. Such measures shall encompass, inter alia: (a) Procedures for the adoption of the national budget; (b) Timely reporting on revenue and expenditure; (c) A system of accounting and auditing standards and related oversight; (d) Effective and efficient systems of risk management and internal control; and (e) Where appropriate, corrective action in the case of failure to comply with the requirements established in this paragraph. 3. Each State Party shall take such civil and administrative measures as may be necessary, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its domestic law, to preserve the integrity of accounting books, records, financial statements or other documents related to public expenditure and revenue and to prevent the falsification of such documents. Annex 2. Article 9 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption19 I9 For more information on the convention, please see: https://www.unodc.org/documents/brussels/UN_Convention_Against_Corruption.pdf 67 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific The checklist below is presented in accordance with the integrity risk areas and circumstances for red flags as described in this Guidebook. It is separated into the three phases of a procurement cycle\u2014pre- bidding, bidding and post-bidding\u2014and begins with a general description of a risk area, followed by \u201cred flags\u201d or possible anomalies in tenders and suggested preventive measures. A \u201cyes\u201d answer to a red flag is usually a sign or warning that closer scrutiny is needed. This extra scrutiny might involve asking for more documents or information from the bidder or, as is often the case, looking for other related red flags. Receiving fewer than the expected number of bids, for example, could be an indicator of rigged specifications or other measures intended to exclude qualified bidders. If detected, procurement officials should look for other indicators of such schemes, as listed in this Guideline. Procurement officials should not, however, undertake an investigation of possible or suspected wrongdoings. If serious concerns remain after a preliminary review, the matter should be referred to the appropriate agency staff. Annex 3. A checklist for the identification and prevention of integrity risks in the procurement process Risk areas/Red flags Yes/No Preventive measures Risk area 1: The procurement plan includes unnecessary items The procurement plan should be in accordance with the budget and the approved requirements. The purpose of such actions is to exclude items paid by the public budget that can be used for private gains. As an example, a tender for building materials or tools may include a certain amount that can be redirected to a public official for private purposes. It may also be a matter of man/hours under a consultancy contract that can be used for a similar purpose.

Pre-bidding phase 68 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Risk areas/Red flags Yes/No Preventive measures Risk area 2: Unjustified use of methods other than open tendering (usually negotiations and direct contracting) Such methods might be legitimate contracting methods subject to special approval procedures. However, these contracting methods might also be used to steer contracts to favoured companies by avoiding competitive bidding. Attempts to avoid the use of competitive methods coincide with main integrity risks in public procurement. The regulatory frameworks include clear rules when a derogation (exemption from or relaxation of a rule) from the use of open tendering should be allowed. However, the possibility for exemptions is available and efforts to make a case for exemption can be appealing if there is an interest to act improperly. Another possibility to act improperly is to set time limits for the submission of tenders so narrowly that certain suppliers are favoured. Red flag \u2022 Inadequate or misleading justification or documentation is required by the regulations. \u2022 Ensure that the documentation for justifying procedures other than open tendering, or other acceptable competitive tendering, comply with the legal requirements. \u2022 Issue clear instructions and definitions on when an exceptional method can be used. \u2022 Be restrictive on the justifications and ensure a proper approval procedure. \u2022 Consider introducing possible invalidations of contracts and sanctions against any illegal uses of non-competitive procedures where a correct approval procedure has been neglected. \u2022 Certain contract amendments that would benefit from competition or where the items should have been procured separately (e.g. additional activities that are not a natural continuation of the existing contract) Risk area 3: Contract splitting The packaging of contracts is designed to attract as many qualified bidders as possible in order to secure the best price and quality. Legitimate considerations regarding decisions to package certain contracts include: the capacity of potential bidders to deliver the outputs specified, risks related to the bundling or unbundling of items, and sequencing of procurement actions in line with needs. Contract splitting might be a deliberate attempt to limit or entirely avoid competition. By splitting contracts into smaller packages, the need for a greater degree of review and less competitive procurement methods are made possible. Red flag \u2022 Unusual splits by issuing two or more contracts for identical items over a short period of time and for no apparent reason, resulting in the application of a less competitive procurement method. \u2022 Careful review by professional procurement and technical staff on the procurement plan and terms of reference. \u2022 Regular change of the composition of the tender committees for preparing the terms of reference. \u2022 Engagement of external experts or observers to the tender committees (at least for high- value contracts). \u2022 Procuring items by each sub-unit that should have been procured jointly. \u2022 Splitting items that are normally procured together in order to keep individual package values below thresholds. \u2022 Many awards just below thresholds. Awarding an unreasonably large number of contracts just below public procurement thresholds. Two or more related and simultaneous purchases from the same supplier in amounts just under the legal procurement threshold. 69 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Risk areas/Red flags Yes/No Preventive measures Risk area 4: Inappropriate bundling This risk area is the opposite of contract splitting, yet yields the same result of reduced competition. The public tender bundles a wide variety of goods that have no relation with each other into one lot (e.g. computer equipment, copper wires and video equipment), with a particular provision stipulating that incomplete lots are not allowed and would be considered non-responsive.

Risk area 5: Rigged terms of reference In a competitive market for goods and services, any specifications that seem to be drafted in a way that favours a particular company deserve closer scrutiny. For example, terms of reference that are too narrow can be used to exclude other qualified bidders or justify improper sole source awards. Unduly vague or broad specifications can allow an unqualified bidder to compete or justify fraudulent change orders after the contract is awarded. Sometimes there is a risk that project officials will go so far as to allow the favoured bidder to draft the specifications. TAILORED SPECIFICATIONS Red flag \u2022 Close similarity between the specifications and the winning bidder\u2019s product or services. \u2022 Draft the terms of reference by using international standards. \u2022 Use performance or outcome based specifications. \u2022 Always ensure inclusion of the wording \u201cor equivalent\u201d. \u2022 Careful and independent review of the terms of reference. \u2022 Proper procedures for the approval of terms of reference in accordance with the regulatory framework. \u2022 Regular change of composition of the committee for tender documentation. \u2022 Specifications stipulate the use of a brand name without stating \u201cor equivalent\u201d, contrary to national procurement rules. \u2022 Complaints from other bidders that the specifications match too closely to those of a single competitor or that a bidder prepared the contract specifications. 70 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Risk areas/Red flags Yes/No Preventive measures POOR SPECIFICATIONS Red flag \u2022 Vague, ambiguous or incomplete specifications. \u2022 Specifications are significantly narrower or broader than in previous similar procurement actions. \u2022 Few bids. \u2022 Only a few of the companies that purchase the bidding documents submit bids, especially if more than half drop out. \u2022 Relatively few companies submit bids compared to prior similar tenders. \u2022 Fewer than the normal or expected number of potential bidders apply for prequalification.

For example, that one of several line items in a request for bids will not be called for after the contract has been awarded or that a certain low-cost solution will be acceptable. This information invariably gives the bidder an unfair advantage by allowing the company to lower its price or otherwise tailor its bid to defeat its uninformed competitors. Project officials can facilitate the scheme by drafting vague specifications to further disadvantage competitors. Unbalanced bidding is also used to describe the practice of bidders quoting prices significantly below cost for some line items and prices significantly above cost for others, in the expectation that the procuring authority will request many more items for prices which have been inflated. As a result, the lowest responsive bidder, as determined at the time of contract award, may not constitute the lowest-cost solution.

Risk area 9: Unfair exclusion of qualified bidders Officials can facilitate the selection of a favoured bidder by improperly excluding other qualified bidders. This can take place at any time, from the drafting of the bidding documents to the receipt of bids. The exclusion of qualified bidders often triggers complaints as potential bidders invest time and money to prepare bids. Red flag \u2022 Unreasonable qualification criteria (e.g. abnormally high annual turnover or liquidity reserves, or years of experience in the country). \u2022 Ensure the availability of an effective complaint review mechanism. \u2022 Ensure that the applied qualification criteria are consistent with those of the tender documents. \u2022 Ensure that decisions on exclusion are based on relevant provisions of the regulatory framework. \u2022 Ensure that decisions on exclusion are made by authorized managers within the contracting authority following a proper evaluation procedure, including on records of the tender evaluation committee. \u2022 Unreasonable qualification criteria (e.g. abnormally high annual turnover or liquidity reserves, or years of experience in the country). \u2022 Qualified contractors fail to bid, indicating that the bidding may be rigged. \u2022 Companies complain that officials refuse to make bidding documents available to potential bidders or to accept the submission of bids (e.g. companies are coerced to refrain from bidding through subtle suggestions, firm statements, or intimidation and physical threats). 73 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Risk areas/Red flags Yes/No Preventive measures Risk area 10: Manipulated evaluation and award procedure Bid submission Bid submission is a sensitive area where late bids are accepted or where bids are tampered with or unfairly excluded. Bids must be received by the agency prior to the date and time indicated in the bidding documents. Corrupt project staff may: (i) accept late bids submitted by favoured bidders with inside information about prices from other bidders; (ii) tamper with the bids received, e.g. by discarding elements of the bid in order to disqualify the bidder; or (iii) exclude bidders by denying access to drop- off points or by failing to open bids. Bid opening A key risk in the bid opening phase is the manipulation of bid prices. The bid opening must be conducted in public at the address, date and time specified in the bidding documents. The bids should be opened immediately after the bid submission time. Various tactics may be used to steer contracts to favoured bidders, e.g. the price read aloud for the favoured bidder does not match the actual bid price or a \u201cnew\u201d price is later written into the bid.

Collect information about past tenders, and, if in the public sector, seek information from other public buyers who have recently purchased similar goods or services to improve your understanding. \u2022 In relation to the procurement process itself, there are a number of practical steps that you can take to minimize the risk of collusion: - As part of the integrity pact, include anti-collusion and conflict of interest clauses in your tender documents; - Warn bidders that all suspicions of collusion will be reported to the relevant authorities; - Require disclosure of all subcontracting arrangements that involve communications between competitors; - Require bidders, where possible, to sign a warranty that their bid has been independently developed and that there has been no communication with competitors, as well as no contract, arrangement or understanding entered into with competitors about price, bid submissions or terms of the bid, including quality and quantity of goods or services; and - If such a warranty cannot be signed, seek disclosure of contacts with competitors with regard to the bid. 78 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific \u2022 Reserve the right to not award the contract if there are suspicions of collusion. \u2022 Ensure the largest number of potential bidders. The probability of bid rigging increases if you have a small number of potential bidders. \u2022 Keep tender requirements clear and easy to follow, thereby encouraging more companies to bid. \u2022 Think carefully about unnecessary restrictions on bidders that might eliminate companies that are in fact qualified for task. \u2022 Facilitate bidding and keep the costs of bidding down. Allow adequate time for bid preparation, use electronic portals, do not require information that is of little use, and keep amendments to the forms/ processes to a minimum. \u2022 Ensure anonymity of bidders. \u2022 Consider allowing bids only on a portion of a large contract (dividing into lots), thereby allowing small and medium-sized companies to participate. \u2022 Make it harder for bidders to communicate and agree on a strategy. In particular: - Avoid unnecessarily presenting the bidders with opportunities to communicate with each other (e.g. at pre-bid face-to-face meetings or at site inspections); - If pre-bid meetings are necessary, mitigate the risk of collusion by, for example, reminding attendees of their obligations (see above); and - Where possible and practical, keep the identity of bidders undisclosed to make it more difficult for cartel members to contact all bidders. \u2022 Try to avoid predictable procurement patterns that facilitate bid-rigging schemes (e.g. vary the scope of successive contracts by aggregating or disaggregating contracts). \u2022 Ensure any external consultants used have signed confidentiality agreements and are subject to a reporting requirement in respect of inappropriate competitor behaviour. \u2022 Define terms of reference in terms of what you want the product to do rather than by reference to specific products. Use internationals standards. \u2022 Provide training for all procurement staff to detect and deter cartels, and to design a procurement process that is less susceptible to collusion. 79 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific E-procurement tools, framework agreements and centralized purchasing are examples of procurement instruments with an increasing popularity within the international procurement community that may mitigate integrity risks in the procurement process. E-procurement E-procurement has become a key component in the reform and modernization of public procurement frameworks in many countries worldwide (UNODC, 2013). The use of electronic procurement can be very efficient in increasing competition and transparency, and can therefore greatly help in reducing corruption in public procurement. E-procurement tools include the electronic publication of contract opportunities, the electronic distribution of tender documents and the electronic submission of bids.

This could be particularly helpful in the assessment of offered prices, to assess whether bid prices are reasonable and in line with market rates (e.g. by benchmarking collected data such as prices/price items in an electronic database with offered prices in a particular tender procedure in order to detect overpricing or bid rigging). Electronic data collection and data management in the area of public procurement could also constitute an important tool in helping to comply with Article 9(3) of the UNCAC, which requires its parties to preserve the integrity of its records, including accounting books or other documents related to public expenditure. For all the reasons mentioned above, States Parties to the UNCAC adopted resolution 3/2 on preventive measures. This resolution invites States Parties \u201cto consider the use of computerized systems to govern public procurement\u201d. The use of e-procurement is well suited to assisting countries in establishing systems of public procurement based on the fundamental principles of transparency, competition and objective decision-making as required by Article 9 of the UNCAC. Framework agreements A framework agreement is an agreement between one or more contracting authorities and one or more firms, the purpose of which is to establish the terms governing contracts to be awarded during a given period, in particular with regard to price and, where appropriate, the quantity envisaged. A framework agreement is a type of purchasing arrangement that will follow the rules of one of the tendering procedures foreseen by the regulatory framework for all phases up to the award of contracts based on that framework agreement (in practice, in the majority of cases, open tendering procedures are used). This purchasing arrangement is characterized by two main stages: the award of the framework agreement itself to one or more firms, and the award of the individual call-off contracts under the concluded framework agreement. The duration of a framework agreement is usually up to four years. Annex 5. Modern procurement instruments 80 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Framework agreements are commonly and actually growingly practised in many procurement systems around the world. There are a number of advantages recognized. It simplifies the acquisition process extensively and reduces the number of tenders, thereby affecting the transaction costs positively. From an integrity perspective, it simplifies audit and financial control. On the other hand, it might have negative effects on the competition and might make the participation of SMEs more difficult. Centralized purchasing A central purchasing body is commonly defined internationally as a contracting authority that:16 \u2022 Acquires goods or services intended for one or more contracting authorities; \u2022 Awards public contracts for works, goods or services intended for one or more contracting authorities; or \u2022 Concludes framework agreements for works, goods or services intended for one or more contracting authorities. Procuring entities might purchase works, supplies or services from or through a central purchasing body in product and service areas of common interest within the public administration. Procuring entities that purchase works, supplies or services from or through a central purchasing body shall be deemed to have complied with the legal framework insofar as the central purchasing body has complied with it. Savings, in terms of better prices and lower transaction costs, constitute the main rationale for establishing and operating centralized purchasing arrangements. Other main factors of a non-economic nature are simplicity; legal, technical and contractual certainty; and the need for standardization and support of important policy goals of the government, such as those concerning the environment and social issues. From an integrity perspective, the government might have better opportunities to control the processes than under a fully decentralized system, but observe that centralized purchasing should only be introduced in areas covering goods and services of common interest, such as in office supplies and pharmaceuticals. Both framework agreements and centralized purchasing are excellent instruments in the context of e-procurement. 16 EU Directive, 2014/24/EU. 81 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Choice of regulatory instrument Public procurement laws (PPL) will provide the greatest degree of legal certainty and the highest guarantee of compliance, as they are difficult to amend since they require an act of parliament.

Stakeholders usually have more confidence in such high level acts and are more likely to apply them. It is important that the supply market, business community and tenderers are also familiar with all the applicable rules. This does not always mean that they should be contained in a PPL, but it does mean that they should receive adequate publicity. In terms of enforcement, it is probably the case that all legal norms can be enforced by tenderers, but lower status norms such as regulations, might prove less amenable to enforcement. Institutional structure The PPL will establish the necessary institutions, such as the regulatory authority, and will include a definition of its functions, authorities and duties (see the following sections). It will also explain the role and powers of any approval authorities, if appropriate. This will link to delegations of financial authorities. Critically, it will define the role of the procuring entity and explain how the procurement function is organized within the procuring entity, with emphasis on lines of responsibility and accountability. Where different committees are used (e.g. bid opening, bid evaluation), these will also be described. Finally, the law will set out the identity and procedures of the enforcement authority (for complaints) and explain the complementary role of the supervisory authorities (e.g. audit or anti-corruption). Integrity The PPL will set out the requirements relating to integrity and probity. It will establish provisions relating to fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest. It also will spell out any specific requirements relating to committee members (e.g. statements of an absence of conflict), procurement officers and others connected to the procurement process which could lead to disciplinary actions, as well as for bidders, including debarment issues. Scope and coverage The procurement rules will apply to certain entities and activities only, i.e. the procuring entities which will be defined based on their identity, function or use of national budget, as well as state-owned enterprises and utilities. The law will also define what contracts are covered in terms of their nature (works, supplies, physical services and consultancy services) as well in terms of form (e.g. whether purchase, rental etc.). A PPL will commonly apply only above certain financial thresholds and will set out the various levels differentiated, according to contract type, and will include methods of calculation, aggregation rules to enable scale economies, and a prohibition of fractioning. The scope of application needs to be clearly defined in the PPL as well as under what circumstances an exemption to the PPL is accepted. Less strict exemptions to the regulatory framework constitute a main integrity risk in public procurement. Annex 6. The legislative and regulatory framework: Basic content and good practices 82 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Organization of procurement The key process for procurement needs to be spelled out. This includes planning issues (e.g. pre- publication of annual requirements to notify the supply base of impending procurements); the preparation and content of tender documents; the possibility of holding site visits and pre-bid meetings; how to deal with clarifications and responses (e.g. responses provided only in writing to all bidders simultaneously); and any implications in terms of extensions of time for bid submission. Procurement methods These will be established in the PPL, especially with regard to conditions for the use of alternative methods. Generally, open tender procedures will be the default method, and this can be used with pre- qualification or can be carried out in two stages for complex procurement. Alternative procurement methods, such as limited tendering or negotiated procedures, will be foreseen to provide for flexibility, but these will be available only on certain conditions and will offer various possibilities (e.g. direct contracting in emergency situations). Technical specifications These are often a cause of problems in procurement, including from an integrity risk angle, so the PPL needs to spell out the requirements very carefully. It will define the type of specifications permitted, e.g. whether design-based (including detailed design drawings, material specifications, bill of quantities, etc.) or performance-based, laying down capacity and performance requirements for specific purposes. They could also refer to physical properties and materials to be used, e.g. in the case of commodities. The law would also cover the use of industry standards, including those needed for testing, certification, inspection, etc. Critically, the law must also apply the principle of the neutrality of specifications so that no bidder is preferred by the use of specific brand names or processes.

Selection criteria The PPL will set out the qualifications that will allow bidders to participate in the procurement. These will not only include eligibility issues, such as the provenance of goods and nationality (also trade embargoes), as well as grounds for exclusion (e.g. non-payment of taxes, insolvency issues or cases of debarment), but will also refer to detailed technical or professional capacity and experience, suitability to pursue a professional activity, and the bidders\u2019 economic and financial standing. It will cover the question of evidence to prove the criteria and should also provide for the provision of evidence by both single and joint bidders. Evaluation criteria This is of course key to procurement and the PPL will set out which methods are to be used, e.g. lowest price or lowest evaluated price, or most economically advantageous tender, depending on which international model is used. It also will set out what criteria can be used (e.g. commitment to spare parts, environmental friendliness, etc.) and how they are to be measured\u2014by way of monetary values, a merit point system and life-cycle costing. The law would also cover issues such as pricing for sustainability and domestic preferences, what to do in the event of abnormally low tenders, and how to accommodate variations. 83 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Tender invitation The PPL will address the provision and format of the tender documents to the bidders. This will differ depending on the method, e.g. two-stage tendering (competitive dialogue), invitation to pre-qualify, requests for quotations, direct contracting invitations, and requests for proposals in the case of consultancy. It will provide for the availability of documents (contact details and cost of purchase) and will provide for modern methods of delivery through electronic procurement methods where documents can be downloaded. Advertising and time limits The PPL will also set out requirements for the form of the various advertisements needed, e.g. for annual requirements (general notice) and procurement notices (specific notice), as well as details of the minimum content requirements. It will refer to the degree of publicity required, e.g. whether through print media, electronic media or by sending individual notices after publication. Minimum time limits are given for bid submissions. These will differentiate between national and international competition, will usually give credit for the use of electronic media, and will provide shorter limits in special cases such as emergencies. The nature and size of the contract will determine the extent of time limits for submission of tenders, normally with a minimum between 10 and 40 days. Conditions for participation These refer to the formal requirements, such as use of forms, insertion of bids into envelopes, required signatures and powers of attorney, certificates, bid validity periods and bid securities. Submission and opening of tenders Other formalities also apply to tender submission and opening, which are designed to guarantee the integrity of the process. The PPL will provide for details concerning the time and place of submissions, the formal submission requirements (e.g. envelopes, number of copies and how marked), and modifications and withdrawal before submission deadline. It will also set out whether there is to be a public bid opening or not and, if yes, will provide for such things as bid opening committees, the announcement and recording of data, whether there are to be multiple openings (technical and financial), and dealing with the issue of late submissions. Tender evaluation This concerns the formal process of evaluation where the law will address such issues as the establishment of an evaluation committee, if appropriate, the method of evaluation (joint, individual), and will provide for the existence of an evaluation matrix. It will consider majority voting and dissenting opinions and the participation of staff with technical expertise. The PPL will also consider a number of eventualities, such as the need for the correction of arithmetical errors and clarifications, as well as record-keeping issues. Award of contract This concerns the authority to award and the form of contract. This is subject to national laws that regulate formalities and signatures for contract formation, entry into force, and the possibility of any conditionalities. The PPL will also address the need for the successful bidder to provide performance securities, as appropriate. If standstill periods are included as part of the enforcement mechanism, then this will be set out here as well. 84 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific Debriefing This is an important element of the system and is required", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acbe8daa-fc2b-4d03-889c-17ee8a9245c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "acbe8daa-fc2b-4d03-889c-17ee8a9245c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tackling Integrity Risks in Government Contracts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f0aa714759dc1ccac6b9e1f260c3111fcf6873f97fa8fec37eb66742ecd8bfe"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8ada0e5-c52b-4363-8a2a-e9b4cc74d1a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tackling-integrity-risks-government-contracts", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab768a89995e55b8f73b659ff7b06239a12a3b720329b1b3cda2836095468df5"}}, "hash": "4d9441eeea888ebe0adce21890e9b79b6eec4478d7cf9cd607d1ec7e2e8263d2", "text": "for two purposes: to explain to bidders why they were rejected and how they could improve, and to provide evidence, if any, of non-compliance.

Enforcement The critical element of enforcement must also be dealt with in the law. It will address the right to complain, the forum for complaints, the requirements for submission of complaints, the procedure to be followed and the timing of the steps of the process, as well as the consequence of complaints. Appeals from decisions on first tier complaints will also be covered. Final provisions These will include such things as reporting and recording requirements, the power to make regulations, any required repeals, savings and amendments, explicit reference to the date of entry into force of the provisions, and any foreseen transitional arrangements. 85 Tackling integrity risks in government contracts: An opportunity to unlock resources for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific The following is a proposed outline of the report on national public procurement integrity risk assessment.

Resilient nations. ISSUE PAPER Marginalized people and communities face additional barriers to accessing services, such as stigma, discrimination and punitive legal environments. Without specific attention to their unique needs and circumstances, they could be left out of development gains including UHC. This is a key gap that has not received adequate attention in UHC policy discussions. An explicit focus on equity for the excluded and most vulnerable populations in society is critical for the success of UHC and for realizing the principle of \u2018leaving no one behind,\u2019 which underlies the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This includes persons with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, people living with HIV, and stateless and undocumented migrants, among others. Thailand has demonstrated that UHC can be designed and implemented with a strong sense of social justice and social accountability towards marginalized and vulnerable populations. Thailand\u2019s experience and innovative approaches can provide examples for other countries on incorporating equity and social justice as part of efforts towards achieving UHC. As part of UHC efforts, Thailand has introduced a health coverage scheme for stateless people and undocumented migrants working and living in the country. Thailand also has unique policies to facilitate service provision for people living with HIV, as well as to enable the participation of marginalized communities in UHC decision-making processes. In partnership with the government, communities and UN agencies, UNDP supports countries to address their unique needs and equity in UHC policy discussions, capacity development of health service providers, and enabling legal environment. It leverages its experience in the governance of HIV response with particular focus on the marginalized such as people/women living with HIV, men who have sex with men, and transgender persons. One of the key challenges for achieving health coverage that is truly universal is equity \u2013 yet this important aspect is often neglected. Investing in policies and systems that explicitly address the needs of the most marginalized and excluded is essential to the success of universal health coverage (UHC). This Issue Paper highlights experience from Thailand in embedding equity in UHC, and provides lessons to promote policies that \u2018leave no one behind\u2019. It is based on a forthcoming publication by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): The Journey of Universal Access to Antiretroviral Treatment in Thailand, which examines efforts to pursue universal access to treatment for people living with HIV and features various equity-oriented policies and mechanisms.

Since 1975, a gradual extension of financial risk protection, using a piecemeal approach, has been applied targeting different population groups[1]. The publicly financed Medical Welfare Scheme, free at point of service, for the low income households was initiated and later extended to cover vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children aged under 12 years and persons with disabilities. Through the 1980 Decree, government employees and their dependants were covered by a publicly funded welfare scheme named the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS). The Social Health Insurance (SHI) scheme, financed through a payroll tax covered the private sector employees through legislation under the 1990 Social Security Act. In 1984, the non-poor informal sector who are not eligible for the Medical Welfare Scheme were covered by a Community Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme funded by low cost premium contributions. This later was transformed to a publicly subsidized voluntary health insurance scheme where the government subsidized half of the premium. In 2002, Thailand reached full population coverage. Beneficiaries in the Medical Welfare Schemes, beneficiaries under the CBHI and the uninsured 30 percent of the population, were combined and covered by a new Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS). The UCS was financed from general taxation, the most progressive source of finance as the rich pay a larger share of their income to taxes than do the poor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6724736c-20fb-40e5-83ac-e3dbe705f1f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6724736c-20fb-40e5-83ac-e3dbe705f1f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-paper-embedding-equity-universal-health-coverage-schemes-lessons-learned-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Issue Paper - Embedding Equity in Universal Health Coverage Schemes: Lessons Learned from Thailand", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-paper-embedding-equity-universal-health-coverage-schemes-lessons-learned-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e3c0bb6d747f1201b0b2bd01181878906e67545c08876b41b5e614f751142c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb8170a9-5a95-47e0-9932-7e26907c1e29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/issue-paper-embedding-equity-universal-health-coverage-schemes-lessons-learned-thailand", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "325f42282cae82408a6bd4e36ebf30a394f28914a6e49708c3cba705edd9770f"}}, "hash": "0134f1f633a7bd4f3a4c04f38ff775b58d65ac776a4355b0c571d4ad5e2e2ec8", "text": "The benefit package for the UCS was to harmonize across two other public health insurance schemes, the CSMBS and SHI.

The comprehensive benefit package and free at point of service results in a high level of financial risk protection for citizens, especially the poor who cannot afford to pay or copay at the point of service. It is the extensive geographical coverage of district health systems (DHS) and referral services to provincial hospitals that contribute to equitable access to diagnosis and treatment by all affected individuals. This fosters heath equity as the poor access to these services without financial barriers. Apart from good health outcomes[2], the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure in both rich and poor households has declined[3]. Pro- poor utilization results in pro-poor government health budget subsidies, as measured by the benefit incidence [4],[5]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), initially excluded from the UCS benefit package due to its high cost, became universal in 2003. This was achieved as a result of local production of triple medicines by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization at affordable price, as well as because of strong voices by the community of affected people. The cost of ART was made affordable by the government, around US$300 per patient year. Other associated services such as laboratory costs and treatment of clinical complications from ART were also fully covered. Additionally, various policies and mechanisms were instituted to ensure the provision and use of available services by people living with HIV, who were, and still are in some cases, highly stigmatized and discriminated against. For example, once registered in the ART systems, people living with HIV can use another unique ID number instead of the Citizen ID number to protect confidentiality. They are also allowed to access health care facilities outside their registered locality so that they can avail HIV-related services without the fear of being seen by friends or neighbours. Furthermore, a separate budget dedicated to ART was established under UCS, outside the capitation payment for outpatient services, to incentivize service providers to provide adequate HIV-related services under the capitation-based payment of UCS. ART averts HIV related mortality and improved quality of life of affected individuals, who are among the most vulnerable 2 EMBEDDED EQUITY: PROGRESSIVE REALIZATION OF UHC IN THAILAND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE SCHEME (UCS): PRO-EQUITY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION 3 in the Thai society[6]. Lives saved results in improved economic livelihood of families and prevents young children from becoming orphans. Equity prevailed when it came to a decision on high cost dialysis. At the 2001 UCS inception, renal replacement therapy (RRT) for patients suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD) was excluded, due mainly to its high cost[7]. Large gaps of inequity was intolerant by policy makers; CSMBS and SHI fully covers RRT for their members, while less affluent UCS patients having to pay for RRT services face catastrophic health spending or partial dialysis, often ending up with mortality leaving a huge debt behind or forcing the sale of assets to cover expensive dialysis bills[8]. With pressure from the ESRD patient group, political decisions were made to bring about universal access to RRT, based on equity across the three public insurance schemes and the right to health services as endorsed by the 2007 Constitution. Despite the fact that RRT was proven cost ineffective in technical evaluations, the decision to include it in the UCS benefit package clearly reflects equity, rights and social justice considerations for the most vulnerable in the Thai UHC policy. Recognizing cost ineffective RRT, early detection and prolongation of Chronic Kidney Diseases in progressing towards ESRD was fully funded by the UCS. The Medical Welfare Scheme covers the low income households regardless of nationality[9]. After UCS, the legal interpretation of \u201cThai citizen\u201d in the 2002 National Health Security Act as individuals of Thai nationality had negative consequences for stateless people. With pressure from civil society, lawyer and humanitarian activists, the Cabinet in 2010 launched \u201cHealth Insurance for People with Citizenship Problems\u201d whereby a separate annual budget was approved to facilitate access to health services among this group, while in parallel accelerating citizenship approval. Not only is the extension of health coverage to stateless people an equity-oriented policy, it also provides financial support to border health care facilities to maintain their services for other vulnerable rural Thai people[10]. The sizable populations of documented and undocumented migrant workers engaged in \u2018three D work\u2019 (dirty, dangerous and demeaning) and their families are covered by annual premiums financed by the voluntary health insurance scheme, managed by the Ministry of Public Health. This aims to expand coverage and access to services for this group.

The benefit package is very close to that of the UCS. The governing body of the UCS, the National Health Security board consists of 30 board members. It was chaired by the Minister of Public Health, central and local government ex-officios, experts and provider representatives, and four Civil Society Organization (CSO) representatives also play an active role on the Board, ensuring the voices of citizens are heard and decisions are made in the public interest. The inclusiveness of CSO constituencies in the governing body of the UCS has proven critical in safeguarding public interests, and therefore highlighted as a good governance practice. The dominant general tax financed scheme of UCS and CSMBS results in progressive financial incidence, where the rich pay a higher proportion of their income on personal income taxes than the poor. Evidence from the Health and Welfare Survey which is regularly conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) shows that the use of health services is preferentially in favour of the poor[4]. The \u201cclose to client\u201d DHS, easily accessed by mostly poor rural populations due to geographical proximity, is the major hub in implementing UCS with pro-poor and equity outcomes. Improved financial risk protection was achieved, as reflected by the very low and decreasing trend of incidence of catastrophic health expenditure[11],[12]. A Socioeconomic Survey conducted by NSO shows that average household health spending declined during the post-UCS period in the poorest and richest quintiles[13] (see Figure 1). An external assessment confirms good UCS outcomes[12]. 3 EMPIRICAL EVIDENCES: EQUITY AND FINANCIAL RISK PROTECTION 4 It is the implicit ideology among Ministry of Public Health predecessors during the 1970s, well before the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration, to adhere to the principle of \u201cgood enough for the most, not the excellence for a few\u201d[2]. This means, for example, that super- tertiary care is the best for a few urban elites who can easily access but primary health care delivered by DHS is good for the vast majority with proper referral backup. This ideology led to a three decade investment of DHS, the main platform for successful UCS implementation. The option of a basic minimum package was defeated and the decision was in favour of a comprehensive package. Expansion to cover high cost and catastrophic illnesses boosts financial risk protection such as ART, RRT and chemo and radiation therapy for cancers. These high cost services are not \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d as they are fully funded by annual budgets, though within fiscal space for health. Health expenditure increased from 10.4 percent of total government budget in 2001 to 17 percent in 2013[14]. Despite political conflicts in the last 14 years, UCS flourished across 8 rival governments, 7 prime ministers, and 13 health ministers[15]. The success was achieved through the tacit approach of the \u201cTriangle that Moves the Mountain\u201d[16], an analogy referring to a triangle of three synergistic efforts to overcome complex challenges. The three synergies in this case being: a) the political engagement and commitment; b) guided by evidence; and c) the role of civic movements and social mobilization. 4 Figure 1: Incidence of catastrophic health expenditure prior to UC (1996-2000) and after UC (2002-2009), national averages Incidence of catastrophic health spending by wealth quintiles, >10% household consumption, 1996-2009 5.1% 7.1% 3.4% 3.8% 3.7% 2.8% 2.8% 2.9% 6.0% 7.1% 5.0% 5.5% 5.6% 4.9% 3.7% 4.7% 6.1% 6.8% 0.0% 2.0% 4.0% 6.0% 8.0% 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2007 2008 2009 Q1 Q5 All quintiles Note: catastrophic health expenditure refers to household spending on health that exceeds 10% of total household consumption expenditure Source: Computed from SES, conducted by the National Statistical Office FEATURES CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH EQUITY AND FINANCIAL RISK PROTECTION 5 Thailand has demonstrated that the UCS design was guided by the principle of social justice, equity and social accountability towards the socially-marginalized and most vulnerable populations.

By illustrating Thailand\u2019s pro-equity approach, this Issue Paper reflects UNDP\u2019s commitment to supporting countries to address the challenges, needs, and rights of the excluded and most vulnerable populations. Examples of UNDP\u2019s work in this area are illustrated below. UNDP\u2019s support related to UHC with focus on equity, social justice and excluded populations UNDP supports countries to address equity considerations, corresponding capacity development and governance systems in UHC efforts with specific focus on the most marginalized and vulnerable. This is a key gap in UHC policy discussions today, which needs to be addressed early on if countries are to pursue universal health coverage that is truly effective and inclusive, and that \u2018leaves no one behind\u2019. UNDP has substantial experience and long engagement in addressing equity, rights and unique needs and circumstances of marginalized populations in the context of supporting countries to develop effective HIV responses. They include people/women living with HIV, sexual minorities (men who have sex with men, transgender people), sex workers and migrants. These marginalized groups, in comparison with other vulnerable populations, face additional barriers such as stigma, discrimination, breach of confidentiality and punitive legal environments. These additional barriers discourage the marginalized from accessing HIV- related information and services including HIV treatment even when they are widely available and free of charge. UHC efforts may risk such non-utilization of available services by the excluded and most vulnerable unless these barriers are appropriately addressed and acted upon at the policy and community levels. The following are examples of UNDP\u2019s equity-oriented and marginalized-focused work on UHC/health system strengthening in Asia and the Pacific region: Documentation and regional capacity building workshops on HIV-sensitive policies and mechanisms under Thailand\u2019s UHC, in partnership with Thailand\u2019s International Cooperation Agency, the National Health Security Office, and the Ministry of Public Health. Development and implementation of training modules to sensitize health care providers on unique circumstances and needs of transgender people, men who have sex with men (and their female intimate partners), in partnership with the World Health Organization. CONCLUDING REMARKS 6 Development of systems to record, monitor, and address rights violations and challenges such as service denial and harassment faced by sexual minorities and other marginalized populations under Indonesia\u2019s UHC, in partnership with Indonesia\u2019s National Human Rights Institution. Documentation of rights violations faced by women living with and affected by HIV at health care settings, and development of training modules to sensitize policy makers and health care providers on the subject. Development of capacity and legal frameworks to address the policy incoherence in relation to the rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health objectives including increased access to medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and medical devices, in partnership with other UN agencies. 7 REFERENCES 1.

Its mandate is to foster cooperation between its 53 members and 9 associate members. ESCAP provides the strategic link between the global and country-level programmes and issues. It supports governments in consolidating regional positions and advocates regional approaches to meeting the unique socioeconomic challenges in a globalizing world. The ESCAP office is located in Bangkok. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the region\u2019s many successes, it remains home to a large share of the world\u2019s poor. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants and technical assistance. The United Nations Development Programme partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in nearly 170 countries and territories, we offer global perspectives and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations.

This report provides a goal- by-goal snapshot of where we stand, including bright spots, hot spots and emerging issues for our region as we implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Limitations of data and the sheer complexity of the issues addressed by the 2030 Agenda have constrained this effort. Nonetheless, a picture emerges of a region that has, on the aggregate level, achieved several of the Millennium Development Goals but in which too many of its people are still not benefiting from growth and progress and are increasingly vulnerable to economic, social and environmental risks. In 2013, 400 million people lived on less than $1.90 per day (in 2011 PPP). With business-as-usual practices, we may not realize the brighter future that global leaders in 2015 committed to reach in 15 years\u2019 time. This outlook report provides a starting point for dialogue and will support follow-up and review at the regional level. It can also help governments and other stakeholders to reach much-needed social and political consensus and focus on the gaps and priorities for moving forward. It also focuses attention on the opportunities for bringing the Asia-Pacific region together in action on cross-cutting issues and in support of the countries that face multiple challenges. In conjunction with the Asia-Pacific SDG Data Portal, the Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook is the first knowledge product under a renewed partnership between the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Having come together to track progress on the Millennium Development Goals, this partnership now builds on its experiences to achieve the 2030 Agenda. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is ambitious and transformative, requiring a stronger push for coherent policies that create synergies and out-of-the-box thinking. It is an also an Agenda which, as intended by SDG 17, requires strengthened partnerships and regional action. The Asia- Pacific SDG outlook report can foster new ideas by providing an informed overview of where we stand as a region in relation to the SDGs and by highlighting those issues that will require a concerted effort to fulfil the dream of a region without poverty. 11 Regional outlook on the Sustainable Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by 193 United Nations Member States in September 2015, and its framework of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the results of a three-year global dialogue. Through extensive stakeholder engagement processes, this dialogue connected people in remote villages with the United Nations General Assembly in New York. With that increased participation comes an increased stake in the outcomes. Asian and Pacific governments have responded, moving from adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs to their implementation at the national level much faster than was the case with the Millennium Development Goals. Some countries have taken steps to integrate the SDGs into existing national development plans, policies and legislation, while many other governments are establishing or strengthening coordination bodies or mapping institutional responsibilities. There are reasons for optimism. The proactive response indicates that many governments are committed to change, and some have already proven that that they are capable of transforming. Poverty rates have fallen dramatically. Infrastructure investments are bearing fruit, and economic transformations are ripening. Social protection investments are being strengthened in at least 20 countries in the region. There is growing investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy, which have become the most economical solutions for new energy capacity in an increasing number of countries. High-level strategies and policy innovations indicate the readiness of governments to take the lead in transformation and innovation to achieve development goals. In Kyrgyzstan, Nepal and Singapore, for example, pioneering governments are bringing more balanced gender representation to parliament. In Indonesia, universal health care legislation has been passed, and in Thailand, universal health care is a national priority. Elsewhere, governments are actively supporting domestic industries attractive to investment. Investors are invited to Make In India, and there are new industrial policies in Bangladesh and Indonesia. China, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea are already global leaders in additive manufacturing, in which 3D printing technologies are applied. By examining the SDGs goal by goal, this report shows that governments will confront many common and fundamental challenges as they work to advance sustainable development. Increasing inequality in most countries points to systemic issues that entrench marginalization and exclusion and hamper the achievement of shared prosperity.

Shortcomings in the recognition and protection of human rights are a systemic issue that impacts the conditions under which many people work. The Asia and Pacific region has the largest number of victims of forced labour in the world, amounting to around 11.7 million people in 2012. Approximately one billion persons in the region are in vulnerable employment, with women significantly more likely than men to be affected. Simply by not having had their births registered, large numbers of people are excluded from education or social services\u2014as many as 70 per cent of the population is affected this way in one country alone. 13 Corruption is a systemic barrier to sustainable development that impacts the neediest of households. An estimated 40 per cent of investments in electricity, water and sanitation, for example, are lost due to corruption. The slow progress on these issues is often rooted in social, cultural, geographic and other factors and will continue to undermine poverty eradication and inclusive growth efforts, even if global economic prospects and foreign direct investment flows to the region improve. Gender inequality is one of the most fundamental challenges confronting the region. Tackling the shortcomings in gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment is urgent and long overdue. Education advances are not yet translating to more equal and just societies for half of the region\u2019s population. There are unacceptable levels of domestic violence with uneven judicial and other protection, disproportionately large numbers of women in vulnerable work, persistent harmful practices and institutionally entrenched injustices (for example, in relation to inheritance). The effect on the progress of countries to date is evident\u2014discriminatory practices coincide with lingering poverty and childhood vulnerability. In some countries, the proportion of stunted children was greater than 35 per cent in 2014. Almost every SDG has a gendered perspective\u2014because action on the gender-based inequities is the key to boosting the collective progress across the goals. Marginalization and exclusion are related to another fundamental and even more complex challenge: the capacity of regional economies to generate high-quality employment for all workers, particularly youth. Growth in real wages has not kept pace with increases in productivity, and employment creation is slowing. Some of the issues are structural while others are market related and institutional. And others are demographic, with increasing numbers among the populations who are of working age. At the same time, the region is growing old before it grows rich. Youth unemployment, marginalization and exclusion that, together, promote civil conflict are increasing the risks, especially as migration pressures intensify and other factors, such as climate change, increase the vulnerabilities. Education provides a foundation for progress. Although the region has achieved near-universal primary school enrolment, this success is poorly distributed within countries and communities, and its quality does not yet match the needs of this generation. Twenty-one million children in the region are not enrolled in primary school, and pre-primary enrolment rates are as low as 10 per cent. The most glaring deficits in education investment are in the least developed countries, where human capital formation will continue to undermine the prospects for slashing chronic poverty. A different quality of education is required for innovation, for entrepreneurship and for all learners to acquire knowledge on the complex challenges of sustainable development. In 2014, 44 countries received development assistance for education from the donor community; but the total amount of such assistance received by the region decreased by almost 8 per cent in only a few years\u2019 time (between 2011 and 2014). Although demand for a diversified range of food is growing, the agriculture sector and food security are underinvested. In some countries, the proportion of people who are undernourished has increased rather than decreased. Good health and well-being cannot be assured without food security, enhanced agricultural productivity and diversification. Climate change, land tenure, land-use policy, know-how and technology, access to production inputs as well as cross-border investments and trade policies are among the factors influencing the scale of the challenge in the agriculture sector, to varying degrees. Effective management of the natural resources, including fish stocks, is an important component of the regional food security challenge. Arable land per capita is decreasing, and about 85 per cent of the global fish stocks are fully fished, overfished or have collapsed. Coral reefs in the region, which are important for maintaining fish stocks, particularly for near-shore fishing, are already impacted by climate change. Around 40 per cent of the world\u2019s oceans are heavily affected by human activities and land\u2013ocean interactions. 14 Terrestrial ecosystem protection shortcomings are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d2d9e71-be92-4280-9768-24b08419fe4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d2d9e71-be92-4280-9768-24b08419fe4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f192f1016cd3856cd41cf661553df87a5b756dd61778eebc5db0c9d3ab1374c"}}, "hash": "0f192f1016cd3856cd41cf661553df87a5b756dd61778eebc5db0c9d3ab1374c", "text": "impacting rural livelihoods, food security and biodiversity in some of the most vulnerable areas of the region: rural areas, coastal communities and small island developing States. Water is perhaps the most fundamental resource and is under pressure across the region. Per capita water resources are declining, and some 80\u201390 per cent of wastewater is discharged without treatment in the region\u2019s developing countries. Between 1990 and 2010, per capita water availability dropped by more than one third in some countries, including some of the poorest. Groundwater contamination and depletion are growing concerns, although it remains difficult to assess to what degree. Failure to safeguard water resources will be an increasing challenge to overcoming the considerable level of unmet basic needs and to achieving the wider goals of agricultural diversification and food security\u2014and perhaps in the long term, social stability. The region is facing increasingly complex health challenges that, in many places, governments are not fully equipped to cope with. The outlook on SDG 2 on health and well-being is dimmed by the growing risks and challenges related to both communicable and non-communicable diseases, population ageing, cross-border epidemics, antimicrobial resilience, pollution and mental health. As a result, the outlook for other goals, such as in relation to poverty and economic growth, are also threatened. Investments in health care are inadequate in most countries; but when compared with the World Health Organization\u2019s estimate of a minimum of $44 per person per year, they are extremely low in the most impoverished of situations, with per capita spending as low as $4 per person. In some areas of health access (such as access to preventive medication for mother-to-child transmission of HIV), per capita spending is far below the global standards for some groups. Four non-communicable diseases are now the major causes of death and disability in Asia and the Pacific and are responsible for economic losses in the range of billions of dollars in India alone. According to the World Health Organization, of the most polluted 100 cities in the world, nearly 70 per cent are in Asia. High levels of chemical inputs for food production, pollution from plastics and textile industry waste, mercury and dioxin emissions are threats that require better chemical management. Life- cycle analysis and demand-side management are an integral part of the response to the increasingly complex health threats. This outlook report recognizes that change is a difficult process. Many of the issues discussed are long standing and persistent, and they may become future crises if not resolved. The capacity to catalyse societal transformation is an important element of governance for sustainable development. This involves setting a clear direction for transformations, creating the conditions to enable systemic changes and managing politically complex processes, including confronting issues of power and vested interests while recognizing the values and interests of all stakeholders. The strength of the relationships between governments and citizens and between and among all stakeholders will define the societal consensus on the ideals of the 2030 Agenda. A \u201chealthy\u201d social contract will be reflected in political and economic systems that equitably fulfil the needs of all stakeholders, including future generations and in both developing and industrialized countries. 15 Many transboundary issues will require a regional response, and there are many opportunities for joint action. Issues highlighted in this report with important transboundary dimensions include migration, trade and environmental protection, particularly in relation to water resources and cross-border investment. As well, regional economic integration, cooperation and dialogue will provide endless opportunities for strengthening the response to these shared concerns. Many of the SDGs deal with global and regional public goods, such as climate change, mitigation, digital connectivity, trade and investment agreements. Therefore, regional cooperation and partnerships for investing more in public goods are needed. This outlook report focuses attention on the need to strengthen policy coherence and recognize the links between the goals. Transformations for sustainable development require that the foundations described previously are built well and that links between the goals are better recognized and, in response, that more coherent policy frameworks are developed. Strengthened policy coherence is targeted within SDG 17 as a hallmark of an effective response to the integrated and interlinked 2030 Agenda. A review of policy frameworks as part of the implementation process for the 2030 Agenda can help to strengthen the policy response, ensuring that policies do not work against each other or against the people they are intended to support and that resources are efficiently allocated and used. Policy coherence also sends a distinctive signal, fostering initiatives and new partnerships to take on the complex issues, such as financial inclusion, food security, education", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "073a82d2-bc36-4847-8f4e-02fa815be3dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "073a82d2-bc36-4847-8f4e-02fa815be3dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "944b2e6a035af350d6b53a92ff9f539c9b357fa3445e541a992211637f52cc93"}}, "hash": "944b2e6a035af350d6b53a92ff9f539c9b357fa3445e541a992211637f52cc93", "text": "access and quality and providing services that meet the needs of people at \u201cthe bottom of the pyramid\u201d. In particular, policy coherence is necessary to achieve SDG 1 on poverty, SDG 2 on hunger and sustainable agriculture, SDG 8 on inclusive and sustainable economic growth, SDG 9 on industrialization, innovation and infrastructure and SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production. The regional outlook for achievement of the SDGs will be brightened by greater policy coherence in the following areas: \u2022\ufffd Economic growth, investment strategies and inequality. The labour share of GDP, comprising wages and social protection transfers, has increased in a few countries, including Australia, Georgia and New Zealand. However, the share is decreasing in East Asia and North-East Asia and in high-income economies. Decent work and economic diversification are foundations for SDG achievement and are needed to reduce inequality and poverty. The impact of capital and energy-intensive investments on poverty outcomes needs to be assessed, while the cultural, social, economic, geographic and other factors that underpin marginalization and exclusion should be dismantled in the context of inclusive growth strategies. \u2022\ufffd Youth unemployment, human capital formation and infrastructure development, in particular for information and communication technology connectivity. Access should be closely aligned with human capital formation strategies to enable countries to capitalize on the opportunities presented for innovation and entrepreneurship. Twenty countries have low broadband penetration rates, and there is the growing digital divide, while youth unemployment is a concern in both developed and industrialized countries. 16 \u2022\ufffd Trade and investment. Trade and investment policies should be better aligned with the fundamental requirements for sustainable development. For example, multilateral and bilateral free trade and investment agreement provisions can further mainstream public policy objectives related to health and food security. The continuing proliferation of preferential trade agreements, as opposed to strengthening of the multilateral trade system under the World Trade Organization, is complicating the global trade system in a way that places a greater burden on poorer, developing countries, and small and medium-sized enterprises within them. Furthermore, to harness the full potential of trade as a means of implementation, there is a need to contain the rising threat of protectionism, both in terms of tariffs and non-tariff measures. \u2022\ufffd Inclusive growth and climate change. Policies that are driving land-use change trends can undermine goals to support poverty eradication by creating increased vulnerability in rural areas to climate change. Strengthened policy coherence in relation to inclusive growth and investment and the protection of terrestrial ecosystems are needed to secure livelihoods, strengthen food security and ensure the continued flow of ecosystem services on which the achievement of the SDGs rests. Natural forest losses continue across the region, although plantations are expanding. \u2022\ufffd Greenhouse gas emissions. Although carbon intensities are decreasing, total emissions are still on the rise. Climate change and its impacts must be urgently tackled across the entire 2030 Agenda, given the vulnerabilities in the region. Levels of political commitment are high, and as of December 2016, 30 countries in the region had ratified the Paris Agreement and submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions. \u2022\ufffd Energy, technology and infrastructure. Action on climate change and growth policies must be integrated within poverty-reduction strategies. At the most basic level, bridging the access gaps in relation to energy and other forms of infrastructure should also respond to climate action. In East Asia and North-East Asia, only 61 per cent of people use modern forms of energy; in South-East Asia, it is only about half the population, while in South Asia and South-West Asia, it is only 35 per cent. The health impacts of using traditional fuels in the home and the gendered dimensions are well documented. Finally, implementing the SDGs in a transformative agenda requires new government capacities. The challenges of an interlinked and integrated agenda require governments and all stakeholders to develop a more concrete understanding of the interactions between the goals. This is fundamental to ensure that institutional structures for monitoring and implementation are representative of the relationships between the goals and the cross-cutting nature of many of them. Localized indicators, data collection and monitoring systems should also reflect these interlinks. Strengthened capacity to coordinate investments and strategies, to engage stakeholders and support effective and inclusive social dialogue will better equip governments to balance the interests of all stakeholders in society, including those of future generations. This will be the basis for ensuring that efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals are approached with a holistic understanding of their interactions and aligned with positive outcomes for everyone. 17 End poverty in all its forms everywhere OUTLOOK Countries in Asia and the Pacific", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05e41cd5-fb55-4e0e-b642-d1a9795c484b": {"__data__": {"id_": "05e41cd5-fb55-4e0e-b642-d1a9795c484b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f48a1b9b2b482ff206af5b6eead43bb5f2dcba70232d96db35d051f94515685"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d539d77-ca25-4172-926b-c0c8fbcfc661", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "242c3eb01d87d2a6bf2bde97de46eeb21a856ff61417e0fe86436db1214c9324"}}, "hash": "8255f47bada92699aa6e4af7c59d6bfbf6d7b5aeb59fab5ee296d8e5c58a4c83", "text": "have made important progress in reducing income poverty, and eradicating it is within reach. The primary challenge is to end poverty in all its forms1 everywhere while ensuring equitable and secure economic opportunities for all people and strengthening resilience, particularly in the face of new threats and risks, including as a result of climate change. Success will be highly dependent on several critical factors, including the effective targeting of social protection policies and job creation that increases support for the most vulnerable groups and marginalized communities of people. THE PHOTO Homes alongside railroad tracks, Dhaka, Bangladesh Photo credit: ADB 19 End poverty in all its forms everywhere INSIGHTS \u2022\ufffd Between 2010 and 2013, the poverty rate or the proportion of people living on less than $1.90 per day (in 2011 PPP2) in the Asia-Pacific region fell to 10.3 per cent of the total population, down from 29.7 per cent for the period 2000\u20132004. For the same period (2010\u20132013), the total number of people who are poor fell to 400 million.3 \u2022\ufffd When considering multidimensional poverty, at least 931 million people are impoverished across the region. Deprivations in health and living standards are the most striking.4 \u2022\ufffd Sticking to business-as-usual practices will not make any significant impact on poverty reduction. A more innovative and comprehensive approach is needed, with increased focus on reducing the economic, social and environmental risks confronting people who are poor and who are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks and/or living in marginalized communities. \u2022\ufffd Although there has been progress in the use of social protection programmes as a tool to address inequalities of opportunity (in health care and education, for instance) in the region,5 limited data disaggregation prevents the effective targeting of social protection and other policies to those who need it most. \u2022\ufffd People living on less than $1.90 per day (in 2011 PPP) are concentrated in rural areas, among the young ages and in agriculture sector employment. Having only a primary school education and large-sized households are common features of poor people in South and South-West Asia.6 \u2022\ufffd People in poverty are particularly more vulnerable to climate-related extreme events. They tend to live in hazard-prone areas, such as slums, steep slopes, seismic zones, floodplains, river banks and remote areas. Impoverished people lack the resources to invest in preventive measures, and they lack adequate savings to draw upon should disaster strike. Disasters are thus likely to push people who are poor into extreme poverty or push near-poor households into poverty. \u2022\ufffd Women are more vulnerable to various forms of poverty due to the challenges they encounter when seeking decent jobs, credit, health care and education. In particular, women are more likely to end up with informal employment and to receive lower wages than men for an equal amount of work because of the limited protection of their workers\u2019 rights, lack of wage- bargaining mechanisms and unsafe working conditions, typically while juggling the extra burden of unpaid care or household work. 20 SDG 1_NO POVERTY BRIGHT SPOTS Poverty reduction and eradication \u2022\ufffd Poverty rates ($1.90 per day) are below 1 per cent in countries like Azerbaijan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Russian Federation, Samoa, Thailand and Turkey.7 \u2022\ufffd Poverty rates have fallen dramatically in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Viet Nam\u2014they are now about 40\u201350 percentage points lower than the rates in the 1990s.8 HOTSPOTS Poverty reduction and eradication \u2022\ufffd In South and South-West Asia, nearly one in five persons (more than 338 million people) were living in poverty in 2012.

Resilience and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events \u2022\ufffd Poverty eradication will be challenging with the occurrence of climate-related events because the region is particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change, with nine Asia-Pacific countries on the list of the 15 countries that are the most exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards.13 Over the past decade (2006\u20132015), disasters caused by natural hazards affected a total of 1.3 billion people in the region14\u2014roughly the same size as India\u2019s entire population\u2014 and resulted in economic losses of roughly $379,000 billion.15 EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Rapid population ageing combined with the lack of social security or pension benefits and the lack of targeted social programmes will likely further increase poverty among older persons. \u2022\ufffd Social exclusion, economic uncertainty and environmental risks are increasing, including those related to natural disasters and extreme climate-related events. \u2022\ufffd Although migration contributes to economic development, climate change-related migration will increase the vulnerability of women and communities in coastal areas, which in turn will lead to near-poor households falling into poverty. TARGETS 1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day 1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions 1.3 Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable 1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance 1.5 By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters 1.a Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions 1.b Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender- sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions 22 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture OUTLOOK There is a challenging road ahead to achieve this goal. Despite significant progress in the reduction of hunger and malnutrition, improvements vary across subregions and countries and disproportionally affect the nutritional status, food security and livelihoods of vulnerable groups. In many places, undernourishment and obesity co-exist; and agriculture continues to pose an unsustainable burden on the planet\u2019s carrying capacity. Climate change will have a significant impact on crop yields and harvests, disproportionally affecting the nutritional status and livelihoods of impoverished households.

Nonetheless, many other phenomena affecting the short-term food situation of a country or of specific population groups also need to be measured. Seasonal variations, food price volatility, impact of natural disasters or irregular weather conditions on food production are just some of the phenomena that are not captured by the prevalence of undernourishment and for which additional measures can be used.1 \u2022\ufffd Many countries in the region need to pay more attention to growth in their agriculture sector and to supporting diverse food systems. Evidence consistently shows that growth originating in agriculture has a stronger impact on poverty and hunger reduction than growth originating in other sectors.2 \u2022\ufffd Achieving SDG 2 will be challenging due to the convergence of expanding populations, climate change, fertilizer overuse, competing use of land for food, energy and industries, changing consumption patterns, the ageing population of working farmers and the degradation of agricultural land.

Agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems \u2022\ufffd The region is the world\u2019s largest producer of cereals, vegetables, fruits, meat and fish, with strong growth in all areas. Agricultural production has been increasing steadily since 1990. Measured in terms of constant prices, the value of food produced in the region increased from $736 billion in 1990 to $1,351 billion in 2013.4 \u2022\ufffd Agricultural productivity in the region, as measured by value added per worker, has generally been rising, especially in East Asia. Although in South Asia, it has been a slow rise. With the exception of a few countries, it remains a fraction of what has been achieved in industrialized countries.5 26 SDG 2_ZERO HUNGER \u2022\ufffd Farm mechanization is increasingly used in crop production and harvest and post-harvest operations: While more than 90 per cent of farm power originated from animal sources in the 1960s, many countries of the region now have mechanization rates higher than 60 per cent.6 HOTSPOTS Eradicating hunger and malnutrition (getting enough of the right food) \u2022\ufffd There has been a slowdown in the rate of reducing undernourishment over the past five years (2010\u20132015) for many countries in the region, when compared with the rates for the previous two decades. \u2022\ufffd Hunger reduction in South and South-West Asia is taking place more slowly than in other subregions and is not keeping pace with population growth. Nearly 300 million people were affected by hunger in 2016, reflecting the slow pace in reduction.7 \u2022\ufffd The rate of reducing undernourishment has reversed8 and it has even deteriorated for some countries. For example, the proportion of people affected by hunger in 2014\u20132016 increased from the level that existed in1990\u20131992 in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (from 23.3 per cent to 41.6 per cent) and Tajikistan (from 28.1 per cent to 33.2 per cent). Only limited improvements (a decline in the percentage of people affected by hunger) have been made in some other countries in that same time period: Afghanistan (from 29.5 per cent to 26.8 per cent); Mongolia (from 29.9 per cent to 20.5 per cent); India (from 23.7 per cent to 15.2 per cent); Pakistan (from 25.1 per cent to 22 per cent); and Sri Lanka (from 30.6 per cent to 22 per cent).9 \u2022\ufffd Stunting due to malnutrition affected more than 96 million children in 2014.10 In Bangladesh, India and Nepal, the proportion of stunted children was greater than 35 per cent in 2014.11 MDGs related to nutrition and stunting remain unmet in the region as a whole. \u2022\ufffd Almost half of all overweight children younger than 5 years in the world live in Asia. The overweight concerns combined with the approximately 27 per cent of children younger than 5 years who are stunted (in 2014) has created a double burden of malnutrition for the region. \u2022\ufffd The prevalence of overweight within the region has grown by 2.1 per cent and obesity by 4.3 per cent annually. The prevalence of obesity is especially high in the Pacific, ranging from 28 per cent in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea to 43 per cent in Tonga and more than 40 per cent for Kiribati, Samoa and Tuvalu. Between 1990 and 2008, the prevalence of overweight and obesity increased most rapidly in South-East Asia.12 Agricultural productivity and sustainable food production systems \u2022\ufffd Agriculture depends on the sustainable management of the genetic diversity of crops, breeds, trees and aquatic resources. But biodiversity is threatened throughout the region due to extensive agriculture, aquaculture and oil palm and rubber plantations. The proportion of threatened native mammal and plant species increased by more than 10 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, in the past decade. Degradation of biota and ecosystems affects the livelihoods of 50\u201380 per cent of rural people.13 \u2022\ufffd A total of 90 million hectares of agricultural land was lost in the region between 2000 and 2013.

In some countries, rates of maternal and child mortality are persistently high, and such diseases as HIV and tuberculosis (TB) continue to disproportionately impact marginalized groups of people. Access to affordable quality health care and medicines is constrained and unequal in many countries. The region also faces increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases, accompanied by population ageing, cross-border epidemics, antimicrobial resistance, natural disasters and environmental pollution. These emerging trends are likely to place considerable financial and capacity constraints on health care systems.

Expanding publicly financed universal health coverage would reduce out-of-pocket expenses. \u2022\ufffd There is critical need for an overall framework of social protection strengthening. Opportunities to raise capital for investment in health care institutions need to be pursued. Policies are needed that expand social protection for disability, critical illnesses and funeral expenses for people who are poor or extremely vulnerable to the financial impact of morbidity and mortality risks. \u2022\ufffd Achieving universal health coverage and health equity requires dedicated attention and investments to address the unique barriers and needs of the most vulnerable and excluded people, including persons affected by HIV, persons with disabilities, slum dwellers, indigenous people and migrants. \u2022\ufffd Promoting gender equality and the human rights of vulnerable groups can lead to markedly better disease prevention, treatment and care. \u2022\ufffd With Asia moving towards an aged society, it is important to accelerate the development and expansion of pension, health care and other essential social protection schemes to support healthy ageing. \u2022\ufffd Evidence shows that improving skilled birth attendance can significantly reduce maternal and child deaths when reinforced with training for health workers and by educating mothers.

This is still below the global average, which increased from 6 litres to 6.3 litres per person per year over the same period.16 \u2022\ufffd Air pollution: Unhealthy environments are causing significant health problems in the region, including more than 7 million deaths annually,17 mostly attributable to both outdoor and indoor air pollution, including second-hand smoke. \u2022\ufffd Road traffic accidents: Of the ten countries in 2013 with the largest number of fatalities per 100,000 people, two were in Asia and the Pacific: Thailand, at 36.2 per 100,000 population, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 32.1 fatalities per 100,000 population. EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Health systems are facing critical capacity and financial gaps to meet the challenges of ageing populations, non-communicable diseases, cross-border epidemics, antimicrobial resistance, environmental pollution, climate change impacts and natural disasters. \u2022\ufffd Rapid urbanization, trade liberalization and the increasing cross-border movement of people in the region are changing the risk and disease profiles. While these trends are often associated with negative health consequences, they also offer new opportunities to promote better care and to protect health through multisector partnerships. \u2022\ufffd Multilateral and bilateral free trade and investment treaty negotiations are increasingly containing provisions that can restrict countries from implementing health-promoting measures, such as tobacco control and access to affordable medicines. Careful health impact assessments of these trade agreements are needed for policymakers and the public to make informed decisions. \u2022\ufffd Key populations at higher risk of HIV infection, including men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who use drugs and sex workers, continue to be left behind in access to appropriate health information and services, such as comprehensive prevention programmes. Countries need to invest more in creating enabling environments (including removing legal and policy barriers) for access to services. The expansion of highly discriminatory and punitive approaches to drug use, sexual orientation, gender identity and other marginalized populations, coupled with shrinking civil society space, threaten to undermine or reverse the progress of recent years. 34 SDG 3_GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING \u2022\ufffd Coherent intercountry linked early warning and mobilization systems will be essential to address

In some countries, international assistance makes a significant supplement to the education budget. \u2022\ufffd Available data indicate that 44 countries in the region received official development assistance (ODA) for education from the donor community in 2014. Among them, India received the largest share of donors\u2019 education assistance in terms of total United States dollars received per year, followed by Pakistan, China and Bangladesh.1 \u2022\ufffd Early childhood interventions are necessary for all children because of the enormous impact on their readiness for primary school and then their transition to secondary education. Yet, large numbers of children continue to miss out, and inequality in opportunity is increasing for the poorest children, for children living in rural areas or slums and for children marginalized due to a disability or their ethnic origin, religion or language.2 \u2022\ufffd Children with disabilities make up a considerable proportion of marginalized groups. Early childhood services to assess and address disability in children as soon as possible helps children and their families improve their life outcomes. \u2022\ufffd In many countries where the most important shortcomings in investment in education are seen, in particular the least developed countries, investment in education falls far short of the required level. Low human capital formation is a barrier to development. \u2022\ufffd Technical and vocational education and training helps strengthen job-relevant skills and is becoming a strategic priority in many countries but lacks investment needed to improve. Greater employer engagement and better workplace linkages are key priorities. 38 SDG 4_QUALITY EDUCATION BRIGHT SPOTS Primary and secondary education \u2022\ufffd Most countries in the region have achieved or are close to achieving universal primary education. Nearly 78 million children across the region were enrolled in pre-primary education in 2013, almost double the number for 1999. The six most significant increases (latest year compared with 1999)3 were recorded in China, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal and Viet Nam, where the gross enrolment ratios increased by 40\u201375 percentage points.4 \u2022\ufffd The transition from primary to secondary education and the completion of secondary education is also on the rise HOTSPOTS Quality of education and relevant skills \u2022\ufffd Based on available data, 18.2 million children were not enrolled in primary school in the past few years.5 Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Tajikistan and Timor- Leste recorded the lowest ratios of pre-primary enrolment, ranging from 10 per cent to 18 per cent.6 \u2022\ufffd Based on the latest data available, a considerable number of teachers in pre-primary, primary and secondary education do not have the necessary teacher training qualifications. In addition, the percentage of trained teachers in primary education is quite low in some countries, such as Bangladesh, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.7 \u2022\ufffd Quality of education is a major concern.

The transition of many developing countries to middle-income status is creating pressure to improve employability and close skill gaps among graduates. \u2022\ufffd Skills development will have an increasingly important role in regional integration, which will provide countries with a valuable opportunity for shared prosperity and more even economic development. \u2022\ufffd Disadvantaged and marginalized youth will need mentoring to improve their learning outcomes and to provide the industry with a diverse talent pipeline. \u2022\ufffd The education system is only as good as the teachers who provide hands-on instruction. Additional teachers are needed for universal primary and secondary education to replace or supplement the teaching workforce. \u2022\ufffd There is a need to increase innovative financing on education projects by strengthening collaboration between governments, financial institutions and other stakeholders, including civil society, and by expanding access and the use of personal savings and loan products to help families plan for and finance education costs. \u2022\ufffd Collaboration across the industry and exploration of good practices for advancing financial literacy is needed, both in schools and for men and women, including marginalized groups (such as people with disabilities, indigenous peoples and racial and ethnic minorities). \u2022\ufffd Expanding health, life and livelihood insurance coverage in developing countries will enable reducing the risk of children missing school due to untreated medical conditions because they must care for a sick relative or they must undertake livelihood activities to supplement household income. \u2022\ufffd Small and medium-sized enterprise entrepreneurs will need accounting, customer service and business management training, thereby building loyalty with their customers and helping them to attract new ones.

Available data highlight a general correlation between a country\u2019s ranking on the Human Development Index and the Gender Inequality Index.1 \u2022\ufffd Women have an integral role in helping countries achieve all the SDGs, with many targets specifically acknowledging women\u2019s empowerment as both the aim and part of the solution. \u2022\ufffd Despite notable progress in some areas, such as girls\u2019 access to education (covered under SDG 4), stark gender-based disparities remain in relation to rights and opportunities. \u2022\ufffd Comprehensive policy and legislative action is essential to protect women\u2019s rights across the region. Even though all but three countries have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and an increasing number are adopting legal and policy measures on gender equality, challenges remain in terms of enforcement, implementation and monitoring. \u2022\ufffd Monitoring progress and evidence-based policymaking are hampered by the non-availability of sufficient sex-disaggregated data for a number of countries in the region. Lack of comparable data (concepts, definitions and data collection methods vary across countries) hampers monitoring. BRIGHT SPOTS Political participation \u2022\ufffd A few countries stand out for substantial improvements in their share of female parliamentary representation: It jumped in Nepal from 5.9 per cent in 2000 to 29.5 per cent in 2015, in Kyrgyzstan from 1.4 per cent to 23.3 per cent and in Singapore from 4.3 per cent to 25.3 per cent over the same time period. \u2022\ufffd As of 2015, Timor-Leste had the highest rate of representation of women in national parliament, at 38.5 per cent, helped along no doubt by an electoral law requirement that one in every three candidates on political lists is a woman. New Zealand had the second-highest such representation in 2015, at 31.4 per cent of seats held by women.2 44 SDG 5_GENDER EQUALITY Sexual and reproductive health \u2022\ufffd As of 2015, the demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods in the Asia-Pacific region stood at 86.3 per cent for married or in-union women of reproductive age, slightly above the 82.2 per cent world average. Despite progress at the regional level, this figure masks disparities in several countries, and challenges remain in reaching under served populations, particularly women residing in rural and remote areas, as well as adolescents and youth.3 HOTSPOTS Violence against women and girls and harmful practices \u2022\ufffd The incidence of child marriage as well as early and forced marriage persists. In Bangladesh, 52 per cent of women aged 20\u201324 years in 2013 had married before they were 18 years old, with approximately 18 per cent married before they were 15 years old. In countries as diverse as Bhutan, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Thailand and Vanuatu, between a quarter and a fifth of women had married before they were 18.4 \u2022\ufffd In countries for which data are available, a large proportion of women experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in the 12 months prior to data collection. According to available Demographic and Health Surveys and World Health Organization Studies, 44 per cent of women in Vanuatu in 2009, 36 per cent of women in Kiribati in 2008 and 31 per cent of women in Timor-Leste in 2010 reported such violence.5 Women\u2019s economic participation, access to economic resources and unpaid care work \u2022\ufffd Gender parity in employment does not exist in most countries, regardless of the economic development level.6 Female-to-male labour force participation ratios have declined in the region, from 0.67 in 1990 to 0.61 in 2015.7 \u2022\ufffd Women earn less than men in almost all Asian and Pacific countries with available data (the Philippines and Turkey are the exceptions).

In the majority of countries, women hold less than 30 per cent of seats in their national parliament.12 Overall in 2015, 18.1 per cent of national parliament seats in the region were held by women, up from only 13.1 per cent in 2000.13 \u2022\ufffd Data compiled in 2015 for 20 developing Asian economies showed that while women accounted for 40 per cent of the workforce, only 14.4 per cent of corporate boardroom members and senior managers were women. Kazakhstan and Viet Nam had a respectable female representation in private sector top management, each exceeding 30 per cent. The female share of top management in South-East Asia was above the Asian average of 14.4 per cent, led by the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore.14 EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Changing demographic trends are likely to have differentiated impacts on men and women. With ageing populations in countries across the region, older women, owing to their longer life expectancy than men as well as their heightened vulnerability to neglect, violence and abuse, will need specific policy attention as a group that is often left \u201cfurthest behind\u201d. An ageing population also puts an added care burden on the shoulder of women. Another demographic concern is the specific needs of women and girl refugees and migrants who face additional challenges of psychosocial stress and trauma, health complications, physical harm, injury and multiple forms of discrimination, violence and exploitation, particularly when they are in transit. \u2022\ufffd As the world\u2019s most disaster-prone region, Asia and the Pacific experience an immense toll caused by natural disasters, with women and girls more likely to be disproportionately affected due to sociocultural norms and the inequitable distribution of roles, resources and power. Continued efforts are needed towards ensuring gender-sensitive disaster risk reduction strategies that take into account both women\u2019s vulnerabilities in specific contexts while also highlighting their potential capabilities to prepare, confront and recover from disasters. TARGETS 5.1 End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere 5.2 Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation 5.3 Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation Discriminatory inheritance legislation remains an obstacle for women, with widows and daughters having no inheritance rights at all in some countries in the region.11 46 SDG 5_GENDER EQUALITY 5.4 Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate 5.5 Ensure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life 5.6 Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences 5.a Undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources, in accordance with national laws 5.b Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women 5.c Adopt and strengthen sound policies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at all levels Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all OUTLOOK Critical challenges lie ahead for achieving this goal. Some 277 million people still lacked access to safe drinking water in 2015,1 and more than 80 per cent of the wastewater generated in developing countries was not treated.2 Around half of the rural population in the region has no access to improved sanitation. These conditions, compounded by the impacts of climate change (which might limit freshwater resources), will hamper achievement of SDG 6 if left unattended. Threats related to water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation will negatively impact the achievement of other SDGs as well.

Energy demand in the Asia-Pacific region is rapidly growing, making it difficult to increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the energy mix despite major increases in absolute terms. Improvements in energy efficiency are encouraging, however, and efforts to manage consumption alongside efforts to promote increasingly low- cost clean technologies, reinforced by climate-related policies, hold significant promise.

Since 2000, the proportion of the region\u2019s population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology for cooking has remained steady, at a 2 per cent annual growth rate. Yet, the gap in the provision of universal access to clean fuels and technology is not closing. By 2014, an average of only 57 per cent of the total population primarily relied on clean fuels and technology.1 The share of renewable resources in the energy mix \u2022\ufffd Notwithstanding the growth of renewable energy utilization in the region in absolute terms, its share in the total primary energy supply is in a steady downward trajectory, with a decrease from 16.7 per cent in 1990 to 12.6 per cent in 2014.2 Fossil fuel-based economies in Asia have a relatively low rate of renewable energy uptake, and they have tended to further decrease the renewable energy share in the energy mix due to rapid growth in energy consumption. However, renewable energy installation is making significant gains in power production. Energy efficiency \u2022\ufffd Energy intensity has steadily declined across the region since the mid-1990s. \u2022\ufffd The degree of energy efficiency uptake varies substantially across all of the ESCAP member States, yet the energy intensity indicator is gradually converging at a median value of 130 kilograms of oil equivalent per $1,000 of GDP (in 2005 PPP).3 Technological foresight, adequate economic incentives and strategic policy planning \u2022\ufffd Energy sectors within the region are transforming, with policy measures being implemented and the pace of reforms depending upon national circumstances and development priorities.

Most top- performing countries in the SDG 7 context have specific measures and programmes that facilitate further improvements in national energy systems while intensifying actions towards achievement of the targets. BRIGHT SPOTS Access to energy services \u2022\ufffd Universal access to electricity has been achieved in many countries within the region, with many countries making significant gains. However, the region is extremely diverse, and the rate of electrification varies from country to country. Of the region\u2019s ESCAP member States, 31 countries have reached 100 per cent electrification, while the others mostly need time to finalize the electrification process under self-sustainment.

A large proportion of the labour force is informally employed, and youths are facing high unemployment or underemployment rates. At the same time, exploitive labour practices and disregard for labour rights and workplace safety are prevalent across the region. Social protection policies, including minimum wage provisions and social transfer programmes, are critical in meeting the needs of the most vulnerable populations.

Employment growth, however, has not kept pace with the economic growth. Providing employment and decent work for all workers is critical to ensure that growth is inclusive and sustainable and to lift millions of people out of extreme poverty in the region. \u2022\ufffd The lack of decent jobs leads to vulnerable employment, which is more likely in informal employment characterized by low productivity, low pay and no social protection. \u2022\ufffd The majority of people who are income poor and food insecure inhabit rural areas and rely on agriculture for their survival. A broad economic transformation is required to absorb surplus labour from agriculture to the non-agriculture sector. This would include strategies to raise agricultural productivity. \u2022\ufffd Many economies need to accelerate efforts to expand their productive capacities, particularly in the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries. \u2022\ufffd Providing financial opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is important for fostering productivity. SMEs accounted for 98 per cent of all enterprises in Asia and, from 2007 to 2012, employed two-thirds of each national labour force, on average.1 \u2022\ufffd Trade can significantly expand demand for manufacturing products as well as services, thereby facilitating growth and providing an impetus for structural transformation, which is an important driver of development and productivity growth. The Aid for Trade initiative was introduced in 2005 to help developing countries fully engage in trade and maximize their gains by reducing trade costs and by reforming their trade and related policies to build the supply- side capacity and infrastructure that they need to compete internationally.

Growth of total factor productivity declined by more than half in developing countries in the region, averaging at slightly less than 1 per cent between 2008 and 2014, while growth in labour productivity declined by more than 30 per cent, to 3.9 per cent in 2013.11 \u2022\ufffd Despite increases in nominal wage levels, growth in real wages has not been commensurate with the increases in productivity levels.12 \u2022\ufffd The proportion of adults with an account at a bank or other financial institution is lowest in the least developed countries and has only increased marginally, from 26.8 per cent in 2011 to 27.3 per cent in 2014.13 \u2022\ufffd Although many countries adopted green growth strategies, overall the economic growth of the region is resource intensive (see the SDG 12 profile). Employment \u2022\ufffd Employment growth in 2015 was merely 1.1 per cent, or 21.3 million jobs, for the Asia-Pacific region. Job growth was notably weak, at 0.3 per cent, in East and North-East Asia, weighed down by both the decelerating economy in China and its ageing population.14 \u2022\ufffd A large portion of the region\u2019s labour force is employed in the informal economy. \u2022\ufffd There are low levels of female labour force participation in some areas of the region, particularly in South and South-West Asia. \u2022\ufffd The youth unemployment rate in 2016 was estimated at 11.8 per cent and was higher for young women (at 12.1 per cent) than for men (at 11.7 per cent).15 Young people in the labour force are 3.8 times more likely to be unemployed than their adult counterparts in the region. By subregion, the ratio is even higher in South-East Asia (at 5.4 times) and South Asia (at 4 times).16 EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd The growing numbers of workers in vulnerable employment17 and working poor people require more attention. The vulnerable employment rate in the Asia-Pacific region was 54 per cent, or 1 billion workers, in 2015.18 \u2022\ufffd Women are more likely than men to be in vulnerable employment. In South Asia, for example, the vulnerable employment rate in 2015 was 79.5 per cent for women and 71.1 per cent for men. In South-East Asia, the rates were 60.1 per cent and 52.8 per cent, respectively.19 \u2022\ufffd The share of young workers from poor households, defined as earning less than the $1.90 extreme poverty line, was 14.2 per cent in 2015, compared with 9.8 per cent for adult workers. The working youth poverty rate was particularly high in South Asia, at 21.6 per cent.20 \u2022\ufffd Active labour market policies are required to support employment in times of economic slowdown and

inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation OUTLOOK Projected investment needs in Asia and the Pacific are substantial. Hundreds of millions of people in the region still live without access to basic infrastructure, including for connectivity. Improving the quality of available infrastructure, its resilience and environmental sustainability needs to be a priority for the region.1 Progress on inclusive and sustainable industrialization and innovation has been uneven. Gaps are widening in some areas, such as manufacturing value-added per capita. Concerted efforts to keep developing countries from missing out on the New Industrial Revolution are needed.2 While much remains to be done, support for innovation as measured in terms of spending on research and development has increased. THE PHOTO Green Power Development Project construction workers passing through a tunnel in the Dagachhu Hydropower Development in Bhutan Photo credit: ADB 67 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation INSIGHTS \u2022\ufffd There has been significant progress in expanding infrastructure services in energy generation, information and communications technology (ICT), transport, water and water sanitation, but gaps remain in meeting the basic needs of poor households, particularly in rural areas, and in ensuring the quality and environmental sustainability of the built infrastructure. Connectivity infrastructure, such as roads and air transport, increased, while rail transport became less of a priority in the region. \u2022\ufffd Infrastructure helps reduce poverty when integrated with wider development efforts. For example, road connectivity, energy and irrigation services can ease and reduce the costs of access to markets and jobs, but the impacts on poverty tend to be greater when combined with efforts to improve access to health care and education. \u2022\ufffd An inclusive and sustainable industrial sector drives economic growth, job creation, social stability and environmental protection. Careful, inclusive and sustainable industrialization policies can help soothe critical issues confronting many countries in the region around jobs, informal employment, the middle-income trap and low levels of entrepreneurship. These policies should be designed to address sources of social grievances, such as youth unemployment, inequalities in the nature and extent of women\u2019s and men\u2019s engagement in economic activity and rapid urbanization. \u2022\ufffd The contribution of manufacturing to employment creation is well documented. As of 2014, global employment in manufacturing was estimated at 482 million jobs, which included jobs in the formal and informal sectors as well as in manufacturing-related services.3 Manufacturing in emerging economies often combines high relative productivity with a strong capacity to absorb labour.4 \u2022\ufffd Manufacturing also supports sustained rapid growth: Driven by manufacturing industries, 13 developing economies globally (several from the Asia-Pacific region) managed to sustain rapid growth of at least 7 per cent for 25 years or more after World War II.5 Structural changes in the economy, in conjunction with industrialization, can support the emergence of a middle class. Some countries in the region have substantially expanded the share of GDP from services sector, however, before expanding the role of industry.6 \u2022\ufffd Real value added per unit of CO2 emission tends to increase", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df7b8875-3d40-4307-bbb3-3b2efc426d5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "df7b8875-3d40-4307-bbb3-3b2efc426d5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4b601fafabefca7bd7cd8ac3884a2c2b5364e4dac09cb71cb56f9d47503d4ec"}, "3": {"node_id": "560b8739-7ae1-4c0a-8e3d-68eb90dd0195", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f726c75402f8cece4fb61f60af378843a902d41f40f387fb2f07d62d8572923b"}}, "hash": "c4cf962a035739b1e6f7231fe8bf9822f4a868e59ac8be902ca07d81b50203df", "text": "with rising real GDP per capita across various manufacturing industries.

The New Industrial Revolution offers tremendous opportunities in the region, with countries like China, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea global leaders in additive manufacturing.8 68 BRIGHT SPOTS Upgrading infrastructure and retrofitting industries \u2022\ufffd There was significant progress in expanding infrastructure services in energy generation, ICT and transport. Access to paved roads increased from 16.3 kilometres to 19.2 kilometres per 10,000 people between 2009 and 2014.9 Air transport in terms of passengers carried grew at a faster rate than freight, at an annual average of 7 per cent in 2000 and of 3 per cent in 2015.10 \u2022\ufffd As countries shift to less energy-intensive industries, cleaner fuels and technologies and stronger energy-efficiency policies, they are experiencing a reduction in the carbon intensity of their GDP. \u2022\ufffd Access to ICT in the region has increased substantially. Nowadays, 45 per cent of the population in Asia and the Pacific has access to the internet through mobile telephones, and this is expected to increase to 70 per cent by 2020.11 The majority of the region\u2019s population (62 per cent, or 2.5 billion people) subscribed to mobile telephone services in 2015, a rate on par with the global average of 63 per cent.12 Inclusive and sustainable industrialization \u2022\ufffd Asian developing countries have outperformed industrialized countries as well as developing countries in other regions in terms of their share of manufacturing employment in total employment (Asian developing countries\u2019 manufacturing employment share grew 73 per cent between 1970 and 2013, reaching a 15.7 per cent share in 2010\u20132013).13 There are five economies in the region (China, India,14 Indonesia, Japan and the Republic of Korea) that belong to the world\u2019s 15-top manufacturers, which together contribute 78.5 per cent of global manufacturing production. China, with an average annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent between 2005 and 2015, has emerged as the world\u2019s largest manufacturer.15 \u2022\ufffd The creation of formal jobs through industrial development recently gained policy priority. The recognition of industry as a development accelerator has led to a revival of industrial policy, including in Bangladesh (Industrial Policy 2016), China (Made in China 2025), India (Make in India), Indonesia (Master Plan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia\u2019s Economic Development), Japan (New Robot Strategy) and the Republic of Korea (Manufacturing Innovation 3.0). Innovation \u2022\ufffd Investment in research and development has increased significantly in recent years. The number of researchers in the region has also increased. Continued efforts to support domestic technology development are needed. \u2022\ufffd In 2014, research and development expenditure as a percentage of GDP doubled to 2 per cent after remaining relatively flat during the period 2006\u20132013, albeit at the same level as in 2000\u20132005.16 \u2022\ufffd The number of researchers rose by 19 per cent, from 686 per million inhabitants in 2000 to 846 in 2010.17 HOTSPOTS Resilient and sustainable infrastructure \u2022\ufffd The infrastructure investment needs of the region are diverse and substantial\u2014projected by the ADB at about $26 trillion between 2016 and 2030 in its developing member countries, particularly in power and transport.18 Infrastructure stock in ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) is 30 per cent below the benchmark for advanced economies, which is calculated at 70 per cent of GDP.19 \u2022\ufffd The region\u2019s CO2 emissions per one dollar of GDP (2011 PPP) have decreased, from 521.6 grams to 389.3 grams between 1990 and 2013 (a decrease of 25 per cent).

inequalities are decreasing. Stronger efforts need to be taken to correct income and wealth inequalities that are perpetuated by unequal access to opportunities and services. Inequalities among countries in the region are gradually decreasing. However, stronger regional cooperation is needed to seal this trend, including facilitating labour mobility and better monitoring of the impact of investments, including foreign direct investment (FDI), on the poorest and most vulnerable workers.

HOTSPOTS Housing, basic services and slums13 \u2022\ufffd In 2014, an estimated 440 million people, representing about 26.9 per cent of the region\u2019s total urban population, lived in slums or informal settlements,14 which are characterized by housing that is non-durable or overcrowded, lacking in access to improved water and sanitation facilities and lacking security against eviction. This included nearly two-thirds of the urban population in Afghanistan and Bangladesh, while in Cambodia and Nepal, it was more than half of the urban populations.15 Although the proportion of people living in a slum is decreasing in all subregions, the absolute number is increasing in many cities.16 \u2022\ufffd Even though the region has made significant progress in access to safe drinking water, progress with sanitation has been much slower and varies across the subregions, ranging in 2015 from 49.1 per cent in South and South-West Asia and 72.3 per cent in South-East Asia to 79.6 per cent in East and North-East Asia.17 Inclusive and sustainable urbanization \u2022\ufffd Many cities exceed the WHO standard of annual mean concentration of 10 micrograms and 20 micrograms of PM2.5 particles and PM10 particles per cubic metres of air volume, respectively. The annual mean concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in cities18 varies from 5.8 and 9.6 micrograms in Australia to 101.2 and 281.8 micrograms per cubic meter in Pakistan, respectively. Other countries with higher PM2.5 concentrations include Mongolia (at 64.1 micrograms), India (at 58.8 micrograms), China (at 41.3 micrograms) and Turkey (at 38.9 micrograms).19 \u2022\ufffd Evidence from 191 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted over the past several years shows that infants and children residing in slums have substantially greater incidence of diarrheal illness than their urban peers and are less likely to survive to their fifth birthday.20 The urban poor in the region\u2019s industrialized countries also face marked disparities in health and well-being.21 EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Cities face converging challenges, including migration and population growth, changes in family structure, increases in informal settlements, vulnerability to climate change and disasters, exclusion, rising inequality and rising insecurity. With the growth of the middle class in cities, emissions and wastes are likely to increase unless there is change in production and consumption patterns. \u2022\ufffd Rising inequality, competition over scarce resources (such as land), impunity from the law and weak city governance could increase the risk of violence and potential breakdowns in law and order.

Although the region overall is becoming more material and energy efficient, overall levels of consumption and waste in the region are growing. Rising incomes and lifestyle changes are expected to further drive this upward trend. Concerted public and private action is needed to change production and consumption patterns in the face of fundamental challenges, such as increasing energy demand, resource depletion and ecosystem degradation while basic needs are not being covered. THE PHOTO A worker turns composting organic waste to improve decomposition in the Integrated Resource Recovery Centre in Matale, Sri Lanka Photo credit: ESCAP 85 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns INSIGHTS \u2022\ufffd The Asia-Pacific region continues to be the fastest-growing and most dynamic production hub among the regions in the world. It is the production centre for food and exports for two- thirds of the world\u2019s population. These drivers are resource-intensive, with the environmental costs of their inefficiencies not reflected in the price of goods. Nor is a sufficient level of profit from export-driven economic growth reinvested in managing the environmental impacts of production. \u2022\ufffd The urgency of transforming the economic strategies and business models in the region is crucial to achieving SDG 12, and the entire range of physical and socioeconomic factors that underpin consumption and production patterns, including infrastructure, lifestyles and economic structures. This underscores the importance of going after the root causes of unsustainable consumption and production patterns across the SDGs, particularly SDG 8 and SDG 9, by embedding the environmental impacts in employment and economic growth policies. \u2022\ufffd The highest potential for resource-efficiency gains exists in developing economies that are locked into inefficient, resource-intensive consumption and production patterns. With appropriate green economy policies, incentives and access to technology, there is scope for increasing efficiency gains in these countries. But early action is needed to avoid further lock-in to inefficient technologies and infrastructure. \u2022\ufffd National Environmental Economic Accounting can be used as a tool for internalizing the cost of using environmental resources and the resulting waste and emissions into economic decision-making. Examples include the assessment of trends in the use and availability of natural resources, the extent of emissions and discharges into the environment resulting from economic activity and the amount of economic activity undertaken for environmental purposes.1 BRIGHT SPOTS Sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources \u2022\ufffd The intensity of domestic material consumption, calculated as direct import plus domestic materials extraction, minus direct exports, increased by 23 per cent in the region as a whole between 2000 and 2015. However, in all subregions, there was a marked reduction in domestic material consumption between 2000 to 2015 (South-East Asia by 15 per cent, South and South-West Asia by 31 per cent, North and Central Asia by 25 per cent and Pacific islands by 21 per cent) compared with the increasing global average of 8 per cent between 2000 and 2010.2 The exception to this downward regional trend is East and North-East Asia, which grew by 76 per cent between 2000 and 2015 (see the SDG 7 profile for energy intensity trends). 86 SDG 12_RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION Waste reduction and management", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f6d7c3d-af55-4c34-acc0-463bbd26e99e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f6d7c3d-af55-4c34-acc0-463bbd26e99e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "260a2a327c70ae629362fb95a39a574af43d2da5f1d1cd5c51946dd524a1d906"}}, "hash": "260a2a327c70ae629362fb95a39a574af43d2da5f1d1cd5c51946dd524a1d906", "text": "\u2022\ufffd There is a growing movement towards sustainable and low chemical-input agriculture, as well as green chemistry methods and material innovation to remove toxins from the value chain. An example is the initiative by 13 countries to adopt a new set of safety and quality standards for machinery manufactured, traded and used in the Asia-Pacific region.3 \u2022\ufffd The number of countries in the region committing to at least one international environmental agreement on hazardous waste and other chemicals has increased. There are signs that awareness and use of techniques to incentivize and reward sustainable consumption and production behaviour is increasing. HOTSPOTS Sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources \u2022\ufffd The Asia-Pacific region requires two times the input of resources than what the rest of the world requires to produce one unit of GDP.4 In 2010, the region\u2019s GDP5 required the use of 2.4 kilograms of materials per unit of GDP, compared with the global average of 1.3 kilograms per unit of GDP. Without a decoupling of GDP growth from resource use, the region is likely to be using 80 billion tonnes of materials by 2050,6 with severe environmental and social impacts and looming shortage. \u2022\ufffd The region\u2019s domestic material consumption increased at an average annual rate of 5.6 per cent between 2000 and 2015, more than five times the population growth rate. Various factors contributed to this increase, including rapid industrialization, urbanization and massive infrastructure and transport development.7 \u2022\ufffd In absolute terms, domestic material consumption has more than doubled, from 22,887 million tonnes in 2000 to 51,369 million tonnes in 2015, with most of the growth coming from East, North-East and South-West Asia.8 Waste reduction and management \u2022\ufffd Total greenhouse gas emissions of economies in Asia and the Pacific in 2012 were 26,725 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, reflecting around a 4 per cent average rate of annual increase since 2000.9 This is despite the decrease of emissions intensity by 44 per cent, from 1.9 tonnes in 2003 to 1 tonne per $1,000 GDP in 2011.10 \u2022\ufffd Urban areas in the region generate about 1.21 million tonnes of municipal solid waste a day. By 2025, this amount will more than double, to 2.65 million tonnes daily.11 In the past five years (2010\u20132015), e-waste from East and South-East Asia grew by 63 per cent.12 \u2022\ufffd Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced worldwide\u2014equivalent to 1.3 billion tonnes and worth around $1 trillion\u2014ends up in the bins of consumers and retailers or spoiled due to poor transportation and harvesting practices.13 In the region, it is estimated that 15\u201350 per cent of fruits and 12\u201330 per cent of grains are lost between the producer and the market.14 \u2022\ufffd Given the realization that plastic is now turning up in 100 per cent of fish catch in some regions of Asia and in sea salt and that the quantity of plastic in the ocean\u2019s gyres is growing, some observers are considering plastic pollution a crisis on the scale of a \u201cglobal threat\u201d, comparable with global climate change, food insecurity and water scarcity.15 Weak statistical capacity to monitor the extent of marine pollution, particularly microplastics, and its implications hinder policy development to fully tackle this issue. \u2022\ufffd A large part of both the positive and negative contributions to advancing SDG 12 will come from private businesses and consumers, which suggests a renewed commitment to effectively implement a \u201cpenalize or reward\u201d policy regime appropriate to the scale of operations and types of goods and services. Institutionalizing policy and action \u2022\ufffd Only a minority of industries and businesses in the region have implemented measures to support conscious consumer behaviour change, such as environmental labelling and consumer information services. In 2016, businesses from only 23 of the Asia-Pacific regional member States have participated in the global voluntary Corporate Sustainability Reporting initiative, accounting for 35 per cent of the global total. Making information accessible to both consumers and producers will empower consumers to make more sustainable choices. \u2022\ufffd Developing Asian countries accounted for close to a third of global subsidies on fossil fuel consumption in 2012, equivalent to about 1.5 per cent of GDP. Removal of such subsidies would result in the decrease of demand and use of fossil fuels. Reduction of fossil fuels can lead to considerable financial savings for governments. For example, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, fossil fuel use reductions led to a savings of $5.3 billion; in Indonesia, it saved $10 billion in one year. These funds can be reinvested into social development policies, as was done in Indonesia. \u2022\ufffd Fossil fuel subsidies also support the production of cheap", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70f0b15a-0768-4158-8a2c-2ee04edd78c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "70f0b15a-0768-4158-8a2c-2ee04edd78c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9017e55c89eb4440de0d4e3c3c6f58e72b4a866fd0bcda243dd09199813a15fa"}}, "hash": "9017e55c89eb4440de0d4e3c3c6f58e72b4a866fd0bcda243dd09199813a15fa", "text": "chemicals, and the carbon footprint of chemicals is substantial.

Reliable data on food waste and loss, household solid waste generation, industrial waste and effluents management and treatment are poor or non- existent for most countries in the region. 88 EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Recent studies traced high chemical inputs for food production to damaging impacts on the health of consumers in the region and abroad. These impacts are not yet fully documented, however, because of the time required for the problems to fully manifest and develop. \u2022\ufffd Chemical management is therefore critical in the Asia-Pacific region, especially chemicals from plastic and textile industry waste, mercury and dioxin emissions. Regional cooperation is needed to create a framework for influencing multinational corporations to avoid their use of chemicals and non-organic packaging, which are prohibited in other regions. \u2022\ufffd Water pollution from untreated wastewater in the region is exceeding the capacity for purification of rivers and lakes, thus calling for a better understanding of the contemporary water cycle. Action to improve the effectiveness of toxic waste and pollutants management is important. \u2022\ufffd Requiring the business sector to apply lifecycle analysis to their products, materials used and services will trigger important changes in the value chain. These changes could be a game changer in terms of reducing wasteful lifestyles and improve environmental and social sustainability and overall well-being.

Progress will be boosted by entry into force of the Paris Agreement, along with efforts to scale up financial resources and technological innovation. Given the high growth of greenhouse gas emissions in the region, topping 4 per cent on average,2 and the high levels of human and economic vulnerability to climate change impacts, the urgency of increasing mitigation and adaptation actions cannot be overestimated.

There is some evidence that industrialized countries are making progress towards this goal. But the investment needs far exceed this amount, and the Paris Agreement sets a goal that all finance flows should be consistent with a pathway towards low-emission and climate-resilient development\u2014in the context of sustainable development priorities. There are huge opportunities to make progress towards this goal in Asia and the Pacific, including through partnerships with small and medium-sized enterprises, with direct public and private finance towards solutions to climate change. BRIGHT SPOTS Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity \u2022\ufffd As of March 2017, 39 ESCAP member countries had ratified the Paris Agreement and submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions containing their climate change agendas and priorities.4 Many of these Nationally Determined Contributions include an adaptation component. While the actions to which countries are committing are significant, more will need to be done in subsequent iterations to succeed in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. \u2022\ufffd As of 2015, 18 ESCAP member countries had national disaster risk reduction strategies.5 There have been considerable advances in preparedness and early warning activities\u2014at least 14 countries now have an operational national early warning system for weather- and climate- 92 SDG 13_CLIMATE ACTION related hazards, and approximately the same number maintain a disaster loss database.6 Many countries in the region also have a strong tradition of community-based disaster risk management. Integration of climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning \u2022\ufffd Some 26 countries in the region explicitly mentioned sector-based policies to achieve their climate change goals in their Nationally Determined Contributions, and 17 countries stated that they had or were developing long-term low-emissions development strategies, suggesting that these countries are intent on integrating climate change measures into their policies, strategies and planning. \u2022\ufffd Many countries in the region are engaged in the National Adaptation Plan process, which is expected to result in the integration of adaptation into medium-term planning and budgeting. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to submit its plan to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).7 Education and awareness raising \u2022\ufffd There is a range of government, civil society and private sector activities across the region. Several countries have incorporated climate education into the formal school curriculum, including Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Tuvalu and Viet Nam.8 Progress on this target will depend partly on the level of action taken under article 6 of the UNFCCC (and based on Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration9) on the importance of achieving education, training and public awareness and participation in environmental decision-making at both the global and local levels. Climate finance \u2022\ufffd As of October 2016, the Green Climate Fund, a mechanism within the UNFCCC to assist developing countries in mitigation and adaptation responses, had raised $10.3 billion in pledges.10 As of 2016, the Green Climate Fund had approved $1.2 billion for 27 projects, of which nine are in Asia and the Pacific. The key issue is going to be how to ensure that allocation and disbursement are scaled up significantly. \u2022\ufffd The 2016 Biennial Assessment of Climate Finance Flows noted that industrialized countries reported $25.4 billion in 2013 and $26.6 billion in 2014 in bilateral public finance to the UNFCCC, representing an increase of about 50 per cent.11 Industrialized countries also released a road map towards the $100 billion goal in which they stated that they will seek to increase public finance from the current level of about $41 billion to $67 billion by 2020 and to leverage additional private finance.12 \u2022\ufffd The use of green bonds\u2014debt instruments targeted to green investments\u2014 as an alternative to conventional bank project finance has taken off in the region. In total, the region generated around $308 billion in climate-aligned bonds,13 or 44 per cent of the global total.14 HOTSPOTS Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity \u2022\ufffd The region, which bears the brunt of the world\u2019s large-scale catastrophic disasters, experienced 155 disasters in 2015 alone, with an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e0deba9-5ca6-4243-8ccb-18486fff37aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e0deba9-5ca6-4243-8ccb-18486fff37aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be53880b0652a02e326f2a5644c9d9a18f041e84ccef61897dd6a5add646333f"}}, "hash": "be53880b0652a02e326f2a5644c9d9a18f041e84ccef61897dd6a5add646333f", "text": "estimated 6,721 fatalities and around $32,578 million in economic damages.15 Indirect losses were even higher, as well as an ongoing erosion of development assets, such as local infrastructure, dwellings, schools, health facilities and roads, that were repeatedly hit by severe weather and climate events.16 These numbers are likely to be underestimates because there has been no systematic assessment of the cost of all disasters that have struck the region, especially slow-onset disasters, such as droughts, heat waves, forest fires and haze.17 Integration of climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning \u2022\ufffd Although many countries have climate adaptation plans, many of them are not fully funded. \u2022\ufffd Although efforts to integrate climate change measures, including disaster risk reduction, into national policies and planning processes are growing, sector-based implementation (such as building and infrastructure codes, land-use planning and zoning) has been much slower.18 There is a particular need to align infrastructure and development planning processes with climate change mitigation and resilience strategies. Climate finance \u2022\ufffd Despite progress in spending climate finance, there is a need to ensure that this funding is predictable and able to address the risks that impede greater investment in climate change solutions and that it is used effectively in countries that need it most. \u2022\ufffd Accounting for finance to address climate change remains a challenge, although progress in reporting continues to be made. Many governments in the region are leading the way in monitoring climate expenditures in their budgets and more broadly within their countries. \u2022\ufffd Climate finance flows predominantly support mitigation. Continued efforts to scale up adaptation support, particularly for least developed and small island developing countries in the region, are needed. EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Although the Paris Agreement creates a framework in which all countries commit to climate- related action, collective pledges are far short of achieving the greenhouse gas emission reductions required to keep climate change below 2\u02daC (targeting 1.5\u02daC). This means that further iterations of the Nationally Determined Contributions need to be much more ambitious and the search for rapid mitigation strategies will assume greater importance in the coming years. \u2022\ufffd Adaptation has limits\u2014there will be losses and damages that people cannot completely prevent. New mechanisms to cope with loss and damage are being explored, including risk and insurance transfer measures. 94 SDG 13_CLIMATE ACTION \u2022\ufffd The issue of climate-induced displacements may become a human crisis. Loss of territories in the Pacific due to sea-level rise19 can pose new international policy dilemmas that touch upon sovereignty, legal, social and cultural issues. \u2022\ufffd People and their assets are increasingly exposed to climate change- induced hazards. A primary driver of increased exposure in the region has been rapid and unplanned development in hazard-prone areas, driven in part by heavy urbanization. \u2022\ufffd The work on achieving SDG 13 in the context of all SDGs has the opportunity to lay the groundwork that would enable countries in the region to advance their adaptation and mitigation efforts. TARGETS 13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries 13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning 13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning 13.a Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible 13.b Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development OUTLOOK The prospects for the achievement of this goal hinge on successful conservation and sustainability of marine and coastal ecosystems while maintaining the economic, food security and livelihood benefits of marine resources. Oceans, seas and coastal systems provide invaluable support to the planet for food security, transport, energy, tourism and many of the most critical ecosystem services, including climate. However, climate change, overfishing, habitat change, invasive species introduction and pollution arising from poor management practices and market failures are threatening ocean health, with serious harmful and irreversible consequences.

The main drivers of overfishing must be tackled, such as fishing vessel overcapacity, perverse subsidies and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. There are also serious human rights violations in the fisheries industry, including human trafficking and labour exploitation, that must be confronted. \u2022\ufffd As much as an estimated 40 per cent of the world\u2019s oceans are heavily affected by human activities,2 including nutrient-based pollution, marine debris and plastics and loss of coastal habitats, resulting in coastal hypoxia and loss of marine biodiversity and other ecosystem goods and services. These reflect poor management practices and underscore the need to directly target land-ocean interaction. \u2022\ufffd Warmer air and sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification and rising sea levels are expected to cause significant loss of coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass and intertidal habitats. Such losses will further threaten ecosystem health and expose coastal populations to increased harm from natural disasters, threats to basic human rights (such as food and fresh water) and population displacement. The small island developing States of the Pacific are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and require the most urgent attention. \u2022\ufffd For comprehensive future monitoring of SDG 14, statistics are needed on a broader range of benefits and challenges related to conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources. Current scientific knowledge on the complex marine ecosystems is too limited to develop complete coverage of indicators for monitoring ocean sustainability, compounded by the limited data for existing indicators. BRIGHT SPOTS Conservation and sustainability of marine and coastal ecosystems \u2022\ufffd Fisheries management and the economic value derived from fisheries for small island developing States is improving in the region. Conventional fisheries management is shifting from an orientation towards single-species maximization (such as maximum sustainable yield) to an ecosystem approach that is broader in scope, encompassing biological, environmental, economic and social objectives. \u2022\ufffd A growing number of marine protected areas have been created to protect threatened species and important habitats. Many countries in the region have started protecting large expanses of their coastal and oceanic waters; the most notable is Palau, which recently enacted the Palau National Marine Sanctuary Law, which declares 80 per cent of its waters as a no-take 98 SDG 14_LIFE BELOW WATER fishing zone.3 The Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security, a multilateral partnership, aims to contribute towards achieving SDG 14 targets by sustaining marine and coastal resources (participating countries are Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste). \u2022\ufffd Strengthening the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the negotiation of a new global treaty for the conservation of oceans and seas presents an opportunity to close current gaps in ocean governance. At the same time, support for country compliance with existing regional and global multilateral agreements provides a framework for achieving the SDG targets. \u2022\ufffd The durability of most plastics combined with inadequate end-of-life management has resulted in marine plastics and microplastics becoming a global problem.4 The Ocean Cleanup is developing advanced technologies to remove about half of the \u201cGreat Pacific garbage patch\u201d in ten years. Use of coastal and marine resources \u2022\ufffd Efforts to improve economic benefits from fisheries among small island developing States in the Pacific have made some progress. The strengthening of the Vessel Day Scheme,5 for instance, has increased the access-fee revenue paid by tuna fishing vessels,6 from $60 million in 2010 (when the scheme reached full implementation) to more than $400 million in 2015.7 Revenues are expected to increase further as the eight countries in that scheme continue to negotiate higher fees within the context of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention to ensure resource sustainability. There have been numerous attempts in all Pacific island countries to encourage small-scale fishers to harvest larger amounts of tuna. HOTSPOTS Harvesting and overfishing \u2022\ufffd Effectively addressing overfishing is likely to be the biggest challenge, considering the complexity of the drivers. Reducing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing requires political will. Weak laws, poor governance and ineffective fisheries management have made coastal fisheries in most of the region largely open access and overfished. Some countries, such as Indonesia, have taken strong positive action. \u2022\ufffd Governance of the fisheries sector is generally poor, and in some countries, it is undermined by corruption. Many governments have neglected the management and sustainability of coastal fisheries, which thus threatens the food security and livelihoods of coastal communities. \u2022\ufffd With high", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db76cca9-cd06-4a04-940e-7473318b9635": {"__data__": {"id_": "db76cca9-cd06-4a04-940e-7473318b9635", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfdfd4fe49f021a756c23845e92f03389b2ce849853804b29492cec2fe5b3a9e"}}, "hash": "cfdfd4fe49f021a756c23845e92f03389b2ce849853804b29492cec2fe5b3a9e", "text": "unemployment, particularly among youth in the Pacific, the fisheries sector has been an employer of last resort, and limits to entry are unlikely in the face of widespread unemployment and underemployment.

Marine pollution \u2022\ufffd Reduction of land-based pollution and marine debris, including ocean plastics, poses challenges to the overarching goal of industrialization by most Asian countries. The coasts will continue to be pollution sinks without dramatic consumption or waste management changes. Coastal and marine conservation \u2022\ufffd While the geographic extent of marine-protected areas has increased by roughly sevenfold (between 2000 and 2014),9 the areal coverage still falls below the target. Most marine protected areas are largely \u201cpaper parks\u201d with non-existent management plans; where they exist, implementation is hampered by lack of funds. EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Rather than a comprehensive global regime for conserving marine ecosystems in areas beyond national jurisdiction, there is currently a complex patchwork of regional agreements on fisheries and specific frameworks that address some threats to marine biodiversity (such as marine pollution). Discussions on a new global treaty to protect marine biodiversity called for at the Rio+20 summit represent a significant opportunity to take on this challenge. \u2022\ufffd While Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu are emerging as world leaders in the granting of licences for the mining of seabed minerals (only Papua New Guinea has granted licences for exploitation, the remaining licences are exploratory), the management and regulation of deep seabed mining according to the precautionary principle is a critical emerging issue in the Pacific. Domestic environmental management appears currently inadequate to ensure the protection of marine ecosystems. \u2022\ufffd The leaders of the Forty-Seventh Pacific Islands Forum welcomed the Paris Agreement and reiterated that achieving the goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5\u00b0C above pre- industrialized levels is an existential matter for many Forum members but must be addressed with urgency. 100 SDG 14_LIFE BELOW WATER TARGETS 14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution 14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans 14.3 Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all

order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics 14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information 14.6 By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries

OUTLOOK Rapid and continuing land use change and increases in demand for natural resources and arable land present serious challenges for the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems in the region. Although total forest cover has increased slightly due to increased forest plantation, biodiversity-rich primary forests are still under pressure. The region accounts for about one third of all threatened species; however, there are programmes achieving success in stopping habitat destruction and in reducing the menace to threatened species (tigers and snow leopards, in particular). THE PHOTO Rice fields belonging to local hill tribes in Sapa, Viet Nam Photo credit: Kibae Park/United Nations 103 Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss INSIGHTS \u2022\ufffd Terrestrial ecosystems are linked to the other goals through the range of essential ecosystem services provided to people and to economies\u2014provisioning services (fresh water, food, fibres, fuel, pharmaceuticals); regulating services (climate regulation; disaster risk reduction); cultural services (spiritual enrichment, recreation, aesthetic benefits); and supporting services (nutrient and water cycling).1 Biodiversity loss, ecological degradation and water-related disaster risks are growing in areas affected by forest loss. \u2022\ufffd Rural livelihoods are intimately impacted by the health of terrestrial ecosystems. The drivers of land-use change vary between subregions, and degradation of terrestrial ecosystems entails forgone benefits in terms of the multiple services provided by terrestrial ecosystems, including for rural livelihoods, disaster risk reduction, water supply, food security and carbon sequestration. \u2022\ufffd Although terrestrial protected areas are expanding, progress is slow, and capacity to sustainably manage these areas may not be keeping up. Key strategies to increase protected areas include expanding the role of the private sector and communities through innovative and diverse participatory governance models, such as community conservation areas and biodiversity heritage sites. Involvement of a diverse range of stakeholders to effectively support the management of protected areas will be critical so that they become more than just \u201cpaper parks\u201d. \u2022\ufffd Socioeconomic threats to terrestrial ecosystems can be addressed by integrating ecosystem values into planning. Efforts in this direction need to be stepped up. The increasing demand for the non-monetary values of terrestrial ecosystems can provide incentives for their conservation and sustainable use. \u2022\ufffd The risks of invasive species are growing as globalization proceeds. Invasive species impact natural resource-based livelihoods, such as fishing and food production. \u2022\ufffd Access to and the sharing of benefits from terrestrial ecosystems is likely to become increasingly inequitable, given the increased demand for ecosystem services and the constrained natural resource base. Focusing on the implementation of global frameworks, such as the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing, is important to ensure the fair and equitable use of benefits, especially from genetic resources. 104 SDG 15_LIFE ON LAND BRIGHT SPOTS Sustainable terrestrial ecosystems \u2022\ufffd In 2014, almost half of the region (24 countries)2 had protected terrestrial areas, totalling almost 3.2 million square kilometres and accounting for 13.9 per cent of the land in these countries.3 Bhutan and Brunei Darussalam have protected areas that are more than 40 per cent of their surface area (Bhutan at 49.2 per cent and Brunei Darussalam at 36.4 per cent in 2014),4 while China and India have made progress in expanding forest and protected area coverage. \u2022\ufffd There are positive trends in reforestation and afforestation that are resulting in substantial increases in secondary-forest cover. In many countries, ambitious national biodiversity targets have been established in National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans as instruments for implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity. \u2022\ufffd There are good regional examples of countries participating in global conservation efforts and addressing threatened species issues, such as the Global Tiger Recovery Programme and the Global Snow Leopard Ecosystem Protection Programme, in which all tiger and snow leopard range countries have strong participation.

The disadvantages of these investments outweigh the benefits to local communities, among other impacts. Some forms of agricultural investments\u2014notably large- scale investments in land concentrated in South-East Asia and Africa8\u2014can entail significant risks, reducing access to natural resources and cause the loss of livelihoods, especially where land rights are unclear and governance is weak.9 Enclave projects with few links to the surrounding rural economy and investments that shift labour from traditional livelihood activities to the production of non-edible or export crops may also present significant risks to food security and livelihoods.10 \u2022\ufffd Large-scale destruction and conversion of primary forests due to the increase in the production of commodities, such as palm oil, combined with the lack of application of environmental standards, legal loopholes, corruption (weak governance and private rent capture) will further have a detrimental effect on ecosystems and the livelihoods of local communities. \u2022\ufffd Reconciling the exploitation of natural resources, such as mineral resources, with sustainability will require strengthening institutions that facilitate dialogue and the wide participation of local communities and stakeholders (including the private sector). \u2022\ufffd A primary issue concerning threatened species (such as elephants, rhinos, pangolins, tigers and snow leopards) and biodiversity in general is that of unsustainable and/or illegal trade in wildlife and forest products. The value of illegal wildlife trade is estimated at $7 billion to $10 billion globally, making it the fourth most lucrative crime, with rapidly growing economies in the region driving it. Wildlife trade robs countries of natural capital while negatively impacting national and local revenues.

Better governance systems allow for the development of people-centric policies, social inclusion and effective, transparent, accountable and responsive institutions, all of which are important for sustainable development.3 Existing methodologies and capacities to measure effectiveness, accountability, inclusion and responsiveness of institutions are limited, however. Systematic methodologies need to be developed to measure the indicators for SDG targets 16.6 and 16.7.4 Countries and stakeholders need to be supported to collect comparable and disaggregated data. The data also would be useful for monitoring targets for SDGs 1, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 11. \u2022\ufffd Corruption is a major driver of inequality in the region.5 An estimated 40 per cent of investments in electricity, water and sanitation are lost due to corruption.6 Illicit financial flows from the region accounted for about 40 per cent of the total illicit outflows from developing countries from 2004 to 2013.7 Illicit financial flows severely limit the overall finances available for development and significantly offset international commercial resource inflows (such as foreign direct investment) into the region.8 (Illicit financial flows are discussed in SDG 17 Finance). SDG target 16.5 calls for reducing corruption and bribery in all their forms. \u2022\ufffd SDG 16 has one composite target on reducing all forms of violence and related deaths. Its indicators currently focus on measuring intentional homicide (as proposed under the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes). There are calls for reporting conflict-related deaths separately because it is a \u201cdistinct phenomena with differing root causes as well as varying levels of precision in measurement\u201d.9 Conflict-related deaths do not overlap with intentional homicides. \u2022\ufffd In the estimates of forced labour, which is a proxy for human trafficking, the Asia-Pacific region has the largest number of victims, at 11.7 million people in 2012. Efforts to determine the prevalence of modern slavery (another proxy for human trafficking) suggest a larger number. SDG targets 5.2, 8.7 and 16.2 directly address human trafficking; these targets cut across issues, from poverty, inequality, decent work and corruption to migration, gender, youth, climate and conflict. Indicator 16.2.2 on the number of victims of human trafficking per 100,000 population by sex, age and form of exploitation reflects a need for much more significant efforts to identify and assist victims of trafficking. \u2022\ufffd The dearth of data is a severe limitation for making sense of the complex governance challenges and limits the monitoring of SDG 16 targets and indicators.

Financing for development in upper-middle- income countries, by contrast, has been lifted by public sector financing and a steady flow of FDI.4 \u2022\ufffd While ODA and other official flows of funds are now relatively modest, compared with other sources of finance, it is still an important source of support for many countries in the region. One third of the total ODA flows in 2015 went to developing countries in the region. ODA also continues to have an important role in the least developed and small island developing countries.

However, the absorptive capacity1 of countries is important to consider in this context because it determines the degree to which countries benefit from access to STI cooperation. \u2022\ufffd The debate on international technology cooperation has long been dominated by one-way technology transfer. Ensuring that STI cooperation contributes to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda requires a re-orientation towards more collaboration and technology sharing.2 \u2022\ufffd There is increasing advocacy around redefining the parameters of technology transfer, dissemination and diffusion so that they contribute to sustainable development. The success of technology cooperation will be increasingly defined in terms of how it can also deliver social inclusiveness and environmental sustainability\u2014beyond the traditional economic-based metrics.3 Technology and its benefits need to reach the poorest households, consistent with the \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d aspiration of the 2030 Agenda. \u2022\ufffd Cooperation by national governments (including through education spending) with academia and the private sector (including support from philanthropy) on new technologies can support innovation. This collaboration can also support a renewed and widespread focus on long-term investments in research, capacity building, sustainable innovation and technology. There also is an important role for open platforms for sharing scientific knowledge and collaboration.4 \u2022\ufffd Technologies available in the public domain could support technological development in poorer countries. Lack of knowledge about these technologies and capacity to use them, however, are important constraint.5 \u2022\ufffd Successful adaptation by countries of technologies from the rest of the world requires more advanced education and well-trained and highly skilled knowledge workers. This speaks to the expanded education focus of SDG 4, which goes beyond formal education. 122 SDG 17_PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS BRIGHT SPOTS International cooperation on science, technology and innovation \u2022\ufffd A number of multistakeholder mechanisms dealing with STI have been established at the United Nations, including the Technology Facilitation Mechanism at the global level. In contrast to previous STI cooperation mechanisms, the recently established ones include representatives beyond member States and recognize the role of indigenous knowledge. This inclusive and multistakeholder approach bodes well for ensuring that various perspectives are represented in shaping United Nations\u2019 priorities and programmes.6 \u2022\ufffd The region has large potential to lead regional and global STI cooperation: \u2022\ufffd Research and development expenditure: The region\u2019s share of world expenditure on R&D rose from 35.3 per cent in 2007 to 42.1 per cent in 2013.7 \u2022\ufffd Research capacity: The region\u2019s percentage share of global researchers rose from 41 per cent in 2007 to 44 per cent in 2013.8 \u2022\ufffd Frontier technologies: China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are among a small group of countries that are driving innovation in frontier technologies, including robotics and 3D printing. Chinese applicants, for instance, account for more than a quarter of patents worldwide in robotics and 3D printing\u2014the largest share among all countries as of 2015.9 These technologies will have a profound impact on the types of jobs in both industrialized and developing countries. In many developing countries without a legacy of technology systems, frontier technology is much easier to implement. \u2022\ufffd Environmental technologies: Japan accounted for approximately 22 per cent of environment-related technologies developed worldwide as of 2012, with Australia, China, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and Turkey accounting for approximately 15 per cent.10 This is a specific group of technology called for in SDG target 17.7. \u2022\ufffd Technology hubs: There are 287 technology hubs in South and South- East Asia, a number that is growing on a weekly basis.11 HOTSPOTS Access to science, technology and innovation \u2022\ufffd Although there are already a number of STI platforms in many ESCAP subregions (Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation), they are unconnected and do not include many economies, such as many Pacific island countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "684237d8-0d73-46f4-ae34-3fbe1a6af4e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "684237d8-0d73-46f4-ae34-3fbe1a6af4e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a1a62e8bc718401da7c09878fba60667f49147275a4a69d092abc3b40cc4b89"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb17ce44-d237-4e01-9d16-0e1df796e256", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "070d3e56c5bbd41f8f3c6ee88673c989781bf463e261662233d8069d72f8b602"}}, "hash": "06da17b4a65aafcf778e3a3b0f969c69713cab984d69ca5ef388140eb9820aa6", "text": "A total of 19 countries do not belong to any cooperation platform or mechanism.12 \u2022\ufffd Eight countries rank in the top quartile of the Global Innovation Index, while nine countries rank in the bottom quartile.13 Many countries have no expenditure on R&D at all.14 \u2022\ufffd Access to information and communications technology is the backbone of an innovative economy (and is also considered a means of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5eedd5ec-af79-4eae-a416-84810248c70f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5eedd5ec-af79-4eae-a416-84810248c70f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Sustainable Development Goals Outlook", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-sustainable-development-goals-outlook", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5692b3ee73e8f0b5bc7b97997ffe728a8641247a155094fcb84b58dccb6d288d"}}, "hash": "5692b3ee73e8f0b5bc7b97997ffe728a8641247a155094fcb84b58dccb6d288d", "text": "achieving SDG 9); yet, the region is one of the most digitally divided in the world15\u201472 per cent of fixed-broadband subscribers reside in North and North-East Asia.16 In other parts of the region, regulatory shortcomings and affordability impact fixed-broadband penetration. \u2022\ufffd Research inequalities remain, with 95 per cent of the region\u2019s researchers located in just five countries.17 EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Technology and innovation may result in some displacement of jobs by smart machines and innovative processes. While the adoption of new technology may result in job creation and an increase in productivity in many sectors, it will not be automatically inclusive if the displaced workers are not able to adapt or move to other sectors.18 These changes underscore the importance of retooling workers with knowledge-based skills so they can adapt to automation and technology-led business models. \u2022\ufffd Traditional thinking that technological innovation only comes from higher education institutions is increasingly challenged by the swift transformation and creation of knowledge outside these institutions. Industry practitioners and field experts have been important technology innovators. A broader and more inclusive process of technology support and education is increasingly required. \u2022\ufffd To complement national efforts, the potential of subnational cooperation (between cities) to provide a viable vehicle for technology cooperation deserves further consideration. The similarities of socioeconomic circumstances and challenges encountered between two cities could provide a more compelling case for technology cooperation than broader national interests.19 \u2022\ufffd Future developments in the trade and foreign direct investment regimes will be critical in the evolution of intellectual property regulations that can facilitate wider access to technology without stifling the competition that drives innovation. 124 SDG 17_PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS TARGETS Technology 17.6 Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanism 17.7 Promote the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed 17.8 Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity- building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Trade OUTLOOK The starting point looks good, but there is substantial uncertainty due to the global economic conditions, lack of progress in multilateral trade liberalization, potential weakening of the global trade regime under the World Trade Organization due to parallel trade liberalization initiatives and pressures for use of more protectionist measures. Least developed countries remain particularly vulnerable to external shocks, and their production structure constrains them from fully benefiting from trade. The potential contribution of agriculture as an instrumental sector for poverty reduction is limited by both tariff and non-tariff measures affecting agricultural trade and production. THE PHOTO Female vendor keeps shop at a wet market in Phuket, Thailand Photo credit: ADB 127 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development INSIGHTS \u2022\ufffd The high growth rates of exports in least developed countries and developing countries between 2000 and 2010 were mainly enabled by high commodity prices and rising demand from emerging markets (especially China). Both drivers have since weakened. Global and regional economic headwinds will impact, to a large extent, the feasibility of achieving these targets. \u2022\ufffd More and much better data are needed to track other factors (beyond tariff rates) that impact market access for developing countries. Small island developing countries and least developed countries continue to be affected by non-tariff measures and high trade costs. Systematic collection of data and analysis of non-tariff measures is needed. Full implementation of the World Trade Organization\u2019s Trade Facilitation Agreement can potentially reduce trade costs for developing countries in Asia and the Pacific by up to 17 per cent.1 Yet, no indicators currently proposed take into account the reduction of trade costs. \u2022\ufffd Greater attention need to be given to the recent developments in international trade policies, in order to maintain and improve the preferential market access of least developed countries. \u2022\ufffd Services and services trade are irreplaceable factors that enable industrialization and deeper production and export diversification of developing and least developed countries.

If the contribution of China is excluded, the share of developing countries in the region in world merchandise exports in 2015 becomes 19.7 per cent, and the share of services export becomes 17.6 per cent.6 Developing economies in the region include major export-oriented economies, like Hong Kong, China, the Republic of Korea and Singapore, which inflates export shares. HOTSPOTS Least developed country exports and market access, especially for agricultural products \u2022\ufffd Least developed countries within the region accounted for only 0.2 per cent of global exports (goods and services combined) in 2015. There has been a substantial slowdown in the growth rate of this share since 2010, compared with the 2005\u20132010 period.7 \u2022\ufffd The 2030 Agenda targets the doubling of the world exports share of least developed countries by 2020. ESCAP, however, showed in 20158 that some least developed countries might fail to reach this target. Based on the historical growth rates, the target seems attainable for such countries as Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. This target will be ambitious for other least developed countries, such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Kiribati, Myanmar, Nepal, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. \u2022\ufffd On average, developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing countries of the region experienced a fall in tariff rates imposed by industrialized countries between 2002 and 2013. But the tariffs levied by industrialized countries on agricultural exports were higher than the average tariffs, and declines in the tariffs on agricultural exports were lower than the average decline in tariffs. In 2014, agriculture exports from developing countries and least developed countries of East Asia and South- East Asia encountered the highest average tariffs in industrialized country markets, when compared with tariffs on agriculture exports originating from developing countries and least developed countries in other regions.9 \u2022\ufffd There is an increasing trend in the use of non-tariff measures across the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors. EMERGING ISSUES \u2022\ufffd Trade-related indicators within the SDG framework do not fully capture many significant emerging issues, such as services trade restrictions, non-tariff measures, quality of exports or e-commerce. These indicators need to be closely monitored. \u2022\ufffd The number of preferential trade agreements, which tend to exclude least developing countries, is on the rise. This may lead to erosion in the relative preference margin obtained by least developed country exports10 and can emerge as an important impediment in the expansion of exports from least developed countries. \u2022\ufffd The increasing use of non-tariff measures presents a big challenge to market access for exports from developing countries, including least developed countries.11 \u2022\ufffd Digital trade, or e-commerce, is emerging as an important enabler of trade. Countries need to evaluate their readiness and capability to develop digital trade and monitor its impact on sustainable development. \u2022\ufffd Services trade has been gaining prominence in terms of its role in facilitating global trade and global value chains.

But it also relies on expert interpretation and insights to provide a snapshot of the region\u2019s potential to achieve the SDGs. The SDGs are diverse and interlinked, and within each goal, the targets are themselves varied. Practical methods, tools and indicators to capture the links (for example, the nexus between climate, land use, energy and water strategies) must be better used and operationalized at the country level. There are also numerous blind spots\u2014targets that countries may not know enough about at the moment. Partnerships in follow-up and review are needed to mobilize the investment required to effectively track progress on the SDGs. The preparation of this report was constrained by indicator and data gaps. Many of these gaps will be addressed as the work of the IAEG-S
