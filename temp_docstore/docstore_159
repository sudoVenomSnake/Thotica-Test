However, to successfully facilitate the cooperation required to achieve effective transboundary conservation, the process can be complex, costly and long. In order to ensure that decision-makers, funders (often the same entities) and donors embrace the essential role that these types of initiatives can play in building resilience to local and global threats, they need to be made aware of successful case studies. In this way, the theory of benefits can be backed up by real examples. This can also help to motivate and encourage the proponents of transboundary conservation to continue in their endeavours. The IUCN WCPA Transboundary Conservation Specialist Group (TBC SG) was established in 1997 and currently has more than 260 members who give of their time voluntarily to support the work of this global network. One of the greatest achievements of the TBC SG is the development and publishing of the IUCN WCPA Best Practice Guidelines \u2018Transboundary Conservation: a Systematic and Integrated Approach\u2019, made available in 2015. The Guidelines contain many transboundary conservation case study examples and have been used to support capacity building initiatives. The TBC SG has also been preparing TB eNEWS to enable exchange of relevant information, but it requires funding in order to ensure that it can be compiled and published on a more regular basis. It is here that synergies with the PANORAMA initiative are possible in that it provides the platform on which transboundary conservation success stories may be published, shared, discussed and scaled-up. The TBC SG welcomes the opportunity to work with PANORAMA and looks forward to building on these synergies. The more transboundary conservation success stories are showcased the more chance we have of seeing them succeed elsewhere.

As a result, both sides implement concrete binational actions improving communication, control and surveillance strategies, reducing threats to regional biodiversity and hence elevating the transboundary protected area governance. Location Guatemala and Mexico Improved coordination between the management authorities of both natural protected areas. Based on a common plan and a shared working agenda, there is more communication between local authorities that facilitates appropriate decision making and effective protection. This in turn benefits the integrity of the ecosystem and its services. Improved institutional presence and strengthened capacities within the communities along the border. Both protected areas dedicate their time and personnel more efficiently to generate environmental awareness about the importance and benefits of protecting this shared forest. Strengthened capacities of park rangers on key aspects like fire management and biodiversity monitoring. Through specific trainings and exchanges, park rangers have improved their capacities and developed common strategies to reduce impacts of illegal hunting, fires and illegal logging. A joint monitoring program for key species like jaguars, tapirs, and others has also been developed. This in turn reduces illegal activities like poaching and leads to a better understanding of the wildlife population dynamics of target species Impacts SOLuTION FuLL 11 Transboundary conservation in the Selva Maya through park ranger exchanges Building blocks Transboundary exchange to define common activities To address multiple threats to the integrity of the shared ecosystems, such as wildlife and fauna trafficking, the protected area agencies\u2019 directors and rangers carried out exchanges.

The activities made the common history come to life, which helped in leaving behind past grievances through achievement of common goals and enhancing sustainable tourism within the Oulanka-Paanaj\u00e4rvi twin park. Location Oulanka National Park, Finland and Paanaj\u00e4rvi National Park, Russia Limits of Acceptable Change methodology was taken into practice in Oulanka National Park in order to guarantee sustainable tourism and recreation within the NP. Sustainable Tourism Development Strategy for Paanaj\u00e4rvi National Park was developed, which strengthened the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of the NP and cooperation between tourism sector, NP and other stakeholders. Sustainable tourism practices were standardized in the Oulanka- Paanaj\u00e4rvi twin park. Channeling of visitor use to decrease risk of overcrowding and disturbance in ecologically sensitive areas in the National Parks was improved. Waste management of Paanaj\u00e4rvi NP was developed, strengthening ecological sustainability of the NP. Nature interpretation and visitor guidance practices and methods/effectiveness of communication on nature-oriented tourism and cultural heritage were strengthened enabling better understanding and interpretation of natural and cultural significance of Oulanka and Paanaj\u00e4rvi National Parks and their shared common history. Sense of common history and future was strengthened. Personal contacts between NPs increased and management unified through implementation of joint action. Commitment to joint work increased. Impacts SOLuTION FuLL 13 Enhancing Sustainability and Cooperation in Transboundary National Parks Building blocks Development of GIS-based electronic information points Nine electronic, multi-lingual information points in- and outside the NPs provide entertaining information about the possibilities for experiencing nature in the parks, encouraging also visitation across the border. Training and certification of National Park guides A training system for nature guides and principles governing the certification of guides were developed in cooperation with an educational institute. This helps intensify the visitor\u2019s experience thanks to guides that are specialised in sites. Enhancing sustainable tourism in transboundary NPs Research institutions conducted assessments of ecological sustainability of tourism and recreational use in both national parks. Sustainable Tourism Development Strategies were developed or their implementation strengthened to ensure long-term sustainability of ecological and socio-economic development of the whole territory. Sharing a common past through preservation of cultural sites The fact that the NPs share common roots and want to share a common future as well was highlighted through the preservation and reconstruction of cultural sites, promotion of cultural tourism and dissemination of information. The border area was ravaged in past wars, and enhancing understanding of the past can promote peace and cooperation in our time. Strengthening transboundary cooperation through joint action The implementation of joint projects that e.g. developed employment opportunities has made transboundary cooperation part of the daily work in the management of the two transboundary National Parks, merging them into one real functional unit. 1 2 3 4 5 \u00a9 Minna Koramo / Mets\u00e4hallitus Parks & Wildlife Finland \u00a9 Minna Koramo / Mets\u00e4hallitus Parks & Wildlife Finland 14 3 Transboundary coordinated natural development and national park extension Solution provider Silke Weich, Dutch-German Nature Park Maas-Schwalm-Nette Summary The project focuses on protected areas along the Dutch-German border intersecting the municipalities Roermond, Roerdalen (Netherlands), Wassenberg and Wegberg (Germany).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4dc5e2f-f033-48b9-aa28-15709d595cd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4dc5e2f-f033-48b9-aa28-15709d595cd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-transboundary-protected-area-solutions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solutions in focus : transboundary protected area solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-transboundary-protected-area-solutions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b82609e010abb7edead7f278d0aa2a26a7ef3a8c3d652e5c0cfe08514a089508"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f9de0e9-16e8-4f60-8245-662adb4870d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-transboundary-protected-area-solutions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23165efede9d74fcce17984b0209ef446b67479b9b883db67f10d1b39a5c7c59"}}, "hash": "551709b9384fd14f799c51955184227ba38dcd32a5181b07fa5429bb6f0ca3c9", "text": "The aim of the project was to further develop a common national park region and to highlight its common history and its present-day significance.

Transboundary sustainable tourism To encourage nature-friendly behavior of visitors and to create consciousness of locals about ecosystems and the region\u2019s common history, multiple measures were taken to foster transboundary cooperation in the sustainable tourism sector, including development of wooden tourism infrastructure and walking routes, workshops for local tourism stakeholders and coordination of transboundary public relations. 1 2 3 4 \u00a9 Dutch-German Nature Park Maas-Schwalm-Nette \u00a9 Dutch-German Nature Park Maas-Schwalm-Nette 16 4 Transboundary cooperation for the removal of an invasive river plant Solution provider Lenka Reiterov\u00e1, Podyj\u00ed National Park Summary Eradication of the neophyte Himalayan balsam was a successful joint project of two bordering national parks, Thayatal (Austria) and Podyj\u00ed (Czech Republic), that led to a significant decrease of Himalayan balsam plants in the area\u2019s river valley, which acts as the border between the two parks and countries, and return of native plants. The most important success factors were the common approach to river valley management, access to both river banks by Czech staff, change in management of river valley meadows, and ongoing joint monitoring. Location Podyj\u00ed National Park, Czech Republic and Thayatal National Park, Austria The joint invasive species monitoring and eradication project was a great success. The Himalayan balsam has disappeared from both national parks with the exception of a few single stocks. In this way, problematic impacts on the Thaya River\u2019s ecosystem due to the rapid spreading of the neophyte were prevented. Targeted removal of Himalayan balsam started in 1995 on the Czech side and in 2001 on the Austrian side following establishment of Thayatal National Park in 2000. The population of Himalayan balsam then decreased rapidly. The surprising positive effect was enhanced by big floods in 2002, which also prevented Himalayan balsam from massive spreading. Since that time, the plant has practically disappeared from the river valley. The joint monitoring and removal of Himalayan balsam and other invasive neophytes in the river valley, along with mowing of river meadows by local landowners, occurs every year. These annual measures are still necessary to control the Himalayan balsam in the valley. The experience of successful cooperation through joint invasive species eradication and monitoring efforts provided added value that encourages and facilitates future transboundary collaboration.

The project develops political will for transboundary cooperation on water and sanitation. The GWN methodology is an original idea based on engaging cross-border communities and utilizing their interdependence on shared water resources to develop dialogue and cooperation for sustainable water management and advancing peacebuilding. Location Jordan, Israel, and Palestine EcoPeace successfully raises awareness of shared water issues among Palestinians, Jordanians, and Israelis and brings them together to jointly advance sustainable cross border water and sanitation projects and improve the natural environment. In 2015, EcoPeace presented a regional Master Plan for the Jordan River Valley, which with the support of community leaders and members identified, advanced common solutions to cross border environmental challenges. EcoPeace widened the constituencies of support for a shared vision of the valley. As more and more people articulate the geopolitical, social and environmental benefits of investing in the river\u2019s rehabilitation, the issue has garnered the attention of national decision makers and key world powers. In 2016, EcoPeace established a Center for Water Security in Washington DC to advance the resolution of water security issues in other conflict zones across the globe by replicating EcoPeace GWN model. The center seeks to disseminate best practices and adapt programming and strategies to the specific circumstances in the given locations.

Together, the communities identify projects that speak to the self-interest of both sides, gaining the capacity to advance solutions even within a turbulent political environment. The combination of a strong youth program and outspoken adult leadership creates the political will of local leaders to get involved. Top Down - National and International initiative Top-down initiatives to create broader political awareness are carried out, including: research and development of a concept paper to explain and document the issues, advocacy for national and international support, and establishment of media relations to heighten political awareness and to convey the information to the public.

A set of quantifiable objectives were identified to represent the main trade-offs and concerns across stakeholder groups while serving as success measures for the transboundary conservation efforts. Transboundary management options and external factors Park authorities identified external factors with a high degree uncertainty about their magnitude and effects on the objectives. A status quo scenario and an optimistic one, representing possible future trajectories for the external factors, were developed. Park authorities assigned a percent allocation toward each management activity in a way they believed would most likely achieve the objectives under each scenario.

Waterfowl monitoring results were shared between the three countries, even though the method was not harmonised in the three countries. There were recreational and health benefits to local people and visitors through new hiking trails, and increased knowledge through educational and information materials. Effort was made to serve the local people well: information was provided in national languages and in English, and materials were produced especially for school children. The established nature tourism working group increased information exchange and networking among tourism entrepreneurs. Dissemination of information was built in all activities of the project. There was increased knowledge about international cooperation in nature conservation and nature tourism among the target groups.

The neighbouring communities of the protected areas are involved in the management of the park, and they actively take part in the operational planning process and the evaluation of the joint strategic plan, and as a result are more willing to conserve natural resources and use them in a sustainable way. Different activities aimed at further supporting the development of local communities are being created such as beekeeping, eco-tourism and the construction of drinking water tanks. An operational joint surveillance system made up of rangers from the three different countries is being implemented across the national borders, and intelligence on illegal activities provided by the surveillance system is shared among all the park managers, creating a more thorough and informed approach to terminating illegal practices.

A long partnership process, at first originated by the need of common wildlife management, then led to sustainable development and common visual identity. Thanks to a growing number of integrated projects, the two parks developed a shared vision, and have finally created a common juridical structure following a new EU regulation: European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (EGTC). Location European Park Marittime-Mercantour, France and Italy Environment: common management of existing ibex population; reintroduction of the bearded vulture; common monitoring of the wolf natural re-colonization; transboundary scientific research, such as the All Taxa Biological Inventory (ATBI). Sustainable development: trail network, common signposting system, sustainable tourism (the parks signed jointly the EUROPARC European Charter for Sustainable Tourism and presented a common strategy and action plan for the whole transboundary area). Financing: funding of the Marittime-Mercantour Integrated Transboundary Plan (ITP) with 10 million EUR thanks to Interreg ALCOTRA European Programme. This plan consists in six integrated thematic projects: scientific research and nature conservation, cultural identity, territorial management, eco-tourism, soft mobility and environmental education. The plan has also stimulated local community involvement. Governance: on May 2013 the EGTC Marittime-Mercantour was officially established, giving birth to the first European Park and producing new ambitious goals such as its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. This idea now involves other five Italian protected areas, creating a continuous land stretch comprising all the ecological successions from the highest mountain to the Mediterranean Sea.

The KAZA univisa is a common tourist visa for the Southern African Development Community region, being piloted by Zambia and Zimbabwe for six months. After the pilot period, the univisa is intended to be rolled out to three other KAZA partner countries, namely Angola, Botswana, and Namibia. Location Zambia and Zimbabwe Eligible tourists are saving time and money because they only need to obtain one visa to visit both countries, resulting in enhanced and shared tourism benefits between the countries sharing the KAZA Transfrontier Conservation Area.

The European Green Belt Initiative is a transboundary collaborative project which includes nearly 150 governmental and non-governmental organizations, enterprises and scientific institutions, with the shared goal to conserve biodiversity, support local communities and aid natural resource management. Location Europe Ground-breaking steps to establish a sustainable governance structure were taken in 2012 with the creation of the \u2018Coordination Group\u2019, which was designed to develop the European Green Belt Initiative, organize Pan- European Green Belt conferences and oversee communication. This process lead to the official establishment of the European Green Belt Association e.V in February 2015. Despite there being marked differences in the four sections included in the initiative; the Fennoscandian, Baltic, Central European and Balkan Green Belt regions, and that the Green Belt is often along former border zones, this project has been able to work with countries which have politically sensitive histories towards a shared conservation goal. Through the initiative, there are programmes in environmental education, cultural heritage and societal integration. For example, in the Fennoscandian Green Belt there is extensive transboundary park-to-park cooperation and collaboration by scientific organizations, which are supported by government- level political decisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cc0cf197-d839-4fdf-80fb-980dbbf75311": {"__data__": {"id_": "cc0cf197-d839-4fdf-80fb-980dbbf75311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-transboundary-protected-area-solutions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Solutions in focus : transboundary protected area solutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-transboundary-protected-area-solutions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08c2cbbfcf63e160d9677a4129e85ccabfe0f5c5ad604087f86639dfad9e15c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "c10ce880-b354-4a0b-aa36-397b5bf4022f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/solutions-focus-transboundary-protected-area-solutions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc626ac560322a1b2dd7dbc26fec9a405c9cd050b852e9ac4aa58906abe38ec9"}}, "hash": "36e739b046c635c4f6ee814b10d81115a244938d2aabfd41bf217339359ffa0c", "text": "Impacts SOLuTION SNAPSHOT \u00a9 European Green Belt Association 30 14 Transboundary strategy for communication about nature conservation Solution provider Brady Mattsson, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria Summary The project used a participatory decision-making process to develop recommendations for transboundary cooperation in targeted external communication about nature conservation in the two national parks.

Authorities from each park came to a common understanding of shared objectives, actions, external factors at least partly beyond their control, and their linkages regarding external communication about nature conservation in the parks. The project generated a decision-analytic tool that can be expanded to inform an adaptive external communication program that can be linked to surveys and other analyses of public opinion. The park authorities also learned about structured decision-making as a participatory decision-analytic process, which led to new insights about their respective external communication programs and activities. The joint communication activities are expected to improve public opinion of maintaining or increasing non-intervention areas, natural resource management activities, and trustworthiness and competence of parks\u2019 staff.

Intending the creation of a transboundary gateway to a sustainable nature experience, the project provides the development of tourism offers supporting nature while contributing to regional development. Location Lake Neusiedl, Austria and Hungary The project achieved the intended transboundary development of eco-tourism and environmental education to provide an improved nature experience to visitors. This contributes to a more sustainable tourism and a raised awareness of natural processes and conservation among visitors. The targeted cooperation of protected area administrations continues also after the end of the project. The project also raised awareness among regional stakeholders and policymakers regarding potential benefits of transboundary cooperation and enhancing personal contacts especially in the field of eco-tourism. Raising awareness enables further coordination and thus improvement of eco-tourism and nature conservation in the area. This improved cooperation allows for the enhancement of the nature experience in an efficient way through creation of joint tourism activities. Furthermore, regional-development stakeholders in the West Pannonian region gained, for the first time, an insight in the characteristics of the ecosystems in the respective neighbouring countries.

The Executive Secretary is circulating herewith, for the information of participants in the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, a report entitled \u201cRestoration of forest ecosystems and landscapes as contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets\u201d prepared by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 2. The report provides an introduction to the concept of Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) and draws linkages between the implementation of various countries\u2019 pledges for FLR, taken under the Bonn Challenge, and the achievement of Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Activities conducted under the Bonn challenge have the potential to contribute to support a range of Aichi Biodiversity Targets, in particular Targets 5 and 15. Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5 and 15 are relevant to items 9, 10, 13 and 19 of the provisional agenda of the thirteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. 3. The report provides country-specific data generated through assessments of opportunities for forest landscape restoration, with details on how various restoration actions can contribute to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in a given national context. This information could help countries refine the alignment of their Forest Landscape Restoration strategies with their national biodiversity strategy and actions plan. These linkages will be further explored through the collaboration between IUCN and the Forest Ecosystem Restoration initiative in 2017, through regional capacity-building and direct support activities. * UNEP/CBD/COP/13/1.

One approach to prepare to implement FLR is through the application of the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM), which provides a flexible and affordable framework for countries to rapidly identify and analyse areas that are suitable for FLR and to identify specific priority areas at a national or sub-national level.

This includes uses pertaining to sustainable productive land uses such as the implementation of agroforestry systems or sustainable forest management, and identification of areas that are important for biodiversity conservation or that will improve the connectivity among high biodiversity areas (Target 11). The main focus of these assessments is to optimise the positive impacts of land use transitions on key ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration (Target 15), the provision of the hydrological services water yield and sediment retention (Target 14), and nutrient retention (Target 8). Understanding the direct monetary impacts of land use transitions for landholders (individual or communal), and the impacts on the provision of key ecosystem services are the main outputs for developing restoration incentive instruments (Target 3). Overall they serve as input in the development of the financial strategy of the different restoration programmes (Target 20). Restoration opportunities assessments also have the potential to identify and prioritise restoration in areas that are of specific concern to threatened species and biodiversity (Target 12), to design restoration strategies that support the increase and maintenance of genetic diversity in cultivars (Target 13) and to ensure that restoration actions are not vectors for the establishment and spread of invasive alien species (Target 9). Finally, measuring the provision of ecosystem services from different land uses is one way to demonstrate the value of high biodiversity areas (Target 1). There are good examples from countries that are already implementing FLR activities, having integrated them as part of their national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPs) or having pledged actions on FLR under a number of other international commitments and initiatives that seek to support climate change mitigation, adaptation, improve water provision, and meet other social and economic development goals. This includes the 38 national and sub-national governments, the private sector and restoration alliances that have committed close to 125 million hectares to the Bonn Challenge \u2013 a global effort to bring 150 million hectares into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. Selected examples of findings from the restoration assessments carried out in nine jurisdictions where Bonn Challenge commitments have been or could be made at the national or sub-national level can be found in the tables annexed to this document. The restoration activities or FLR interventions included in the tables were identified as the most appropriate for the national situation and respond to the results of the biophysical, economic and institutional analyses and iv consultations/feedback from stakeholders. Furthermore, the tables show information on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets that best connect to the appropriate restoration techniques identified by the country assessments. The integration of these commitments and initiatives into what countries report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) would be the logical next step in the process of accelerating action to implement the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. In order to materialise this potential, countries could take advantage of activities related to the restoration of forest ecosystems at a landscape scale that are currently under implementation at the national or jurisdictional level.

This is illustrated with examples by Parties that have already identified, or could easily identify the potential of FLR for meeting their biodiversity goals and targets. Another opportunity to bolster achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets through restoration of forest landscapes is to connect the Bonn Challenge to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The Bonn Challenge is a global effort to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested lands into restoration by 2020 and at least 350 million hectares by 2030. A number of Parties to the CBD have made and are implementing commitments to the Bonn Challenge. 2 Restoration of forest ecosystems at a landscape scale FLR is the ongoing process of regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human wellbeing across deforested or degraded forest landscapes. A restored forest landscape could include naturally regenerated areas, agroforestry, on-farm trees, mangroves, protected wildlife reserves, plantings of trees and other woody plants such as bamboos, and more. \u2022 FLR restores \u201cforward\u201d to meet present and future needs and to offer multiple benefits and land uses over time. \u2022 FLR is not just about \u201cforests\u201d \u2013 it focuses on increasing the number, health and/or diversity of plants in an area. The term \u201cforests\u201d always includes trees and other woody plants, but may also include other features such as mangroves, windbreaks, or small open areas depending on the landscape in question. \u2022 FLR is about \u201clandscapes\u201d \u2013 it involves entire watersheds, jurisdictions, or even countries \u2013 areas in which many different land uses interact. \u2022 FLR is about \u201crestoration\u201d \u2013 it involves enhancing the biological productivity of an area in order to achieve multiple benefits for people and nature. \u2022 FLR is \u201congoing\u201d \u2013 it requires a multi- year vision of the ecological functions and benefits to human wellbeing that can be gained; in addition to the tangible deliverables such as jobs, income and carbon sequestration that begin to flow right away. A fuller reference to what FLR encompasses can be found in the principles that guide the application of the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM): Graphic by EcoAgriculture Partners, photo by Nate Dappen 3 1. Restoring an agreed, balanced package of landscape functions; not only increasing forest cover and not trying to re-establish the forests of the past; 2. Working across whole landscapes containing mosaics of land uses; not just individual sites, so trade-offs can be made; 3. Using of a range of restoration options from natural regeneration to tree planting as appropriate; 4. Active negotiation and collaboration among stakeholders; 5. Avoiding further reduction or conversion of natural forest cover and other ecosystems; and 6. Tailoring to local conditions; continuously learning and adapting to changes in these landscapes. FLR offers a biological and socio-economic transformation of large areas of degraded and deforested land into resilient, multifunctional assets that can contribute to local and national economies, sequester significant amounts of carbon, strengthen food and clean water supplies and safeguard biodiversity. This is accomplished through balancing a mosaic of interdependent land uses, including agriculture, agroforestry systems and improved fallow systems, ecological corridors, discrete areas of forests and woodlands, and riparian plantings to protect waterways to create nature-based solutions to landscape challenges. Considering and restoring entire landscapes, as opposed to individual sites, is critical in the FLR approach. Landscapes are often seen as sets of overlapping ecological, social and economic networks within a specific area. This makes landscapes an ideal, albeit malleable unit for planning and decision making as it allows for the integration of various sector plans and programmes into a spatial context, combining natural resources management with environmental and livelihood considerations. People and institutions are therefore perceived as an integrated part of the landscape system rather than as external agents operating without impunity. 4 Forest landscape restoration through the Bonn Challenge According to a global assessment of restoration potential carried out for the Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration, there may be more than two billion hectares of deforested and degraded land around the world where opportunities for some type of restoration may be found. The Bonn Challenge aims to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land under restoration by 2020 and at least 350 million hectares by 2030.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7a11aab-61df-4831-ac67-083937ec76a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7a11aab-61df-4831-ac67-083937ec76a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Restoration of forest ecosystems and landscapes as contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1db906ec2170a8b09f9fb38c22390365349d35f583051f9be188afe7a94032e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7360330-3c1d-4a0c-ad4c-5336d0ce39f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db31f89ec80200cae4e010bd0b6178b8646e105dff8f39aaa547ebf56b7243cd"}}, "hash": "a45bb6403773fae1b8ca47811bc4956235a43113edd20b29170563e9f29d4df0", "text": "In September 2011, at a high-level event co-hosted by the German Ministry of the Environment and IUCN, the Bonn Challenge 2020 target was launched by leaders from around the world.

This target is consistent with Aichi Target 15 which calls for the restoration of 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020, while contributing to other Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The Bonn Challenge is an implementation vehicle for national priorities such as water and food security, disaster risk reduction and rural development as well as for international biodiversity, climate change and land degradation commitments. As of November 2016, the Bonn Challenge has reached almost 125 million hectares pledged from 38 national and sub- national governments, restoration alliances and the private sector from around the globe. With the recent launch of the Bonn Challenge Barometer it will be possible to measure progress of implementation of these restoration pledges in terms of policy commitments and financing, in-country technical knowledge gained, and on- ground progress which will include estimation of biodiversity and livelihood benefits from restoration activities. Many of the countries that are Bonn Challenge partners have incorporated their restoration plans into their National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) and National Reports to the CBD\u00b9. There are also Parties to the CBD currently implementing FLR activities and planning that have the opportunity to align these activities within their NBSAPs and report on those as progress to the CBD but have not yet done so. Finally, there are Parties who are currently undertaking activities that could be considered FLR and would contribute to the Bonn Challenge, but are not yet recognised as such. \u00b9 For more information on countries and their restoration targets in their NBSAPs & National Reports please visit www.infoflr.org 5 Forest landscape restoration to achieve Aichi Biodiversity Targets FLR supports the overall vision of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets: By 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people. Ecosystem connectivity and resilience are key concerns for the FLR practitioner when weighing how restoration activities apply to an entire landscape \u2013 including the genesis and flow of ecosystem services. Through connecting and restoring ecosystems that have been degraded, habitat and biodiversity will improve and certain FLR activities, if properly targeted, can genuinely support the increase in populations of threatened species. FLR supports Aichi Biodiversity Targets such as: \u2022 minimisation of harmful measures to biodiversity (Target 3); \u2022 sustainable use of productive lands ensuring conservation of biodiversity (Target 7); \u2022 reduction of soil pollution and other pollution sources levels to ensure the functioning of ecosystems and biodiversity (Target 8); \u2022 invasive alien species control, eradication, and reduction (Target 9); \u2022 conservation of natural protected areas (Target 11); \u2022 prevention of extinction and improvement of conservation of known threatened species (Target 12); \u2022 maintenance, erosion prevention and safeguarding of the genetic diversity of socio- economically and culturally valuable species (Target 13); \u2022 restoration of ecosystems that provide essential ecosystem and livelihood services (Target 14); ecosystem resilience and contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks enhancement through conservation and restoration of ecosystems (Target 15); and \u2022 substantially increasing mobilization of financial resources to effectively implement the CBD Strategic Plan (Target 20). While relevant to all of these, FLR can perhaps make the greatest contribution to Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 14 and 15. Restoration strategies can support Target 5 by prioritising decisions on land use that avoid a reduction of natural forest cover. FLR can also directly reduce and address or eliminate the loss and conversion of primary and secondary natural forest by providing sustainable resources and livelihoods. One of the largest threats to natural habitats is expanding agricultural land into primary habitat. The Aichi Biodiversity Targets most relevant to FLR: \u2022 Target 5: \u201cBy 2020, the rate of loss of all natural habitats, including forests, is at least halved and where feasible brought close to zero, and degradation and fragmentation is significantly reduced.\u201d \u2022 Target 14: \u201cBy 2020, ecosystems that provide essential services, including services related to water, and contribute to health, livelihoods and wellbeing, are restored and safeguarded, taking into account the needs of women, indigenous and local communities, and the poor and vulnerable.\u201d \u2022 Target 15: \u201cBy 2020, ecosystem resilience and the contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks has been enhanced, through conservation and restoration, including restoration of at least 15 per cent of degraded ecosystems, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation and to combating desertification.\u201d 6 Through restoration of degraded land, FLR can increase agricultural productivity and reduce or eliminate the need for new agricultural land, thereby reducing pressures on natural habitats. By using ecological intensification techniques and carefully controlling the impacts of pesticides and fertiliser runoff, the increase in productivity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d94d96e-5785-4cce-9c20-98fa6385584a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d94d96e-5785-4cce-9c20-98fa6385584a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Restoration of forest ecosystems and landscapes as contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bd8720f38f0d812ceb126b94fb6876fb91849063554c1e29adbd8284f209716"}}, "hash": "6bd8720f38f0d812ceb126b94fb6876fb91849063554c1e29adbd8284f209716", "text": "in agricultural areas can be achieved while limiting impacts on agro-biodiversity and on species that use agricultural land for their habitat. Moreover, through comprehensive planning and stakeholder engagement, activities that put pressure on forests (agriculture, livestock) can be shifted to more suitable areas for production. Restoration of mixed-use agricultural land in areas adjacent to primary habitat can also provide higher quality matrix habitat between forest fragments and lead to the creation of wildlife corridors that can improve the resilience of certain species to climate change. FLR is a multi-stakeholder process that works at a landscape level to identify and implement restoration that leads to \u2018functional landscapes\u2019. In order to accomplish this, it is often critical to measure and monitor ecosystem services. Not only does the process of FLR often require an assessment of ecosystem services, but it also requires that the benefits of restoration are measured, and many of the indicators of success are measured in terms of ecosystem services. Since these activities are generally at a landscape scale, this provides an important source of attributable information to stakeholders and international conventions, such as the CBD, on the existence and maintenance of ecosystem services, as well as on the equitable distribution of economic and non-economic benefits resulting from restoration activities. All of this is a direct contribution to Target 14, and this broad and inclusive stakeholder-driven process will help to ensure that benefits and costs associated with ecosystem services are equitably distributed. With regards to Target 15, FLR practices seek to improve the long-term ecological and social resilience and productivity of currently degraded and deforested landscapes. Moreover, restoration involves a wide range of strategies from on-farm trees to planting of trees and other woody plants that have a direct effect on the volume of carbon capture in climate change mitigation schemes. FLR implementation naturally adopts an ecosystem-based adaptation approach by considering biodiversity, ecosystem services, and social welfare and resilience when defining adaptation strategies to climate change. FLR promotes the idea that landscapes can have multiple functions that provide essential services for people like food and livelihoods by accommodating multiple land uses, such as protected areas, agroforestry or new tree plantings. Restoration interventions planned within a landscape context can serve as a vehicle for countries to meet different Aichi Biodiversity Targets in a coherent and mutually supportive way. Several of these arguments have been emphasised in the \u2018Short Term Action Plan on Restoration\u2019 annexed in the draft recommendation on ecosystem restoration (UNEP/CBD/SBSTTA/ REC/XX/12) which will be discussed during COP13. This Short Term Action Plan \u201caims to facilitate ecosystem restoration across all types of habitat (\u2026) including forests\u2019 under the understanding that restoration is \u2018a contribution to reversing the loss of biodiversity, recovering connectivity, improving ecosystem resilience, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services, mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, combating desertification and land degradation, and improving human wellbeing while reducing environmental risks and scarcities.\u201d The purpose of this Action Plan is to reinforce the relevance of FLR as a nature-based solution to restore deforested and degraded areas to support the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. 7 Forest landscape restoration in national strategies As mentioned before, several countries have included restoration of forest biodiversity and ecosystems as part of their national biodiversity strategies. In national reports and NBSAPs, forest ecosystems prominently appear with most countries providing quantitative time series of data of forest cover, often in a spatially explicit manner. Most national targets make an explicit reference to forest ecosystems and link them with plans that include restoration of degraded and deforested ecosystems, restoration of lands preventing deforestation and forest degradation, and promotion of restorative measures in ecosystems, among others. Encouragingly, issues of scale and broader thinking beyond the site level are coming through these strategies and plans. On the other hand, few of these national targets were found to be \u2018measurable\u2019 and \u2018time-bound\u2019, or to mirror the content of Aichi Target 5, 14 and 15. Outside of national targets set under NBSAPs, several Parties to the CBD have pledged actions on FLR under a number of international commitments and initiatives that seek to support climate change mitigation, adaptation, improve water provision and meet other social and economic development goals. The integration of these commitments and initiatives into what countries report to the CBD appears to be the logical next step into the process of accelerating action to implement the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. In order to materialise this potential, countries could take advantage of FLR related activities currently under implementation at the national or jurisdictional level.

NBSAPs examples where FLR has been incorporated In 2012, Colombia submitted its National Policy for the Integrated Management of Biodiversity and its Ecosystem Services (NPIMBES) to the CBD. In the NPIMBES, Colombia proposed a number of restoration-focused national targets to be completed by 2014. A key goal of Colombia\u2019s during the period of 2012 to 2014 was to implement measures to confront environmental change, which it planned to do by restoring or rehabilitating 280,000 hectares of land for protective aims, including connecting biological corridors and preventing deforestation, and by preventing the deforestation of 200,000 hectares out of the total 61 million hectares of natural forest. Peru\u2019s National Strategy on Biological Diversity and Action Plan details goals and plans for the period of 2014 to 2021. To achieve and operationalise the broader objectives laid out in the National Strategy, Peru created a complementary Action Plan on Biological Diversity for 2014 to 2018, which includes several goals that are relevant to restoration. One of the six strategic objectives of the National Strategy is to reduce the direct and indirect consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem processes pressures by 2021. A subcategory of this strategic objective is that by 2021, Peru plans to reduce the degradation of ecosystems by 5%, with an emphasis on reducing degradation to forests and fragile ecosystems. In support of this goal, the Action Plan states that Peru will reduce ecosystem degradation by 2% by 2018. Another goal mentioned in the Action Plan is that by the first semester of 2017, Peru will have a national proposal to recover and restore all ecosystems, which should have allocated budgets and responsibilities assigned across all government levels. Peru also plans to implement activities, such as the Forest Investment Program, in order to incentivise the value of forest ecosystems as well as the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation, by the second semester of 2016. This activity is related to Peru\u2019s stated objective of valuation of ecosystem services by 2021. India\u2019s National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP) was released in 2008 and updated in 2014 with new targets and plans, in alignment with the CBD\u2019s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Many of India\u2019s NBAP targets align with FLR objectives, including: \u2022 Target 5: Promote site-specific eco-development programmes in fringe areas of protecteed areas (PAs), to restore livelihoods and access to forest produce by local communities, owing to access restrictions in PAs. \u2022 Target 16: Formulate and implement partnerships for enhancement of wildlife habitat in Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves, on the lines of multi-stakeholder partnerships for afforestation, to derive both environmental and eco-tourism benefits. \u2022 Target 50: Promote reclamation of wasteland and degraded forest land through formulation and adoption of multi-stakeholder partnerships involving the land owning agency, local communities, and investors. \u2022 Target 53: Incorporate a special component in afforestation programmes for afforestation on the banks and catchments of rivers and reservoirs to prevent soil erosion and improve green cover. \u2022 Target 56: Mainstream the sustainable management of mangroves into the forestry sector regulatory regime so as to ensure the protection of coastal belts and conservation of flora and fauna in those areas. \u2022 Target 66: Promote restorative measures of degraded ecosystems using preferably locally adapted native species for this purpose. 8 9 Assessment of restoration opportunities and the relevant Aichi Biodiversity Targets IUCN, together with other partners, is working with countries to identify existing restoration opportunities using the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM), developed by IUCN and World Resources Institute (WRI). ROAM provides a flexible and affordable framework for countries to rapidly identify and analyse areas that are primed for FLR and to identify specific priority areas at a national or sub-national level. These restoration assessments include the carrying-out of geospatial analyses to locate restoration opportunities, analyses and stakeholder consultations to identify appropriate restoration actions, and economic analysis of the proposed restoration actions to assess net costs and benefits of different interventions. Numerous land use transitions are considered at the landscape level that have a connection with biodiversity benefits. This includes the ones pertaining to sustainable productive land uses such as the implementation of agroforestry systems or sustainable forest management, and identification of areas that are important for biodiversity conservation or that will improve the connectivity among high biodiversity areas (Target 11).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b80f928e-f25f-466b-afc8-66d3ac891a19": {"__data__": {"id_": "b80f928e-f25f-466b-afc8-66d3ac891a19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Restoration of forest ecosystems and landscapes as contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a66492b5115131d3ad8a5af513a29c369e082994669579f41de07c1a37c7b3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "63ce438c-21c2-4ce6-a492-dd78689883b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e91505e87cb86dd2a47a05a6e2c489567a302ac1df549d5bce418d286d6c17b5"}}, "hash": "b284dbf2910736a7c9a8c8a5abaf2519d8a76eeecd9f19dfb9df7342f1a85b65", "text": "The main focus of these assessments is to optimise the positive impact of land use transitions on key ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration (Target 15), the provision of the hydrological services water yield and sediment retention (Target 14), and nutrient retention (Target 8).

Restoration opportunities assessments also have the potential to identify and prioritise restoration in areas that are of specific concern to threatened species and biodiversity (Target 12), to design restoration strategies that support the increase and maintenance of genetic diversity in cultivars (Target 13) and to ensure that restoration actions are not vectors for the establishment and spread of invasive alien species (Target 9). Finally, measuring the provision of ecosystem services from different land uses is one way to demonstrate the value of high biodiversity areas (Target 1). As a result of the application of this methodology, various countries have been able to identify their restoration opportunity areas at the national or sub-national level with specific restoration activities to be implemented. Brazil, Costa Rica, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, El Salvador, Ghana\u00b2, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Rwanda are examples of jurisdictions that have completed ROAM assessments at the national or subnational level, which results are presented in the tables annexed to this document. The restoration activities or FLR interventions included in the tables were identified as the most appropriate for the national situation and respond to the results of the biophysical, economic and institutional analyses and consultations/feedback from stakeholders. Furthermore, the tables show information on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets that best connect to the appropriate restoration techniques identified by the country assessments. \u00b2 Ghana has a preliminary restoration assessment that includes a restoration opportunities map and associated analyses on net economic benefits per ton of carbon sequestered. 10 In some countries certain restoration activities have been deemed appropriate for a specific type of current land use; however different decisions could be taken in other countries for the same type of land use. The appropriate restoration transitions are dependent upon the country context. For example, in some landscapes restoration in degraded pastures could be implemented through agroforestry or silvopastural systems, while in others natural regeneration or plantations with native species would be more appropriate. The unifying factor is the FLR approach with the guiding principles described in the first section of this document. The manifestation of these principles through the selection of restoration strategies depends on many biophysical, socio-economic and other factors which vary from landscape to landscape. The following examples illustrate the diverse choices of restoration activities for certain land- uses and the associated Aichi Targets. In Brazil in 2009, a group of NGOs, private companies, governments, and research institutions launched one of the most ambitious ecological restoration programmes in the world \u2013 the Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica) Restoration Pact. The programme has more than 260 members and has a mission to restore 15 million hectares of the forest by 2050. The Pact aims to promote biodiversity conservation, job creation and income generating opportunities through the restoration supply chain, provision of key ecosystem services to millions of people as well as to establish incentives for landowners to comply with the Forest Code. The coalition plans to restore more than one million hectares of land by the Bonn Challenge\u2019s 2020 target. Espirito Santo, one of the state members of the Restoration Pact, developed a restoration opportunities assessment that found six types of current land usage \u2013 pasture, agriculture, macega (natural native vegetation in early secondary stage of regeneration), silviculture, bare soil, and mining \u2013 with a total area of restoration opportunity of 574,475 hectares. Some appropriate restoration techniques for Brazil would be high-density forest restoration, soil restoration, and assisted natural regeneration, among other interventions. The Aichi Biodiversity Targets that were identified as being most relevant to Brazil\u2019s restoration techniques are Targets 7, 13, and 15. In 2012, Costa Rica pledged to restore one million hectares toward the Bonn Challenge, and later completed a ROAM assessment. Costa Rica\u2019s restoration assessment identified an area with over three million hectares of restoration potential where activities cover ten types of current land usage, including categories such as pastures for milk and beef production, shade coffee plantations, and mature forest outside protected areas. Restoration in the selected area of one million hectares will contribute to Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 7, 8, 14, and 15. In 2016, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire pledged to restore five million hectares in support of the Bonn Challenge.

In its restoration assessment, the government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire identified 5,077,672 hectares of restoration potential, split among five categories of current land uses \u2013 protected areas, production forests, rural domains, other (including sacred groves), and abandoned mines; 87 percent of the restoration opportunity is currently held in rural lands. This assessment provided the foundation for the Bonn Challenge commitment. The restoration assessment identified a detailed list of possible restoration interventions for each type of land use, including participatory management of human habitats, land tenure security review, promotion of commodity-based agroforestry, and phytosanitary training and monitoring. Several Aichi Biodiversity Targets were identified as relevant through the implementation of restoration activities as per the assessment, such as Targets 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. 11 El Salvador has committed one million hectares to the Bonn Challenge, and completed a full ROAM assessment after its announcement, to better specify the extent and nature of the opportunity. El Salvador\u2019s restoration assessment found five types of current land use \u2013 scrub, basic grains, mosaic crop/grass/vegetation, sugar cane cultivation, and coffee plantations. The country\u2019s restoration assessment indicated that there are 1,152,647 hectares of restoration opportunity. El Salvador plans to restore this area of opportunity through a wide range of interventions, including the establishment of gallery forest, diversified systems of fruit cultivation, and replacing coffee with cocoa crops. The restoration assessment identified links to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, and 15. In 2015, Ghana committed 2 million hectares to the Bonn Challenge after identifying restoration opportunities across several types of land uses including degraded forests and deforested land, savannahs, wetlands, plantations, agricultural zones and abandoned mines. Restoration strategies for these types of lands have been included in a variety of initiatives, national plans, and regulations. Internationally funded initiatives such as FLEGT, FIP and Natural Resources and Environmental Governance Program (NREG) support restoration activities, while Ghana\u2019s restoration strategies include improvement of forest management systems, soil and water conservation, natural regeneration, cultivation of multipurpose trees in farms, re-introduction of native plants and animal genetic material, among others. The implementation of these FLR activities will generate benefits to biodiversity that could be linked with the Aichi Biodiversity Targets 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20. In Guatemala, the National Forest Institute decided to initiate a participatory process to develop a map of FLR opportunities. The aim of the assessment was to provide a basis for the development of the country\u2019s first national- level FLR strategy and the re-shaping of existing reforestation incentive schemes to better align with the FLR approach. This was seen as important for assisting the country in meeting its commitments under international conventions and national policies related to land use. The mapped assessment and national strategy process was also intended to provide a platform for cross- ministerial engagement so that priorities related to poverty reduction, food security and mitigation, for example, can be addressed in a complementary way with those related to forests and other land uses. The completed assessment identified three basic types of land use in Guatemala \u2013 low shrubbery, natural pastures, and basic grains \u2013 with a total area of opportunity for restoration of 1,757,409 hectares, from which an area of 1,230,755 hectares was prioritised and pledged under the Bonn Challenge. The appropriate restoration techniques identified were natural regeneration, forestry plantations, agroforestry systems with permanent crops, and silvopastoral systems, which connect to Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 7, 11, 14, and 15. In Mexico, the aim of the assessment was to contribute to the development of a cross- institutional national FLR strategy with a focus on the states of the Yucatan Peninsula. This assessment produced a national-level map of priority areas for FLR, which is being used by federal institutions to prioritise actions in support of national objectives, and to formulate the national FLR strategy and strengthen existing policy instruments on forest restoration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab22dfae-0055-4a7c-8feb-64311d94948e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab22dfae-0055-4a7c-8feb-64311d94948e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Restoration of forest ecosystems and landscapes as contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35bfec2b013ba733da7ebc0e31e73355fdc920d13781d9f9ab5bd183ecfa3d3b"}, "2": {"node_id": "92dc59d0-d5f4-4a77-85d7-611aaecce76d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34b6ff5158322bf0defc33ce4b86f30f7779b80220338a4bf0baaf3f64734d58"}}, "hash": "4a7b98959791c620c6c37806d8ec0ce04c6e05d6187e70ae9e7cc1929cb65fd3", "text": "The restoration assessment identified six types of land use in the Yucatan Peninsula \u2013 protected areas (IUCN category I to IV) and primary vegetation; protected areas (IUCN category VI); secondary vegetation (trees); secondary vegetation (shrubs and grasslands); agriculture and livestock grazing.

Since then, Nicaragua has completed a ROAM assessment for the north Caribbean coast region, and identified six categories of current land usage \u2013 natural grass savannah, scrub, shrubby and herbaceous vegetation, broadleaf forest restoration, annual crops and pastures. Within the north Caribbean coast region 1,203,052 hectares with potential for restoration have been identified. Some appropriate restoration techniques that were identified in the assessment include pine reforestation, recovery of perennial traditional crops, natural and induced regeneration, and agroforestry. The Aichi Biodiversity Targets that are most relevant to restoration in Nicaragua include Targets 5, 7, 11, 13, 14, and 15. In Rwanda, the initial impetus for a restoration assessment came from the ambitious commitment, announced by the Government of Rwanda in 2011, to implement FLR countrywide by 2035. The main aim of the assessment was therefore to guide the scaling up of Rwanda\u2019s restoration efforts. In its ROAM assessment, the government of Rwanda identified five types of land use \u2013 protected areas and primary vegetation, secondary vegetation (trees), protective forests, agriculture, and livestock grazing. In total, the ROAM assessment found 1,534,430 hectares of restoration opportunity around the country, with effects and benefits extending to more than two million hectares, and identified restoration interventions for each type of land use, ranging from natural regeneration (Aichi Biodiversity Targets 5, 11, 14, 15) to secondary forest enrichment for sustainable use (Targets 5, 11, 14, 15), to agroforestry (Targets 5, 7, 8, 15). The Aichi Biodiversity Targets that best connect to Rwanda\u2019s restoration techniques are Targets 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, and 15. Rwanda made a pledge to the Bonn Challenge to restore two million hectares by 2020. For more details on these country restoration assessments, please see Annex. 13 Mainstreaming biodiversity for wellbeing through forest landscape restoration For nearly two decades, the CBD has set biodiversity targets that have had success in creating institutional space for the monitoring and assessment of biodiversity at a national and international scale. The theme of the 13th Conference of the Parties, held in Cancun, Mexico is Mainstreaming biodiversity for wellbeing, and is intended to expand the discourse on biodiversity by integrating it with other sectors. A significant amount of effort has been given to communicating the importance of biodiversity to policy-makers since the inception of the 2010 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Ecosystem services are a good example of how biodiversity can be communicated and mainstreamed. Prior to their emergence as a concept it was difficult to quantify some of the economic and social benefits provided to people by biodiversity. This is especially the case for non-provisioning services such as disaster risk reduction, carbon sequestration, and cultural services. Since the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity studies and the integration of their results into the monitoring of the 2010 Biodiversity Targets, the externalities of biodiversity services for social and economic enterprises are far greater integrated in decision-making and cost accounting. However, ecosystem services themselves do not always capture the full contribution of biodiversity to the concept of wellbeing. They can be good indicators, but wellbeing through biodiversity restoration and conservation is a topic that should also include the socio-economic linkages to species and ecosystems, and increasingly include broader social benefits as well. As a concept, and in practice, FLR is grounded by its focus on restoring the productivity of degraded landscapes for both people and nature. In practice, FLR is primarily focused on restoring degraded lands to support human livelihoods and the benefits of these restoration strategies are often positive for biodiversity. A central challenge to the mainstreaming of biodiversity for wellbeing is the common institutional disconnect between organisations that work on \u201cdevelopment\u201d and organisations that work to support biodiversity. The interdisciplinary nature of FLR has precipitated a weakening of these institutional barriers in areas where it is implemented such that, for example, coffee farmers and ranchers in Costa Rica are planning FLR activities to both restore degraded lands and increase their productivity \u2013 which directly supports national economic growth and biodiversity conservation. Similarly, in Malawi, FLR has the potential to contribute 4.5 million hectares of restored landscapes under the Bonn Challenge that will help support their Vision 2020 national development strategy \u2013 a strategy that is heavily dependent on using natural and human resources to meet economic development goals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ce95bb3-d1f2-4eac-a117-33ab3c1af437": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ce95bb3-d1f2-4eac-a117-33ab3c1af437", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Restoration of forest ecosystems and landscapes as contribution to the Aichi Biodiversity Targets", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff10f870c1178555a2c63b97c6f6aa261e2faf64b8e05fb489c8b3f55e803609"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d327983-491c-4c51-b29e-1a9033978d49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/restoration-forest-ecosystems-and-landscapes-contribution-aichi", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af3f6cd7dfca122ccca3c97574c745916e5ead89d06ff4512dc4e3ff35f06a23"}}, "hash": "ad803e28a85d163c63fac6fa2331648a8f907719c7917fe91582ce689fbff8a7", "text": "In an international development context, FLR could be the emerging nature-based solution for addressing biodiversity conservation, climate change adaptation and mitigation, poverty alleviation, and economic growth objectives, effectively and coherently.

Aligning these efforts with the FLR approach and the Bonn Challenge provides a pathway through which national contributions to biodiversity conservation and restoration can be quantified. In some cases, just the presence of the information generated through an FLR assessment would be useful for an NBSAP and vice versa. In some cases these contributions are not yet fully integrated into NBSAPs, national reports or ongoing national CBD processes. The exploration of how the objectives of FLR and of the CBD align presented in this report is therefore expected to improve the outlook for national action in support of the achievement of several Aichi Biodiversity Targets. int/doc/publications/cbd-ts-34-en.pdf Convention on Biological Diversity. \u201cStrategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\u201d https://www.cbd.int/ doc/strategic-plan/2011-2020/Aichi-Targets- EN.pdf Convention on Biological Diversity. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Problem?\u201d https://www.cbd.int/forest/ problem.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity.

iv Foreword, Government of Uganda I take this opportunity to introduce the Opportunities report for Forest Landscape Restoration in Uganda. Over the years, we, as a country have been concerned about the state of our forests and the increasing trend of deforestation and degradation, despite the various efforts and investments within the sector. This still remains a challenge. This report is another step in the right direction because it provides an opportunity for us to understand exactly where the opportunities for restoration are across the country, along with the appropriate interventions in the various landscapes. Government of Uganda has prioritized Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) in the national plans, with an aim to restore forest cover to its 1990 levels by 2020. As a matter of fact, at the UN Climate Summit in September 2014, this goal was translated into a Bonn challenge pledge to restore 2.5million hectares of degraded and deforested land, using the FLR approach. This pledge not only demonstrates Uganda\u2019s leadership within the global community in restoring degraded lands and mitigating climate change impacts, but also acknowledges that Uganda forests are a national priority that will increase food productivity, water security, biodiversity, and resilience to climate change, each of which benefit all Ugandans and the global community. The report actually reveals that Uganda has a total of 8,079,622 hectares of land available for restoration with the highest restoration opportunities being in the Northern moist, Karamoja and South West rangelands. This information will be used to support the sector investments, to ensure that priority is given to the areas with the highest potential. This report is also expected to support ongoing processes like the development of the REDD+ strategy, the Forest Investment Plan and the climate change resilience programme. I therefore wish to take this opportunity to re-affirm Government\u2019s commitment in implementing these restoration options to achieve our set targets. I specifically extend my gratitude to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for providing both the technical and financial support for this assessment and production of the report. The leadership provided by the Forest Sector Support Department is much appreciated, and the national FLR Core team which spearheaded the application of the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Report (ROAM). The production of this report was participatory in nature, involving key stakeholders both at the national and sub-national level, and this is greatly appreciated for making it a true nationally owned product. I look forward to a continuous collaboration with partners as we strive towards effective implementation of the restoration options, to achieve our set targets.

The Forest Landscape Restoration approach which World leaders agreed upon in the challenge is what Uganda intends to apply in her restoration efforts. This shared aspiration is in response to the sharp decline in forests cover in the recent decades in Uganda. The forest cover is currently estimated at 9% of the total land cover. This current situation is exacerbated by land degradation due to population pressure and land tenure systems which is resultant into soil erosion and decline in soil fertility.. In order to mitigate this, Uganda has prioritized forest restoration as envisaged in existing targets provided in vision 2040, National Development Plans (I & II), and the National Forestry Plan (2011/12-2021/22). The primary target is to restore forest cover from the current 9% to a national target of 24% of Uganda\u2019s land cover. Restoring 2.5 million hectares would contribute about 89% of the aspired 24% considering the current forest cover status. In order to carry out FLR, it is important to: identify the sites in the different landscapes of the country which are deforested and degraded, determine their size and the most socio-ecologically and economically optimal restoration options or interventions. It is against this backdrop that the Government of Uganda through the Ministry of Water and Environment in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), World Resources Institute (WRI) and other Government Agencies conducted a study to comprehensively assess the potential for forest landscape restoration in Uganda. The specific objectives were to determine: deforestation and land degradation trends in Uganda, available area and \u2018priority areas\u2019 for forest landscape restoration, site specific forest landscape restoration options for various ecological landscapes, profitability of selected landscape restoration options, socio-economic and policy environment for restoration and strategies for addressing major policy and institutional bottlenecks that affect forest landscape restoration interventions. The Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) \u2013 an approach that was developed by IUCN and WRI \u2013 was used to guide processes of developing forest restoration interventions at landscape level. ROAM is a stepwise and iterative application of a series of analyses used to identify the best set of Forest landscape restoration opportunities applicable to a specific site. Seven classified landscapes were produced through a participatory process by a core team composed of technical staff from ministries and government agencies, academia and IUCN. Climate, vegetation type, Altitude and Farming systems were the key attributes used in developing zones. The classified landscapes include Western mid-altitude farmlands, Lake Victoria Crescent, Karamoja, South Kyoga floodplains, Afro-montane high altitude, North Moist farmlands, and South west rangelands. The study revealed that deforestation and forest degradation have occurred mostly in northern moist, southwest rangeland and western mid altitude landscapes of Uganda in the last 10 years mainly due to anthropogenic factors, weak law enforcement and inadequate funding to the natural resources sector. The Northern moist and western mid-altitude landscapes were the most severely deforested landscapes followed by southwest rangelands respectively. The western mid-altitude was the most degraded followed by southwest rangelands and Lake Victoria crescent respectively. Uganda has a total of 8,079,6221ha of land with opportunities for forest landscape restoration. Northern moist, Karamoja and southwest rangeland landscape zones offer the highest acreage for restoration. Afforestation (planting of trees in areas not under forest for the last ten years), reforestation, agroforestry Page ix Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 and natural regeneration are the most preferred restoration options. Agroforestry has a higher likelihood of creating benefits that far outweigh the costs compared to other options. There were twenty-two priority areas identified for forest landscape restoration. For the purposes of this report a priority area for restoration was defined as those areas that have had severe deforestation and degradation in the last 15 years, with high socio-ecological value and low population density to enable restoration. The success factors that already exist for restoration interventions include: Legal and policy requirements of FLR, suitable ecological conditions and suitable market conditions.

Introduction 1.1. Overview on forest landscape restoration The degradation of forests continues to be a global concern because of the threat to both the functioning of ecosystems and the well-being of human communities (Lamb, 1998; Orsi & Geneletti, 2010). Global forest cover has reduced by almost half from 62 million sq. km to 33 million sq. km in the last 8000 years (Bryant et al. 1997). Forest decline has majorly occurred in the tropics due to agricultural expansion and high population growth (Wade et al. 2003). This has to a great extent led to significant reduction in biomass, biodiversity and ecosystem services from forests which potentially affects human livelihoods (Fisher et al. 2009). Nations have for several years grappled with the challenge of finding ways of restoring forest cover that suits the ecological constraints of particular sites as well as the socio-economic circumstances of the landowners or land users, and ensure resilience under various future uncertainties (Lamb et al. 2012). One of the approaches being promoted at global level to address this challenge is through Forest Landscape Restoration. It is a long- term process of regaining ecological functionality and enhancing human well-being across deforested or degraded landscapes. It aims at achieving a balance between human needs and those of biodiversity conservation (Dudley et al. 2005). The overarching purpose is to build a forest-based landscape that can improve biodiversity conservation, ecological functioning and the livelihoods of human communities (Orsi & Geneletti, 2010). Forest landscape restoration is about \u201cforests\u201d because it aims at enhancing the number and/ or health of trees in an area. It is about \u201clandscapes\u201d because it involves entire watersheds, jurisdictions, or even countries in which many land uses interact. It is about \u201crestoration\u201d because it involves bringing back the biological productivity of an area in order to achieve a number of benefits for people and the planet. It is long- term because it requires a multi-year vision of the ecological functions and benefits to human well-being that restoration will produce although tangible deliverables such as jobs, income and carbon sequestration can begin to flow right away. However, in some cases it can be carried out over relatively short time scales (e.g. Shinyanga, Tanzania \u2013 15 years and Cost Rica -25 years). Forest Landscape Restoration is also called \u2018Forest and Landscape Restoration and in Central America \u2013 Functional Restoration of Rural Landscapes (FRRL). The names may vary but the guiding principles are to a great extent similar. It is guided by principles such as considering and restoring entire landscapes as opposed to individual sites, allowing for multiple benefits, considering a wide range of eligible technical strategies for restoring trees on a landscape, actively engaging local stakeholders in decision making, adapting restoration strategies to fit local social, economic and ecological contexts, addressing ongoing loss and conversion of primary and secondary natural forest and applying adaptive management. FLR can be implemented through new tree plantings, managed natural regeneration, agroforestry, or improved land management to accommodate a mosaic of land uses, including agriculture, protected wildlife reserves, managed plantations and riverside plantings. The main goal is to build up a forest-based landscape that is good for both nature and human beings. Landscape is not interpreted at spatial level per se but the principle is to consider an area within which one has to intervene in order to achieve some desired outcome or set of outcomes. For instance, maintenance of forests on hillsides to improve water supplies and prevent erosion of agricultural lands lower down those slopes (Boedhihartono & Sayer, 2012). Forest Landscape Restoration includes tree-based restoration in croplands and rangelands \u2013 termed as well as the restoration of forests themselves \u2013 and the greatest potential is often in mosaics of land-use.

Page 1 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Forest landscape restoration provides the opportunity for breaking the destructive spiral of decline in forest cover and land degradation, by creating a virtuous upward spiral of recovery, while generating multiple benefits which can facilitate attainment of sustainable development (Roberts et al. 2009). For example, restored landscapes can support livelihoods and enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services such as provision of clean water, reducing soil erosion, providing wildlife habitat, biofuels and other forest products (Benaya et al. 2009). In addition, restoration of forest landscapes plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by sequestering carbon and maintaining diversity of plant and animal communities (De-Souza & Batista, 2004). Restoration of forests and trees in agricultural landscapes can boost food productivity through enhanced soil fertility, moisture conservation and other ecosystem services (Chazdon, 2008). Restoration can also enable countries meet their existing international commitments related to biodiversity conservation and sustainable forest management. 1.2 Forest cover change in Uganda Tropical high forest - well stocked and woodlands are the major forest cover types in Uganda, followed by tropical high forest-low stocked, conifer and broad leaved. The country has significantly experienced a reduction in the total forest cover since 1990 to 2015. The decrease has majorly been experienced in both woodland and tropical high forest-low stocked than the other forest cover types apart from conifers and broad leaved forest plantations which have gained more land area (Table 1). The forest cover types have been predominantly felled through saw/pit logging and burning to access high value timber and to create more agricultural, industrial and settlement land. The major drivers of percentage loss in forest cover types include high population growth rates, intensification of agricultural activities without external input, land tenure system, weak enforcement of environmental laws, and increased value of forest products. The gains in land area of conifers and broad leaved are attributed to enforcement and monitoring of vegetation in the forest reserves, re-afforestation and restoration programmes being promoted by various actors in the country. 1.3 Land degradation in Uganda Uganda loses approximately from 4 to 12% of her GDP due to land degradation (Bolwig, 2002). The most severely affected areas include highlands, mountains, areas under agriculture, wetlands, shorelines, forests, rangelands, river banks and bare grounds. Soil erosion has been recorded as a single major physical driver of land degradation in the country. For example, Figure 1 shows estimates of the proportion of land affected by erosion in selected districts. The worst affected districts (85 \u2013 90 percent) include the highland areas in the Southwest, Kabale and Kisoro, and those severely affected (75 \u2013 80 percent) include Mbale, Rakai and Kotido cattle-grazing districts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "599b0d25-1d0c-41a9-b3e3-76beb565f0a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "599b0d25-1d0c-41a9-b3e3-76beb565f0a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Forest landscape restoration opportunity assessment for Uganda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89e0df0571cafc1ce7f2ffb6facca66410d47badb1daa37e0b55c394ed5082c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "19f196c2-092d-4270-b13b-2dc6367fc51c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d155f01ec892cdf9477c823bba51c1a6842eaf9f0255699e8e37c80c227b87df"}}, "hash": "58bd73e79d69a7cac6d3f577717ac6cc002d859e8cdd455bf4e05f14dd6334fe", "text": "In terms of cropping systems, land degradation rates are higher under annual crops (17-86.8 mt.ha- 1yr-1) and rangeland systems (3.2\u201353.2 mt.ha-1yr-1) than in the coffee (19.6-44.9 mt.ha-1yr-1) and banana Page 2 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Year/Forest Plantation Tropical Woodland Total cover high Forest forest 1990 34,983 923,984 3,973,857 4,932,824 2000 21,343 930,410 2,834,584 3,786,338 2005 33,144 823,929 2,365,485 3,222,559 2010 64,701 685,653 1,448,806 2,199,161 2015 107,689 630,912 1,212,899 1,951,501 Table 1: Forest cover changes (ha) from 1990 to 2015 Table 2: Rates of deforestation from 1990 to 2015 Period Annual deforestation (ha) 1990 - 2000 - 114,648 2000 - 2005 - 112,755 2005 -2010 - 204,679 2010 - 2015 - 49,531 Soil Loss (mt.ha-1yr-1 ) Measured Predicted (USLE) Annual crops 2.5 \u2013 9.0 Brunner et al (2004) Annual crops 17.0 \u2013 86.8 74.4 \u2013 93 Bagoora (1997); Lufafa et al.

Importantly, the magnitude of soil loss is dependent on the frequency, and intensity of amount rainfall received. Land degradation has implications on Uganda\u2019s ability to attain sustainable agricultural growth and overall productivity of the country. Uganda is currently formulating her voluntary targets to achieve land degradation neutrality considering her commitment to the Ankara agreement of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) COP 12. 1.4 Context of the study There has been a sharp decline in forests cover in the recent decades in Uganda. The highest annual rate of deforestation occurs on private and communal lands (3% annual loss) and the lowest in National Parks and Wildlife Reserves (0.4% annual loss). The forest estate outside Protected Areas reduced from 68% of the total forest land area in 1990 to 61% in 2005 and to 38% in 2015. Based on the 2010 Land use/Land cover map, the forest cover in Uganda is estimated at 9% of the total land cover. This already bad situation is worsened by the fact that land degradation which is associated with soil erosion is equally increasing. This trend has negative impacts on the ecological resilience of the different landscapes of Uganda and their ability to provide ecosystem services that support livelihoods of millions of Ugandans and neighbouring countries. In order to mitigate this, Uganda has prioritized forest restoration as envisaged in existing targets provided in vision 2040, subsequent National Development Plans (I & II), and the National Forestry Plan (2011/12- 2021/22). The primary target is to restore forest cover from the current 9% to a national target of 24%. Within this context, the country has a target to plant 200 million trees by the year 2020 (an output of the 2012 National Tree Planting Strategy), and Uganda\u2019s desire for a Green Economy.

This was made in 2014 during the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Summit which increased the global ambition for reducing forest loss and increasing restoration1. The Bonn Challenge is a practical, action-orientated platform to facilitate the implementation of several existing international commitments that require restoration, including the CBD Aichi Target 15, the UNFCCC REDD+ goal and the Rio+20 land degradation target. The challenge was established at a ministerial roundtable in September 2011 in Bonn, Germany, and it calls for the restoration of 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded lands by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. Through this commitment, Uganda aims to restore degraded forest landscapes to improve ecosystem quality and resilience, provide new opportunities for rural livelihoods, while securing adequate water and energy supplies and supporting low carbon economic development. In order to achieve the aforementioned commitment, there is need to identify sites in the different landscapes of the country where degraded land is located, determining the size of degraded land and the most optimal restoration options or interventions. It is therefore against this backdrop that the Government of Uganda, through the Ministry of Water and Environment in partnership with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with technical support of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and other government agencies conducted a study to comprehensively assess the potential for forest landscape restoration in Uganda. It is envisaged that the outcome of the study will be useful for any interventions by government and other partners involved in forest landscape restoration. 1.5 Aim and Objectives 1.5.1 Aim of the study Assess Uganda\u2019s forest landscape restoration potential.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6f3d83c-9a76-4b77-8616-e83fab37d772": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6f3d83c-9a76-4b77-8616-e83fab37d772", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Forest landscape restoration opportunity assessment for Uganda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff06fb6d2adba1a3fcf428215923572b1ef47345aaba7b6c24ea114254577052"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf504f13-5a36-438d-8ef2-ccf9bcc721cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffc3751d32d9b6eab0315d0a9dcc36be54857287a9bb404ab96f4e47fa324f3b"}}, "hash": "c089801c946a69feb4a05e29120b90d65075f5e2d3a28154dacdfa85372ff47e", "text": "1.5.2 Specific Objectives a.

It is a stepwise and iterative application of a series of analyses used to identify the best set of Forest landscape restoration (FLR) opportunities applicable to a specific site (IUCN & WRI 2014). This approach was piloted in Mexico, Ghana, Guatemala and most recently Rwanda (Ministry of Natural Resources \u2013 Rwanda 2014). The approach has been published in a hand book and importantly in a \u2018Road Test\u2019 edition implying that the Uganda assessment can feed into future versions of the handbook. ROAM provides a flexible and affordable framework to rapidly identify and analyse forest landscape restoration (FLR) potential and locate specific areas of opportunity at a national or sub-national level. It provides vital support to move forward with developing restoration programmes and landscape-level strategies. In Uganda, the initial step of the ROAM process was IUCN and other relevant non-state actors establishing contact with the Ministry of Water and Environment to dialogue on Forest Landscape Restoration. A series of meetings were convened with the Minister and his technical staff to lay ground for the political support of FLR. The ministry had an ongoing Greening the Economy campaign into which FLR could directly feed into to enable the country achieve her aspirations. A key output from the ministerial engagements was signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for the collaboration between the Government of Uganda and IUCN to formalize the partnership for the ROAM assessment. In addition to the initial contact made with the Ministry of Water and Environment, IUCN established contact with senior staff in the Ministry including the Permanent Secretary and relevant Directors to enhance their knowledge on FLR and also seek their support for the process. IUCN subsequently convened a national multi-stakeholder meeting to introduce, enhance the knowledge and understanding of the Forest Landscape Restoration and ROAM assessment process across national stakeholders. The workshop was attended by multi-sectoral participants who included representatives of Civil Society Organizations, the Private sector, Government, Academia and Development partners. This workshop coincided with the launch of the Greening of the economy campaign by the Ministry of Water and Environment. A core team of multi-disciplinary specialists representing various categories of participants was subsequently constituted through consensus at the workshop based on mandate and expertise. IUCN and FSSD led the process of identifying and formalizing the core team. The team\u2019s mandate and functions were derived from the ROAM Handbook \u201cA guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology\u201d which was applied to support the country\u2019s efforts to move forward with developing restoration programmes and strategies. Specialists were identified with expertise in the fields of GIS and remote sensing, Forest restoration ecology, economics and statistics, Monitoring & Evaluation, Forest Governance and Policy Analysis. The institutions represented by the core team members were; Makerere University, National Forestry Authority, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry, Fisheries (MAIAF), Forest Sector Support Department (FSSD) and IUCN which played the role of a secretariat for the team (Annex 2). In order to empower the team to deliver on their mandate, a two-day capacity building workshop to create a general understanding of the ROAM process and its application was organized and held by IUCN. The key purpose of the workshop was conceptualization of FLR and ROAM process. The workshop was facilitated by the IUCN-Global team that had operationalized the ROAM process in other countries such as Rwanda prior to Uganda.

The immediate task for the core team that was constituted was to conduct sub-national consultation workshops. Seven sub-national consultation workshops were conducted in selected regions for restoration assessment. The specific objectives of the consultations were to; 1. Create a common understanding of Forest Landscape Restoration (what it is, clarifying the misconceptions, providing key examples of where it has worked, and the broader picture \u2013 Bonn Challenge) 2. Identify communities\u2019 goals for forest landscape restoration (i.e. what do they hope to achieve through restoration) 3. Visual validation of maps on degraded land and Identifying priority areas for restoration 4. Create a short list of the most relevant and feasible restoration interventions across different types of degraded landscapes 5. Suggest restoration interventions by describing tree species that could be used 6. Identify the institutional, financial, and ecological barriers that currently prevent people from restoring degraded land The workshops were multi-sectoral and involved the participation of District Local Government technical staff, cultural and opinion leaders, farmers\u2019 groups, political leaders, members of the media and the private sector. The overarching purpose of the workshops was to suggest and discuss well-defined goals that articulated the land to be restored; in what ways and for which purposes, identify barriers that could prevent achievement of these goals and make recommendation to reduce the barriers.

Validation of the ROAM preliminary findings Validation of the Uganda ROAM process and ROAM findings was through a multi-stakeholder process that was conducted during the Annual National Forest Consultative Forum of 2015. This particular forum was aimed at raising awareness for sustainable management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests for the benefit of current and future generations as well as characterizing linkages between forestry and climate change. This was an opportunity for state actors, non-governmental organizations, and development partners in the forest sector to raise awareness for sustainable development of all types of forests for the benefit of current and future generations. Not only did the forum provide a platform for information sharing but was an avenue for launching of the forestry week that was tagged to the week proceeding to 21st March.

Page 6 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Page 7 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 2.1 Geospatial analysis To quantify the areas of degraded land use that are opportunity areas for forest and landscape restoration, a geospatial analysis was performed incorporating more than a dozen national datasets including soil, slope, landcover, rainfall, water bodies, protected areas, and administrative boundaries were consolidated into GIS, where criteria associated with each type of potential restoration intervention were applied. Datasets including elevation, slope, land cover, forest cover, water bodies, parks and reserves, and administrative areas, were consolidated into a geographic information system (GIS), where criteria associated with each type of potential restoration intervention were applied. This criteria represented the means to identify the areas best suited for implementing the intervention and are presented in Appendix 1. The datasets representing the criteria were overlaid and combined with each other, and areas where they intersected were identified as opportunity areas. This process was replicated for each of the restoration interventions to create maps of opportunity areas. Areas were summarized at various administrative levels (e.g., province and district) to convey the level of opportunity within an applicable context. 2.1.1 Identification and classification of land degradation proxies The ROAM team identified and classified land degradation proxies (indicators for land degradation) and the intervention priorities that could improve landscape quality (socio-ecological functions).

The purpose of the zoning was to stratify the country into relatively homogeneous landscapes in terms of restoration-relevant characteristics, for national forest restoration initiatives. The production of the stratification map involved overlays of the MAAIF Agro-ecological and administrative boundary GIS layers, with specific focus on three main attributes namely: 1. Climatic factors, 2. Altitude 3. Farming systems The core team stratified the country into seven landscape zones. The zones included Western mid-altitude farmlands (150,151.5sqkm), Lake Victoria Crescent (115,947.6sqkm), Karamoja (105,941.0sqkm), South Kyoga floodplains (122,560.0sqkm), Afro-montane high altitude (113,342.0sqkm), North Moist farmlands (132,484.1sqkm), and South west rangelands (126,593.6sqkm). The overall characteristics of each zone are summarized in the Table 4. Within each classification, there are bound to be similarities or minimal differences in possible challenges and options to promote forest landscape restoration and other related initiatives. This classification was validated and subsequently recommended for adoption by the technical workshop on development of REDD+ National Baseline Scenario (reference emission level and/or forest reference level- FREL/FRLs) and National Forest Monitoring System. This was to ensure that future REDD+ initiatives can also find the classification in this report relevant and applicable. The outcome of this analysis was a map of Uganda stratified into the zones as indicated in Figure 3. The purpose of classification was majorly to generate a manageable number of relatively homogeneous landscape types in terms of restoration-relevant characteristics to enable restoration interventions.

The consultations took place in Kampala for the Lake Victoria Crescent, Moroto for Karamoja, Fort portal for the Western mid- altitude farmlands, Gulu for Northern Moist farmlands, and Mbarara for South west rangelands. The choice of selection for the areas of consultation was dependent on accessibility and regional impact. The consultations were directed towards the identification and categorization of degraded lands, specific districts and feasible restoration interventions. In addition, secondary data sources such as reports and maps were collected and used to extract information on demographic characteristics and categorization of degraded lands in the country. 2.2.3 Quality Control The collected spatial datasets were checked and corrected for consistency prior to identification of degraded lands. The quality measures and checks that were undertaken included spatial data extent assessment, projection, attribute data and polygon completeness. The online data sources were collated with data from the mandated Government Agencies. 2.2.4 Processing The spatial datasets were pre-processed and processed to extract information on land degradation. The datasets were pre-processed through transformation geographical coordinate systems to WGS 1984 zone 36N for degraded sites computations and display. The vectors were also topologically cleaned for connectivity errors. The vector layers were spatially converted into rasters for easy simulation. The parameters and intermediate outputs are shown in figure 4. The population dataset comprised of human and livestock population counts. The human and livestock counts were the total of people and livestock counted in each district. The aridity of the landscape dictated the intensity of livestock rearing. While, the country\u2019s human population density is 174 persons per square kilometre. The soil organic matter, saturation and texture were included in the workflow because of their significant roles on the productivity of land to support plant growth. The slope length and steepness greatly determine the erodibility of the top soil particles to the valleys. The slope shape influences soil erosion and runoff rates that are largely dependent on the amount and intensity of rainfall received. The drainage network was included because the rivers currently face bank erosion which is attributed to poor agricultural practices, unstable bank materials, and high rainfall runoff events resulting into the narrowing and widening of the river channels and sedimentation. The conversion of natural land cover other land use activities plays an important role in determining the erodibility of the soil and thus affects soil fertility due to deforestation and wetland reclamation to create cultivable and settlement land. The derived intermediate parameters were combined to form a potential land degradation map. Figure 4 show the Land degradation workflow that was followed.

Approximately 416 district local government officials and 46 other key stakeholders from civil society organisations were consulted (Table 6). Civil society organizations that participated at the workshops were selected based on expertise, physical presence in the regions selected and their involvement in forest restoration initiatives. 2.3.1 Determining existing and missing success factors for restoration interventions The rapid restoration diagnostic tool developed by WRI and IUCN was applied in regional workshops and key informant interviews to identify which success factors currently exist and which are missing (or partially missing) within landscapes being considered for restoration. This was primarily done to determine whether there was a motivation for restoration, an enabling environment, and capacity and resources to facilitate restoration. The factors that were missing were perceived as bottlenecks. The tool uses 5 point \u2018traffic lights\u2019 graphic to allow rapid appreciation of the status of the particular variable under consideration (Box 1). Stakeholders were consulted to produce preliminary results of the assessment of key success factors for forest landscape restoration in Uganda and these were validated in a National workshop. 2.3.2 Economic Analysis of Restoration options The core team in consultation with relevant agencies and stakeholders carried out the following activities in order to have reliable data to carryout investment analysis of the selected restoration options: a) Compiled secondary data and literature to identify current degraded land management practices (i.e. rotation/coppice intervals, species types, cropping decisions, pastoral stocking densities) for degraded forests, agricultural, and pastoral land. b) Defined management practices of restoration technologies, including, rotation/coppice intervals, species types, cropping decisions, pastoral stocking densities. c) Constructed detailed annual land management budgets of inputs (i.e. labor and material inputs) for degraded forests, agricultural, and pastoral land use systems and each restoration technology. d) Collected agricultural, forestry, and pastoral survey data to estimate outputs (i.e. crop yields, timber yields, livestock yields) from degraded forests, agricultural, and pastoral land use systems and restoration technologies. e) Identified sources of data to value market (e.g. crop and timber yields) and ecosystem (e.g. carbon and avoided erosion) goods and services. f) Mapped the economic costs and benefits of degraded land uses and restoration technologies using GIS data layers to estimate crop yields, timber yields, livestock yields based on ecological characteristics of each grid-cell (e.g. land use, slope, soil type, ecological zone and precipitation) Page 12 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Table 6: Distribution of categories of participants in sub- national workshops District No. of District officials Key stakeholders and Lead Agencies from Civil society organizations Gulu 111 4 Mukono 82 7 Moroto 42 14 Soroti 57 5 Kabarole 64 5 Mbarara 60 11 2.3.3 Analysis of Profitability of selected landscape restoration optionsrestoration interventions Cost-Benefit Analysis Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a tool for evaluating the desirability of a specific restoration activity or comparing the desirability of several alternative activities. Restoration projects create costs through the inputs and activities that are needed to make them successful. If the benefits of the project are larger than the costs, then the project can be said to be desirable. However, if the costs are greater than the benefits, then the financial resources could have achieved a larger impact by being spent on alternative activities. CBA takes an inherently anthropogenic perspective to evaluating costs and benefits by valuing them based on their human impacts. This does not mean that nature\u2019s value in a CBA is zero if restoration does not directly impact humans because people can benefit from nature even without using it and these benefits can be valued with non-market valuation methods.

The difference between the discounted sums of benefits and costs is known as the Net Present Value (NPV) and it is the standard decision metric used in CBA. Other decision metrics, like the cost-benefit-ratio, return- on-investment, and internal-rate-of-return can also be used to evaluate the efficiency of such projects. Another useful decision metric is the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). The BCR measures the value of benefits that would be expected from a restoration activity for each UGX of cost and projects with higher BCRs are recommended over projects with relatively smaller BCRs. For example, a BCR of 2 would suggest that for every UGX 1,000 of cost paid for a restoration activity UGX 2,000 worth of benefits would be expected over the time horizon of the activity. Enterprise budgets were created for each restoration options based on the information provided by stakeholders during the regional workshops. During the workshops stakeholders reported the annual fixed and variable costs associated with each activity. 2.3.4 Strategies for addressing major policy and institutional bottlenecks The assessment team conducted desk research to get more insights on strategies for addressing major policy and institutional bottlenecks based on literature on forest governance in Uganda. This was enriched by the views generated through regional workshops and the national validation workshop. The views were further triangulated with key informant interviews of staff in the Ministry of Water and Environment and other non-state actors in the environment and natural resource sub-sector. 2.3.5 Analysis for qualitative data Content and narrative analyses were the major tools used in analyzing data from workshops and key informant interviews. Net present value and benefit-cost ratios were generated to compare restoration options agreed up on by participants of all the stakeholder engagements across the seven landscapes. Restoration activities with positive NPVs are recommended since the discounted flow of benefits outweighs the discounted flow of costs, while activities with negative NPVs are not recommended because the discounted flow of costs outweighs the discounted flow of benefits. Both the NPV and BCR are sensitive to the discount rate that is used in the cost-benefit analysis so a sensitivity analysis was carried to determine how the results change when the discount rate changes. The historical minimum and highest interest rate of Bank of Uganda (2000-2015) were used as discount rates in the analysis. Page 13 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 3.0 FINDINGS 3.1 Deforestation and land degradation trends in Uganda Uganda has experienced significant forest loss to deforestation and forest degradation since 1990. The rates of deforestation have generally increased from an annual average of about 114,648 hectares per annum for the period 1990-2000 to a record high of about 204,679 hectares annually in the period 2005 to 2010 (Figure 5). It is important to note that the rate of deforestation in protected areas under Uganda Wildlife Authority and National Forestry Authority is significantly lower than that on privately owned natural forests (Figure 6). More so, UWA has the most stable forest cover compared to that under NFA\u2019s mandate and this is majorly due to two reasons; 1, UWA applies the highest level of natural resource protection and the resource there is managed under strict conservation. On the other hand, forests under NFA are managed at a lower level of protection and are accessible for controlled extractive harvesting or sustainable forest management. The map in Figure 7 shows how forests around Bugoma central forest reserve have declined from 1990-2015. Most of the deforestation took place in western and Northern region of the country as indicated in Figure 8 below. However, forest degradation is more widely spread and varied than forest degradation. In most cases Forest degradation is a precursor to deforestation. This implies that the all degraded forest whether protected or not are at risk of being deforested. 3.2 Deforestation trends in the selected landscapes The northern moist, southwest rangeland and western mid altitude were the most deforested and degraded landscape zones between 2005 and 2015 (Figure 9) both in terms of coverage and magnitude. These were followed by South East Lake Kyoga flood plain, Afro-montane and Karamoja respectively (Table 7). Forest deforestation and degradation are mainly as a result of high population pressure that results into uncontrolled conversion of forests into other landuses, uncontrolled bush burning, poor agricultural practices, illegal saw- logging activities, unregulated charcoal burning, poor land tenure system, weak enforcement of forestry laws Page 14 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Figure 5: Forest change in Uganda 1990-2015 Forest Area Million Hectares 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1990 2000 2005 2010", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1585377f-f8f5-4f41-8954-cf2df1175347": {"__data__": {"id_": "1585377f-f8f5-4f41-8954-cf2df1175347", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Forest landscape restoration opportunity assessment for Uganda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d115c77cb9a837a2de2b9a71c4890608785bdbaf1a068ac19557eea7b024c6e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "fca5a2cb-b006-46a5-942b-04cf94427fed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2df6c8e9793a119166c563cc5ad1f4b083e6cae762cf65948f0cfeefd4bcbe86"}}, "hash": "4b53a86a2a9cf579570df75bcb4eb4611ed67a1604442ab59e0f697709936602", "text": "2015 and inadequate funding of the forestry sector. The type of vegetation and encroachment of forest reserves across the landscape zones were the major determinants of the extent of deforestation and degradation.

Table 8 shows the level and scale of land degradation in the seven zones. 3.3 Land degradation trends in the selected landscape The scale of land degradation varies across various landscape type zones in Uganda. Seventeen percent of the total land area is severely degraded, 30% is highly degraded, and 31% is moderately degraded, while the area that can be characterized as low to no degradation is 5.8% and 15% respectively (Table 9). The Northern moist and Karamoja landscape zones are the most severely degraded landscapes followed by south west rangelands, and western mid altitude that are moderately degraded. Whilst, Lake Victoria Crescent, Afro-montane and South East Kyoga floodplain are the least degraded areas (Figure 9 and 10).

Land degradation in these regions is manifested through exposure of land surface, erosion scalds, gullies, decline in soil fertility and spread of invasive plants which potentially can affect the composition and distribution of plants and animal species. Studies (e.g. Maitima et al. 2009; Lamprey & Mitchelmore, 1996) have shown that wildlife especially mammals have declined in some of the landscapes due to land degradation which contributes to low net primary productivity. 3.4 Priority areas for Forest landscape restoration Priority areas for restoration based on predetermined criteria were identified as shown in Figure 11.

All the hot spots identified are located in protected areas because of the readily available data that can be validated for protected areas, compared to forests on private land. 3.5 Available area for forest landscape restoration Northern moist, Karamoja and southwest rangeland landscape zones offer the highest acreage for restoration followed by Lake Victoria crescent, south east Lake Kyoga floodplain and western mid- altitude. The Afro-montane landscape offers the least acreage for restoration (Table 11 and Figure 11). The major underlying factors for restoration potential include population size, land tenure system, land and civil conflicts, urbanization, conservation programmes among others. Figure 11: Location of priority areas for Forest landscape restoration ROAM Zones High priority area Moderate priority area International boundary Open water Page 20 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 3.6 FLR options for various landscapes During the workshops, stakeholders generated a short list of the most relevant and feasible restoration options across different types of degraded land categories. They proposed restoration activities by describing tree species that could be used and which management practices would be implemented to improve existing land uses. The suitability of the species proposed in the workshops for each landscape was triangulated and confirmed by the National Forest Authority, Forest Sector Support Department and available literature. Afforestation (for sites that have not been under forest for the last ten years), reforestation, agroforestry and natural regeneration (passive restoration) were found to be the most preferred and feasible restoration interventions across the landscapes. It was emphasized that the sites being proposed should have previously been under forest cover but had been degraded. Although, the restoration options were relatively similar across landscapes, the options were further classified into sub-options. Riparian vegetation restoration/ and natural regeneration were unique to a few landscapes unlike agroforestry, afforestation and reforestation that were cross-cutting. Natural regeneration was considered suitable for restoration in the Karamoja landscape and western mid altitude whereas Riparian vegetation restoration/ riverine buffer zoning was highly recommended by the stakeholders in the Lake Victoria crescent. Natural regeneration could be through allowing seeds in the soil to germinate or maintaining re-sprouts after a landscape has experienced some form of disturbance.

Table 11: Potential acreage for restoration in each landscape regeneration can also be augmented through control of fires and grazing. It is recommended in sites that have not experienced extreme degradation (Holl & Aide, 2011). To minimize the risk of only having prolific species that easily recover after disturbance, enrichment planting or seeding of less common, often later successional, species after a canopy has established can facilitate maximization of diversity and to attain the original species composition (Cole et al. 2011). Clipping of plants around established tree seedlings may be a useful management tool to improve growth and survival of naturally regenerating species (Vieira & Scariot, 2006). Indigenous tree species were widely preferred for restoration and this was attributed to their high ecological value while the exotic trees; Pinus caribaea and Eucalyptus grandis were considered for their higher commercial value. Albizia spp, Maesoposis eminii, Markhamia lutea and Cordia spp were the most highly regarded indigenous species for restoration. The restoration options, the most suitable intervention and the species for each landscape as proposed by participants are provided in Annex 1. 3.7 Site specific restoration options The area available in each landscape for any of the three restorations options (Agroforestry, woodlots and natural regeneration) is shown in Table 12 and appropriate sites for each option in Figure 13.

Table 13 displays the enterprise budgets for agroforestry, woodlots, and natural regeneration. Table 14 shows the cost and revenue structure for agroforestry, woodlots, and natural regeneration restoration options. Agriculture in Uganda is a low-input activity where there is almost no mechanization and relies on very few inputs because most farmers cannot afford the investment necessary to intensify production. Labour is the largest cost across all activities and enters the budget through the following activities: Site preparation; planting; patrolling/protection; weeding; thinning; pruning; and harvesting. The material costs of each activity include seedlings and small farm equipment such as hand hoes. The largest cost of agroforestry and woodlots is harvesting timber, which costs UGX 3M per hectare for agroforestry and UGX 6M per hectare for woodlots. Natural regeneration has the lowest establishment costs since the trees naturally regenerate without any seeding by humans, however the costs of protecting the land from encroachers and fire is estimated to cost approximately UGX 2.1M per hectare, annually. The costs of protection/patrolling were calculated based on information from Namatale Central Forest Reserve, where efforts are in place to protect it and enhance restoration of the reserve through natural regeneration. The 662-hectare reserve is employing six guards to protect the forest from both fires and encroachers at a total cost of UGX 5.76M. When the total cost is divided by the number of hectares the total cost of protecting each hectare is found to be UGX 8,700 Ha-1 Year-1. To be conservative the estimate was rounded off up to UGX 10,000 Ha-1 Year-1. The total benefits (in nominal terms) from each restoration activity ranges between UGX 86M per hectare for agroforestry to UGX 34M per hectare for woodlots to UGX 2.6M per hectare for natural regeneration.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a9c2773-2103-4a9f-8373-4d1422f3ce8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a9c2773-2103-4a9f-8373-4d1422f3ce8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Forest landscape restoration opportunity assessment for Uganda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca9bababdd66c45968f4d87e815661781492629933d48c78550a9b2315d1c853"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4bcec1a-dd13-4d07-be21-24e64675bce6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b609adddb4a69ac109cfea88c8709115f6479fdc4e950b7dab9732d4ae4ac6f"}}, "hash": "a0e33e7983abd12dcbaf5307de73b6ee6e4a456a0134d813a85c2803bec50103", "text": "Agroforestry systems generate benefits from several sources, including crop yields, timber, firewood, carbon, and watershed protection.

After the 5th year of natural regeneration it is assumed that approximately UGX 100,000 per hectare of fuelwood is collected from each site and that the increased vegetation yields UGX 346,000 per hectare in watershed protection services. This was determined based on the FAO study on the contribution of forests on Mt. Kenya as watersheds (Watkins & Imbumi, 2007). At the end of the thirty-year time horizon it is assumed that carbon sequestration benefits from natural regeneration will be worth UGX 1.68M per hectare for carbon stored in above-ground biomass and UGX 1.4M per hectare for carbon stored in below-ground biomass, respectively. Other ecosystem services such as pollination, soil erosion control, nutrient cycling and bee foraging are not included in the analysis because of the difficulty in determining their values and market, however it\u2019s acknowledged that they can potentially be marketable. The results of the CBA are shown in Table 14. Table 14 shows that the NPV and BCR are positive for agroforestry under both discount rates.

Under a 16% discount rate the NPV of agroforestry declines and equals UGX 8.1M. Part of the reason the decline in NPV is so large is that many of the benefits of agroforestry are received in the future and a 16% rate of discount reduces the value of events that occur many years ahead. Still, the BCR in this scenario is still a favorable 8.95, which means for every UGX 1,000 invested in agroforestry UGX 8,950 of benefits would be received over the thirty-year time horizon of the activity.

Page 25 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Interpretation The results of the CBA analysis show that the option of agroforestry evaluated here has a high likelihood of creating benefits that far outweigh the costs. Additionally, the benefit sources from agroforestry are well diversified in the sense that they would benefit landowners and society alike. Even if the benefits from carbon sequestration, fuelwood, and timber were ignored, the crop benefits alone would still create benefits in excess of the costs. Woodlots are more sensitive to the assumptions of the CBA model. Under a 10% discount rate woodlots would produce benefits in excess of the costs, however the benefit cost ratio of 1.48 is quite low and small changes in the assumptions of the enterprise budget could easily move the benefit cost ratio below 1 even at a 10% rate of discount. At a 16% rate of discount, the high upfront costs of woodlots justify waiting for benefits that occur so far into the future, but just barely. The CBA is even very favourable to natural regeneration mostly because the costs of protecting the sites from encroachers are relatively low compared to the benefits natural regeneration creates. Moreover, natural regeneration is the most efficient option analyzed since each unit Uganda shilling (UGX) invested returns substantially more benefits than either agroforestry or woodlots. This is not to say that these options should be overlooked in favour of natural regeneration because an efficient landscape requires a suite of land uses that work together to create the goods and services people demand. However, it could be considered for areas that are under protection such as national parks and forest reserves. The results of this analysis should be taken as evidence that the restoration activities being considered in support of Uganda\u2019s pledge to the Bonn Challenge have the potential to create real impacts for nature and people that justify the expense of restoring degraded land. Agroforestry and natural regeneration restoration options have a potential to have more landscape mosaics and heterogeneity than woodlots. Heterogenous landscapes are more socio-ecologically resilient and with high species richness (Atauri & de Lucio, 2001; Fuhlendorf, & Engle, 2001). This is because they provide more niches and different ways of exploiting environmental resources hence increasing species diversity (Tews et al. 2004). Cognizant of the fact that FLR is about addressing human needs while enhancing the ecological value of landscapes, Agroforestry and natural regeneration ought to be given priority. This however will require harnessing of existing markets for ecosystem services to make these restoration options attractive to land owners. Markets with relatively low transactions costs especially in voluntary markets ought to be prioritized 3.9 Success factors that currently exist and those missing for restoration interventions 3.9.1 Motivation There is fair level of awareness on FLR approach and the associated benefits among bureaucrats but very limited in the local communities. The statutory laws and cultural practices are supportive however enforcement is still weak due to various bottlenecks (Table 15). The low level of awareness of FLR is linked to poor forest extension service in the country. The District Forest Officers are expected to carry out forest extension services but most local governments\u2019 budgets do not prioritize forestry. The vacuum has been partially filled by civil society organisations involved in conservation interventions. However, these have limitations such as being project based and therefore limited sustainability, limited coordination with other actors and narrow coverage. 3.9.2 Enabling conditions The ecological conditions are generally very good and suitable for restoration interventions. However, there is need to have more information on site species matching for various landscapes. The policy environment is supportive, although implementation has been a challenge for most responsible agencies due to various structural and fiscal bottlenecks (Table 16). Page 26 3.9.3 Implementation capacity and resources The support for forest restoration is reflected in the policy, plans and legal frameworks of Uganda.

Local communities are ill-equipped in terms of knowledge and skills of forest restoration yet they are critical actors in restoration interventions. 3.9.4 Institutional framework for FLR in Uganda Over all, institutions relevant to FLR in the country are appropriate. FLR provides an opportunity for different sectors to engage and promote the approach and these sectors include: agriculture, water and environment (including forestry subsector), land, education, academia and research. These sectors have implementing institutions that have been formed and they are functional. Figure 14 shows an illustration of the institutions, their mandates and how they may link with each other to support FLR. 3.9.5 Strategies for addressing major policy and institutional bottlenecks that affect forest landscape restoration interventions There is need for a paradigm shift in the current forestry extension approach. Forestry extension agents need to be readily available at least up to sub-county level to ensure that community members have access to knowledge and skills in implementing forest restoration in their landscapes. Forest extension services ought to be provided as a subsidy to communities because most of them cannot afford to pay for the actual cost of a trained forestry extension agent. The extension agents should also be involved in raising awareness on the value of FLR in the communities that they are serving. Adoption of policies and laws that promote establishment of more value addition forest-based industries is necessary. This can be through economic instruments that encourage investors to establish industries that increase the benefits that can accrue from restoration interventions. Ensure that the economic value of forests and trees is enhanced and acknowledged as natural capital. This can be through providing market-based incentives such as paying communities involved in forest restoration for the ecosystem services e.g. carbon sequestration, soil fertility enhancement and water availability, aesthetic and scientific values, biodiversity and species protection that their restored forests provide. This will motivate land owners to allow natural regeneration of forests on their land. Page 27 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Table 15: Diagnostic analysis of motivation for FLR Integrate FLR and Eco-DRR interventions at the local level to encourage communities to participate. This will require joint planning and implementation by the relevant agencies or government departments. The capacity of responsible bodies involved in the enforcement of the laws and regulations governing forests needs to be enhanced for them to execute their mandate. The agencies should ensure that they adhere to professional ethos in order to promote sustainable management of forests and trees. 46 Table 15: Diagnostic analysis of motivation for FLR Feature Preliminary Result Preliminary Rationale Ability to Improve Awareness: To what extent are stakeholders aware about FLR Partially in place Although there is a fairly wide understanding of the need and actual restoration, there is limited knowledge on what it entails to undertake restoration using a landscape approach, to balance ecological and livelihood aspects. At the political and policy level, there is commitment and it is recognized that quite a number of FLR related activities are on- going although it is not often recognised as such High: Despite the gains in understanding and growing support for forest restoration, there is great opportunity to enhance awareness of FLR due to the various ongoing processes Multiple Benefits: To what extent is there a specific understanding of the multiple benefits of FLR? Partially in place There is a growing and broad understanding of FLR in Uganda, with some understanding of its multiple benefits. However, there seems to be a disconnect between the FLR interventions and the direct benefits at different levels. High: There is a high potential for a much greater understanding of the multiple and integrated benefits of FLR including ecological, social, cultural and economic dimensions Crisis events: To what extent is ecosystem based linkages to crisis and disaster and the role of Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco DRR) that can be addressed by FLR understood? Partially in place At the higher level, there is a clear understanding of the role of FLR and ECO- DRR to crisis and disasters. However, this understanding is limited at the local level where the actual crisis and disasters occur, hence the need to integrate FLR and Eco- DRR interventions. Medium: The opportunity is there because there are many actors interested and recently government has prioritized the use of EBA, ECO- DRR and FLR approaches to address crisis and disasters. However, there is need for sustained engagement of the communities that are prone to these disasters", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7e7022d-7fc9-4b27-b892-f879561e8dc9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7e7022d-7fc9-4b27-b892-f879561e8dc9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Forest landscape restoration opportunity assessment for Uganda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1cd082afdc415a657a505c62356eca0d43b959b02e54dd1a7b2cfed88562a1ad"}}, "hash": "1cd082afdc415a657a505c62356eca0d43b959b02e54dd1a7b2cfed88562a1ad", "text": "to appreciate the long term, landscape and integrated approaches and coordination of efforts by various actors. Legal requirements of FLR Mostly in place Uganda has a robust legal framework that enables and support FLR. The critical laws in place are the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003 and related regulations, National Environment Act, 1995, Uganda Wildlife Act, 1995, the Land Act , 1998 and Local Government Act, 1997 Medium: Although the legal frameworks are in place, there are still challenges with enforcement due to weak governance across scales Culture (dimensions of FLR) Mostly in place There is a wide range of cultural aspects that attach a lot of value to forestry and related restoration activities. It is observed in Uganda that women play a significant role/participate in restoration activities to a greater degree than men. However, this participation is limited by the lack of ability to make decisions due to some cultural norms which don\u2019t allow women to own land and sometimes trees. High: There are various active cultural institutions that can be partnered with to promote FLR. Some communities have traditional norms and values that promote forest and tree conservation Page 28 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Table 16: Diagnostic analysis of enabling conditions Enhance staffing levels of key institutions through a deliberate recruitment drive and filling up of vacant positions where they exist will be necessary. This should be coupled with retooling staff with new knowledge and acquiring of equipment to facilitate their work. Existing policies and laws need to be reviewed to provide security of forest and tree tenure for women living on customary land to enhance their participation in forest restoration. Similarly, the forest and tree rights of bonafide and lawful occupants on mailo land need to be clarified in regulations and fully enforced to ensure participation of more local communities in forest restoration. 48 Table 16: Diagnostic analysis of enabling conditions Feature Preliminary Result Preliminary Rationale Ability to Improve Ecological Conditions Mostly in place Ecological conditions across the all landscapes suit restoration activities because of the suitable edaphic and climatic factors. The main elements could be selecting of the restoration interventions including aspects of species site matching and land use dynamics. High: With the right technical support and coordination, there is high potential to restore most of the degraded landscapes in the country, because of the favorable ecological conditions (arable soils, relatively high and stable rainfall and suitable altitude) for tree planting in most parts of Uganda Market Conditions Mostly in place There is generally high demand for forest products both internally and externally. Market trends studies by Government and partners show that by 2025, the supply of timber will not be sufficient to sustain the booming construction industry, which is mainly fed by restoration activities. Increasingly carbon buyers are buying carbon credits from Uganda and there is potential to widen the market through REDD+ initiatives High: There is high potential to tap into the increasing demand for the various forest products and services Policy Conditions Mostly in place Uganda has adequate policy framework relevant to FLR. Vision 2040 framework observes the need to address the increasing rate of landscape degradation and recommends restoration back to the 1990 target of 24% of Uganda\u2019s land as forested area. This is supported in other frameworks like the NDP II and policies like the National Land policy (2013), National land use policy (2007), Forestry policy (2001), Agricultural policy (2011), Draft Rangeland management and pastoralism policy (2014). Medium: Whereas the policies and planning frameworks are in place, implementation has been weak due to capacity and resource constraints. Social Conditions Partially in place Most of the restoration activities require well defined land tenure and land use planning. Whereas the Land use policy is in place, the scale of land use planning for the entire country in the different landscapes is very low. This coupled with unclear land and tree tenure especially under customary land tenure compromises efforts to restore degraded lands in a coordinated and sustained manner. High: the ongoing efforts to enhance security of tenure and community forestry present an opportunity to address the challenges. Government\u2019s model of providing licensing land in reserves to individuals to plant trees is also an opportunity to harness Institutional Conditions Mostly in place The institutional conditions are very conducive, with clear structures and linkages at the national, subnational and local levels. There are also ongoing interventions to strengthen the regional / trans-boundary management of key landscapes.

Table 17 Implementation capacity and resources Feature Preliminary Result Preliminary Rationale Ability to Improve Leadership Partially in place The assessment indicates that although the country has appropriate policy and institutional framework, strategic leadership for forestry at lower levels has remained a challenge hence limited commitment of resources to facilitate restoration interventions Medium: There is need to increase the level of advocacy to enhance financing of restoration interventions Knowledge Partially in place Despite the increased awareness about the value of restoration as seen from the engagement and activities being undertaken at various levels, there is still need to build capacity of the communities who engage in actual restoration activities in order to promote appropriate FLR technologies. The science of restoration is concentrated merely among the technical staff within the institutions that lead and coordinate implementation of restoration interventions in the country and yet this knowledge has not been effectively conveyed to the communities that are involved in the actual restoration. High: There are many actors engaged in forest landscape restoration in the country, hence presenting an opportunity for mobilizing the communities and creating a platform for practical implementation of appropriate FLR options Finance & Incentives Partially in place Although there are various stakeholders that are providing finance and incentives for restoration activities in the country, these have remained low, scattered and un- coordinated. Medium: Most of the models for incentivizing and financing restoration interventions are donor-driven. There is need for mobilization of financial resources internally for better coordination, sustainability and ownership. Feedback mechanism Partially in place Although there are many players in the sector, the platforms for information sharing are limited and there is no clear mechanism for feedback and follow up. High: There a number of on-going processes to strengthen communication and participation of stakeholders in forest management which FLR can take advantage of, e.g. REDD+ and FLEGT Page 30 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 Figure 14: An illustration of the institutions, their mandates and how they link with each other to support FLR \u2022\ufffd MAAIF - Integration into programs \u2022\ufffd MFEPD - Access to & administration of finance \u2022\ufffd UWA - Protected areas \u2022\ufffd MGLSD \u2022\ufffd MLHU \u2022\ufffd MLG \u2022\ufffd Min. of Local Government \u2022\ufffd Min.

This is mainly due to anthropogenic factors, weak law enforcement and poor funding to the forestry sector. The Northern moist and Karamoja landscapes are the most severely degraded followed by south west rangelands, and western mid altitude that are moderately degraded. Land degradation is due to excessive use of the land without replenishment. Uganda has a total of 8,079,622.1ha of land for forest landscape restoration with about twenty-two priority areas. Most of the priority areas for restoration are found in the northern moist landscape of the restoration zones of Uganda. Afforestation, reforestation, agroforestry and natural regeneration (passive restoration) are the most preferred and feasible restoration options. Agroforestry has a high likelihood of creating benefits that far outweigh the costs compared to other restoration options. While natural regeneration has potential to have more social- ecological benefits albeit difficult to price. The success factors that already exist for restoration interventions include: Legal and policy requirements of FLR, suitable ecological conditions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "deda9e0a-1dbc-443a-beb4-bb3636620f7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "deda9e0a-1dbc-443a-beb4-bb3636620f7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Forest landscape restoration opportunity assessment for Uganda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbbbd4cdc0ef28ce0982768227b03e5e266b2fad6a53cd48070f811e45901a1d"}, "3": {"node_id": "48de95d7-b399-4a36-8b25-da0deedf7115", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/forest-landscape-restoration-opportunity-assessment-uganda", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7817b32b065e1e902e9c02e6915475adc579c41e53c50db833bb2a07a38dd83b"}}, "hash": "69d6410120e50fc8b777ccd138bc3200e1dfd58e514b8aad37776a0082f8c59a", "text": "and suitable market conditions. The factors that are missing are awareness of FLR and its role among local communities, well defined tree and forest tenure under mailo and customary land tenure system, resources committed to restoration and monitoring system for restoration interventions. The major strategies for addressing major policy and institutional bottlenecks that affect forest landscape restoration interventions are: Providing reliable and timely forest extension services to local communities, promoting establishment of more value addition forest-based industries, providing market-based incentives to those involved in restoration, enhance capacity of responsible bodies in the forest sector, enhance security of forest and tree tenure, improve on the coordination of relevant agencies and integrate the value of forests as natural capital into national accounting and reporting systems. Page 31 Uganda FLR - Restoration Opportunity Assessment Report 2016 4.2 General Recommendations Planting of mainly native/indigenous species from different functional groups will be necessary under all restoration options preferred by land owners to restore degraded forests. This is because of the associated ecological benefits of indigenous tree species compared to exotic species in the ecosystem. The species grown should be suited for the ecological conditions of each landscape and existing natural disturbances. The focus should be to have species mosaics within a landscape that enhance socio-ecological robustness. Agroforestry ought to be used in the transition phase early in forest restoration in protected areas that have been encroached on to overcome socioeconomic and ecological obstacles to restoring former forest lands that were turned into agriculture. It should also be promoted in areas that are densely populated to minimize encroaching on crop land. Natural regeneration should be promoted in reserves and private land committed to forest restoration but this will require prevention of disturbances such as fire and cultivation that may hinder natural succession process. Emerging seedlings and re-sprouts should be protected from competition by clipping plants around them. There will be need to have regular monitoring of restoration sites in order to understand the sites\u2019 forest restoration trajectory and for guiding management and intervention practices. Subsidies in form of planting materials, training and forest extension services will be critical in implementing restoration interventions in all the landscapes. There is need to develop capacity in tree seed especially of native species that can be used for restoration. Involving local communities in building a good reliable seedbank system will be useful. Trials for restoration models that can lead to ecological and economic benefits in different landscapes need to be implemented and cascaded to communities. There is need for a policy and legal requirement for all landowners who degrade forests to restore them and there should be a mechanism to monitor their progress to minimize fragmentation. Involvement of non-state actors such as corporate companies, traditional institutions and civil society organisations should be pursued to address funding bottlenecks for forest restoration programmes. Implementers of FLR initiatives should as much as possible avoid conversion of other natural ecosystems such as wetlands and grasslands into forests to avoid loss of the ecosystem services they provide. Much as exotic species may have fast growth and high economic returns, it\u2019s important that they are not planted in sites that were formerly covered by indigenous species because of the potential to change the micro-conditions. Colonizing species ought to be prioritized in restoration of heavily degraded sites to provide ecological conditions that enhance late successional species. Maximizing ecological benefits of restored riparian vegetation will require farmers to \u201csacrifice\u201d significant buffer widths, and restoration should adopt a multi-species riparian buffer strip system including trees and grasses.

These range from food, medicine, climate regulation and coastal protection to recreational opportunities and spiritual benefits. Despite their global significance, marine and coastal ecosystems face a wide array of threats \u2013 mainly due to anthropogenic causes. Habitat loss and degradation, overfishing and destructive fishing methods, eutrophication and pollution deterio- rate the state of our ocean. In addition, the impacts of climate change are heavily affecting many ecosystems. Response to these threats is often limited due to a lack of regula-tion and enforcement, insufficient management and governance or limited awareness. To halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is crucial to make enhanced efforts at global, regional, national and local levels. Therefore, the Blue Solutions Initiative supports partner countries to work towards the achievement of the coastal and marine related Aichi targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

This publication is a result of Blue Solutions\u2019 first Regional Forum on Solutions for Oceans, Coasts and Human Well- being in Asia and the Pacific. This three-day workshop was held on Mactan Island, Cebu, Philippines in May 2014. During this event more than 25 participants presented their positive examples and engaged with the larger audience in discussions around how these examples can be adapted to address pressing challenges faced in other regions or sectors in Africa. This publication compiles 27 blue solutions from Asia and the Pacific, most of which were presented. The cases blue solutions from asia and the pacific introduction are summarized within this publication and focus on topics such as marine protected areas, sustainable tourism, sustain- able fisheries, sustainable livelihoods, conservation of resources and biodiversity and mitigation of the effects of climate change. It is an inspiring guide through activities and projects towards the protection and integrated, sustainable man- agement of valuable and vulnerable coastal and marine ecosystems. SOLUTIONS \u2013 APPROACHES THAT WORK Blue solutions exist at all levels \u2013 from local to global \u2013 and address challenges in a variety of ways, from technical infrastructure or co-management approaches to policy-making or law enforcement. Thus, blue solutions are successful approaches or processes that\u2026 \u00b7 address marine and coastal challenges. They contribute to the maintenance or improvement of the health of biodi- versity and ecosystems helping to achieve global sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals. \u00b7 are effective. They are specific, applied examples that have been implemented with a demonstrated positive impact. \u00b7 are scalable. Elements of a solution have the potential to be up-scaled and/or replicated in other geographic, social or sectorial contexts. While a solution describes a context-specific example, we believe that every solution is com- posed of essential elements that determine its success \u2013 we call them building blocks. These building blocks, described as part of a solution story, may be adapted and recombined to ad- dress challenges in other socio-cultural and ecological contexts, sectors or geographies. The Blue Solutions Initiative has established building block categories according to their means of action. A glossary of all building blocks, sorted by category, can be found at the back of this publication and all solutions contributed are published on the marine and coastal portal of the Panorama platform. \u00a9 GRID-Arendal | M.

The overall aim is to inspire action towards effective man- agement and equitable governance of our planet\u2019s marine and coastal living spaces at all social and institutional levels. The exchange around solutions is realized through face-to-face meetings, the integration of solutions as real-life exam- ples into capacity development formats as well as through an online platform. face-to-face solutions exchange Face-to-face meetings allow participants to learn about solutions from other regions or sectors, and experience how these examples can be adapted to other contexts. Workshops allow participants to establish new connections and networks with other practitioners and policy-makers. The Blue Solutions Initiative organises face-to-face exchanges at different levels, adapting the format to its specific context. One outstanding series of events facilitated by the Blue Solutions initiative are Regional Fora for Oceans, Coasts and Human Well- being.

Creating ownership To build a long-term and lasting management plan, all perspec- tives, uses and needs are taken into account. Provincial workshops facilitate a collective understand- ing. Community input is ensured through the use of participatory risk assessments, among others. Understanding local impacts and threats Detailed studies and sur- veys are undertaken to gain improved under- standing of the vul- nerability of the site to climate change and human-related threats. The Peam Krasop Wildlife Sanctuary in Kho Kong Province, Cambodia, is one of the largest and most undisturbed re- generated mangrove forests in Southeast Asia. In order to address the need for climate change adaptation in the area, a co-management plan was developed for the sanctuary with participation of local communities. The co-management plan will support ecosystem and social resilience through maintenance and restoration of mangrove areas, the implementation of a zoning system that regulates use of and movement in the sanctuary, the development of livelihood diversification and adaptation techniques for local communities, as well as the conserva- tion of key species. Mr Veng Somsak, Deputy Chief of Koh Sralao Community Protected Area: From my understanding every protected area should have zoning to reduce conflicts between the Protected Area Authority and the users and to make it easy for the local community to participate in natural resources conservation. It is easier if people know where they can collect natural resources and where they cannot.\u00ab \u00a9 Keith Ellenbogen solution adaptive, community-driven and resilient co-management plan building blocks Solution components for replication Sharing knowledge in a community workshop \u00bb Areal view of the Peam Krasop Wildlife Sanctuary \u00a9 IUCN/ Sun Kong cambodia National upscaling and trans-boundary exchanges A platform is established to share effective solu- tions, good practices and lessons learned at the regional level.

Mr. Seru Serevi, renowned artist and composer in Fiji and the South Pacific region: Nasoata is important to us because it is our \u2018ikanakana\u2019, meaning our breadbasket, where we get our crabs and fish from. We have in our own ways been protecting the natural resources on the island, such as declaring taboo zones for certain periods and this has contributed to the pristine state of the man- groves to date. Our people have respected the need to protect the island, it is people from outside who are not respecting our taboos. Through the consultative process we went through, strong cooperation between the vil- lagers, the Provincial Office and the relevant government departments is now evident. The future of Nasoata is brighter. The protection of Nasoata, the inclusion into Ramsar and also the addition of some eco-tourism activ- ities will be the best outcome for the island.\u00ab fiji Nasoata Island in Fiji belongs to the people of Nakorovou village. It was in 1970 when the villagers bought back the island that, during colonial times, belonged to coconut plantation owners. Today, people living on the island do not have to fight colonisers, but people from outside who access the island illegally and poach its resources in an unsustainable way. Nasoata Island\u2019s co-management is a solution that bridges biodiversity con- servation and fishing rights through an effective management framework. It was developed in a consultative process, bringing together different stake- holders from the national, provincial and local level. The solution considers traditional fishing rights, modern monitoring and law enforcement techniques. The management plan will enhance the chances of Nasoata being chosen as the second Ramsar site in Fiji, meaning that it might become a certified Wet- land of International Importance. The application is on-going.

Construction of fish ponds and bunds Ponds with salt tolerant fish species provide new sources of income and nutrition. Bunds around these ponds planted with mangroves and halophytes protect the coast from natural hazards. Village level institutions These local management commit- tees develop rules, regulations and micro plans for all activities and are responsible for their im- plementation. They try to consi- der the concerns and priorities of different stakeholders. Training allows them to also take into consideration new climate change findings. Situation analysis and vulner- ability assessment Participatory rural appraisals help to draw a picture of the socio-economic and environ- mental situation and to iden- tify the project area and risk zones that are affected most by climate change impacts like sea level rise and salinity. In India\u2019s state Tamil Nadu almost half of the population lives in coastal areas and depends heavily on the resources that the coast provides. However, these resources are at risk due to a number of climatic and non-climatic stresses, such as cyclones, floods, land and groundwater salinity, water pollution, or siltation of creeks in mangroves. This solution helps to turn saline areas into productive land again by introducing brackish-water fishery farming. This in turn helps to secure people\u2019s incomes and livelihoods and to reduce migration to urban areas. Integrated Mangrove Fishery Farming includes building ponds and bunds, planting mangroves and halophytes on the bunds and introducing new salt-tolerant fish and plant species. What makes this solution \u201cintegrated\u201c is not only the fact that it combines in- come generating activities with protection measures, but also that it is science-based and community-centred at the same time. Indrani Pakri Samy, living in a coastal village in Tamil Nadu: Fishing was never easy for us. Very often we used to spend the whole day submerged in creeks or mangroves to hand- pick fish and crab. And very often this caused health problems like wounds in legs and hands, skin diseases, colds or fever. Plus, our fish catch decreased with time. With this project, things have become better. We set up a nursery, raised mangroves and planted them along the bunds and mounds of the ponds that we created. Today, I can earn money by selling fish which grows in our pond again since we use salt tolerant fish varieties now.\u00ab \u00a9 Keith Ellenbogen solution integrated mangrove fishery farming building blocks Solution components for replication Villagers planting mangroves that were grown in the village nursery.

In order to identify appropriate salt-tolerant spe- cies, data on soil and salinity is collected. Since 1969, Mousuni Island in the Indian Sundarbarns has shrunk by one sixth due to coastal erosion. In the same time the island\u2019s population has tripled. With breaches in the island\u2019s embankments, saline water keeps flowing onto the mainland. Especially before and after the monsoon, when most of the storms occur, vast areas of the island are under water. With the expected sea level rise, the threat of damage to agricultural land, property and human and animal life will most likely increase. This solution prepares island communities for an uncertain future, enabling them to adapt to climatic changes. Its two core activities are preparing people for extreme weather events and disasters and introducing suitable salt-tolerant paddy and fish varieties in flood prone areas. Mostafa Khan, farmer on Mousuni Island: Breach of embankment has become a regular phenomenon on our island. When a breach occurs, our agricultural land and our ponds are flooded with brackish water. What has made the situation worse is that many farmers decided to go for high yielding varieties that are not only more expensive, but also more sensitive to brackish water than traditional varieties. Today, paddy cultivation with high yielding paddy varieties has more or less become impossible. This project has provided me with seeds of Lalgetu, a salt-tolerant paddy variety that was cultivated in the old days. I have been cultivating this variety on my land for three years now and have started to share it with other farmers. Unfor- tunately, brackish water can still destroy very young seedlings. But on my plot of land, the growth of paddy has been very good to date.\u00ab \u00a9 Keith Ellenbogen solution preparing for disasters and building livelihood resilience building blocks Solution components for replication Mostafa Khan checking his ready to harvest salt- tolerant paddy. \u00bb Awareness campaigns These campaigns inform and sensitise the target community on climate change, its impacts and effects on livelihoods, and on the need to adapt.

Bird\u2018s Head Seascape, with its highly productive waters and diverse habitats including coral reefs and mangroves is the life support system of the people of West Papua in Indonesia. Ecosystem health is crucial to sustainable natural resource industries such as fisheries, tourism and aquaculture. After a decade of conservation efforts, the Bird\u2019s Head Seascape is now a global model for community-driven conservation at scale and for a well managed ecologically-connected Marine Protected Area network. The network includes 15 Marine Protected Areas and covers over 3.6 million hectares of critical coastal and marine habi- tats. It aims at preserving the Seascape\u2019s globally significant biodiversity while at the same time ensuring food security and sustainable economic benefits for local communities. A co-management approach integrates modern and traditional community management systems, thus strenghtening the rights and capacities of local communities to manage marine resources within their own unique cultural context.

Multi-sectoral stakeholder committee Key persons from all stakeholder groups, including governmental staff, discuss spatial conflicts in a series of meetings and agree on a zonation scheme. indonesia In many spatial planning processes, the use of land and marine areas is treated seperately, which often leads to conflicts in economic use and environmental protection. This applies especially for areas that are highly populated and intensive- ly used. Bontang City in Indonesia is such an area. The coastal zones around Bontang City feature human settlements, power plants, oil and gas industries, ports, aquaculture, marine transportation, fisheries and tourism. In order to prevent the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems around Bontang City and to address existing and potential spatial conflicts in an adequate and effective way, a number of mid-level government officials initiated the development of an integrated spatial plan. This new plan, for the first time, includes both land areas and marine areas with its mangroves, coral reefs and seagrass beds.

The effectiveness of MPA networks significantly increases if MPAs are eco- logically connected, for example by situating the protected areas to facilitate the linking of marine populations through dispersal of fish and coral larvae. Although the understanding of ecological connectivity is crucial for the establishment of MPA networks, little is known about connectivity patterns. This solution provides for the first time scientific data to better understand ecologically relevant larval disper- sal of reef fishes in the Philippines. Genetic data analysis revealed that locally-managed MPAs situated along a 90 km coastal stretch in the province of Negros Oriental can supply reef fish larvae to fellow MPAs and to areas open to fishing. The derived knowledge on larval disper- sal patterns helps stakeholders to improve existing MPA networks or to efficiently plan new networks that may even cross political (municipal) boundaries. Dr Rene A. Abesamis was the main investigator of the larval connectivity study that was carried out at the Silliman University, Angelo King Center for Research and Environmental Management. He and his colleagues worked with local stakeholders in eight municipalities in Negros Oriental during the scientific study. They shared their findings with local government officials, government agencies and representatives from people\u2019s organisations, the education sector and other stakeholder groups. In workshops with stakeholders before and after the study they explained the concept of larval connectivity and why knowledge of larval dispersal patterns is crucial for determining the size, spacing and location of individual MPAs within a network. In 2013, Dr Abesamis was awarded as an outstanding young scientist by the National Academy of Science and Technology for both his research and his endeavors to share his findings and transfer knowledge. This solution is being implemented by the Silliman University, Angelo King Centre for Research and Environmental Management (SUAKCREM) in cooperation with GIZ\u2019s project Adaptation to Climate Change in Coastal Areas (ACCCoast) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB). Scientific investigation on larval dispersal Parentage analysis using microsatellite DNA markers is used to expose links between reef fish populations via larval dispersal and the extent of ecological connectivity between different MPAs. Communication of scientific results Findings on larval connectivity are communicated to local stakeholders, decision-makers and the scientific community to improve the efficiency of existing and future MPA networks and its governance. \u00a9 T.

Mangrove ecosystems provide livelihoods and coastal protection. They also have a high carbon sequestration and storage potential and thus contribute to climate change mitigation. And yet, mangroves are being cleared at an alarming rate. In the Philippines over 50 per cent of mangroves have already been lost. Community-based mangrove rehabilitation addresses the degradation of coastal greenbelts by enabling and empowering people to protect remaining mangroves and reforest degraded areas. In order to make protection, rehabilitation and management measures sustainable, this solution also stimulates income diversification and offers capacity building for communities. The island-village of Silonay is exposed to frequent storm surges. During the past decades, the village has become even more vulnerable because residents have cut huge parts of the island\u2018s mangrove trees. With support of Conser- vation International (CI) the local community organisation Sama-Samang Nagkakaisang Pamayanan ng Silonay (SNPS) is turning the situation around \u2013 by implementing the Silonay Mangrove Conservation and Ecotourism Project for the rehabilitation and conservation of a 42-hectare mangrove area. SNPS is working to diversify income from mangrove conservation and planting to micro-enterprise projects ranging from ecotourism to the sale of souvenirs. CI and the provincial government of Oriental Mindoro funded the construc- tion of a 400-meter mangrove boardwalk, where visitors can experience the vast expanse of the mangrove forest. A look at Facebook shows that the eco- tourism concept and the crash course in nature conservation for tourists work well. Students and teachers, government officials and foreign journalists, and even beauty queens have posted their encounters with the \u201cparadise island of mangroves\u201d on the project\u2019s Facebook account.

In the Philippines, small-scale fisheries play a critical role in the livelihoods of coastal communities, and also contribute significantly to the national economy by supplying the bulk of the dietary fish requirements and providing direct employ- ment. However, the failures and inadequacies in governance of small-scale fisheries are conspicuous: depleted fish stocks and degraded fish habitats, intensified resource use competition and conflict, post-harvest losses, limited institutional capabilities, inadequate and inconsistent fisheries policies, and weak institutional partnerships. To address these problems, an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) was adopted by eight coastal municipalities in the Province of Misamis Occidental in Northern Mindanao, Philippines, to improve small-scale fisheries management for poverty reduction. These municipalities founded the Iligan Bay Alliance of Misamis Occidental (IBAMO), a multi-stakeholder body which provides a governance framework for inter-municipal collaboration in the province. IBAMO seeks to create opportunities that foster the wellbeing of both the environment and the people who depend on fisheries for their livelihood by developing EAF strategies and action for fisheries management and by strengthening the capacity of local fishery stakeholders and government agencies to collaborate and work according to EAF. The formation of IBAMO is based on previous programmes in the field of coastal resource man- agement in the province of Misamis Occidental. Thus, building partnerships and consensus with \u201coutside\u201d institutions (including NGOs and civil society groups) and catalyzing the improvement of fisheries governance at target sites was achieved within two years. In 2012, all eight LGUs en- tered and signed a new Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to constitute IBAMO, along with the provincial government and regional offices of several government agencies of Northern Mindanao. Since its establishment, IBAMO increases the commitment to implement EAF in small-scale fish- eries management through better understanding of its potential for poverty reduction and environ- mental sustainability, integrates EAF in existing Coastal Resources Management plans and enhances the understanding of the roles of marine protected areas. The alliance fosters active participation and capacity development of beneficiaries in participatory research and collaborative implementation of EAF strategies and produces practical guidelines for EAF action programs and policy recommendations for long-term planning. solution strengthening governance of small-scale fisheries building blocks Solution components for replication Fishing boats in Misamis Occi- dental Participatory Diagnosis and Adaptive Management (PDAM) Stakeholders jointly identify the fishery to be managed by defining fishery boundaries, identifying fishery-specific challenges and opportunities, prioritizing issues and scoping potential manage- ment solutions.

The creation of protected areas, especially protected areas with restrictive no-take policies prohibiting extractive activities, often fuels fears in local communities that are confronted with new rules and restrictions. They are afraid to lose access to resources and thus to income. The Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park Act showcases that, if carefully planned and sensitively mana- ged, assumed losses in protected areas can be turned into benefits. The formulation of the Act and its policies involved multiple consultations with a cross section of society \u2013 from the village to the national level. This participatory process ensured that the affected communities and stake- holders were able to shape the contours of the new rules and regulations that would later affect them. Locally-based management involving a range of stakeholders, partnerships between the public and private sector, good communication and financial compensation have led to effective and voluntary compliance with the specifications of the Act and improved protection of this UNESCO World Heritage Site. USS Guardian aground at Tubbataha Reef In 2013, a US Navy warship ran aground at Tubbataha Reef. It damaged an area of 2,345.67 square metres. The vessel had to be removed from the reef in segments. The Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board issued a notice of violation to the US government and communicated the total cost of damage and penalties for violations, based on fines stipulated in the Republic Act No. 10067, the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park Act of 2009. The violations include unauthorised entry, damage to the reef, destruction of resources, non-payment of conservation fees for entering the park area, and obs- truction of law enforcement officers. Thus, the US Navy is facing a fine of 58 million Philippine Pesos, or US$ 1.4 million. Reckoning the cost of damage was straightfor- ward because it is based on clearly articulated provisions embodied in the Act. Information campaigns To promote awareness and a general understanding of the global significance of this biodi- versity hotspot, the developed Act and policies are commu- nicated to the public through various outreach activities, e.g. through radio plugs and local newspapers. solution tubbataha reefs natural park act building blocks Solution components for replication USS Guardian aground at Tubbataha Reef Participatory develop- ment of the Act A series of multi-stake- holder consultations and workshops for drafting and reviewing the Act en- sures full stakeholder par- ticipation as well as broad acceptance and compliance with rules and regulations. Economic incentives for communities Local communities are com- pensated for economic losses caused by no-take policies. A share of the conservation fee is channelled into a livelihood fund that provides loans for development. Locally-based park management and law enforcement Local institutions and communities, municipal and national govern- ment representatives, NGOs, academia, and the private sector are all represented in a locally-based park management and law enforcement body. Law enforcement is ensured through partnerships with the Phil- ippine Navy and Coast Guard and locally recruited park rangers who receive in-depth training and appropriate surveillance equipment. The environmental situation in the park is monitored regularly, while the effectiveness of governance is measured annually using participatory mechanisms. The Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park is composed of over 10,000 hectares of coral reef and more than 87,000 hectares of surroun- ding waters.

A couple of years ago we decided to join forces in order to make more wise and informed choices about our future \u2013 which is especially urgent given the pressures from logging, rising water levels, decreasing natural resources and increasing exploration by mining companies. Therefore, in 2008 LLCTC together with the provincial government requested support from The Nature Conservancy in order to better protect the land and seas of Lauru. The result was a provincial master conservation plan. This plan has been the foundation for the development of the 18 marine and terrestrial protected areas that have been established in Lauru so far.\u00ab \u00a9 Jimmy Kereseka solution lauru ridges to reefs protected area network building blocks Solution components for replication \u00a9 James Hardcastle Rich in natural resources: Lauru in the Solomon Islands \u00bb solomon islands Monitoring of protected areas The community\u2019s manage- ment committee ensures continuous monitoring of protected areas.

Tourism is also of increasing importance for developing countries but constitutes a significant pressure on coral reefs. The diving and snorkelling industry is one of the fastest growing tourism industries. What is good for business often creates threats for nature \u2013 in this case for marine ecosys- tems and in particular for coral reefs in tourism hotspots worldwide. This solution targets these threats. The Green Fins approach provides guidance to environmental stan- dards for dive operators thus creating more responsible and sustainable behaviour within the industry. It offers simple and economic recommendations to prevent haz- ards like anchor damage or littering. In order to sustainably conserve and protect coral reefs, private and public sector stakeholders are brought together and collaborations are encouraged to create a network for awareness. This is how dive centres get involved: dive centres agree to become members. This is voluntary and free of charge. A trained Green Fins assessor then carries out an assessment and the dive centre agrees on three realistic actions it can commit to that will limit its environmental impact and improve environmental awareness and eco-friendly dive operations. Depending on the success of these actions, dive centres have the possibility to become one of the 10 top members. If, after two yearly assessments, no improvement is recorded, free membership can be suspended or withdrawn from the member. This is a valuable quality control tool because members and above all the most eco-friendly operators get free publicity \u2013 on the Green Fins website, on social media, or at inter- national dive shows.

Spatial planning is a tool to integrate measures to incorporate climate change into planning processes. It is not a new concept in the East Asian Seas Region. In fact, spatial planning has been employed for decades in member countries of the East Asian Seas Region. However, existing planning systems often do not include climate change and sea\u2010level rise scenarios or modern management approaches. This solution is an initiative in the East Asian Seas Region that pro- vides capacity building for national and local authorities responsible for coastal development and management and in particular for coastal spatial planning. It integrates emerging issues and new management approaches into existing planning concepts. The solution also provides national adaptation activities tailored to the needs and priorities of each country as well as best practices for capacity building and field applications.

This was done through hands on demon- stration and development of coastal planning scenarios considering ecosystem-based adaptation (EBA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). During the trial two things were developed with participation of local authorities and communities: a spatial planning strategy for EBA and DRR; and an outreach document in non-technical language with illustrative graphics of EBA and DRR scenarios inclu- ding the role of mangrove and coastal ecosystems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The spatial planning strategy and the outreach document are now used by Cambodia in their planning activities. \u00a9 COBSEA Secretariat COBSEA COORDINATING BODY ON THE SEAS OF EAST ASIA 50 51 This solution is being implemented by the Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA) of the United Nations Environment Progamme (UNEP) and the Government of the Republic of Korea through the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI), the Ministry of Land Transport and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). southeast asia In the countries of the East Asian Seas Region the speed of coastal erosion, exacerbated by climate change, increases year by year, threatening coastal ecosystems, communities and economies.

Community awareness, participation and stewardship Local communities discuss restoration objectives, protection plans and co-management principles and are trained in community-based ecological mangrove restoration. Project managers connect communities and government agencies to support the restoration process. thailand There are an estimated 400,000 hectares of abandoned shrimp ponds in former mangrove areas worldwide. These areas represent both environmental degradation and lost economic opportunities. There are many efforts to regener- ate hydrologically disturbed or degraded mangrove forests. The success rate, however, is rather low due to a number of reasons, including failing to observe nature and planting the wrong species in the wrong place at the wrong time. This solution, applied in the coastal Trang Pro- vince in Thailand, has shown that Community- based Ecological Mangrove Restoration can make a difference. It restores degraded and unproductive areas back to healthy and diverse mangroves at low cost and with community stewardship. The overall aims are to sustain livelihoods of fishers and resource users, to protect communities from disasters and last but not least to benefit the environment. This solution highlights the need to observe nature thoroughly first while allowing nature to do the seeding and rehabilitation by itself.

The Mekong River Delta accounts for about 80 per cent of the country\u2019s total shrimp production. Silvo-aquaculture is an extensive farming method that incorporates mangrove forest in aquaculture ponds. However, poor culturing techniques, a lack of capital and mono-cultures make aquaculture farms prone to calamities that may lead to periodical loss of profit. To supplement their income, farmers therefore often collect natural resources from adjacent mangroves, causing their degradation. By promoting Best Management Practices for silvo-aquaculture as well as supporting Farmer Interest Groups along the Mekong Delta coast, the solution aims at both awareness creation for mangrove ecosystem conservation and diversifi- cation of farmers\u2019 incomes.

Then, the mangroves were destroyed due to many people having uncontrolled access to the fishing grounds. Her livelihood, like that of many others\u2018, was regularly threatened by floods inundating her gardens and house.

Planning and construction of breakwaters Field testing of the design verifies the strength of the natural material of choice \u2013 bamboo. Local people are informed of and engaged in the planned activity. With tech- nical support, local people construct the breakwaters, in this case T-shaped fences. The long-shore parts break the waves and the cross-shore elements catch suspended sediments in long-shore currents. vietnam Along the mangrove-mud coasts of the Mekong Delta, erosion causes loss of land up to 30\u201390 m per year and affects the life of many thousands, often poor farmers and fisherfolk. The traditional response of building concrete dykes and seawalls does not work on the soft soils since the structures simply sink into the mud or collapse. In such situations, a coastal area protection strategy which combines floodplains (foreshore), mangrove forests and, where necessary, an earth dyke is the most effective solution. However, at sites where the foreshore and mangrove forest have been destroyed by erosion, such a strategy can only be implemented after restoration of the eroded floodplains.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "addb0b30-7127-4f3d-a0c3-2c3cf2426da1": {"__data__": {"id_": "addb0b30-7127-4f3d-a0c3-2c3cf2426da1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fffb21b461b4cdadcccf9ad60c28f7e1b2cdd8f51ef75c6b816baf037c0a957"}, "2": {"node_id": "c46c5e57-5668-4541-a4ec-0f561177bdc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aca9140c44376346336bc453f66d696e86bfa06e0ccb5e8bf516a3e973f29a61"}}, "hash": "a65cf8b8001b77117e7bc0f787874a83f1d58b8ace9a48e7f807c4ca000a3d9b", "text": "This will re-create the site conditions suitable for mangrove forest growth.

Facilitating a co-management dialogue The MPA management plan was developed using the co- management model including workshops and stakeholder meetings. Shared responsibilities and interests of the state, com- munity, and stakeholders have been jointly identified. Designing and zoning an MPA for climate adaptation The MPA design followed an ecological systems approach to prioritize strictly protected areas, ecological restoration, tourism development, reasonable exploi- tation and development areas. Zone management allows for specific adaptive measures. vietnam The coastal city of Hoi An is flooded every year, incapacitating all economic and social life in the city. Typhoons destroy crops, buildings, homes, schools, and infrastructure \u2013 endangering people\u2019s lives. Saline intrusion as well as coastal and riverbank erosion are serious challenges. Hoi An officially aims to become a resilient eco-city by 2030. As part of the eco-city strategy, Hoi An established the Cham Islands Marine Protected Area (MPA). The MPA allows the city to regulate fishing activities and control pollution to protect species and marine resources. It furthermore helps to reduce coastal erosion through ecosystem restoration and supports the development of eco-tour- ism models to diversify local income sources, proving that environ- mental protection can also be compatible with economic growth. solution supporting the development of the resilient eco-city hoi an: the cham islands marine protected area building blocks Solution components for replication For the establishment of Cham Islands Marine Protected Area, an integrated and adaptive ecosystem management approach was applied by local people. Since 2006, the entire MPA is managed by a community organization. A community-based ecotourism home-stay program was developed, which provides job opportu- nities and improves local people\u2018s standard of living. The recently established community-based land crab management pro- gramme was particularly innovative because residents agreed upon a protocol for sustainable management of the endangered land crabs. This programme has been enormously successful and has demonstrated the power of thoughtful and sustained commu- nity participation in environmental decision-making. Conducting formal risk assessment The risk assessment and the creation of Biosphere Reserve criteria lead to the delineation of the MPA in accordance to ecosystem and community needs.

Developing alternative livelihoods The community-based eco- tourism homestay programme promotes socio-economic devel- opment and local income oppor- tunities. The community-based land crab management pro- gramme promotes the sustainable exploitation of land crabs. Establishing local man- agement infrastructure A coordinating centre sets up the Cham Islands MPA zoning plan and regula- tion roadmap. It super- vises monitoring, conducts research, public awareness raising and education, and coordinates development of management regulation and alternative livelihoods. 64 65 This solution is being implemented by the Kien Giang Department of Science and Technology in cooperation with Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0928b44-f76e-4b43-93e4-9c7fc163bbf4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0928b44-f76e-4b43-93e4-9c7fc163bbf4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blue solutions from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb8961cf6bb71cc98f73e27f95f93ee9c1419cc398315d15491295bd88bb887f"}, "2": {"node_id": "f70deb64-2fc6-45bd-aa99-4b1625fe8928", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/blue-solutions-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6114591cda4e6ace5e71edbd12a17c73788db5f2ce82f37fa8a4dbd4529f7dd"}}, "hash": "f1b7eddd9c393e6851af002e3623317fd42c3903768f468fe68c73e514277252", "text": "vietnam The conservation of Melaleuca trees has national priority in Vietnam because they buffer the effects of river floods, recharge aquifers and provide a unique environment for many wetland species of which a great number are endangered.

Since we intro- duced our new management regime no major fires have been recorded which means we could also reduce the costs of firefighting extremely. There are also a number of positive social and economic impacts.

By focusing on holistic, successful approaches for sustainable management and conservation of marine and coastal resources, the Blue Solutions Initiative helps to address challenges in the coastal and marine realm. The global project collates, documents and promotes so called \u00bbblue solutions\u00ab \u2013 successful case studies from all over the world \u2013 with the objective to inspire, share knowledge and support a worldwide exchange of replicable ideas to accelerate action for our ocean. Blue Solutions is funded through the International Climate Initiative (ICI) as a contribution of the German Environment Ministry (BMUB) and is being implemented jointly by GIZ, GRID-Arendal, IUCN and UNEP. This publication is a result of the Blue Solutions\u2019 third Regional Forum for Oceans, Coasts and Human Well-Being in Africa held in spring 2016. It compiles 32 blue solutions from Africa, most of which were presented during the event. The solutions summarised in this publication focus on topics such as marine protected areas, sustainable tourism, sustainable fisheries, sustainable livelihoods, conservation of resources and biodiver- sity as well as mitigation of the effects of climate change. It is an inspiring guide through Africa\u2019s activities and projects towards the protection and integrated, sustainable management of it\u2018s valuable and vulnerable coast- al and marine ecosystems. blue solutions from africa introduction \u00a9 Rob Barnes | GRID-Arendal Zanzibari fisherman on the Indian Ocean \u00a9 Rob Barnes | GRID-Arendal Participants of the Blue Solutions\u2019 Regional Forum for Oceans, Coasts and Human Well- Being in Africa SOLUTIONS \u2013 APPROACHES THAT WORK Blue solutions exist at all levels \u2013 from local to global \u2013 and address challenges in a variety of ways, from technical infra- structure or co-management approaches to policy-making or law enforcement. Thus, blue solutions are successful ap- proaches or processes that\u2026 \u2026 address marine and coastal challenges. They contribute to the maintenance or improvement of the health of biodi- versity and ecosystems helping to achieve global sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals. \u2026 are effective. They are specific, applied examples that have been implemented with a demonstrated positive impact. \u2026 are scalable. Elements of a solution have the potential to be up-scaled and/or replicated in other geographic, social or sectorial contexts. While a solution describes a context-specific example,we believe that every solution is composed of essential elements which determine its success \u2013 we call them building blocks. These building blocks, described as part of a solution story, may be adapted and recombined to address challenges in other socio-cultural and ecological contexts, sectors or ge- ographies. The Blue Solutions Initiative has established building block categories according to their means of action. A glossary of all building blocks, sorted by category, can be found at the back of this publication. All solutions contributed are published on the marine and coastal solutions portal of the Panorama plat- form.

The overall aim is to inspire action towards effective man- agement and equitable governance of our planet\u2019s marine and coastal living spaces at all social and institutional levels. The exchange around solutions is realised through bringing people together in face-to-face meetings, integrating solu- tions as real-life examples into various capacity development formats, as well as through an online platform. face-to-face solutions exchange Physical meetings allow participants to learn about solutions from other regions or sectors and experience how these examples can be adapted to other contexts. These workshops allow participants to establish new connections and net- works with other practitioners and policy-makers. The Blue Solutions Initiative organises face-to-face exchanges at different levels, adapting the format to its specific context.

The solution implemented by the Organisation for the Environment and Sustainable Development (OPED) leads to the widespread use of improved energy-efficient smokeries and alternatives to mangrove trees as energy sources for smok- ing fish. It indentifies ways of replicating the taste(using local aromatic plants) and colour (smoking using fish scales) of fish smoked using mangrove trees. The initiative has led to a 70\u201380 % reduction in the use of mangrove trees, cut the women\u2019s workload by more than 60%, reduced eye and respiratory diseases as well as the traditional con- sumption of alcohol in an effort to combat the heat, and improved household hygiene and health. solution provided by Jonas Kemajou Syapze (OPED) alternatives to mangrove degradation and improvement of women well-being Jonas Kemajou Syapze from OPED shares: \u00bbCameroonian women traditionally use mangrove wood to smoke fish be- cause it gives the fish a good colour and flavour. However, it was discovered that the women who were smoking the fish were placing huge pressure on the mangroves and exposing themselves to smoke and heat (the cause of respira- tory and eye diseases, fever etc.). They had a heavy workload and a low income. We began working with groups of women on activities to protect the mangroves, trying to find ways to raise their income and reduce both their work- load and the adverse impact the fish smoking was having on their health. Together, the activities have modified the deforestation process, increased blue carbon stocks in the mangrove ecosystems in Kribi, raised the women\u2019s income and enhanced their well-being. \u00ab A woman smoking fish in front of her improved smokery Improving and adapting the smokeries Trained community leaders \u00a9 Jonas Kemajou Syapze \u00a9 Jonas Kemajou Syapze \u00a9 Jonas Kemajou Syapze cameroon This solution is being implemented by the Organisation for the Environment and Sustainable Development (OPED) with the World Fish Center, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).

The nets are then sold into a global supply chain and recycled into yarn to make carpet tile. At the heart of Net-Works are the local community banks. Run by community members they provide access to finance, enabling people to save money and take out small loans. The banks also manage the local net supply chain: they organise coastal clean-ups, facilitate sales transactions and create \u00bbenvironment funds\u00ab to help finance local conservation projects. Since 2012 over 100 tonnes of waste nets have been collected through Net- Works, 900 families have been given access to finance and 60,000 people have benefitted from a healthier environment. solution provided by the Net-Works team net-works tm Fanny Djomkam is the community coordinator for Net-Works in the Lake Ossa region of Cameroon. Her role involves working with communities to set up locally-managed savings groups and net collection activities. Net-Works has benefitted local communities in many ways, but for me the biggest benefit has been the community banks or VSLAs (Village Savings and Loan Associations) as we call them locally. VSLAs have really helped to strengthen fisher communities. They provide a simple and effective mecha- nism that enables fishermen to organise themselves and manage their savings in a way that is clear and accountable. Where there may have been conflicts in the past, the VSLAs have helped communities come together in a spirit of cooperation. Fishermen committees are now working with the local administra- tion to co-manage the lake and ensure the code of conduct for responsible fisheries is enforced.

Mangrove areas cover a vast area of approximately 700 ha in total along the Egyptian shoreline. The rapid increase of coastal development and commercial activities during the last two decades lead to negative human impacts on this ecosystem. In 2001 a degradation of the mangrove stands in Egypt was noted, mainly caused by urbanisation and unsustainable resource use due to lacking aware- ness. A small scale mangrove reforestation study was conducted in Sharm El- Shiek and Nabq focusing on the rehabilitation of four local mangrove stands. Working in close collaboration with the local people, the conservation and rehabilitation activities lead to a measurable regeneration of the stands. Ad- ditionally, stakeholder engagement and awareness raising campaigns support local law enforcement. solution provided by Tarek Temraz (EEAA) community-based approach to mangrove restoration and conservation The conservation efforts of the mangrove restoration are not only important for the mangrove stands but also to the local people. Through incentives and subsidiaries leading them towards non-destructive resource use within protected areas, local communities increase their welfare. This approach enables local people to follow the regulations, especially by implementing a no-take zone within Nabq protect- ed area. They are also more likely to comply with fish- ing regulations now e.g. using the right type of nets and fishing lines.

Julie was horrified by the waste washing up onto the beaches creating an environmental disaster for the marine ecosystem and species. Inspired by the toys children were making out of the flip-flop debris, Julie encouraged their mothers to collect, wash, and cut the discarded flip-flops into colorful products. A large order from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Switzerland for 15,000turtle key rings was received and the local women were empowered to create these from an estimated 1,000kgs of discarded flip-flops. This was the first step in \u00bbcommercialising the business\u00ab and provided the first trade focused initiative that support the wo- men and conservation in the Kiunga Marine National Reserve.

Most nations have agreed to protect \u226510% of coastal zones by 2020 and scientists recommend 30% protection by 2030. However, there are significant shortfalls in management effectiveness, and MPAs continue to be threatened due to local and global stressors. The Science for Active Management (SAM) Program works with gov- ernment agencies to develop adaptive management frameworks that incorporate scientific data into decision making. SAM (1) guides staff in translating broad agency goals into measurable objectives, (2) engages staff and stakeholders in MPA monitoring and data review, and (3) provides a co-developed framework to use data to inform and evaluate management actions. Managers and stakeholders think through what information is needed for evaluation, and researchers learn about man- agement needs. solution provided by Jennifer O'Leary (SAM) and Arthur Tuda (KWS) using science for effective and adaptive mpa management The results of using science to empower communities have exceeded expectations.

Lack of CC related knowledge, the absence of local climate data and the heavy dependence on small-scale fishery and traditional agriculture makes the ecosystem and local communities more vulnerable. By recognising the problems associated with CC in the Nosy Hara marine protected area (MPA), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in collaboration with Madagascar National Parks (MNP) has provided CC related capacity building to national park managers. They receive support in undertaking a multi-target vulnerability assessment and implementing adaptation measures for coastal and marine resources as well as for local communities.

Soon after the first offshore oil field was discovered, an intense public debate started about environmental and social risks of this sector. Both, fishermen and industry now impact the marine environment and the cumulative effects increased the need for a sustainable, cross-sectorial marine spatial planning approach. That led to the development of the Program Biodi- versity Oil and Gas (BGP).

Sharing information on ICCA rules and the \u00bbICCA option\u00ab Intense and diverse communication activities (exchanges, meet- ings, popular debates and radio shows) spread information and understanding about Kawawana. Other Community Conserved Areas emerged in Casamance and elsewhere in Senegal. 50 51 The benefits humankind earns from an ecosystem are commonly known as ecosystem services. Coral reefs for instance provide food, coastline protection from erosion, jobs in fishing, recreation etc. Climate change induced coral bleaching, storm surges and sea level rise threaten reefs and minimize the provision of services. This means vulnerability to coastal risks and disasters increases, and valuable income is lost. Reef Rescuers implemented the first-ever large scale reef restoration project using \u00bbcoral gardening\u00ab. It involved collecting over 40,000 small pieces of healthy coral from sites that survived a bleaching event, raising them in underwater nurseries and transplanting them to a 5,300m2 degraded site at Cousin Island Special Reserve affected by coral bleaching. It aims to build resilience in coral reefs damaged by bleaching and improve associated fisheries, tourism and coastal protection. solution provided by Dr Nirmal Jivan Shah (Nature Seychelles) reef rescuers: restoring coral reef ecosystem services On Friday October 23rd 2015 I received word that on the beaches of Cousin Island Special Reserve, a Marine Pro- tected Area where our coral transplantation site is located many dead fish were washing up and that the waters had a dark green appearance,\u00ab tells Dr Phanor Montoya-Maya, Technical/Scientific Officer & Trainer at Nature Seychelles\u2019 Reef Rescuer project. \u00bbDr Nirmal Shah, Nature Seychelles CEO, confirmed that a harmful algal bloom (HAB) was taking place.

These threatened and endangered species are far too often victims of acci- dental by-catch, sand mining, poaching for their meat, eggs and carapaces as well as destruction of nesting beaches due to construction and climate change impacts. The Reptile and Amphibian Program \u2013 Sierra Leone (RAP-SL) reacted to the severe situation for the marine turtles and developed a community-based turtle conservation program. Locals are now supporting the surveillance of nesting beaches and by-catch.

The Sherbro Island beach is about 52 km long and hosts the lar- gest population of nesting leatherbacks in Sierra Leone. For the monitoring of nesting beaches and bycatches, the marine turtle conservation program annually hires members of the adjacent coastal communities. Presently, the Reptile and Amphibian Program \u2013 Sierra Leone (RAP-SL) is en- gaging more than 54 monitors from the local communities to conduct nest- ing beach and by-catch monitoring along the beach. Since 2008, the marine turtle conservation program has recorded a total of 750 marine turtle nests on beaches. These nests resulted in the release of about 38,118 hatchlings while the by-catch monitoring has recorded around 1,000 turtles. Sierra Leone has well over 70 major coastal settlements.

Back in Zanzibar we started our first sponge farm in 2009. We had to do a lot of research to find a species that can be used as a bath sponge and cultivated sustainably. Today we have 3 productive farms and can open 1\u20132 new farms a year. To create even more jobs we started 2014 coral farming for the aquarium trade that allows much faster scaling. To secure the jobs and to manage their marine re- sources sustainably the local people need to learn more about the sea and its\u2019 biodiversity.

In addition to rapid population growth and mass tourism, challenges include overfishing, poaching and illegal destructive fishing methods. On Zanzibar, Chumbe Island Coral Park Limited (CHICOP) was founded to address these issues.

Beaches and other coastal habitats e.g. forests and mangroves are frequently used as a dumping ground for household waste and as public latrines. One coastal community in Pangani District was selected as a pilot site to improve this sad situation. Sea Sense decided to apply creative and participatory outreach tools to raise awareness on the importance of waste management, to initiate dia- logue among citizens and village leaders and to mobilise people into action. The different stakeholder groups subsequently applied the gained knowledge to phrase local waste management bylaws, providing a sustainable and legal framework for improved waste management. solution provided by Lindsey West and Boniventure Mchomvu (both Sea Sense) influencing community attitudes towards waste management Through access to information citizens became increasingly aware of the impacts of poor waste management and mobilised themselves into action. A weekly village clean-up was implemented by Kipumbwi Village Council and a clean-up in Pangani Town was initiated by District Authorities. The immediate impact was dramatic and in the lead up to a World Environment Day celebration, a further fifty District Staff participated in a \u00bbClean Up Pangani\u00ab campaign. A community fisheries management group in Kipumbwi participated in the International Coastal Clean-Up Day. The group collected 66 kg of waste and data were submitted to the global marine debris database. To ensure long term sustainabili- ty the community has now prioritised the formulation of local waste management bylaws.

Awareness raising of the impacts of poor waste management An education and outreach program (e.g. theatre, radio campaign, events) raises awareness on waste management. It also stimulates an initial dialogue and influences attitude and behavior changes. Bylaw formulation and implementation Community members are trained in bylaw formulation and implementation. Participants learn to conduct a situational analysis and to understand the impact of poor waste manage- ment. It also enables them to identify management and ad- ministrative gaps between different stakeholder groups.

The worsening situation has forced fishermen to resort to other activities, which has resulted in the over-exploitation of natural resources (e.g. unregulated extraction of gravel and sand from beaches) with an adverse impact on marine and coastal ecosystems. The solution raises the awareness of the inhabitants of the coastal areas to the issues of vulnerability to erosion and marine pollution.

One can now assess existing competence, identify competence gaps, inform and shape trainings and other capacity development intervention needs and certify MPA personnel meeting the required competences. Certification tools and instruments A number of assessment tools provide opportunities to assess the different MPA management competences of a MPA PRO candidate. Tools for scoring used by WIO-COMPAS are e.g. an application form for initial screening, a portfolio of evidence, practicals, written tests and interviews. Certification events To evaluate their competence appropriate candidates are invited to an interactive evaluation. It involves professional development components and integrates the established interactive assessment instruments. The final decision on certification is with the Certification Board. MPA PRO candidates complete their patrol reports \u00a9 Lawrence Sisitka 74 75 Illegal fishing is a massive worldwide problem as it highly contributes to the depletion of fish stocks especially in the coastal waters of developing countries. The most aggrieved parties are small coastal communities as the illegal activities not only cause environmental, but also economic and social harm to the society. FISH-i Africa is a partnership of eight East African countries, regional organisations and international experts that gathers, analyses, shares and strategically uses information to take action against illegal fishing operators. It has shown that enforcement against those operators can happen, even if capacity is low and the ocean areas to monitor are vast. Key factors have been access to timely and relevant information, effective information sharing and close regional cooperation. solution provided by Krist\u00edn von Kistowski (FISH-i Africa) and Mark Ssemakula (NFDS) fish-i africa Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Somalia and Tanzania joined forces to tackle illegal fishing through an innovative approach. The countries work as the FISH-i Africa Task Force through national fisheries enforcement officers who collect and share information, and take actions against those identified as illegal fishing operators. FISH-i Africa has already worked on more than twenty concrete cases. In 2015, the concept of FISH-i Africa was adapted for replication in a partnership of West African countries, funded by Norway. The de- velopment of a Task Force is also being discussed in Central Africa and the concept has received much interest in East Asia and in Latin America.

This phase has been given the name interdisciplinary situation analysis (ISA) (Idrobo et al. 2016). The intent of this document is to provide detailed rationale and directions for ISA procedure, data sources, analysis and document storage. This document provides information on the ISA workflow from start to finish with the intention of guiding the PiN team in making decisions about what information and procedures should be included and excluded and who to involve. This pa- per also makes suggestions as to the organization of the ISA report that marks the transition between PiN phases I and II. APPROACH TO PiN INTERdIsCIPLINARy sITuATION ANALysIs The PiN mixed methodology (Idrobo et al. 2016) outlines the phases of the PiN landscape assessment (figure 1) and gives early guidance for the ISA (figure 2). The current docu- ment aims to provide a detailed description of the ISA to be followed during early PiN project implementation, and pro- vides suggestions for moving forward in terms of adopting a consistent ISA workflow that may then be integrated with other IUCN tools and approaches.

(2016) PiN WORKING PAPER 6 | PiN LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT PHASE 1 \ufffd Figure 2: PiN Phase I process (Idrobo et al. 2016) The procedure is sequential but feedback between steps may be necessary for adaptation of the ISA to reflect specif- ic needs identified along the way. An aim of the PiN secondary data module (Deutsch et al. 2016) is to employ crowdsourcing tools in order to gain better access to existing data and to be more thorough in terms of data coverage. The digital tools to support this approach have not yet been built at the time of writing, so it is assumed that manual work will be needed to find sourc- es that are difficult to located on and offline. The approach suggested in Deutsch et al. (2016) is aimed at significant- ly reducing the amount of effort for both researchers and communities in the field phase of the PiN methodology, and additionally may be viewed as part of an effort to repatriate data in secondary sources to the community or communi- ties involved in the landscape assessment. A knowledge of what public information is already available in relation to biodiversity and landscapes they use and value is im- portant for community empowerment in assessment and planning processes. The following sections guide the reader through the stages of phase I and provide indications as to which information is required and whom to involve. 1. FORmATION OF THE AssEssmENT TEAm Ideally, the team that is responsible for implementing phase II of the mixed methodology will be formed in the initial stage in the ISA and will be involved in its execution. The IUCN SA emphasizes identification and analysis of stakeholder groups for inclusion or consultation during implementation of the project. While identification of stakeholders is import- ant during the PiN ISA, phase I also focuses on formation of an assessment team, and which will necessarily involve some key stakeholders and rights holders and calls for at- tention to which individuals to involve at the landscape level. PiN landscape assessments may be community-based and as such require an attentive eye towards the partnerships and team composition that can support communities in building an understanding of the biodiversity-based sys- tem and solutions to the problems they identify. PiN takes a rights based approach (RBA) with particular attention to rural and remote communities and Indigenous Peoples. Some stakeholders may be rights holders, and as such, further stakeholder identification and analysis should be carried out with their involvement.1 PiN is still in early development, and is jointly being devel- oped by both secretariat staff and commission members 1 A Preliminary Framework of IUCN\u2019s Rights-Based Approach: Systemization of the Union\u2019s Policy Instruments, Standards and Guidelines.

PiN WORKING PAPER PiN LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT PHASE 1 | 7 under IUCN\u2019s one programme approach. As such, the land- scape assessment team will likely need to involve both sec- retariat staff and commission members that are members of PiN working groups dedicated to specific regions or meth- odological development issues. As PiN is being developed through regional assessments, assessment teams may also involve IUCN regional staff, organizations and local com- munity researchers involved in implementation of projects. Thus, assessment teams may draw on two levels of organiza- tion in the project structure: the regional level, comprising PiN regional working group membership and IUCN regional office staff, and the local community level, including actors who are part of community institutions and/or implementing organiza- tion staff for projects to which the PiN assessment is linked. Members of the assessment team will need to convene at least once during phase I in order to identify objectives, key stakeholders and rights holders, and to delineate the as- sessment area. Once the ISA has been completed, another meeting may be necessary to review gaps in the secondary data and agree upon primary data collection protocols.2 Roles of assessment team members in the IsA A coordinator for the ISA phase should be chosen. The coordinator may effectively perform most of the tasks of gathering secondary data and analysis. It will be necessary, however, to involve members of the assessment team, in keeping with the principle of participatory involvement throughout", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3494e1c2-bb2e-43f6-b04f-e7651a956efc": {"__data__": {"id_": "3494e1c2-bb2e-43f6-b04f-e7651a956efc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/pin-landscape-assessment-phase-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "PiN landscape assessment phase 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/pin-landscape-assessment-phase-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e976e4785b656edc67cd1f857c5ed1dd6fc936bb19a937f0f02f0e8e0707721"}}, "hash": "4e976e4785b656edc67cd1f857c5ed1dd6fc936bb19a937f0f02f0e8e0707721", "text": "the landscape assessment process. In practice, this would mean sharing data collection responsibilities, as well as the data collected with team members through use of a common shared folder on the Union Portal (see below). The coordinator may involve those close to the ground in collection of data that is accessible only locally, e.g., in gov- ernment or NGO offices and information available only in local languages. Likewise, if data is archived at sites distant from the landscape assessment area, team members may need to be located at these sites, or choose to contact oth- ers in partner networks who are able to access this data. Membership of the team in the early stages of PiN develop- ment may be shaped by the need to better communicate decisions with the appropriate constituencies. Coordination of PiN development is guided by the Steering Group, while landscape assessments are coordinated and implemented by project teams (see figure 3). The project team is likely to contain members of both the Steering Group and Re- gional Working Group, at least in early stages of PiN de- velopment. Regional Working Groups may contain IUCN regional staff, members or partners with knowledge of re- gional issues more generally and project sites in particular. Communication between these different levels is necessary in the scoping phase, following which, responsibilities for data collection and analysis during Phase I of the landscape assessment lie with the project team, which can work rel- atively independently of other levels. The results of the ISA (synthesis) should be shared with both the Steering Group and Regional Working Group at which point decisions on how to proceed in Phase II can be taken collaboratively. 2 This is an issue that will require more detailed attention in future discussions. Members of the assessment team may be able to access data that is difficult for the coordinator to access if distributed in collections on/off site and not available on the internet. Proj- ect team members, together with other team levels can be instrumental in activating a wider network of IUCN Members, Commissions and partners (partner networks) in order to find people who may hold data relevant to the project that they are able and willing to contribute publicly. This data will even- tually be contributed through a dedicated platform designed to crowdsource data (planned as part of the PiN secondary data module). Figure 4 suggests how the project team and partner networks may be directly involved in filling in these gaps through, 1) desk review of available data, 2) compiling data sources from partners, and 3) employing crowdsourcing tools to sources data from wider partner networks. \ufffd Figure 3: Hierarchy of project responsibilities. PiN WORKING PAPER 8 | PiN LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT PHASE 1 2. sCOPINg OF PRObLEms ANd gOALs The initial scoping section of the ISA report must provide a rationale for the site-based study, of its participants and of the landscape assessment area. Initial community meetings to form the assessment team will help to define goals and vision, but a defining feature for PiN in its current state of development is that assessment teams work alongside or within the structure of existing on-the-ground projects. The assessment team thus needs to nest within, and indeed pro- vide support for existing projects. The following set of ques- tions can guide the process of scoping problems and goals: \u2022\ufffd Why is PiN being used at this site? \u2022\ufffd Who are the regional and local project partners? \u2022\ufffd What are the main problems to be addressed? \u2022\ufffd What are the main objectives of the assessment (e.g. planning for climate change adaptability, land use cor- ridors, etc.)? This section should describe threats, trends and pressures that affect people and ecosystems. Local project imple- mentation experts and regional IUCN office staff may be involved at this stage due to their knowledge of policies that guide decision-making at higher levels. These team mem- bers may also identify useful indicators used regionally and nationally, and data available in policy documents. An ad- ditional advantage to working this way with regional teams and local experts is that they will be able to provide informa- tion on how previous projects in the area have scoped prob- lems, and how project governance has worked. Experience held regionally and locally will also be important for defining protocols for primary data collection, and may have project governance and policy impact implications. 3. dELImITATION OF THE AssEssmENT AREA The boundaries of the assessment area may be defined in terms of ecological variables, e.g., to reflect an ecolog- Figure 4: Illustration of data flows for filling in secondary data", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3932bbe-8bc9-42bf-8935-8ccbba8ac67d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3932bbe-8bc9-42bf-8935-8ccbba8ac67d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/pin-landscape-assessment-phase-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "PiN landscape assessment phase 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/pin-landscape-assessment-phase-1", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3f57142883c4b472b6f6d4e70d5ed5e3eda518937cc87abee796ce2f6ab57ec"}}, "hash": "e3f57142883c4b472b6f6d4e70d5ed5e3eda518937cc87abee796ce2f6ab57ec", "text": "gaps \ufffd ical area such as a watershed, a particular ecosystem or the range of a species of interest (Springate-Baginski et al. 2009). They may be shaped socially and culturally, i.e., the area in which a particular livelihood or cultural practice of a given group of people is undertaken; or in terms of planning areas or political-administrative factors, including an indige- nous territory or planning unit over which local communities may exercise control. The delimitation of the area may then be brought in line with agreement of the assessment team on a set of problems, goals and protocols. The study area description in the ISA report should clearly define the study area boundaries, referring to existing maps and documents when possible. This section of the report will require team members to assemble maps and spatial data layers from government repositories, other institutions/ partners, and from open data sources. The ISA may refer to existing maps of planning boundaries, ecological classi- fications, land use and development plans, and protected areas planning documents, and might make references to ethnographic data to describe people, group and territories in order to describe the study area. Maps and map layers need to be collected and stored digitally. It may be conve- nient to keep a table or spreadsheet updated with a list of map layers available to the assessment team. 4. gATHERINg ANd EvALuATION OF sECONdARy dATA Current and potential use of Nature Phases I and II together provide a comprehensive assess- ment of people\u2019s interrelationships with nature with a focus on understanding material use of nature, including flows of services from biodiversity \u2013 from genes to ecosystems, wa- ter, and potentially other services and the factors that shape and constrain this use. Phase I aims to generate baseline socio-economic and ecological data but also plays a funda- mental role in the landscape assessment by collecting and presenting information regarding known uses of nature, ac- cess of local communities to natural resources, and knowl- edge about conservation status of species, ecosystems and genetic resources that underlie the potential of nature to con- tribute to human livelihoods and wellbeing. In this respect, the PiN ISA guides the assessment team beyond commonly researched questions focused on current use of biodiversity by including questions on potential uses (e.g., of species, ge- netic resources, habitats). As such, data collection in phase I is structured around the importance of understanding current and potential uses of nature that can influence livelihoods and wellbeing of communities. The ISA aims to find and anal- yse documentation on interrelationships between people and nature in the past and present, and also documentation of known uses of nature that is potentially available within the assessment area, where actual uses may relate to a species PiN WORKING PAPER PiN LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT PHASE 1 | 9 or other level of biodiversity in places geographically removed from the landscape assessment site. The ISA analysis is designed to get the landscape assess- ment project team thinking about the reasons that biodiver- sity that is known from the secondary data to have potential to meet human needs is not being realized in a particular assessment area. The critical feature of this approach is that it should help communities themselves identify specific impacts of different interventions in terms of this potential, while recognizing that some changes in ecosystems that degrade biodiversity may improve wellbeing in other cases (e.g. by bringing electrical energy from hydro dam or ex- panding agriculture) (Myers et al. 2013). The relationship between current use and potential use of biodiversity is articulated through four analytical catego- ries: availability, stability, access and perception (David- son-Hunt et al. 2016). Current use of nature in a study area (Uc) is currently defined as the total number of species or subspecies and agricultural landraces currently used by members of a community, including all ages, households, and individuals. Potential use (U) is defined as the number of species, subspecies and landraces in an area that have a documented use in the secondary literature or global datasets, regardless of whether they are currently used by community members at the time of assessment.3 Figure 5: use, trade and livelihoods data schema for assessment scale (figure provided by Kevin smith, species Programme, Cambridge, uK) While the variable U is calculated based on existing second- ary data, the variable Uc can only be verified using primary data collection procedures undertaken during phase II.

Secondary sources on uses of nature may include ethnobiolo- gy papers and datasets containing accounts of species use or inventories of species used, reports from previous projects, and planning and management documents. Ethnographic literature may contribute to an understanding of use in terms of the ana- lytical categories described below, and detailed narratives may be referenced. Notably, IUCN\u2019s Species Information Service (SIS) stores species use data in the use, trade and livelihoods tabs. Species use data is stored either globally by species ac- cording to end use, or within Wild Harvest Records, which con- stitute local reports on species use (see figure 5). Table 1 makes note of the potential importance of a selec- tion of SIS variables for the ISA that may be stored in either the global-level summary section or in local harvest records of the use, trade and livelihoods tabs. These \u2018tabs\u2019 of the SIS are not yet stable and further development in the future means these categories may change. 3 A similar variable may be employed to characterise use of abiotic parts of nature, e.g., water and potentially other services.

The concern is whether PiN landscape studies can interface easily with a database (SIS) that is organized around species, and not around ter- ritories. Regarding the ISA, a simple answer would be that the assessment team requires a list of species with known uses that may be found within the assessment area. In practical terms, it is difficult if not impossible to derive a list of species that may be found within the area at the time of the assessment due to variability in populations and ranges. However, databases and datasets may be used to build a list that can then be verified during Phase II, which draws on participatory biodiversity assessment methodology. A list of species that is potentially available locally may be drawn from 1) occurrence datasets, 2) Red List spatial data (spe- cies range estimates), and 3) Ethnobiology datasets for the area of interest. A combination of these sources would likely yield the best results. Information available through the SIS Habitats & Ecosys- tems and Occurrence modules, and Red List Spatial data on species and subspecies ranges may be brought into the ISA to narrow down the list of species with potential use. Suitable occurrence datasets external to SIS, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) can be used to collate lists of species with potential local use. The sug- gested methodological workflow for understanding this re- lationship is illustrated in figure 6 and involves: 1. Compiling comprehensive data on documented uses of nature, including species/subspecies and landraces that are likely present in the study area; 2. Collecting and reporting on variables that shape or me- diate use of species, or that constrain or prevent poten- tial sustainable uses from being fully realized; 3. Identifying threats and factors that shape use of na- ture, including conservation status of species and local landraces, and of the habitats and ecosystems they rely upon.

It is thus beyond the scope of the team to be exhaustive in research. Rather, the ISA should aim to reveal a range of issues regarding the abil- ity of people and communities to benefit from biodiversity. Access Access describes the ability of an individual or group to benefit from biodiversity, whether through access to ma- terials, persons, institutions or symbols. This includes who has access according to normative frameworks, legislation, action plans, planning and management frameworks as well as through customary or traditional rights and authority. PiN takes a rights-based approach and as such, work on access would need to identify rights of access to resourc- es, e.g. property ownership or common property rules with regard to wetlands, forests, fisheries. These refer to legal frameworks, including customary law. The ISA needs to identify national and international legal and normative frameworks that apply to area in the most basic case of application. An understanding of normative frame- works may include understanding international conventions that have been ratified by the national government, incorpo- ration of international conventions into national law, under- standing of infringements of conventions and national laws. Voluntary standards signed by private companies operation- al in the assessment area may also be scrutinized in order to understand duties that companies may bear in relation to local communities and their environments. The relevance of specific instruments and standards in national contexts may be explored, e.g. UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples and CBD, as well as other frameworks that regulate or restrict access to biodiversity and land (e.g., protected areas management documents, planning documents). In developing the ISA methodology, more attention needs to be dedicated regarding assessment of national, regional and local level standards and rights. Gonzalo Oviedo (Se- nior Advisor, IUCN Social Policy Programme) has recom- mended a three step approach to the assessment of rights. The first task should be to examine the relevant (applicable) legal frameworks to understand the existing normative pro- visions, followed by an analysis of the institutional frame- works, to understand roles, responsibilities, capacities and accountability. Subsequently, the analysis should focus on implementation, looking at the situation of stakeholders, with particular attention to vulnerable groups, including the situation of women. Data on equity, i.e. distribution of ben- efits by gender, income, ethnic group, and other relevant groups may be used where available. With an interest in how interrelationships between people and nature are shaped by social, economic and institution- al factors, we can broaden our focus from rights to abili- ties of people to benefit from nature. Abilities encompass a broader set of governance issues, including customary norms and traditional knowledge, constraining or enabling factors for collective action and decision-making. Project team members may have access to data available through public planning and management offices, through NGOs, public offices, census data, etc. Rights on paper will often differ from rights practiced or rights understood to exist on paper. For example, it will be important to understand a range of rights \u2013 both formal and customary, including: \u2022\ufffd Land tenure (gender stratified) and resource access rights (beyond formal/legal property rights). \u2022\ufffd Any bioprospecting activities and IPR in a place, and terms for access and benefits sharing from these activities \u2022\ufffd rights to harvesting and cultivation within protected areas \u2022\ufffd Rights to use of fresh water \u2022\ufffd Decision-making rights Gonzalo Oviedo has suggested the following rights catego- ries for assessment during an ISA: a.

The ISA should also flag situations where there are contested or inequitable claims to lands and resources or where cus- tomary systems are not currently recognised or understood. In such situations, the ISA may act as a warning system that raises the need for further action on access in phase II. Availability Availability refers to the quantity and quality of biodiversity necessary to satisfy a need, being free from adverse sub- stances. Information on land use, land quality, air and water quantity and quality are desirable for better understanding the availability of species and its suitability for consump- tion. The availability variable effectively helps link ecology to social variables. Availability concerns the presence of a species and the ability of people to find and use a species, subspecies or variety within the landscape mosaic of the assessment area. Occurrence data from diverse sources, including the Glob- al Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the Occurrence Module of the SIS, and protected areas documents may provide information on availability. The SIS Occurrence Module can be used to determine the absolute size of the range, or endemic status, of a given species known to oc- cur in the assessment area. For instance, the SIS database may hold useful information in coded habitat types includ- ing suitable, marginal and possible habitats for a given spe- cies. Land cover types, e.g. based on GLCC 2000 codes or local classification systems may additionally be used to explore occurrences and availability of a species within cer- tain landscapes. stability Stability refers to variability and risks to availability over time. As with availability, this variable also helps link ecology to social variables. PiN landscape assessments require data on conservation status of species and wild and domesti- cated (crop and livestock) populations. Information about threats, risks and drivers as they impact individual species and the ecosystems they rely on for habitats may be avail- able from a variety of sources, but key sources are already held by IUCN. Risks to species can be assessed using the SIS and the Red List of Threatened Ecosystems. The status of ecosystems that support species with known uses to people can be looked at through the use of the Red List of Ecosystems. The IUCN SA identifies an adaptable set of data concerning ecosystem dimensions, including di- versity and quality of ecosystems, modification, conversion, degradation. The Red List of Ecosystems, as well as other sources in the scientific literature and reports may contain data on threats to particular ecosystems. IUCN does not aggregate national red list data on risks to species, as national lists do not necessarily follow IUCN cri- teria. At present there is an unofficial national red list da- tabase maintained by IUCN Red List partner, Zoological Society of London, however this database only compiles available national assessment of risks to species. Additional richness in terms of data on risks to species at regional or local levels may be sourced from project reports. In order to assess local threats to stability, it is necessary to find data, if available, on local threats to availability and stability of supply of benefits, including development plans that would reduce the area of suitable habitat. Information in the SIS Habitats and Ecology module may help assess how land use choices may affect the stability of a species. Land and resource use, including planning scenarios are of particular interest to the assessment team, including plans related to the energy, materials, waste, and natural resource sector activities (e.g. agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining and hunting). Secondary data on the communities con- cerned should ideally be collected using the most local-level data available. Perception Perception shapes use through knowledge and discourse. The perception variable looks at the importance of species harvest, its consumption and use as culturally acceptable or desirable. Species may be available and accessible, but may not be locally used due to perception. Potentially, data mining of publicly available ethobiology journals, documents and databases (e.g. eHRAF) could yield results on percep- tion. This data may be of interest for communities engaged in data repatriation efforts, however, for the purposes of the ISA, perception may be flagged as having an influence on use, but a more involved analysis of this variable should be kept for phase II.

The following domains have been stabilised: in- come, medicine and health, food and nutrition, energy, shel- ter, trade, and ceremony. PiN domains have not yet been set in stone, and may change as policy discourses change. This set of domains has been designed to link information on bio- diversity to consideration of multiple dimensions of poverty and wellbeing for people who use biodiversity. A good way to approach the PiN domains at the ISA phase is to focus on finding data on projects and interventions relevant to the domains listed, then to review species uses and think about where publicly available data supports biodiversity-based solutions to existing problems locally. A number of hierarchical standardized schemata exist for categorising use data for various purposes. For instance, the Kew Economic Botany unit has created a standard for categories of use.4 Similarly, the SIS has adopted a stan- dard for use data. The SIS use categories and the Econom- ic Botany Data Standard are considered in table 2, which proposes how these categories can be compared to the PiN domains. These standards have been developed to multiple levels or depths with progressively more detailed description of use at lower levels. It will be necessary to collapse data on use into PiN domains while ensuring that data is stored in its original format such that other domains may be studied. Similarly, data taken directly from the sec- ondary literature should retain as much information on use as possible, thus, original narrative data on use and relative categories, if present, should be preserved. Many categories of use listed in table 2 may not fit directly into PiN domains, however, each of these empty categories represents potential trade and income. More information is necessary on trade of products from species in order to cor- rectly assess use in the trade and income domains. The SIS stores information on scale of trade (from local to interna- tional markets) along with use categories for both local de- tailed wild harvest records and global species assessments. The scale of trade can inform PiN assessments by showing which species may be of commercial importance, although information specific to trade within the assessment area may not exist. For example, it would be possible to simply flag species with a known market value (locally, nationally, internationally) during the ISA in order to make choices in terms of which value chains may be of interest to consider during phase II. Similarly, the ceremony domain is absent in the standards in table 2. Yet reference to ceremonial uses may be found in ethnobiology datasets, necessitating de- velopment of a \u2018ceremony\u2019 section of the SIS use tab. The project team may choose to focus within a particular policy domain for the purposes of the project (e.g., impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security). However, digital workflow tools that are planned for PiN will allow us- ers to rapidly assess uses across other domains in order to identify the potential of biodiversity to address multiple poli- cy areas. For instance, if a PiN assessment is being carried out alongside a local project to restore forested landscapes, a rapid analysis across use domains may identify species that may be useful for food and nutrition, income, shelter and medicine that may be replaced instead with species for restoration that fulfil a narrower set of local needs. secondary data on social and economic dimensions For the scoping of problems and goals within the assess- ment area, maps or map layers are needed for adminis- trative boundaries, protected areas and development plan- ning. The key is identifying how this data may contribute to a better understanding of use of nature with the scoping of the study in mind. The IUCN SA identifies health and popu- lation data, wealth data (economy, income, material goods, infrastructure, basic needs such as food, water, clothing, shelter) as areas of relevance for collection of secondary data. The social and economic dimensions for understand- ing of livelihoods and wellbeing suggested for PiN in Suich et al. (2016a) are education, employment, energy, food and nutrition, health, income, water and sanitation, asset ownership and social and cultural relations (core domains). Locally defined dimensions not included in this list may be added if they are seen to be critical to the project team. Demographic and economic data on assets, including household wealth, any census or household survey data, health and nutrition (nutrition surveys), ethnic, gender equality and equity data may be collected and collated.

The report might be or- ganised into the following sections: 1. Executive summary 2. Scope of the assessment/objectives 3. Methodology 4. Assessment area description: boundaries, ecology, so- cio-economic trends and governance 5. Analysis of potential biodiversity use (U) by PiN domain and habitat/ecology 6. Analysis of variables that shape and constrain use 7. Gaps in secondary data and proposal for primary data collection The ISA contributes to the biodiversity use metric, current use/potential use (Uc/U), drawing the variable, U, from the ISA secondary data assessment. By comprehensively com- piling and analysing data on potential use of species (U) and mediating variables that may constrain current use (Uc), the ISA may complement other methods and project-based in- dicators identified in the initial stages of project planning. As such, PiN methodology may contribute the biodiversity use metric to monitoring of project-specific indicators over time. Other more specific metrics may be derived or suggested by the ISA report in order to monitor change under policy domains of interest. Some suggestions might include: \u2022\ufffd The number of species making important nutritional contributions to childhood and maternal health; \u2022\ufffd The number of households with prevalent malnutrition; \u2022\ufffd The status of ecosystems most critically important for provisioning of important species within PiN domains; \u2022\ufffd The total number of farmer\u2019s varieties/landraces in use; \u2022\ufffd The total area accessible to households with different socio-economic status for harvesting, including forests, coastal areas; \u2022\ufffd Change in the sizes of land holdings of households over time. using cumulative reporting from IsA results for metrics on data coverage and completeness of existing databases and portals PiN is interested in working with the use, trade and liveli- hoods sections of the SIS which store data on global uses of species. One simple indicator related to species use data coverage that can be calculated for each PiN landscape as- sessment is the number of species for which there is avail- able information on one or more species uses within the SIS. It would also be feasible to create a metric for species at a site for which conservation status has been assessed (thus informing PiN teams on stability). The use, trade and livelihoods sections of the SIS have not yet been populated for the majority of species in the SIS, so it will be useful to have data available on species use cov- erage to guide future work in filling data gaps. Species use coverage may be further disaggregated to domain level, providing a metric for monitoring SIS coverage relevant to specific policy domains. Some global metrics already exist that PiN may want to relate to in this regard. For example, on food and nutrition, an indicator is being developed by FAO for species for which food composition data exists. This metric is focused on monitoring availability of data on food biodiversity.5 PiN has only committed to working with openly available data that is licensed for open access use or is in the public domain. As such, these metrics would only apply to data that is already openly accessible and for this reason, may also help steer campaigns to increase avail- ability and accessibility of global open data. For cumulative ISAs, it should be possible to disaggregate metrics by, for example, geographic regions or cultures. This information can then be used to inform IUCN and various partner initiatives on critical geographical gaps in available data. It is envisioned that through iterations of landscape assessments at different sites, new global or regional data sources will be discovered and put to use, making future assessments progressively less time consuming (i.e., less time will need to be dedicated to searching for, and extract- ing data from existing sources), and more complete (i.e., fewer uses of biodiversity and threats would be overlooked due to data availability and accessibility issues. 5 The open access Biodiversity Indicators Partnership nutrition indicator for biodiversity (http://www.bipindicators.net/nutirtionindicators) draws directly on FAO INFOODS databases.

Documents will need to be labelled using standardized tags in order to facilitate their retrieval using the Portal\u2019s search function. Suggested tags are listed in box 1. There are some disadvantages to file storage on the Portal. Access to these files is limited to those with access to the Portal. Portal file type issues Many types of documents may be stored on the Portal, but others cannot. Reports on governance, socio-economic analysis, indigenous/local knowledge; plans for protected areas and community or regional development; and scien- tific literature, including peer reviewed papers, book chap- ters published in scientific literature may be stored in com- mon document formats. Online documents, articles, maps and databases may be referred to by their url/uri or doi. Be- cause the portal restricts file types that can be stored, this folder might contain images, e.g. maps in jpeg of pdf for- mat, metadata for GIS data repositories, but not most spa- tial data formats. While maps may be stored on the Portal in popular image formats, raw spatial data may not. Database tables may be downloaded as excel files to be stored in the portal folder, or a document containing searches performed on a specific database may be saved. TEAm duTIEs ANd TImELINEs ISA project teams that include members of different organi- sations and organisational units will need to make decisions on budget and time requirements in order to perform an ISA. For instance, it will be necessary to budget for costs associated with the time of Species Programme staff to perform an SIS data extract on species found in the area, and for staff from the regional office or local project team for collection and collation of data sources. An ISA coordinator, whose duty it is to compile data into the database and over- see authorship of the ISA report needs to be chosen and budget dedicated toward their work. Table 5 estimates timelines and costs for completion of the ISA. Five weeks are thought necessary for research and re- port authoring. A complete ISA may be produced with esti- mated total of 41 days of work, distributed among different team over a five-week period. These estimates exclude initial meetings and activities needed to come to agreement on location and partner- ships to be entered into in order to get the project of the ground. Time and budget estimates will also likely change as progress is made on the PiN secondary data module, which is required to streamline secondary data research, analysis and document storage. It is assumed that all ma- jor tasks listed in the table below can be undertaken from the desk and no additional international travel is necessary. Local travel may be added to the budget in order to meet with data holders or access physical documents that are not available digitally. Finally, additional time and budget must be calculated if it is thought that team members require more face-to-face con- tact (with stakeholders) to develop the scope and objectives of the study. Face-to-face time to develop protocols for pri- mary data collection is also not estimated, as this stage will be dependent on context.

PiN WORKING PAPER PiN LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT PHASE 1 | 21 COmPLEmENTARITy OF PiN IsA wITH IuCN sITuATION ANALysIs During early methodological workshops, it was suggested that PiN adopt the term \u2018situation analysis\u2019, as it reflects a set of IUCN project methodologies already in use.6 The IUCN situation analysis (IUCN SA) can take two paths, re- sulting in either a basic or a comprehensive situation anal- ysis. While the basic IUCN SA aims to create an overview of the context, strategy and partners, the comprehensive situation analysis draws on a more rigorous set of sustain- ability assessment procedures and is explicit about use of its humans and ecosystems framework. It calls on the project team to establish social, economic and ecological baselines, and requires the team to choose indicators and performance criteria to track status and trends in ecosys- tems and human wellbeing. Figure 7 illustrates the method- ological workflow of a comprehensive IUCN SA.7 The choice of generalized social, ecological and economic indicators and performance criteria is beyond the scope of PiN, but may be complementary to ISA methodology de- pending on the needs of the project team. Reference exam- Figure 7: Representation of IuCN comprehensive situation analysis methodology 6 The document describing the IUCN Situation Analysis approach can be found at the following link for the basic SA: http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/approach_and_method.pdf. For the comprehensive SA (PPT learning module): http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/resource_kit_c_eng.pdf. In order to avoid confusion, PiN phase 1 will be referred to in this docu- ment as the interdisciplinary situation analysis (SA), while the accepted IUCN situation analysis approach outlined in the linked documents is understood to comprise a set of objectives and methodological frameworks to be considered in parallel. 7 http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/resource_kit_c_eng.pdf \ufffd ples of a write-up of a brief basic SA can be found Garc\u00eda et al. (2010), while a comprehensive IUCN SA methodology can be found in the IUCN SA on East and Southeast Asian intertidal habitats (MacKinnon et al. 2012). Whether the PiN ISA develops as an \u2018add on\u2019 to the tradi- tional IUCN SA approach, becomes integrated within ex- isting assessment methodologies across IUCN projects, or evolves into a set of stand-alone tools or modules is an important point for future discussion. For now, the scope and objectives of the PiN ISA differ from those of the ac- cepted IUCN SA approach. Secondary data requirements differ significantly in that PiN aims to assess a set of vari- ables that shape potential local uses of nature. For PiN landscape assessments, it is clear that specific PiN ISA approaches will replace the existing IUCN SA approaches as currently packaged.

IUCN is a membership Union composed of both government and civil society organisations. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 15,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. CEESP, the IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy, is an inter-disciplinary network of profes- sionals whose mission is to act as a source of advice on the environmental, economic, social and cultural factors that affect natural resources and biological diversity and to provide guidance and support towards effective policies and practices in environmental conservation and sustainable development. The People in Nature (PiN) Knowledge Basket is an initiative established by the IUCN programme of work and whose development is led by a steering group composed of representatives from CEESP, IUCN secretariat and IUCN members. As described in the 2017-2020 CEESP mandate, PiN will promote learning to improve our understanding of how nature contributes to local livelihoods and well-being.

93 8 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Illegal trade and the trafficking of Tiger Panthera tigris, as well as their parts, products and derivatives, and the poaching which supplies it, is the most immediate threat to the survival of wild Tigers. In April 2016, the WWF released a new minimum estimate of over 3 890 Tigers Panthera tigris in the wild. This figure is based on national Tiger surveys which employed more rigorous methods of sampling compared to previous surveys, as well as estimations at a national level. The information also shows that the known Tiger range has declined by 42% between 2006 and 2014, attributed to actual decline in Tigers as well as a reflection of better data collection methods and increase in Tiger survey efforts. While current knowledge on the range and number of Tigers has improved, the most immediate threat to the survival of wild Tigers persists. This is the continued persistence of illegal trade and trafficking in Tiger parts, products and derivatives, and the poaching which supplies this trade. Demand also shows no signs of abating, and the role of captive Tiger facilities has become a highly relevant factor. In 2010 and 2013, TRAFFIC produced two systematic reports analysing Tiger seizures from 11 and 12 Tiger range countries (TRCs) respectively, which described the trafficking patterns. This current report presents an updated situational analysis which, assesses seizure information over a 16-year period from January 2000 to December 2015 for all 13 TRCs, using a combination of government acquired data and open source media reports. The data was analysed for overall trends for the full 16 years as well as for four quarterly periods during this duration: 2000-2003 (Q1), 2004- 2007 (Q2), 2008-2011 (Q3) and 2012-2015 (Q4). The objective of this report is to summarize the current trade dynamics for Tigers at a global level, in addition to assessing trade characteristics for each country with selected key considerations at a country-specific level. Practical recommendations are also provided for the consideration of the TRCs, stakeholders and -other actors at international, regional and national levels. Over the 16-year period between 2000 and 2015, a total of 801 Tiger seizures were reported across the 13 Tiger range countries, equivalent to an estimated minimum of 1 755 Tigers seized. On average, 50 seizures were reported annually, equivalent to a minimum of 110 Tigers. Compared to TRAFFIC\u2019s previous analysis in 2013 where 654 seizures were recorded from 2000-2012, representing 1 425 Tigers seized, the 2016 data shows an increase of 147 Tigers, which reflects an additional 330 Tigers seized. It needs to be mentioned that some of this increase can be ascribed to the inclusion of data from more countries in the 2012 and 2015 analyses. For example, Cambodia did not previously report seizure incidents for the year 2000, and therefore did not feature in TRAFFIC\u2019s analysis in 2010 or 2013. While China, Indonesia and Thailand were observed to be the top three countries that demonstrated a consistent increase in seizures in each four-year period quarter of the 2000 to 2015 timeframe, only Indonesia and Thailand show an increasing number of Tigers seized each quarter. For instance, Thailand seized 166 Tigers from 2012-2015, compared to the 64 Tigers seized from 2008-2011; it must be noted that the seizure of 102 Tigers from the Tiger temple in 2015 is the reason behind this increase. Indeed, this analysis highlights the prominent role of Tiger seizures from captive facilities, including farms, zoos and tourist locations. At least 297 of the 1755 tigers (17%) are those that have been reportedly seized from or originated from captive facilities, crucially though this percentage rises to an estimated 30% 9 (or 154 Tigers) for the most recent quarter (2012-2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6f7a43a-7a57-4ee6-bb7e-75301be0cb9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6f7a43a-7a57-4ee6-bb7e-75301be0cb9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ead804f4caa10ceac6559522c786c5c3693a406a7aa0c592f1e6c2c21833eef"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a3db01e-acec-4d79-8c9a-0a4bfda82720", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a728755c1a9a2aae82e4e8b5e27af8a6e7500bf16c8535ae1582473cc3b282f"}}, "hash": "5db8db933a9e56cd6646fbf0f4945e66f7ac5a8d47cdbf6484d5f21a1f60b554", "text": "Ten of the 13 TRCs reported seizures of live Tigers, totalling 263 live Tigers seized over the 16-year review period, with Thailand and Viet Nam seizing the highest numbers.

Overall, the highest number of seizures was reported by India, accounting for 44% (355) of all reported seizures. However, statistical analysis of its short-term data indicates that the relative proportion of seizures in India, compared to other TRCs, has significantly declined over this period. Moreover, there was no statistically significant change in the relative proportion of seizures for any of the other countries during 2000-2015. In the analysis of Tiger commodity type in trade, the data show that skins \u2013 seized in complete parts, representing one Tiger \u2013 were the commodity most often seized, with a minimum of 758 skins seized during the 16-year period analysed. Statistical analysis of the combined trend for all TRCs, however, indicate a significant decrease in the seizure of skins. Notably, while the first quarter of the 2010-2015 timeframe saw 214 Tiger skins seized, this number declined in each subsequent quarter, with a minimum of 146 skins recorded seized in the most recent quarter of 2012-2015. This decline, however, could have been due to reporting issues rather than to an actual decline in Tiger skins being seized. For instance, India\u2019s reported seizures of skins have declined drastically since 2009. At a Tiger range level, seizures of bones in the most recent quarter (2012-2015), however, were significantly higher than in the preceding three quarters. Similarly, the amount of Tiger bone wine detected in trade \u2013 mostly seized in China and Viet Nam - was higher in the most recent quarter than in the preceding quarters. Alarmingly, more Tiger canines were seized in the 2012-2015 quarter than the three previous quarters combined, and this may signal a greater demand for these as items of jewellery. The huge disparity in how each of the TRCs report seizures makes meaningful and accurate analysis exceedingly difficult, particularly regional level analysis. The lack of a systematic centralized reporting system underlies this problem. While the data shows both the number of seizures and number of Tigers seized across Asia increasing throughout the 2000- 2015 review period, this is not consistent with national level trends, and may reflect changes in reporting practices rather than anything substantive. Analysis of density estimation to determine significant \u2018hotspots\u2019 of activity shows prominent clusters on the India-Nepal border and the India-Bangladesh border. Given that almost half the seizures had been reported in India, there will inevitably be a greater prevalence of hotspots there. These clusters are evident in the data for all four quarters, which indicates that these areas should be a target for concentrated law enforcement activities and investigations aimed at 10 identifying and dismantling trade networks. Seizure information also points to other hotspots \u2013 for instance, northern Viet Nam around Ha Noi, and to a lesser extent Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas in Malaysia. Analysis of Tiger trade routes, from point of origin to final destination, also highlighted some interesting findings \u2013 most notably relating to two seizures in 2015 that occurred in China and Cambodia of Tiger parts (as well as Rhino horn and ivory) originating in Africa. COMMON THEMES AND RECOMMENDATIONS The analysis of the seizure data reinforces the reality that current collective efforts at the global level are insufficient to stem the threats posed by trade. Furthermore, seizures very often represent only a proportion of the illegal trade, meaning that actual trade levels are suspected to be much higher. This assessment identifies the critical elements in national-level trade dynamics across several key Tiger range countries, such as the demand for skins for taxidermy purposes (trophy) and bones for traditional medicinal purposes. Each of the problems and issues described highlight an urgent need to address the enabling conditions that allow the Tiger trade to continue at such high levels. The application of the seizure data analysis, contextualized with up-to-date information on the trade, will allow for the development of recommendations designed to solve this problem. There are clear indications of a number of common themes that exist across most, if not all, TRCs that need to be tackled strategically to achieve meaningful impact. Every one of these themes has been highlighted in the past as requiring specific intervention by Parties of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), particularly TRCs.

Addressing these issues requires that countries, particularly TRCs, make substantial efforts aimed at: 1) improving law enforcement effectiveness, legislation and regulation; 2) captive breeding; and 3) reducing demand and consumption. 1. LAW ENFORCEMENT, LEGISLATION AND REGULATION The persistently high number of seizures, involving an equally high number of whole Tigers in trade, is rooted in the lack of intelligence-led law enforcement efforts that can lead to successful convictions. Parties should utilize the results of seizure data analysis and mapping, such as the work done by TRAFFIC, to guide their law enforcement interventions, alongside their own intelligence and inter-agency efforts. TRAFFIC urges TRCs to share information and intelligence on seizures and poaching incidences. They should also share information regarding Tiger skin seizures to enable the determination of Tiger provenance, as this can provide a better understanding of criminal networks and their trade patterns including for example, the routes used for Tiger trafficking. This recommendation is closely associated with the need for countries to establish a systematic and 11 standardized database to store forensic markers and photographic information, at minimum. This will aid investigations and law enforcement efforts, as endorsed by the 17th Conference of Parties (CoP) to CITES in October 2016. Collaboration at the regional level is needed, particularly at hotspots and border areas identified in this report. The role of bilateral co-operation and multilateral law enforcement networks such as the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN), is extremely pertinent. Collaboration with partners at the international level, including INTERPOL through the National Central Bureaus (NCBs), in co-ordinating and supporting investigations can strengthen efforts on this front, particularly in pursuing nominal information about the perpetrators. If the criminal activity involves businesses and / or corporations, investigations by TRCs and other CITES Parties should consider the possibility of money-laundering operations, and prosecutorial actions should be pursued under the relevant legislation. The 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES also saw the adoption of CITES\u2019 first resolution on anti-corruption. Corruption is inherently difficult to quantify, monitor and prevent; direct links between this seizure analysis and corruption cannot be made. However, any effort to eliminate poaching and Tiger trafficking must consider anti-corruption measures that accompany intelligence- led investigations, prosecution and successful convictions. While many TRCs have laws to address corruption, they are seldom used to tackle wildlife crime. Such efforts must be considered in any law enforcement effort, perhaps in tandem with anti-money laundering investigations where such cases are present, without which organised criminal networks perpetuating this problem will not be eradicated. While analysis of seizure information provides valuable insights into developments at the global level, efforts to evaluate the progress made by TRCs had been hampered by the non-systematic manner in which seizures are reported to CITES, compounded by the overall low rate of reporting. Pursuant to CITES CoP Decisions 16.68 to 16.70 on Asian big cats (Felidae spp.), all TRCs are required to \u201cprovide information on incidents of poaching of and illegal trade in all Asian big cat species, including their parts and derivatives, which will enable the compilation of a report for the law enforcement community\u201d as well as \u201cgather information on incidents of poaching of and illegal trade in all Asian big cats since the beginning of 2010, undertake an analysis of the information, and prepare a report for the law enforcement community to be circulated in a restricted fashion to relevant enforcement agencies and range States\u201d. This has however clearly not been implemented fully yet, given the paucity of feedback from TRCs to the CITES Secretariat based on Notification to the Parties No. 2013/037 regarding Implementation of Resolution 12.5 (Rev. CoP 16). The notification sent to Parties in 2016 regarding the New Annual Illegal Trade Report (No. 2016/007) provides a simple template for the Parties to report all information regarding illegal trade. Action taken by TRCs in a timely manner would aid efforts to better understand the levels of trade across TRCs, especially when assessed with a standard reporting template. This can be useful in assessing progress at the national, regional and international levels, including the identification of additional support for law enforcement efforts. 12 Law enforcement can only be effective if legal tools are in place to regulate and control the trade in Tigers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a870fb9-ce57-4627-a6cf-d8b1bc0418ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a870fb9-ce57-4627-a6cf-d8b1bc0418ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95048de0db50832d745f690af7ff3806a3089f3cd29e3bc4bd566da32743bc7a"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8cd6531-123c-4758-994a-ffa42b59828f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b4db7900cab9639c4f8ba41deba3d1a4ca1d80c3d007943115e7559eee8471a"}}, "hash": "b93963fdcb8d15b699770b479ef8ca77c67eacac0daa41c1ea585bd7e18cd2b0", "text": "When legislation is weak or have gaps, for example if they do not protect non-native CITES-listed species, CITES becomes ineffective.

However, the legislation in some of these seven countries have significant gaps, such as those concerning the regulation of captive facilities, and the lack of protection on the use and trade in non-native species within the country. TRAFFIC therefore proposes a comprehensive re-assessment of the effectiveness of CITES-implementing legislation for Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam as a matter of priority, including a re-examination of their categorization under the CITES National Legislation Project. These countries have been selected based on gaps and weaknesses in legislative provisions, such as low penalties and deterrents to illegal activity. This re-assessment should include at minimum, a reconsideration of the following areas: 1) protection against the hunting, use of and trade in all Tigers (including all sub-species) which effectively affords protection to wild Tigers across all TRCs and allows TRCs to fully and adequately implement CITES, 2) adequacy of penalties provided by law, 3) captive breeding regulation ( for all Tiger species including at the sub- species level), 4) registration of privately-held stocks and the prevention of leakage into the market, and 5) control of products and medicines containing or claiming to contain Tigers. To stem the issue of laundering and leakage regarding captive-bred Tigers, countries that have captive breeding facilities operations should as a matter of urgency revise their legislation to include non-native Tigers (and other Asian big cats). It is also worth considering that the application of laws is as paramount as the legislation itself. The lengthening of custodial sentences and increased penalties will not be enough on its own. Extensive and thorough investigations are required for the legislation to be fully implemented. Cybercrime involving Tigers is becoming more prevalent, as evidenced by seizures analysed in this dataset that show sellers attempting to offer items for sale on the internet. Social media and phone applications, especially those with restricted access features, facilitate communication between traders in a non-detectable way. In April 2016, WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) reported that the messaging service would be fully encrypted, creating greater challenges for law enforcement agencies in monitoring and detecting illegal activity. TRAFFIC urges commercial trading sites and social media enterprises to work closely with national governments to shut down businesses and individuals found to be facilitating illegal trade in Tigers (and other endangered species) online. The speed and volume in which cybercriminals operate necessitates collaborative action across agencies and national borders. Viable options for self- policing by internet service providers and social media networks, combined with mechanisms for reporting illegal trade, should be considered to enhance enforcement efforts. This should include the establishment of systems to prohibit or suspend accounts of repeat offenders. Parties are also encouraged to adopt approaches similar to China\u2019s \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d of online advertising of Tigers which involves joint efforts by service providers, governments and non- governmental organizations. TRAFFIC also urges members of the public to report suspected crime directly to local law enforcement agencies. Options for reporting to TRAFFIC can also be made via the Wildlife Witness App, which can be downloaded from the App Store or Google Play for free. 13 If illegal activity is suspected to be taking place on Facebook, a direct report to Facebook itself is encouraged. Facebook\u2019s Community Standards are a strong affirmation of its policy against illegal activity including wildlife crime, and provides a procedure for direct reporting to Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/help/181495968648557?ref=communi%20ty_standards) 2. CAPTIVE BREEDING The rise in unregulated breeding farms and facilities, and its relation to illegal Tiger trade, needs to be closely monitored. Seizures of suspected captive origin Tigers (both live animals and carcasses) have risen in three Southeast Asian countries \u2013 Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam, in parallel with the growing number of captive Tigers in these countries. Years of requests from Parties for greater efforts to regulate and control the leakage of Tigers from captive facilities has not seen any meaningful progress on this matter. Reports are also being submitted in a non-standardized manner with varying levels information that often lacks the level of detail required to understand the full breadth of the issue and implications to wild Tigers. Given the involvement of, and allegations against, captive facilities, there needs to be further investigation into the true motives behind such operations to dispel the cloud of uncertainty surrounding the management, regulation and control of such facilities. This analysis shows that Tigers from these facilities have indeed leaked into and become part of the illegal trade chain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6346d729-7739-4889-b0e4-45854f3cf062": {"__data__": {"id_": "6346d729-7739-4889-b0e4-45854f3cf062", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ef8b4a30b429cd5562f3e2eddac9a662418aa693ab10d024d4fe3fcddd798fb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1d7b9e6-357e-4fca-a07c-a442b3d76f45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a59644e767685bd40d27e6daf1cd8e838e647498b039cebce4727d48eabf720"}}, "hash": "260a458eaee1ad9815c3861ea57249d213a5189197018eb4ff9f1a8ef6032a0f", "text": "Based on this, TRAFFIC recommends that the following be implemented as immediate priorities by the CITES Secretariat, as contained in CITES CoP 17 Doc. 60.1 and the draft", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e1e85c6-4a1f-45ed-8b9c-26f8c71196d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e1e85c6-4a1f-45ed-8b9c-26f8c71196d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b2a2ff66b95f2a6b3c86ed3f13975bc9fb39ae0fdf36638961d66da16e6b34b"}, "3": {"node_id": "22b54c16-1001-4ee5-a523-2f6f3ec4d69b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28bedc6757480e9950cb219f513deb937c80c99bcb49d82dd8c83f4fa6356940"}}, "hash": "d858853d2d418c81ada45a9d4718af131982f0381fa9e43a84a67903cdeda610", "text": "Decision on Asian big cats CoP17 Com.

In addition, given the involvement of, and reported allegations, against captive facilities as well as suspicions about their true motives, affected countries particularly TRC should investigate all breeding centres for involvement in illegal activity, and close them down if there is evidence of such exists. Further analysis is also encouraged to better understand the implications of Tiger seizures from captive facilities for their impact on wild Tiger populations. For Lao PDR, the recommendations from the CITES Secretariat\u2019s mission in July 2016 point to some key priorities: \u201cThere is an urgent need for the adoption of clear guidelines regarding the operation of Special Free Economic Zones in relation to farming, consumption and trade in CITES-listed species, as well as clear guidance on how to proceed in cases of alleged illicit trafficking occurring in these zones. No standard procedure seems to be in place to act upon such information\u201d. Lao PDR\u2019s announcement at the 67th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee (SC67) regarding its intention to discuss 14 ways of phasing out Tiger farms is relevant in this context, including the enactment of regulations on wildlife trade within its Special Economic Zones. DNA profiles and other markings (such as photographic evidence) should be taken from all Tigers held in captivity to monitor the numbers of Tigers being bred in captive facilities, and prevent more Tigers from being leaked into trade. These samples should be recorded and managed in a centralized database. Samples from seized Tigers can then be cross- referenced against the database, to corroborate or refute claims that Tiger breeding is supplying trade. 15 1.0 INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND Internationally, illegal wildlife trade currently attracts a greater level of political interest than it ever has. The call to action against illegal wildlife trade is now being observed globally, and no longer limited to markets in East Asia for example, which have long been cited as the primary attributer driving the demand for trade in endangered species (UNODC, 2007; TRAFFIC, 2008; UNODC, 2010; Lawson and Vines, 2014). As recently as June 2016, the United States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) introduced new regulations to effectively prohibit domestic ivory trade. This measure demonstrates the United States\u2019 commitment to tackling the persistent poaching of elephants to feed the international demand for ivory (USFWS, 2016). The status of wild Tigers Panthera tigris population continues to be of great concern. In April 2016, Tigers were declared officially extinct in Cambodia, followed closely by the contrasting news that after national assessments in several TRCs, the global Tiger population is likely to be over 3 800 individuals (Anon, 2016; Dockrill, 2016; Rohr, 2016) which is higher than the previous estimate of 3 200 in 2010 (CNN, 2010; The Hindu, 2014; WWF, 2016). While there has been some discourse around the methods used to determine the number of wild Tigers, there is no question that remaining Tiger populations, fragmented across Asia, are still seriously threatened by poaching and trafficking. 1.1 Global Wild Tiger Population During the 3rd Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation in 2014, the governments of TRCs pledged to announce a new global wild Tiger estimate by 2016 based on full, systematic national surveys. Today, not all countries have completed or published these survey findings. The new minimum estimate of over 3 800 wild Tigers (Table 1) is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species count for Tigers in Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Viet Nam, and has been updated for Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia and Thailand where national Tiger surveys and estimation have taken place since the IUCN assessment (Chndawat et. al., 2011; Kawanishi, 2015; Lynam and Nowell, 2011; The Hindu, 2016). Bhutan and India recorded increases in their populations, whereas Malaysia (Kawanishi, 2015), Indonesia and Thailand recorded decreases (Goodrich et al, 2015). Previous estimates were unavailable in Bangladesh or Russia in 2014 but both have since undertaken national surveys.

In 2010 and 2013, TRAFFIC produced \u2018Reduced to Skin and Bones: An Analysis of Tiger Seizures from 11 Tiger Range Countries (2000- 2010)\u2019 and \u2018Reduced to Skin and Bones Revisited: An Updated Analysis of Tiger Seizures from 12 Tiger Range Countries (2000-2012)\u2019 (Verheij et al., 2010; Stoner and Pervushina, 2013). Following this, and to service the 65th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee in Geneva in July 2014, IUCN and TRAFFIC with the support of the CITES Secretariat and WWF, published an analysis that also reviewed the trade in Tigers and other Asian big cats \u2018Review of implementation of Resolution Conf. 12.5 (Rev. CoP16) on Conservation and trade in Tigers and other Appendix-I Asian big cat species\u2019 (Nowell and Pervushina, 2014). Each publication reported a consistent, year-on-year increase in the number of Tigers detected in trade. Building on these previous analyses, this fourth report evaluates the current trade picture in light of the constantly evolving pressures including the impact of online trade and increasing prevalence of Tiger farming. 18 1.1 Review of the implementation of Resolution Conference 12.5 (Rev CoP 16) on Asian big cats Over the years, the CITES Secretariat has issued numerous notifications to the Parties (CITES, 2011; CITES, 2012; CITES, 2013; CITES, 2014a; CITES, 2015b: Table 2), requesting each to report on the progress of their activities to address Resolution Conf. 12.5 on Conservation of and trade in Tigers and other Appendix-I Asian big cat species which was last revised at the 16th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES [Resolution Conf. 12.5 (Rev.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76df3997-c64e-45a2-837c-84b3f56a1124": {"__data__": {"id_": "76df3997-c64e-45a2-837c-84b3f56a1124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Reduced to skin and bones re-examined : full analysis", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de379334915a937d6455ce5b7b136e4e7362fdd82b78a2bc194cedcfdf48b99b"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7615a4c-8e44-43ea-b1e8-15a060c607dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/reduced-skin-and-bones-re-examined-full-analysis", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00337aa543db036ecea2b37c5fb504ee2a7e4ca5f71a191fdec6fa32338daf88"}}, "hash": "ba89e8497304bc1329941852c9e6c9fb7db4817fc5131f6891c480cec364eef0", "text": "12.5 (Rev.

The most recent notification was issued in January 2015 (No. 2015/006 of 30 January 2015) to communicate the recommendations on Asian big cats which were endorsed at SC65 to Parties (CITES, 2015a).

Twelve Parties responded to this call, which included only six TRCs: Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Viet Nam. The Working Group conducted a number of rounds of discussions and consensus was achieved on some of the five main areas; a summary of the relevant responses from the reports of both the CITES (SC66 Doc. 44.1 ) and the Intersessional Working Group (SC66 Doc. 44.2 ) is provided below: 1. Concerning legislative and regulatory measures The reports noted that legislative improvements are required in some countries. However, much of this is focused on the issue of captive breeding without specifying other crucial aspects such as penalties. The Working Group also noted the legislative limitations in some countries which had laws that only applied to native species and sub-species of Asian big cats, without considering non-native species and sub-species. This clearly presents an obstacle to law enforcement, particularly as CITES is meant to govern international trade in species, in addition to stonewalling investigations, seizures and convictions. 2. Concerning national law enforcement It is clear that illegal activity continues in many countries, and improvements in law enforcement, monitoring and control are required to overcome this problem. The reports note that gaps in legislation impede effective law enforcement 19 including seizures, arrests, investigations and prosecution. In addition, inadequate and low rates of reporting obstruct efforts to evaluate the progress made by Parties. The issue of internet trade is closely associated with both law enforcement and demand reduction. Some Parties such as China, have initiated engagement with e-commerce trading sites to address concerns regarding internet-based trade. 3. Concerning demand reduction, education and awareness Some level of demand reduction programmes for Tigers do exist but there does not appear to be a dedicated effort, compared to those for elephant ivory and rhino horn for example. Where they do exist, they do not appear to be conducted in a systematic and comprehensive manner that would allow for the identification of drivers, factors and key consumer groups. 4. Concerning the prevention of illegal trade in parts and derivatives from breeding facilities and 5: Concerning the management of national and privately-held stocks of parts and derivatives These two issues are closely connected and are discussed jointly. These were also the more prominent issue that remained unresolved, notably on CITES Decision 14.69 stating \u201cParties with intensive operations breeding tigers on a commercial scale shall implement measures to restrict the captive population to a level supportive only to conserving wild tigers; tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives\u201d. This appears to be a common recurrence at CITES deliberations, despite the various progress reports being requested from Parties through time. The Asian big cat Working Group notes that measures taken by some countries to prevent leakage of the products from captive breeding facilities into internal markets are unclear. It was also reported that some Working Group members were keen on recommending time-bound implementation, though the Chair felt some Parties would face difficulties during implementation due to various reasons, including a lack of definitions and terminologies in Decision 14.69. In its report to the 66th meeting of the Standing Committee, the CITES Secretariat noted that \u201cany further requests to Parties to report on their implementation of Decision 14.69 may be of limited value. Such requests for reporting have not proven to be successful since CoP14, and it is likely that this will continue to be the case until an agreed way forward has been reached, one which allows for unity and clarity in the Convention's approach to Asian big cat issues\u201d. Additionally, little and non- comprehensive information exists about the volume of national or privately held stockpiles of captive-bred or confiscated Asian big cat body parts and derivatives. No Party, with the exception of Nepal, reported on the volume of their stockpile. Recommendations from the work of the Working Group formed the bases of a draft Decision on Asian big cats that was adopted at CITES CoP17 (CoP17 Com.
