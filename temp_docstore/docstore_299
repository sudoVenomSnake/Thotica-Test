The latter are translated into outcomes that determine the level of human development. Models of this type can be used to evaluate the impact of macroeconomic adjustment policies on poverty incidence, income distribution, health outcomes, education, gender bias and the environment. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of studies that deal solely with the impact of regional integration in South-East Asia. Based on the studies available, some areas of concern with respect to the impact of economic integration on human development are discussed below. 28 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation Government expenditure on human development The importance of public expenditure in determining the status of human development in a country was noted earlier. The size of the expenditure, however, is likely to be influenced by globalization policies and pressures on Governments to reduce public expenditure to meet fiscal deficit targets. Thus, expenditure on social sectors depends not only on the commitment of Governments to those sectors but it is also significantly influenced by the financial crunch experienced under globalization. Available data on public expenditure indicate that expenditures on social sectors are quite low in countries that are lagging in terms of human development in South-East Asia and more work needs to be done in this area, including calculating the four public expenditure ratios discussed earlier for South-East Asian countries. Labour and employment The concerns arising in the field of labour and employment from greater integration are well known (Lanzona, 2001). Workers in many developing countries fear that as a consequence of the entry of China and other labour surplus economies in international trade there will be downward pressure on their wages, leading to further immiserization. Increased domestic unemployment leading to further international migration are other undesirable outcomes. While some industries will benefit from globalization, the process of adjustment could well lead to some short-term job losses. There are also concerns about labour standards and institutions. Workers may be forced to work in sub-standard conditions in order for firms to be competitive. Globalization and increased regional integration have encouraged flexibility in labour markets, which in turn has resulted in the informalization of labour. Outsourcing of work through contracting and sub-contracting tends to promote piecework and home-based work, particularly for women workers, who are usually poorly paid, lack social protection and have limited possibilities for upward mobility in the labour market. There is also the issue of the adequacy of educational institutions in coping with the demands likely to arise as a result of greater economic openness. Inadequate facilities for education and skill formation result in increasing wage and income gaps between those with skills and those without. Environmental standards Related to core labour standards is the matter of environmental standards. Under the neo-liberal paradigm, environmental resources are not recognized as natural capital and as a result scant attention is paid to environmental sustainability and the conservation of natural resources. The desire for faster growth has therefore led to rapid environmental degradation in many East Asian countries. Industrialists, who fear a loss of competitiveness, do not welcome the imposition of stricter environmental rules nor are policy makers keen on putting controls on industries so as not to jeopardize economic growth. It goes without saying that a depleted and degraded environment is likely to have an adverse impact on human development. Poverty and income distribution Economic growth is a necessary but insufficient condition for poverty reduction. The net positive impact of regional integration at the macroeconomic level in terms of higher levels of GDP indicates that the necessary condition is satisfied. The main channels through which macroeconomic policies affect poverty incidence are employment and wages. The GTAP model was used in a study of the impact of multilateral trade liberalization on poverty in three South-East Asian countries, namely Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, by linking it with new international cross-section consumption and earnings data from household surveys (Hertel et al., 2002).7 The data showed that the poor were more specialized in their sources of income than the non- poor, making them more vulnerable to changes in trade policy, which tend to favour one sector at the expense of another. The results of the simulations also showed that the aggregate measure of poverty incidence was reduced by trade liberalization in the countries studied. Moreover, households that largely depended on income from the agricultural sector in those countries benefited substantially from the liberalization of trade in that sector in developed countries. In another study, which included Viet Nam, also showed a reduction in aggregate poverty incidence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "57bc6325-6640-4963-9126-f80a13a01e5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "57bc6325-6640-4963-9126-f80a13a01e5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd5d80f75113fb34aec4452f95ec9d7f6e1c32c0bc47e9c3110d6fcc53d0f989"}}, "hash": "bd5d80f75113fb34aec4452f95ec9d7f6e1c32c0bc47e9c3110d6fcc53d0f989", "text": "in that country following trade liberalization (Hertel et al., 2003). It should be noted that the favourable impact of trade liberalization on poverty arises mainly from the inclusion of the agriculture sector in the simulation exercises. Since the bulk of the poor are dependent on agriculture to some degree, the national poverty rate tends to fall since trade liberalization raises the profitability of agriculture. 7 A related study dealt solely with Indonesia (Hertel et al., 2004). South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 29 A review of the impact of trade liberalization on output and income distribution in the Philippines (Yap, 2002) indicates that greater global integration generally has a net positive impact on welfare and poverty reduction but the results for income distribution are mixed. This finding was supported by the sharp increase in the Gini coefficient of the Philippines between 1994 and 1997, when the Government accelerated the implementation of market-oriented policies. Another recent study indicates that several factors contributed to rising income inequality in the larger countries of South-East Asia (Pangestu, 2001). An important consideration is that those countries had either inadequate or non-existent social safety nets or income transfer programmes. South-East Asia did not share the experience of the Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, of an export-oriented strategy accompanied by the spread of industrialization to rural areas, increased rural-urban linkages and rapid increases in non-agriculture employment, especially in the countryside. While labour markets in the larger countries of the region responded to the need for a labour-intensive, export-oriented drive, they were hampered at subsequent stages of the drive by the lack of skilled labour. South-East Asia did not move as fast as North-East Asia to educate its workers, so while labour markets continue to be flexible, there is growing income inequality owing to the sharp rise in the wages of skilled versus unskilled labour. Data on the pattern of poverty incidence and income distribution over time support the general conclusion that greater economic openness has coincided with a reduction in poverty but a worsening income distribution. The positive impact of FDI on economic growth implies that it too has satisfied the necessary condition for a beneficial effect on poverty. Other channels through which FDI can influence poverty include by reducing the volatility of capital flows and incomes. Compared with other capital flows, FDI is more stable and has a better risk profile and is therefore more conducive to macroeconomic stability. FDI can also improve corporate governance. Companies owned and controlled by foreigners tend to increase productivity more than those under dispersed ownership do. Foreign investors usually observe better standards than domestic firms do, partly because they can afford to do so owing to their higher productivity and partly because they are under greater scrutiny, particularly from civil society groups. Foreign investors also contribute to tax revenues, which can be used to finance improved social safety nets and basic services for the poor (Klein, et al. 2001). The degree to which FDI induced economic growth and led to poverty reduction in South-East Asia was the subject of a recent study (Jalilan and Weiss, 2001). The relevant results show that FDI inflows were associated with higher economic growth, the association being strongest in countries with higher educational levels. In terms of the relation between growth and poverty, there was a close relation between the growth in average income and the growth in the incomes of the poor. Turning to the question of poverty in ASEAN, the study found evidence that FDI in the region has been poverty-reducing and that this effect was stronger in the region than elsewhere. On average, 40 per cent of the poverty-reducing effect of FDI resulted from the economic growth induced by it, with the remainder resulting from more direct impacts. The obvious candidates for those direct effects include labour training and employment of the poor. Although the growth effect leads to additional job creation over time, this mechanism is the conventional trickle-down path in response to rising mean incomes. Inflows of FDI could also have contributed to the disparities observed in South-East Asia, both within and among countries. The development disparity among countries is partly caused by differences in the volume of FDI received and partly by policy differences in handling the inflows. Policies that enhance the capability of the economy to benefit from FDI are related to measures to improve the technological capability of domestic firms in order for them to benefit from dealings with, and spillovers from, foreign firms. In addition, Governments can encourage FDI to flow into areas that have greater linkages with the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a36bc159-72f8-4500-a4c2-3e2e2a285dfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a36bc159-72f8-4500-a4c2-3e2e2a285dfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e1b8f7475b53c3780a38bb5fe1e2d697d32fdfc67354dee6fa4bfc802d104499"}}, "hash": "e1b8f7475b53c3780a38bb5fe1e2d697d32fdfc67354dee6fa4bfc802d104499", "text": "rest of the economy. For example, FDI in rural-based industries would have a more significant impact on poverty reduction. FDI is likely to have contributed to increased income inequality within countries. With the exception of FDI in textiles, foreign investment in manufacturing has employed labour that is relatively skilled and this has increased wage disparities between skilled and unskilled workers. 30 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation Health, nutrition and labour standards To monitor the impact of trade liberalization on other aspects of human development, household models can be linked to standard macroeconomic models. For example, in a study which dealt with the choice of health care facility by households\u2019 estimated price and income elasticities, it was found that prices or user fees and income are important determinants of health care choice (Orbeta and Alba, 1998). Moreover, there was a clear tendency for price elasticities to be greater among lower income households, implying that uniform price increases hurt the poor more than the rich. The results showed that the tariff reform programme led to an increase in the cost of private health care and a decline in the cost of public health care, which would have benefited the poor. A similar approach was adopted to investigate the impact of greater trade liberalization on child labour in Viet Nam (Edmonds and Pavcnik, 2002). Using household panel data, it was determined that child labour fell as rice prices rose. The effect was largest for girls of secondary school age and corresponded to an increase in school attendance by this group. Since trade liberalization, through a relaxation of rice export quotas, resulted in a rise in the average domestic price of rice, the conclusion was drawn that trade liberalization had contributed to a decline in child labour in Viet Nam. Gender issues8 Economic development in South-East Asia in the last two decades has been anchored by the export sector, supported by FDI. From the early-1980s onwards, the increasing importance of export-oriented manufacturing activities in many Asian countries has been associated with a much greater reliance on women\u2019s paid labour. It has been argued that their labour constitutes the ultimate foundation of international competitiveness in the region (Gills, 2003). The process was most marked in the high- exporting economies of East and South-East Asia in the 1980s, where the share of female employment in total employment in export processing zones and export-oriented manufacturing industries typically exceeded 70 per cent. The so-called feminization of employment in many Asian countries resulted from the need to remain competitive in a very dynamic and fluid economic environment and therefore for cheaper and more flexible sources of labour. Feminization was also encouraged by the widespread conviction among employers in East and South-East Asia that female employees are more tractable and subservient to managerial authority, less prone to organize into unions, more willing to accept lower wages because of their own lower reservation and aspiration wages, and easier to dismiss using life-cycle criteria such as marriage and childbirth. However, as the effective relative remuneration of women has improved, in terms of the total package of wage, work and contract conditions, their attractiveness to employers has decreased. The more recent experience with the employment of women has been moves towards casualization of labour, shifts to part-time work or piece-rate contracts and increased reliance on the informal sector through sub-contracted and home-based work. It has been observed that this is part of a wider international tendency of somewhat longer duration: the emergence of international suppliers of goods who rely less and less on direct production within a specific location and more on subcontracting a greater part of their production activities. Those trends have reduced the social protection of women and made them more vulnerable to economic downturns and there is enough empirical evidence to show that children and women are most vulnerable in the adjustment process. The early feminization of employment has had both positive and negative effects on the women concerned. On the one hand, it has led to greater recognition and remuneration of women\u2019s work and typically the relative status and bargaining power of women within households, as well as their own self-worth, have improved thereby leading to greater empowerment. On the other hand, regardless of a woman\u2019s participation in productive work, household work remains the primary responsibility of women so that the increase in paid employment actually led to an increase in the burden of work of women. In short, greater global and regional integration in South-East Asia initially led to a rise in the labour force participation rate of women.

Not only has labour force participation declined but the degree of casualization and use of informal labour has also risen. The effect of the 1997 crisis on women was also more severe. 8 This section draws extensively on Ghosh, 2004. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 31 In this regard, the challenge is to devise mechanisms that reduce gender bias in the adjustment processes inherent in globalization. Social policies that reduce the double burden of work on women, such as the establishment of child-care centres, are needed as are improved protection for people in the informal sector, particularly women, and the elimination of gender bias in the provision of social security. The social dimensions of migration Migration has social implications that need to be considered in addition to the economic impact on home and host countries. On the one hand, families and communities of migrants sustain social costs. The absence of the migrant may have significant adverse effects on the family including disruption of relationships and problems with the education and socialization of children, particularly when women migrants have to leave young children behind. On the other, remittance incomes provide crucial benefits. Typically, they enable families back home to lead better material lives than would otherwise have been possible and contribute to expenses towards the education of children, better health care for the sick and elderly in the household, and so on (Ghosh, 2004). Policies towards labour migration are either absent or lack coherence in both sending and receiving countries. This has at least two important implications. The absence of policies tends to increase the number of undocumented migrant workers who are vulnerable to abuses and violations of human rights. On the part of the sending country, the absence of a policy on overseas employment reveals the inability of the State to protect its citizens working outside its borders (Rico, 2004). Cross-border migration in Asia is highly gendered, with women migrants largely found in service sectors, especially in domestic work and personal and health care, as well as in entertainment. There is often a fine line between voluntary migration and trafficking in women and girls. Trafficking is a widespread problem, which is on the increase, not only because of growing demand, but also because of larger and more varied sources of supply, given the increasingly precarious livelihood conditions in many rural parts of Asia. The social impact of the 1997 financial crisis Many studies have analyzed the social impact of the 1997 crisis extensively (for example, UNESCAP, 1999 and Khandker, 2002). In general, the social consequences were uneven and the vulnerable in urban areas suffered more than the urban rich or rural households (Khandker, 2002). In the words of one account, as the crisis deepened, \u201cunemployment soared, GDP plummeted, and banks closed. The unemployment rate was up fourfold in South Korea, threefold in Thailand, tenfold in Indonesia. In Indonesia, almost 15 per cent of males working in 1997 had lost their jobs by August 1998, and the economic devastation was even worse in the urban areas of the main island, Java. In South Korea, urban poverty almost tripled, with almost a quarter of the population falling into poverty; in Indonesia, poverty doubled. In some countries like Thailand, people thrown out of jobs in the cities could return to their rural homes. However, this put increasing pressure on those in the rural sector. In 1998, GDP in Indonesia fell by 13.1 per cent, in Korea by 6.7 per cent, and in Thailand by 10.8 per cent. Three years after the crisis, Indonesia\u2019s GDP was still 7.5 per cent below that before the crisis, Thailand\u2019s 2.3 per cent lower\u201d (Stiglitz, 2003). This description is consistent with the upward trend of poverty incidence in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand after the crisis that was mentioned earlier. Soaring inflation, particularly in Indonesia, also eroded purchasing power and reduced standards of living. As is well known, lower income groups are generally hardest hit by inflation and empirical analysis shows that the impacts of price changes on poverty were far more significant that the impacts of changes in income (Khandker, 2002). 32 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation The contraction in the real economy also led to the reversal of many past achievements in the areas of education and health care. However, the most glaring shortcoming in social policy that was revealed by the crisis was the absence of social safety nets that could", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0affb9a-47ae-4b1c-8563-e1692cf195da": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0affb9a-47ae-4b1c-8563-e1692cf195da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09cf96b73ffef3ffbaadccb89e0dafeb9590c1cb1bba60278e69806d8b28fe46"}}, "hash": "09cf96b73ffef3ffbaadccb89e0dafeb9590c1cb1bba60278e69806d8b28fe46", "text": "have mitigated the difficult adjustment process.9 Only after the crisis did Governments realize the importance of social safety nets, not only during a crisis period but also during the process of adjustment that accompanies greater global integration. Governance concerns Regional integration among the countries of South-East Asia could benefit in many ways from better governance within each country, even as conversely, good governance could be helped by greater regional integration. In a way, they could be mutually reinforcing and important in narrowing the gap among countries and in promoting human development in the region. Since variations in the quality of governance are a major determinant of disparities in the level of development in South-East Asia, as was discussed earlier, it is appropriate to analyze the impact of greater economic openness and outward orientation on this factor. Two major issues stand out in this area. One is whether greater economic openness has compelled Governments in South-East Asia to improve the quality of governance in order to enhance competitiveness or whether economic growth resulting from greater openness has induced better governance. It has sometimes been argued that Government interventions in some countries, such as Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China, succeeded in stimulating economic growth because of the quality of institutions behind the interventions. That is, \u201cgood\u201d institutions were necessary for those countries to take advantage of opportunities provided by greater outward orientation. The second issue revolves around the possibility that greater economic openness and adherence to the international rules of the game may have constrained Government action, particularly in the provision of public goods. The large variation in the quality of governance in South-East Asian countries indicates that greater global economic integration has not influenced governance significantly. On the contrary, it has also been argued that the emphasis on international competitiveness and export promotion often supplanted explicit policy measures against poverty and social inequality (Gills, 2003). In some of the countries of South-East Asia, a clear linkage has emerged between the turn to export-oriented growth, labour controls and the withdrawal of previous social commitments (Haggard, 2004a). Therefore, greater economic openness or, more accurately outward orientation, appears to have had a distinctly negative impact on the quality of governance. Identifying \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d The assessment of the impact of greater global and regional economic integration reveals that it has been largely uneven. While many of the larger economies experienced high rates of economic growth during the period of greater economic openness, this did not shield them from the 1997 crisis. Moreover, the gains reported during the period prior to the crisis are measured on a consolidated basis, so that the outcome is a reflection of benefits net of costs. Hence, even if a net positive impact is reported, as is the case in some counterfactual studies, the underlying adjustment process that reallocates resources between industries and sectors results in beneficiaries or \u201cwinners\u201d and those adversely affected or \u201closers\u201d. If the former outnumber the latter consistently, there should be a trend towards convergence, not only within a country but also among countries. However, as seen earlier, economic convergence has been slow in South-East Asia and the disparity between countries continues to be relatively high. Income distribution within countries is also relatively unequal, especially in the larger economies. While this lack of convergence cannot be attributed to a failure of regionalism, as formal trade arrangements among South- East Asian countries are relatively recent, it can nevertheless be related to the process of regionalization and globalization. The Human Development Report 1999 expressed the concern that \u201cwhen the market goes too far in dominating social and political outcomes, the opportunities and rewards of globalization spread unequally and inequitably \u2013 concentrating power and wealth in a select group of people, nations and corporations, and marginalizing others\u201d (UNDP, 1999). The ascendancy of neo-liberal economic policies globally has been a major contributor to persistent and rising inequality in many regions of the world. 9 Among the five hardest hit countries, only Republic of Korea had an unemployment insurance program at that time. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 33 Tight fiscal and monetary policies to stabilize inflation and reduce budget deficits have generated recessions and poverty surges. Cuts in public expenditure have been a drag on growth, especially when the needs of the poor have not been taken into consideration. Financial liberalization has increased volatility, occasionally leading to financial crises, particularly since the mid- 1990s. Ill-conceived privatization programmes have led to the concentration of State assets in the hands of former managers and a small financial elite.

Labour\u2019s share in national income has been declining. Tax systems have also become more regressive through a greater reliance on indirect taxes, while public expenditures have become less (Cornia and Court, 2001). Left to their own devices, market forces clearly cannot guarantee convergence. Not only does Government intervention at the domestic level have a role to play but also mechanisms at the regional level can contribute to convergence. The logic for those interventions stems from the theory underlying market failure, positive externalities and the provision of public goods, and will be discussed further below. To sum up, greater economic openness through global and regional integration has generally benefited countries in South- East Asia. This is manifested by higher inflows of FDI, increased trade flows, greater intraregional migration, faster economic growth and rising standards of living. The impact of trade liberalization and FDI on employment and poverty appear to have been favourable. Greater openness to trade has also been shown to impact positively on health outcomes, child labour, and the environment. The emphasis on export-orientation has led to an increase in the labour participation rate of women. However, not all aspects of greater global integration have been beneficial, as shown by the 1997 financial crisis. Moreover, the evidence clearly demonstrates that the benefits were largely unevenly distributed both within and among the countries of the region. This is reflected in the large disparities in levels of development between countries and income inequalities within countries. Export and manufacturing sectors in several countries have an enclave nature and work conditions have deteriorated for women and workers in the informal sector. Social protection for unskilled temporary migrants is largely absent. Shortcomings in macroeconomic and social policies, inappropriate approaches to FDI and weak governance and institutions underlie the inequities and there is a need to address those constraints through appropriate policy interventions. The lack of convergence among South-East Asian countries is perhaps a symptom of deeper structural problems. It is likely that some countries have not achieved the critical threshold of development that would allow them to reap the benefits of globalization and regional integration. Deficiencies in capabilities in terms of human resources and institutions constrain closer regional cooperation, preventing those countries from participating effectively in creating regional arrangements and adding to their difficulties in implementing policies agreed upon. Hence, it may be imperative to attempt to reach a threshold level of human development in key areas in poorer South-East Asian countries within a truncated period of time. Not only will this facilitate regional economic integration and regional cooperation but it will also accelerate the overall process of development. 34 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation As discussed in the conceptual framework, the fundamental rationale for regional cooperation in whatever form rests on the recognition by a group of countries of shared opportunities or constraints that provide the basis for joint action (Abonyi, 2003). Regional cooperation can have an impact on human development in two ways. First, it facilitates regional economic integration by engendering a stable regional macroeconomic environment, mainly through financial and monetary cooperation, and by helping low-income countries achieve the critical threshold of development that is necessary to participate effectively in regional arrangements. Regional cooperation can help those countries in skill formation, capacity-building and in developing infrastructure to enable them to attract FDI and open their economies. Regional cooperation can also provide technical advice on how to go about regional integration by sharing best practices that have yielded good results from integration, for example, in identifying sectors where FDI can help to reduce poverty more rapidly. Leading countries can also involve lagging countries in the process of integration by becoming their partners and promoters. Second, regional cooperation directly contributes to human development when countries jointly address common economic and social concerns. The latter includes mechanisms to compensate \u201closers\u201d in the process of regional economic integration. While the current impetus for regional cooperation is largely driven by the necessities of regional economic integration, it is imperative to highlight the importance of human development as a regional objective. This chapter deals with the relationship between regional cooperation and human development in South-East Asia. It aims to highlight the various human development initiatives undertaken by different regional and international institutions working in the region. 5.1 FORMS AND RATIONALE OF REGIONAL COOPERATION By taking joint action on issues that transcend national boundaries, countries can enhance their development prospects", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a1e6d3d-ef4f-48e1-94c4-c96b3816018a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a1e6d3d-ef4f-48e1-94c4-c96b3816018a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0080e4ff5624039da44a08973d3585005f53bbad9aa219f655d6c71d63ff6bc7"}}, "hash": "0080e4ff5624039da44a08973d3585005f53bbad9aa219f655d6c71d63ff6bc7", "text": "and boost their capacities to alleviate poverty, promote peace and security and achieve sustainable development. While most regional cooperation agreements in South-East Asia were initially undertaken to provide strategic defence and strengthen the bargaining power of countries in the global political arena, those aims have since expanded to cover various social and economic concerns. Inter-country cooperation plays a significant role in the promotion of peace and security. Regional collaboration enhances community solidarity, emphasizes common goals among politically or culturally distinct groups, and mitigates political power imbalances among neighbours. Some of the major concerns are the trafficking of women and children, drugs, arms and contraband deals, money laundering and the cross-border movements of fugitives from justice as well as international terrorism. Closer cooperation and coordination among countries in the region are imperative for the resolution of those problems. Regional cooperation that furthers regional integration expands opportunities of participating countries, particularly those with less developed economies, to achieve faster and more equitable economic growth, which enhances regional stability. Through the facilitation of information sharing and best practices, countries can adopt better ways of meeting specific needs and concerns in fields such as governance, health, education, and research and development. Regional cooperation can also enhance social protection. It can serve as a medium for bringing countries together to share information and experiences in order to develop efficient and effective labour markets, reduce peoples\u2019 exposure to risks, protect women and children from exploitation, and provide cost-effective welfare programmes and social safety nets. Cooperation on the environment and natural resources management can also foster more sustainable development in the region. Social development is a major area of functional cooperation in South-East Asia. ASEAN Social Development Cooperation was recently restructured with a view to revitalizing and refocusing policy cooperation on strategic issues, such as the implications of economic integration and greater trade and services liberalization. Preparations of work plans for social welfare and development as well as disaster management are in progress. Although cost sharing is increasingly used as a modality for funding priority regional activities, ASEAN\u2019s Dialogue Partners \u2013 the specialized agencies of the United Nations, the World Bank and other institutions \u2013 continue to support projects on labour, health, education, women and children. 5. REGIONAL COOPERATION INITIATIVES FOR HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 35 5.2 INSTITUTIONAL MECHANISMS FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA Human development necessitates myriad shared and complementary efforts from the Governments of rich and poor countries, international agencies, local authorities, the private sector and civil society organizations. Those interventions usually aim at overcoming market failures that result in sub-optimal outcomes. Human development initiatives may be launched by Governments or international agencies or both (UNDP, 2003b). Three main institutions promote regional cooperation in South- East Asia: the United Nations, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Program of ADB and ASEAN.10 United Nations Agencies Several agencies of the United Nations work towards the advancement of human development in South-East Asia. Among them are the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) As a regional commission of the United Nations, UNESCAP\u2019s mandate is to foster cooperation between its members in order to promote economic and social development in the Asia-Pacific region. It fulfills this mandate through: policy advocacy and dialogue on global and regional commitments and critical emerging issues that need the urgent attention of its members; regional knowledge networking to enable its members and associate members to share and discuss information and experiences on good and innovative practices; and training advisory services and other technical assistance aimed at strengthening the capacity of its members and associate members to formulate and implement effective policies and programmes. UNESCAP\u2019s regional cooperation initiatives are generally in the form of a mandate, where Governments reach a set of agreements or resolutions at the policy-level addressing common social and development issues as bases for cooperation, and technical assistance where countries collaborate with UNESCAP to conduct specific development activities. UNESCAP\u2019s activities related to human development come in two of its seven programme areas of work, namely social development, including emerging social issues, and poverty reduction. Social development focuses on strengthening the capacity of members and associate members in the development and implementation of policies and programmes to address persistent and emerging social issues in order to enhance the productivity and quality of human resources. In terms of sustainability, UNESCAP has played a leading role in organizing high- level intergovernmental meetings addressing various", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4a23142-e4cd-4236-a807-1ab680f5cdb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4a23142-e4cd-4236-a807-1ab680f5cdb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b73e7d859f8524dad74286c91d4c358b32dee957be244eeb2854548e1a977e06"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b7d9a07-22aa-4888-a9a2-e99c59e95cc8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1e3f6bfa22848fa855b732042540d6d9d0a7a982515e6daf03d6d0d9b4e821f"}}, "hash": "db086d163229bc15557e7c337669191ad83660faa7f3dbd4ad349c4dd86b29bb", "text": "issues for improving the productivity and quality of human resources. UNESCAP\u2019s traditional clients and partners are national Governments, who determine its work programme and act as key partners in implementing regional cooperation activities. UNESCAP has also involved state or provincial and local governments, NGOs, research and training institutes, the media and the private sector in the planning and implementation of its technical cooperation activities. Although national Governments are traditional target beneficiaries, NGOs, community-based organizations and the private sector are increasingly becoming important beneficiaries of the secretariat\u2019s regional cooperation activities. Poverty and development focuses on strengthening the capacity of UNESCAP members and associate members to identify and analyze opportunities and constraints related to poverty eradication and to design and implement policies and programmes to reduce poverty in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals. In 2003, UNESCAP conducted a review of its two flagship projects, namely, the Millennium Development Goals and the Human Dignity Initiative. The report on MDGs provides a qualitative region-wide assessment of the progress achieved and obstacles encountered in meeting the MDGs in the region. The Human Dignity Initiative has implemented 30 community-based pilot projects in five countries of South-East Asia with the objective of promoting participatory community-based initiatives that improve living conditions in poor and disadvantaged communities. The initiative links grass-roots experiences with the policy-making process and results in a broad-based approach to development. 10 Another form of regional cooperation is growth triangles, of which there are three in existence in South-East Asia. However, owing to space constraints, growth triangles have not been considered in this Report. 36 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation Other activities conducted under the UNESCAP programme on poverty and development include a regional poverty alleviation programme; the replication of a best practices strategy on rural community development based on the Saemaul Undong methodology; cooperation and collaboration with other intergovernmental bodies and NGOs in activities related to rural poverty reduction; and the Conference on Microfinance Policy and Governance organized jointly with other organizations in March 2002 to build knowledge, institutional capacity and public-private sector cooperation in enhancing the effectiveness of microfinance as an instrument of poverty alleviation in the region. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) UNDP is the critical development arm of the United Nations. With a global network in 166 countries, UNDP helps member countries of the United Nations build and share solutions to the challenges of democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention and recovery, energy and the environment, and HIV/AIDS. UNDP is primarily engaged in global advocacy and analysis to generate knowledge, alliance building and promotion of enabling frameworks on key issues, policy advice and support for national capacity-building, and knowledge networking and sharing of good practices (UNDP, 2004). UNDP is involved in several regional initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region. Of those initiatives, two best exemplify regional cooperation for human development: the Urban Governance Initiative and the Asia Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative. The Urban Governance Initiative (TUGI) was created by UNDP as a response to the growing trend of urbanization in the region. TUGI is a regional project of the UNDP that acts as a hub for promoting good urban governance through institutional capacity-building, providing policy advisory services, enabling innovations on tools and methodologies for urban governance and ensuring wide information dissemination and collaborative networking between and within cities in the Asia-Pacific region. The TUGI Project popularized a five-point vision for well-governed and sustainable cities to promote socially just, ecologically sustainable, politically participatory, economically productive and culturally vibrant cities. In terms of harbouring participation and empowerment among sectors, TUGI employed its well-known report card system. TUGI report cards have been widely accepted and utilized by urban planners and administration. The Asia Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative (or Asia Pacific Access to Justice, summarized as AP-A2J) of UNDP seeks to promote justice as a significant component in uplifting human development and augmenting poverty reduction efforts in the region. Access to justice is a major area of UNDP\u2019s democratic governance practice and a critical strategy for poverty reduction. The goal of UNDP\u2019s community of practice in Asia and the Pacific is to enhance access to justice and justice-related development policies and programmes for poor and disadvantaged people. AP-A2J involves approximately 30 UNDP staff from 17 country offices in the region and is supported by an electronic network of more than 80 members globally (UNDP, 2003a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b7d9a07-22aa-4888-a9a2-e99c59e95cc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b7d9a07-22aa-4888-a9a2-e99c59e95cc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b73e7d859f8524dad74286c91d4c358b32dee957be244eeb2854548e1a977e06"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4a23142-e4cd-4236-a807-1ab680f5cdb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db086d163229bc15557e7c337669191ad83660faa7f3dbd4ad349c4dd86b29bb"}}, "hash": "c1e3f6bfa22848fa855b732042540d6d9d0a7a982515e6daf03d6d0d9b4e821f", "text": "The community has used a bottom-up process to achieve two major results: policy and tool development; and individual and organizational capacities to transform knowledge into practice.

International Labour Organization (ILO) Apart from UNDP, the ILO also makes a considerable contribution in fostering regional cooperation initiatives for human development in South-East Asia within the United Nations. ILO seeks to promote social justice and internationally recognized human and labour rights. It formulates international labour standards in the form of conventions and recommendations setting minimum standards of basic labour rights: freedom of association; the right to organize; collective bargaining; abolition of forced labour; equality of opportunity and treatment; and other standards regulating conditions across the entire spectrum of work-related issues. It provides technical assistance primarily in the fields of vocational training and vocational rehabilitation, employment policy, labour administration, labour law and industrial relations, working conditions, management development, cooperatives, social security, labour statistics, and occupational safety and health (ILO website). South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 37 ILO implemented the Trafficking in Children and Women (TICW) project in 1997 through its International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in an effort to combat child labour in five countries in the Greater Mekong subregion, namely; Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, Viet Nam and China\u2019s Yunnan Province. The TICW project consisted of several interventions for raising awareness, advocacy, capacity-building at national and local levels, and direct assistance to communities in the GMS. By mobilizing a broad alliance of stakeholders, the TICW Project covered work in education, skills training, employment creation, alternative livelihoods and legal literacy. Asian Development Bank (ADB) The GMS Program of ADB, which began in 1992, has the goal of promoting economic and social development by forging strong economic linkages between countries in the subregion.11 For a period of ten years, the thrust of the GMS Program has been the development of infrastructure to enable the harnessing and sharing of the resource base and promoting the freer flow of goods and people in the subregion. Economic linkages among the six countries in the GMS have greatly strengthened in the first decade of intervention through a series of infrastructure and other projects, with overall investment amounting to about $2 billion (ADB, 2002). ADB has designed a 10-year strategic framework that aims to extend the success of the GMS Program and articulates a vision of a more integrated, prosperous and equitable Mekong subregion. The new programme builds on successes to date and lessons learned in implementation, and addresses trends and challenges that beset the subregion. An array of regional technical assistance initiatives has enabled the GMS Program to address the problem of inadequate access of people to opportunities beyond employment and livelihood. Some of those initiatives are: Preventive Education in the Cross- Border Areas; Small Scale Regional Technical Assistance for Drug Eradication in the GMS; Roll Back Malaria Initiative for the Greater Mekong Subregion; Preventing HIV/AIDS among Mobile Populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion; Study of Health and Education Needs of Ethnic Minorities; Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS in the GMS; and Cooperation in Employment Promotion and Training. Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) ASEAN\u2019s evolution was discussed earlier in the introduction. Here, the focus of the discussion will be on ASEAN\u2019s initiatives on regional cooperation for human development. Economic cooperation, mentioned in the ASEAN Declaration, became a central goal of ASEAN with the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia and the first Declaration of ASEAN Concord, known as Bali Concord I (ASEAN, 1976a and 1976b). The explicit reference to economic cooperation in ASEAN\u2019s key constitutional documents facilitates action by members on this issue. Nonetheless, it does not guarantee success of the programmes adopted, since that depends on a range of other factors including domestic and external conditions, which shape the incentives and disincentives for regional economic cooperation. Social development cooperation was also emphasized in the key constitutional documents of ASEAN. However, as economic integration intensified after 1992, the level of attention and detail accorded to economic cooperation in ASEAN documents increased sharply, while social development remained categorized under the broad rubric of functional cooperation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04b9c42a-0117-41e2-808a-9224f2485786": {"__data__": {"id_": "04b9c42a-0117-41e2-808a-9224f2485786", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "784fc9f45b100e67a870d54fe795512b71afdebaace51f97d0c0d491ca47e5cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "8585e0d6-8053-4c72-bd7c-a4a905ab3990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "168f0a852e188910be91f52e099f8da3d9a6815c367d83e9da0cd6512247cfd5"}}, "hash": "e52106d1b8636f08623b6ca8167a4c41e16573ccab3aff028fbc551d83543f13", "text": "This encompasses a wide range of issues ranging from health, rural development and poverty, social welfare, HIV/AIDS, labour, education, disaster relief, sustainable development, and women, youth and children.12 It was only after the 1997 financial crisis that social development issues became more focused around the fallout from globalization and regional liberalization.

ASEAN\u2019s organizational approach and the \u201cASEAN way\u201d Clearly, ASEAN has a very comprehensive framework for dealing with regional integration and cooperation in South-East Asia, including specific programmes designed to deal with human development issues. A summary is presented in Table 7 relating various ASEAN initiatives to the different objectives of regional cooperation. However, an important issue is whether ASEAN has the resources and appropriate philosophy to carry out those programmes effectively. Table 7. Objectives of Regional Cooperation and Relevant ASEAN Initiatives Objective of Regional Cooperation ASEAN Initiative Compensation of \u201closers\u201d ASEAN Plan of Action on Social Safety Nets Hasten economic convergence Initiative for ASEAN Integration Directly enhance human development Various ASEAN plans of action Engender regional macroeconomic stability ASEAN Surveillance Process The behaviour of ASEAN member States is guided by two sets of norms: regulatory norms, or the ground rules regarding the internal and external relations of member States; and procedural norms, which guide collective decision-making. The primary regulatory or behavioral norm of ASEAN is that of non-interference in the internal affairs of another State, given formal expression in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (Job 1999). It is through this principle that ASEAN reassures its members that another member engaging in direct or indirect acts of subversion will not jeopardize its territorial and political integrity. This norm, consequently, also contributes to securing domestic regimes, a key concern in ASEAN since its inception in 1967 that has continued to the present given ongoing nation building and political consolidation in member States. The procedural norms of ASEAN, collectively referred to as the \u201cASEAN way\u201d, govern the manner in which members engage in collective decision-making. Prescribing means rather than ends, the \u201cASEAN way\u201d specifies how policy-makers should conduct themselves in the ASEAN context (Busse, 1999). The \u201cASEAN way\u201d to collective decision-making and problem solving emphasizes informality and an aversion to formal institutions, flexibility, consensus, a high degree of discretion and non-confrontational bargaining styles (Acharya, 1997). Those norms help to reinforce the domestic autonomy of governing regimes by reassuring member states that they will not be publicly pressed to undertake actions that run counter to domestic interests. In Bali Concord II, ASEAN leaders reaffirmed the \u201cfundamental importance of adhering to the principle of non-interference and consensus in ASEAN cooperation\u201d (ASEAN, 2003). From the mid-1990s, ASEAN Governments adopted an increasing number of rules and procedures to govern regional economic cooperation, consequently reducing to a significant extent their respective individual autonomy or sovereignty in aspects of economic policy.

In this regard, the secretariat often works closely with relevant United Nations agencies.14 The proposal to explore the impact of regional economic integration on social development and welfare is a secretariat initiative, supported strongly by the new members of ASEAN. This is in contrast to the period before 1993 when national Governments tended to propose projects for consideration at the ASEAN level that, more often than not, were projects that met national priorities but were not of interest to other member Governments. It is for this reason that many ASEAN projects failed to be supported at the regional level. At present, cooperation in social development tends to be more purposive, guided by programmatic plans and is no longer ad-hoc or piecemeal. The infrastructure for social development cooperation has also been transformed with the establishment of specialized networks in a range of social development fields. Aside from specialized funds to finance specific ASEAN projects, such as the ASEAN Fund, the Science and Technology Fund and the Cultural Fund, ASEAN has to date relied heavily on dialogue partner States to fund ASEAN projects. Although member Governments make an annual contribution to ASEAN, this is largely used for operational expenditure, particularly secretariat staff salaries. While ASEAN has benefited from dialogue partner funding, this trend nonetheless increases ASEAN\u2019s dependence on external funding and subjects the institution to conditionalities imposed by funding Governments. Rather than function as an official funding arm of ASEAN, the ASEAN Foundation is mandated to raise funds from other international foundations, charities and the private sector. Its establishment potentially increases the sources of funding for ASEAN and it could reduce dependency on dialogue partners if it were strengthened and greater efforts were made to transform it into a viable source of funding for ASEAN cooperation on social development. ASEAN networks to enhance regional cooperation ASEAN has very well-established networks of governance, particularly with other States, other relevant international and regional organizations and with the private business sector. Unfortunately, its links with civil society are limited in comparison, which could have some bearing on the efficacy and accountability of ASEAN\u2019s social development programmes and, more broadly, of ASEAN as a regional institution. ASEAN has an extensive network with non-member States through its dialogue partners scheme. The dialogue partners include Australia, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Russian Federation and the United States of America. The best developed of those relationships involves Australia, which became ASEAN\u2019s first dialogue partner in 1974. Two flagship projects of ASEAN, Initiative for ASEAN Integration and Mekong Basin Development, receive external funding from dialogue partners such as Australia, Japan, China, Republic of Korea and may do so from India, while ASEAN contributes in kind through a range of technical assistance programmes and other non-financial contributions. ASEAN\u2019s most extensive extra-regional cooperation is with North-East Asian States through the ASEAN+3 process. This involves networking at the level of leaders, ministers, senior officials and the private sector. Through those processes, a number of significant cooperative projects have been initiated, the most notable being the Chiang Mai initiative of bilateral currency swap agreements. Other joint projects include those aimed at helping small and medium-scale enterprises through training and technical assistance, human resource development, electronic-learning, food security, the environment and energy cooperation. ASEAN also has extensive networks with several agencies of the United Nations. ASEAN has developed strong networks with the private sector, particularly since the mid-1990s, and it has long sought inputs from the ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry, from whom valuable suggestions were received that went into the initial design of AFTA in the early 1990s (Bowles and MacLean, 1996). At the Seventh ASEAN Summit in Brunei in 2001, ASEAN leaders decided to establish the ASEAN Business Advisory Council to provide private sector input into various ASEAN programmes on economic integration and economic development. This is now the primary vehicle for private sector feedback and guidance to 14 This section draws extensively on a telephone interview with a senior official of the ASEAN secretariat on 1 December 2003. 40 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation ASEAN on matters pertaining to ASEAN economic integration and ASEAN economic competitiveness.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10d3e9a4-9b56-4951-add7-9651c8b02758": {"__data__": {"id_": "10d3e9a4-9b56-4951-add7-9651c8b02758", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3042b75c47a287ae0bd8901863e67dacd0ea65885072400382cdbf82d773a8a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "34c6e258-1e39-485d-94d5-c7b1b1c72f75", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "adccd0541858da642e22cd9c0e2c77f74701c2488299c7d9f12f6dd78b1a1cb5"}}, "hash": "7e0b10c49ce472006063c3408101828facf5953334a86b141fb108caceece237", "text": "Networks with foreign businesses also exist in ASEAN, notably the United States-ASEAN Business Council, the AFTA-Closer Economic Relations Business Council with Australia and New Zealand and the ASEAN-China Business Council, while efforts are underway to form an ASEAN- India Business Council.

Around 57 NGOs are affiliated with ASEAN but most of those are professional, industry and special interest associations that gather on an ASEAN-wide basis. Nevertheless, there is considerable potential for engagement between ASEAN and civil society organizations, with some very encouraging encounters to date. There is growing interest in the region about the role civil society can play in complementing the tasks of regional institutions in national, social and economic development. It is widely believed that an empowered civil society, working in partnership with regional agencies and the business sector, is essential to address regional poverty and social development successfully in the decades ahead. The forging of working relationships, together with an ongoing process of dialogue, between regional institutions, civil society organizations and bilateral and multilateral lending and development institutions is essential for the design and implementation of social and economic development programmes in the region. Through such a process, new mechanisms that would allow civil society organizations to play a more active role in the design, planning and implementation of regional development programmes could be identified. Civil society organizations, Governments and regional and international institutions could also agree on steps to be taken to strengthen civil society capacities to participate actively in regional development. The growth in the recognition of the crucial role played by civil society in furthering human development initiatives is implicit in the initiatives of several regional organizations, particularly UNDP and ILO, although South-East Asia in general has yet to witness regional cooperation initiatives led by civil society. This chapter has provided a review of selected human development initiatives by regional and international organizations operating in South-East Asia. However, it is important to note that it has not been possible to measure the impact on human development of the various regional cooperation arrangements and initiatives discussed owing to the dearth of relevant information. Consequently, the identification of best practices in human development initiatives at the regional level has not been possible and more work is needed in this area. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 41 The principal objective of the Report is to explore how and the extent to which the benefits of human development can be deepened and broadened through regional economic integration and regional cooperation. Although South-East Asian countries have shown considerable progress in human development over the years, the average level of human development in the region is still low compared with other more developed regions. Furthermore, less developed countries in the region such as Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Viet Nam and Timor-Leste often lag far behind the others on most measures of human development and there are few signs of them catching up. Achievements in terms of the MDGs show that progress has been made but convergence between countries in the region is still small. The challenge before South-East Asia at present is not only to raise the average level of human development but also to bridge the gap between rich and poor countries in the region and regional integration and cooperation could play a significant role in meeting this challenge. In this chapter, some important questions on the relationship between regional integration, regional cooperation and human development need to be answered. To what extent have regional integration and regional cooperation contributed towards promoting human development in South-East Asian countries? What are the problems and constraints that need to be addressed to enable regional integration and cooperation to deepen and broaden the benefits of human development in the region? Last, but not least, what approach should be followed in order to realize the full human development potential of South-East Asian countries in the future? As discussed earlier, the status of human development in any society depends on the macroeconomic environment, social policy in human development sectors and the microenvironment. Although economic growth is a necessary pre-requisite, it does not guarantee human development unless a development path that is conducive to it is followed. Social policy also has to be designed in a way that promotes human development, while administrative decentralization and the participation of empowered communities in decentralized decision-making are essential for human development to reach all sections of the population. Therefore, the recommendations made in this chapter are broadly classified under three heads: promoting regional and global integration to create an enabling macroeconomic environment; regional cooperation for social development, focusing on social policy in human development sectors; and the promotion of an appropriate microenvironment. In addition, some concerns that need particular attention at the regional level have also been identified.

Therefore, further economic integration of those countries with the regional and global economy should be pursued. However, there appears to be limited scope for accessing the gains from integration solely within South-East Asia, as the region has yet to reach a level at which \u201cclosed regionalism\u201d could provide substantial gains. Deeper integration beyond AFTA is needed and less developed members of ASEAN should be helped, including through intra-ASEAN preferences, to become more competitive and engaged with global production, trade and investment networks. Participation in the global economy will help in raising GDP and standards of living in those countries and reduce economic and social disparities within the region. It should be noted, however, that significant differences between ASEAN and the EU prevent the former from emulating the latter in further globalization and South-East Asia will have to follow its own path to economic integration beyond the region. Trading arrangements of the ASEAN+1 or ASEAN+3 types could be useful in the absence of greater multilateral integration under the World Trade Organization but this requires further study. An area where South-East Asia could be more effective is in addressing the issues arising from greater economic integration at the global level. As a trading bloc, ASEAN is in a position to question the rules and institutional structures of globalization collectively, so lending its weight to other developing countries. Another important conclusion from the evidence in South-East Asia is that despite the gains from integration, convergence among the countries of the region has been limited and, in particular, countries that are lagging behind do not seem to be catching up. The reasons why some countries have gained from opening their economies and others, such as the CMLV countries and Timor-Leste, have not can be identified as resulting from shortcomings in social policy, poor macroeconomic policies, such as insufficient attention to physical infrastructure, an inappropriate approach to FDI, and weak governance and 6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 42 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation institutions. All four areas are in the realm of domestic or national policymaking. The absence of violence and wars, together with political stability, are also needed before countries can benefit from greater integration. Clearly, those constraints will have to be addressed before lagging countries can gain more from liberalization. Regional cooperation to promote social development and combat adverse effects of globalization This raises the question as to how domestic policy making could be influenced in order to promote regional and global economic integration. Regional cooperation, with its multiple approaches, can contribute significantly in this area. In this context, however, there is a need to resolve an important issue relating to the regulatory norms of ASEAN. South-East Asian countries will have to decide whether they should agree to a region-wide system of human rights to help countries achieve the critical threshold of development for integration to be successful. In this regard, the experience of the EU is relevant. It has been suggested that in Europe \u201crespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms should not be viewed as an objective to be pursued per se on a region-wide level but rather as a key component of any advanced cooperation and integration experience rooted in a regional model of society. The ultimate success of any regional integration arrangement would ultimately be guaranteed also by the full observance of human rights\u201d (Schiavone, 2001). Since the discussion of human rights is a very sensitive topic in South-East Asia, the focus could be placed on economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to work, the right to social security and the right to education, which essentially entitle the individual to ask for and obtain a series of benefits and services from the State. Labour and environmental standards could also be incorporated in this framework. The MDGs adopted by each country are an ideal foundation for a regional system of human rights. Establishment of this system of human rights at the regional level offers a chance to countries with a shared tradition and a common understanding of basic values to adopt their own version and to identify a proper enforcement machinery. Rights also lend moral legitimacy and the principle of social justice to the objectives of human development. The rights perspective helps shift the priority to the most deprived and excluded (UNDP, 2000). Details of this framework could be the subject of future studies and debate.

First, it will not be tainted by the perception that it is an imposition of Western democracies. Second, putting the standards down in black and white provides policy makers with a goal to strive for and civil society with a norm by which to measure the performance of Government. Last, and perhaps most relevant, a region-based system augments the accountability process since it opens the door to a peer review mechanism. The process of promoting and implementing such a regional system of human rights should be an integral part of regional cooperation. One suggestion is to establish a procedure similar to the ASEAN Surveillance Process and the Manila Framework Group.15 A peer review process can be established along the same lines for the region-based system of human rights, perhaps with an international organization being the outside observer. However, both the Surveillance Process and the Group have been criticized for being too informal and non-confrontational. A similar situation should be avoided with the system of human rights, otherwise it will lose its purpose and become a mere set of platitudes. Empirical studies have shown that although regional and global economic integration can promote economic growth, if countries are equipped to take advantage of the opportunities offered, it can also have an adverse impact on human development. In many cases, GDP has increased but so have income inequalities and \u201closers\u201d appear to outnumber \u201cwinners\u201d. In fact, several major concerns related to human development have emerged after the spread of globalization. In the case of South-East Asia, those concerns have arisen in areas such as labour standards and wage inequalities, poverty and income distribution, environmental standards, health and nutrition, education and skill formation, gender inequality and migration. Issues related to human development arising from globalization can be addressed through proper policy design in problem sectors and by 15 The ASEAN Surveillance Process operates on the principles of peer review and mutual interest among ASEAN member countries. It has two mechanisms: a monitoring mechanism that allows early detection of problems that might affect the economy, in general, and the financial sector, in particular; and a peer review mechanism that focuses on the policy measures needed to address the issues identified in the monitoring exercises quickly. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 43 documenting best practices and disseminating them to policy makers. Promoting the participation of civil society organizations in decentralized decision-making, organizing capacity-building and training and making adequate funds available to fight the adverse effects of globalization are other important steps that could be taken. Several regional and international institutions and organizations have initiated projects to promote regional cooperation in the field of human development in this region, in areas such as social development, poverty eradication, MDGs, urban governance, HIV/AIDS, energy and environment, disaster management, labour laws and social protection, and child labour. However, systematic studies of the impact of those projects on human development have not been undertaken so it is not possible to make a complete assessment of the efficacy of those programmes, although preliminary assessment is contained in Appendix II. ASEAN itself has initiated several projects related to regional economic as well as social cooperation in South-East Asia, to promote meaningful regional economic integration and human development. The main objective of ASEAN projects on economic cooperation is to deepen the integration of member countries into global investment and production networks rather than to increase intraregional trading links at the expense of extraregional economic relationships. ASEAN projects on social cooperation promote social development in the region, the major areas being rural development and poverty, the informal sector and microfinance, and social services. Again, no systematic studies are available on those projects for an assessment to be made of their impact. Promoting an enabling microenvironment A microenvironment favourable to human development entails the participation of empowered communities in decision-making through decentralized administrative structures. It is therefore related to the administration of the State and to the role of civil society organizations and both aspects can be influenced by functional cooperation at the regional level. The issues regarding administrative decentralization can be dealt with through cooperation at the level of States, while community participation requires the support of civil society organizations. There is a clear realization in the region regarding the importance of such organizations in enhancing regional cooperation as well as human development although studies on this subject are limited and further work will be needed before a strategy can be formulated for creating a favourable microenvironment.

Good governance has also been identified as a major factor explaining why some countries lag behind and why convergence in human development achievements in the region has been poor. There is, therefore, an urgent need to foster good governance in the region. \uf06c Funding for human development Related to governance is the issue of public expenditure on human development, which reflects the commitment of Governments to this issue. Steps should be taken to ensure that public expenditure on human development is adequate and regional funds available for helping countries raise spending in this area should be increased. 44 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation \uf06c Migration Migration of workers in search of work, much of which is temporary, is an important issue in human development that cuts across national boundaries. Efforts to help migrant workers need to be intensified. \uf06c Informal labour With increased labour market flexibility, workers in the informal sector have emerged as an important problem area. Not only is employment uncertain for those workers but they also have little or no social protection and they make up the most vulnerable segment of the labour force in South-East Asia. Conditions of work in the informal sector need to be improved on an urgent basis, particularly as women and children constitute an important part of the informal labour force and an important related issue concerns child labour. \uf06c Environmental standards Environmental depletion and degradation are closely related to human development. Since environment affects health and nutrition as well as livelihood of the poor, there is a need to focus on this issue for the purpose of promoting human development. \uf06c Civil society organizations Civil society organizations and community participation seem not to receive the attention they deserve. Since the participation of those organizations is critical for ensuring that the benefits of human development programmes reach all levels of society, there is a need to recognize and incorporate their role in human development strategies at all levels. \uf06c HIV/AIDS, transboundary diseases and disaster management Many countries in South-East Asia are grappling with a resurgence in HIV infections and the region has had to deal with SARS, avian influenza and the Indian Ocean tsunami within the space of a few years. All these issues pose serious threats to human health and human survival and there is considerable scope for regional cooperation on all of them. ASEAN has already initiated action in those areas but there is a need to intensify efforts and to allocate more funds to them. \uf06c CLMV and Timor-Leste South-East Asia\u2019s prosperity and well being hinge on bridging the gap between rich and poor countries in the region. There is a need to focus on the problems and constraints that hamper progress in the countries that have fallen behind. In this regard, making use of the human rights approach to foster human development may well be a good solution. There is a need to work intensively on promoting this approach so that efforts at the regional level can have a significant impact on those countries. The concept and content of regional integration and regional cooperation need to be sharpened so that they can play a greater role in deepening and broadening the benefits of human development for the people of South-East Asia. The region\u2019s own vision of a community of caring societies, bonded by the spirit of partnership, is certain to be achieved with the right approach and the right actions.

It is organized into four parts: Part 1 provides the overall regional development context within which the two Centres operated in 2006, while Part 2 highlights key achievements. Part 3 reflects on organizational and management issues. Finally, Part 4 looks at future opportunities and challenges based on lessons learnt in 2006. The Regional Development Context Dynamism, inequalities and resilience are defining a new Asia-Pacific. As other developments riveted the world\u2019s attention, Asia witnessed its own upheavals: constitutional crises in Fiji, Thailand and Timor- Leste that underscored the fragility of democratization; the nuclear ambitions of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Iran; a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan and a sharp upturn in civil war in Sri Lanka. The region also saw some positive developments, with Bhutan embarking on an indigenous democratization process and with Nepal averting a potentially debilitating and violent crisis and the parties entering into a constitutional dialogue.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdd22356-8c83-4092-bbc0-0cad0ca73d00": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdd22356-8c83-4092-bbc0-0cad0ca73d00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e2992b1df8862f9614a91b77cc09765f4deea7f03511177830a4e5a13e13829"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff8f3c51-594e-4bef-b19a-1f737546d2db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5d20946fb8eb0c2ab31980d63df1773f9e6d2dd7242f23f08e6524210d65729f"}}, "hash": "9559024ce66d2184d0f759fac61e932f73a49e2ae823b5acea98244844572cdd", "text": "Trade, massive build-ups of foreign exchange reserves and foreign direct investment combined to sustain the dynamism, deepen economic integration and expand regional cooperation.

Indeed, the dramatic growth of trade is cutting across geography, gender and occupations. FDI is pouring in: more than US$72.4 billion for China alone. Beijing likewise has greater than $1 trillion in foreign reserves, making it a major creditor in the global economy. A frenzy of bilateral and regional free trade agreements has important implications not only for the multilateral trading system but also for human development in the region as a whole. Amid the successes, dangerously rising inequalities represent the Achilles heel of Asia-Pacific and seriously threaten the region\u2019s overall achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Inequalities amongst and within nations have sharpened to where political stability is being undermined, and the limited gains of the Least Developed Countries have marginalized them in the global development debate. Severe gender inequities still exist in many countries; violence against women is widespread across the region, and women\u2019s participation in governance and decision-making requires further strong improvement. More than 1 billion people in Asia-Pacific lack access to energy, putting additional stress on the natural resource base. China and India\u2019s growing demand is having an impact on global energy prices, which is in turn putting fiscal pressure on many other countries, especially poorer nations in the region. As fossil fuel demand rises, climate change is making its impact felt more and more, with severe flooding and drought. At the same time, the HIV epidemic continues to spread, with three major characteristics in the region: increasing numbers of women are infected; stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS remains rampant; and access to essential HIV and AIDS medicines is limited to fewer than 1 in 5 of those who need them. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 3 On a more positive note, the resilience of the continent is reflected by the manner in which it has coped with devastating and increasingly frequent natural disasters. Indeed, the Indonesian response to the 2004 tsunami has demonstrated a strategic vision that is exploiting physical reconstruction to build potential for a lasting peace in long-suffering Aceh. And while the earthquake in northern Pakistan and India has not advanced peace in Kashmir as extensively, the event has served as a reminder of the common human bonds that remain deep, despite persistent tensions. UNDP, like other development agencies, is supporting countries during a changing environment of development assistance and finance. Poverty reduction initiatives are becoming all the more difficult to implement. New sources of finance are becoming available and must be tapped. Among them are private philanthropists, often linked with government support in areas such as global funds for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; international private flows, through the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol; and new donors from emerging economies such as China, Thailand and the Republic of Korea, as well as the countries of the Middle East. With a greater emphasis on the coherence among international development agencies, the United Nations\u2019 ambitious \u201cOne UN\u201d agenda is shaping the work of the Regional Centres. This work, and the Centres\u2019 sharpened programmatic and operational roles, thus support the four strategic priorities identified by the Administrator: \u2022 Helping guide globalization toward inclusive growth and sustainable development \u2022 Leadership and operational effectiveness in crisis prevention and recovery \u2022 Democratic governance, capacity development and institution building \u2022 Enabling a decentralized United Nations System to become more agile in its delivery, disciplined in its use of resources, and better able to regularly demonstrate significant results We now turn to the ways in which this was operationalized by the Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo during 2006. 4 Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 Part 2 Achievements in 2006 Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 5 2.1 Overview of Achievements and Services in 2006 A. Key Achievements Influencing Development Policy and \u201cOne UN\u201d agendas The Regional Centres introduced a strong UNDP flagship brand in 2006, the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, which represents a noteworthy annual regional public good. Based on external responses, the APHDR is proving instrumental as a regional platform for furthering an intellectual and advocacy agenda that supports and goes beyond the Millennium Declaration. The policy and advocacy impact has been considerable, both in the region and internationally, with 160 print and broadcast articles and nearly 18,000 web page loads in the last six months of the year. The Centres\u2019 efforts behind the MDG Initiative, as a part of the \u201cOne UN\u201d reform agenda, also came to the fore as a step toward deepening relations with United Nations Agencies around substantive issues.

Continued training workshops on costing, financing and modeling, are being organized exclusively for United Nations Agencies. Building Coalitions to Fight Corruption in Asia-Pacific 2006 saw the initiation of an \u201cIntegrity in Action\u201d Community of Practice that will serve as a forum for sharing and consolidating knowledge and information in the area of corruption and for advocacy and capacity development. A comparative study on institutional arrangements for combating corruption was made available as a practical tool for UNDP and other development practitioners. To augment these efforts, a network of trained journalists reporting on corruption is being created through a series of hands-on media development workshops involving reporters chosen by Country Offices across the region. Two Public Service Announcements on corruption were produced, one of which has been recognized as a leading innovative knowledge product and has run both internationally and nationally. It continues to be used in a range of regional MDG conferences and training workshops. These efforts will be further augmented in 2007 with the publication of the APHDR on corruption, a topic chosen by the Management Board in 2006. Cutting-Edge Analysis of the Impact of Trade Policies in Asia-Pacific A range of case studies and papers were prepared in the areas of public finance implications of trade policy reforms in Asia-Pacific LDCs; bilateral investment treaties; WTO agreements; and human development impact assessments of trade policies. Many of these important papers have been used and cited by various organizations, including ADB, UNCTAD and UNESCAP. A Nobel Laureate recognized their merit and requested the Trade Team\u2019s support his work on investment treaties. In addition, two flagship capacity development events in the trade area were organized. UNDP Trade Focal Points from 20 Country Offices, in partnership with UNDP Cambodia, led to the creation of a Community of Practice called the Trade Affinity Group, resulting in a rise in requests for Country Office support in trade-related programmes. Furthermore, an inter-governmental training was held in cooperation with SAARC to strengthen capacity to implement the Agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 6 Shaping Gender-Sensitive Policies The absence of gender sensitivity in programme and project planning, along with monitoring and evaluation, emerged as a common issue across the region. The groundwork for an Asia-Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Community of Practice was set up to provide a substantive and technical platform for monitoring, compiling and analyzing gender mainstreaming initiatives in the region. The ultimate aim is to use the information-sharing capability to help shape strategic directions for gender-sensitive programmes. The Centres continued to highlight the current availability and uses of gender data and why it is necessary for policy formulation in poverty reduction, while an important initiative on gender- based violence prevention also was launched. At the country level, policy advisory missions and gender mainstreaming training extended support to a more than a dozen Country Offices. Constitution Making in Asia How is it possible to adapt a constitution after new developments call into question its principles and values? That was the essential issue explored through an innovative pilot training course on \u201cConstitution Making in Asia,\u201d a partnership with International IDEA and the International Network on Constitutional Development. This knowledge-sharing opportunity included practitioners with extensive experience in constitution making; the 10-day intensive course covered both content and processes. Thirty participants from Maldives, Myanmar (including activists in exile), Nepal, India and Thailand offered their practical experience in constitutional affairs, including areas engaged in armed conflicts. They explored how constitutional provisions can address issues of discrimination and exclusion, which are often at the root of many contemporary conflicts, and how constitutions can acquire legitimacy and public consent. Rapid Response and Disaster Risk Reduction Following the earthquake in Indonesia, the floods in Thailand, and the landslide, oil spill and typhoon in the Philippines, the Centres responded immediately and rapidly to Country Offices. Working with United Nations Country Teams, the Centres undertook initial impact assessments and provided technical support to recovery coordination. Early-recovery projects also were developed. In Timor- Leste, governance and crisis prevention and recovery teams helped shape recommendations that the Secretary-General made to the Security Council on the future of the United Nations relationship to the country. The Centres facilitated Country Office resource mobilization efforts in support of minimizing conflict and emphasizing reconciliation efforts.

A framework for this approach was developed for China, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia. Yale University also collaborated with the Regional Centres to study the socioeconomic impact of stigma and discrimination in the region. A further highlight was the completion of a three-year regional effort on human trafficking, which benefited more than half a million people through sharing of information Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 7 and capacity-building in South Asia. In fact, more than 300 trafficked women and girls were rescued through project support, and more than 8,000 are on their way to improved lives with assistance for small-scale business opportunities. In addition, the largest broadcasting initiative on HIV in the region was launched, in partnership with the Asia Pacific Broadcast Union, involving 16 national broadcasters and facilitated by BBC World Service Trust and CNN trainers. Gender, Energy and Poverty The Regional Centre in Bangkok published a report entitled Will Tomorrow Be Brighter Than Today? It shed light on gender concerns relating to energy for poverty reduction in the Asia-Pacific region. The absence of gender-sensitivity in programme and project planning, along with monitoring and evaluation, emerged as a common issue across the region. The report provides a number of policy options to mainstream gender concerns into national processes. It offers insights into how to bring better access to energy services for all. Consolidation, Cooperation and Expansion 2006 proved to be a year of consolidation and expansion. All major gaps in staffing have been filled, and a more systematic relationship has been built between the staff of the two Regional Centres, substantially expanding information sharing as well as collaborative work. A major challenge for 2007 is how to ration and allocate the Regional Centres\u2019 resources, given the situation of high demand for services and an urgent need to establish transparent rules for prioritization of services. Balancing Regional Public Goods Provision and Inter-Disciplinary Support to Countries Lastly, 2006 exposed the pressure on Regional Centres to navigate the path between their twin mandates, providing both regional public goods and country-level support. The core strength of a country-based organization such as UNDP is the institutional framework of the Country Office, within a larger United Nations System. The focus on regional public goods therefore became stronger, while Country Office support efforts were delivered in a more integrated, inter-disciplinary manner. Even so, 2007 will require still sharper clarity on what is expected from the Regional Centres in order that both thrusts continue to be effectively addressed. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 8 B. Major Products and Services Delivered Policy Advisory Services As part of the calibration of regional public goods and services to Country Offices noted above, policy advisory missions comprise a major component of Regional Centre support. These are requests by COs for missions to support interventions designed to influence government policy and that result in recommendations aiming to influence government action with respect to a UNDP development priority. Examples may include designing a national MDG strategy, advising programme formulation or supporting national consultations as a resource person. Policy advisory services also include missions requested to provide advice to help ensure the technical soundness or quality of an output that the client is responsible for delivering. The Regional Centres undertook 327 country support and policy advisory missions covering all 25 Country Offices; of these, 77 percent were by the Regional Centre in Bangkok and 23 percent by the Regional Centre in Colombo. Figure 1: Policy Advisory Missions to Country Offices by Regional Centres Combined figures also show that, for the region as a whole, 23 percent of missions were in the area of Crisis Prevention and Recovery, followed by Democratic Governance (21 percent), Poverty (19 percent) and Energy and Environment (15 percent). Indonesia had the highest number of missions fielded with 39 missions.

The Regional Centre in Colombo fielded 76 missions to 23 Country Offices. Of these, 30 percent were in the area of Trade, close to 24 percent in the MDGI, 18 percent in Gender Equality, 12 percent in Human Development Report Unit and 9.2 percent in HIV/AIDS. From Colombo, Mongolia, with 9 missions received more missions than any other country. Capacity Building Events Building capacity in the region is very important to the work of the Regional Centres in order to enhance capabilities and networking of Country Office staff, their Governments, civil society organizations and institutions in priority development areas. The two Centres undertook 66 capacity building events, 33 by RCB and 33 by RCC. The highest number of events was in HIV/AIDS, accounting for 22 percent of activities, followed by Management (16 percent), Gender Equality (14 percent) and Democratic Governance (9 percent). Figure 4: Capacity Building and Training Events Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 11 Regional Programme Technical Consultations A further element of the Regional Centres\u2019 service delivery is technical consultations at the regional level. These are undertaken with critical stakeholders for input, endorsement, political or financial support on matters related to Regional Programme outputs and initiatives. The two Regional Centres undertook or participated as key resource persons in 153 technical consultations during 2006, with RCC representing 65 percent and RCB representing 35 percent of consultations. For the region, Trade and HIV/AIDS held the largest number of technical consultations, at 20 percent each, followed by ICT for Development at 18 percent and the Human Development Report Unit at 12 percent. Figure 5: Regional Programme Technical Consultations by Regional Centres Knowledge Resources Another key contribution of the Regional Centres is the creation and brokering of knowledge. The Centres produce knowledge resources, some of which proves to be strategic regional public goods, that serve to update knowledge about a specific issue, empowering people to provide informed advice on a specific knowledge domain. The two Centres produced 80 knowledge resources in 2006. Forty-nine (over 60 percent) were produced in Bangkok, of which nearly half were on ICT4D, while 31 (39 percent) were produced by Colombo. Work on an additional 10 RCC publications was finalized in 2006, but these still await printing. In particular, RCC was responsible for a number of high-profile, media-oriented regional publications such as the first Asia-Pacific Human Development Report and several cutting-edge trade reports analyzing the collapse of the WTO talks and the aftermath of the Multi Fibre Agreement. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 12 Figure 6: Knowledge products and resources produced by Regional Centres in 2006 Research Services Another arm of the Regional Centres\u2019 service to Country Offices is research, which comprises consolidated responses to requests for information, advice, or research support related to comparative experiences, good practices, and lessons learnt. In 2006, the two Regional Centres received and responded to 139 research queries. The most services were in ICT4D (27 percent), Democratic Governance (23 percent) and MDG-I (12 percent). Nearly two-thirds of the research queries were from Country Offices or Governments in Asia-Pacific, with slightly more than one-third from Country Offices outside the region and various units from UNDP Headquarters. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 13 Figure 7: Research Services by Regional Centres Access to Expertise Services With a rigorous screening process in place to ensure only high-quality experts are recommended, the business of expert recommendations remains a popular service of the Regional Centres, with 195 responses to requests in 2006. More than 70 percent of these went to Asia-Pacific Country Offices, with the rest serving other UNDP countries, UNDP networks and Regional Centres. Country Offices at the highest levels of service were primarily LDCs. Demand for expert recommendations was highest in the area of Democratic Governance, totaling more than 1 in 4 of all referrals.

At the technical level, a key aim of this Programme was to develop and apply analytical approaches and tools that could guide low-income country efforts in Asia and the Pacific to formulate national strategies for MDG achievement. A considerable amount of MDG-I resources were spent over the year in refining and applying the analytical approach \u2013 known as the Integrated Approach \u2013 for this purpose. A detailed needs assessment of various sectors of a country\u2019s economy, including infrastructure, energy and social sectors, was complemented by a macroeconomic framework to analyze what human, institutional and financial resources and capacities would be required to achieve the MDGs by 2015. The significant feature of this approach was that it allowed planners to assess how public investments required for the MDGs would affect macroeconomic stability, as well as the implications that a scaling-up of investment would have on economic growth, and consequently, on poverty reduction. To support planners and Ministry of Finance officials in using the results of such an exercise, capacity also was built by MDG-I to develop financing strategies that were MDG-consistent. Indeed, a critical element in design of the Programme was to use the results of the Integrated Approach to inform budgetary allocations and strengthen the links among poverty/MDG targets, plan priorities and budget allocations. Meanwhile, the Macroeconomics of Poverty Reduction (MPRP) project was merged with MDG-I, gradually winding down over the year. MPRP was brought to a close on 31 December 2006. This internal reorganization has provided greater coherence to RCC\u2019s substantive work. Unlike other Regional Programmes, the MDG-I is entirely focused on supporting activities at country level. It does so through the consolidated expertise available at the Regional Centres. In addition, MDG-I has invested in path-breaking research and development that makes available to Asia-Pacific Country Offices a unique integration of costing, financing, macroeconomics and policy advice. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 15 Over the year, scoping missions were undertaken by Programme staff to five countries (Mongolia, Bhutan, Cambodia, Afghanistan and China) to assess the support required by governments in rolling out an MDG-based national plan. A full rollout of the MDG-I was requested by the Governments of Mongolia and Bhutan. This meant building the capacities of national counterparts to undertake a needs assessment and costing exercise, institutionalize the macroeconomic framework, conduct MDG simulation exercises to identify and assess potential policy tradeoffs and options, and support MDG- consistent financing frameworks. Finalization of the results in Mongolia, during early 2007, is undergoing a rigorous quality check to ensure that the financial estimates are credible. In Bhutan, meanwhile, the Regional Centres are jointly working with the Government through MDG-I to consolidate the sectoral investment requirements for the MDGs, following a needs assessment in June. A mission in the first quarter of 2007 will support institutionalizing of the macroeconomic framework and engage in a policy dialogue with Government on the macro- and financing implications for an MDG-based national plan. All this will complement preparatory work for the MDG-based Tenth Five Year Plan. Despite scoping missions to Cambodia and Afghanistan, the rollout of support to these countries did not materialize for various reasons. In Afghanistan, a decision was taken by the Government to cost sectoral strategies for the full PRSP; however, sectoral strategies had yet to be developed, so the exercise was deferred. For its part, Cambodia had only recently implemented its National Strategic Development Plan 2006-2010. The UNCT decided to consider a different approach of identifying \u201cquick win\u201d measures, mainly to overcome deprivations in water supply and sanitation, education and health. The MDG-I provided technical support to several more countries, from Timor-Leste, Lao PDR, Nepal and Pakistan to China and countries of the Pacific. Notably, in Timor-Leste and China, support was provided to assist provincial governments in localizing the MDGs. In Timor-Leste, poverty profiles using MDG targets were employed to identify the kinds of poverty-mitigating measures needed in different districts, while in China, governments in five of the poorest provinces are using best practices from other countries to set MDG-based targets in provincial plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6041b0c8-5058-47f1-ba52-5a0499901b39": {"__data__": {"id_": "6041b0c8-5058-47f1-ba52-5a0499901b39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25346005989c9dead1c55c3da8b4b68fda5830715ebd817541b856747c280aca"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4f73bb6-f41c-4fba-8d8e-352bf2bb52c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "292c053e3f291e705d668e2f17cc121b3b73c16b2059057f5209c8a1174b5533"}}, "hash": "676179251e8277150cf71a69dec5b6bca564d4191d696373935c693f3e27f0c8", "text": "A workshop for the Pacific Islands has resulted in requests from three Pacific Island states to formulate MDG-based plans in 2007.

The MDG-I also published a regional cross-country case study with ILO on employment in Asia and completed a paper on MDG-consistent macroeconomic frameworks. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 16 A.2: Trade and Investment In 2006, the Trade Team pursued cutting-edge research, analysis and advocacy on trade policies and regimes based on trends and priorities in the region. These include policy support through the Integrated Framework or aid-for-trade initiatives; public finance implications of trade policy reforms; trade-related intellectual property and development; post-quota textiles and clothing and industrial adjustment; and the new regionalism of trade and investment agreements in Asia-Pacific. The team directed two flagship capacity development events, the first being a four-day orientation program in March 2006 for UNDP Trade Focal Points from 20 COs in partnership with UNDP Cambodia, which also led to the creation of a Community of Practice called the Trade Affinity Group (TAG). This event resulted in a remarkable growth in the number of Co requests to support their trade-related programmes. The second event was an inter-governmental training in May 2006, in partnership with SAARC, to strengthen capacity to facilitate the implementation of the Agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA). Both events were successfully executed with participation of not only several renowned experts but also all Trade Team professionals as resource persons. Overall, the team further enhanced its networking and outreach capacity in 2006, and its members were engaged in nearly 30 regional consultations as resource persons. A series of trade-related policy advisory missions or technical backstopping covered more than 20 UNDP Country Offices of the region. The team helped design new trade projects or contributed to aspects of project design and implementation in China, Nepal, Mongolia, DPRK, Philippines and Lao PDR. Technical backstopping was provided for COs in Thailand, Pakistan, Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka, Maldives, India, Samoa, Bangladesh and Malaysia. Two exploratory missions were conducted in Viet Nam and Fiji to suggest future interventions. The team also played an integral role in preparing technical inputs on trade and income poverty as part of the MDG-related missions in Afghanistan and Bhutan. In partnership with UNESCAP, the team led a large regional research effort on trade facilitation issues in the region. Turning to regional public goods, major case studies and discussion papers were prepared and disseminated on: i) Public finance implications of trade policy reforms in Asian LDCs; ii) bilateral investment treaties in South Asia and South-East Asia; iii) WTO agreements; and iv) Human Development Impact Assessment (HDIA) of trade policies. Several thematic and country studies on cooperative trade and industrial strategies (Flying Geese), as well as gender equality and trade, were initiated. The role of the team in producing these analytical outputs ranged from direct authoring to supervising researchers. Several of these studies have been used and cited by publications of various international organizations, including ADB, UNCTAD and UNESCAP, and have been extensively used by UNDP Country Offices. The team also was requested by a Nobel Laureate in Economics to provide inputs for his work on investment treaties. The Trade Team played a key role in contributing several rounds of substantive inputs and technical comments on the Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report 2006, Trade on Human Terms.

This important resource and policy advocacy instrument is the product of an intensive consultative process of theme selection, scoping, stakeholder consultations, research, peer review and feedback, drafts, publication, launch, dissemination and advocacy. As noted in the Key Achievements, based on external responses to the first annual report, the APHDR is proving instrumental as a regional platform for furthering an intellectual and advocacy agenda that supports and goes beyond the Millennium Declaration. Because of the inherently cross-practice nature of the unit\u2019s work, it builds bridges with other programmes in RCC, RCB, the Pacific Centre and other entities such as the Human Development Report Office, Bureau for Development Policy (BDP), UNESCAP, ADB, academia, central statistics offices (CSOs) and other stakeholder organizations. For example, the APHDR 2006, Trade on Human Terms, was a collaborative effort with contributions from a number of sources \u2013 BDP, the Trade Team and Macroeconomics of Poverty Research Programme, researchers, experts and regional institutions, and numerous stakeholders from the region. An ongoing relationship exists with ADB and UNESCAP, strengthened by the production of various studies. The themes for the HDRU\u2019s work take into account the dynamic and evolving reality that Asia-Pacific is the most rapidly changing, diverse region in the world. With changing conditions, ongoing development concerns are taking on new dimensions, and new development concerns are emerging. The unit\u2019s objective is to focus on inherently regional issues that are of concern to numerous countries, have sensitivities that are better addressed at a regional level, and/or have clear cross-border dimensions. With that in mind, Trade on Human Terms focused on one of the most relevant questions for this region: How can trade, an inherently \u201cfor-profit\u201d activity, benefit human development, and vice versa? After an extensive analysis of key trade-related themes, the report proposed a bold, new eight-point agenda relevant for national policies \u2013 even more relevant in light of the stalled Doha trade negotiations, which provides little hope of resolving difficult trade issues. The advocacy impact of the APHDR 2006 has been considerable, with demand so great that it led to high-level presentations to the U.S. State Department, the Ambassador\u2019s Circle in New York, and Stanford University, among others. Significantly, impact also has been seen in individual countries such as Cambodia, where the Minister of Commerce planned to use the report to persuade senior colleagues in government of the need to liberalize the Cambodian economy. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 18 In Asia-Pacific and around the world, media coverage on issues raised in the APHDR totalled more than 160 print and broadcast articles and nearly 18,000 web page loads by the end of the year. Coverage focused on \u2022 How free trade can widen inequalities, even as it accelerates economic growth and reduces poverty \u2022 How food security has become a major issue in the region, which has moved from a net food exporter to a net importer \u2022 The need to address concerns of Least Developed Countries, especially those that do not have much to export \u2022 Rising issues over \u201cjobless growth\u201d in some of Asia\u2019s most successful economies \u2022 How more successful countries, such as China, can do more to assist poorer countries in the region Corruption has been chosen as the theme for the APHDR 2007 and gender as the 2008 theme, following extensive consultations culminating in a decision by the Management Board. The HDRU propelled initial work on corruption across Asia-Pacific during the last half of 2006, including two critical sub- regional stakeholder meetings. It is also undertaking preliminary brainstorming with the Gender Team to begin refining the gender APHDR concept. In addition, the unit continued to handle two regional programmes (APRI and MDG-I) until mid-2006, when the MDG initiative was handed over to the new MDG-I Team upon completion of all major outputs. Also in 2006, the HDRU strove to refocus attention on the tangible human development gains that can be achieved through deeper economic integration and broader cooperation among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54ae5bf7-99cc-4404-989a-75f6c81768c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "54ae5bf7-99cc-4404-989a-75f6c81768c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43aa9b46764137b7cf96e54a254de021fa84d0990778c6509e01a66e168bc6be"}, "2": {"node_id": "296203eb-c86d-41e4-a7b4-927c46a6b0e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b79824a1b5c9e9a096fbe3fbd3019d1712764309170d2eec141b6d1749b86587"}}, "hash": "e142210eef8f76a9d1491a52ce66b00638cd4fb458ff31dd9b7843c748ff70bd", "text": "The report South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation: Deepening and Broadening the Benefits for Human Development highlights ways to bridge the gaps between the rapidly advancing countries in the sub-region and the contrasting experience of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam, which are lagging behind.

The fellowship aims to encourage these young students to analyze development issues from a human development perspective; contribute to theory, applications and policies, and push the frontiers of the discipline. This was extended to include a UNDP Human Development Media Fellowship, providing incentives for policy advocacy and dissemination of research in order to bring people to the centre of development debates and demystify complex issues. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 19 Since 2005, the pattern of HDRU support to clients, mainly Country Offices, has evolved from mostly expert referral services to more in-Unit, skill-based services. Missions, technical backstopping and research queries now dominate. The intellectual work of the Unit has found expression at country level as well as the regional level. Support to National Human Development Reports has included assistance to DPRK, in preparing the country\u2019s first \u201cQuality of Life\u201d Report; to Cambodia, in comments on the outline of its new NHDR; to Papua New Guinea, in technical backstopping on calculating Human Development Index (HDI) tables; to Afghanistan, on how to institutionalize human development into national education and curricula; and to the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific (RBAP), in reviewing NHDRs, with a gender focus. In addition, other regions called upon HDRU\u2019s leadership: the Regional Bureau for Arab States (RBAS), on good practices for the process of theme selection for the APHDR, and Rwanda, for comments on the Great Lakes Region HDR. Important missions for programme development and policy advice have included missions to DPRK, as noted above, and to Indonesia, to support development of an MDG programme. In addition, numerous papers and technical notes have been submitted to other United Nations agencies (WFP, UNICEF) and other regional programmes (MPRP/MDG-I). Responses have been given to a total of 16 technical backstopping requests and to 11 research queries. In addition to the HDRU\u2019s biggest achievement for the year, the first Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, Trade on Human Terms, other notable knowledge products from the team include the South East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation for Human Development, Asia Water Watch 2015: Are Countries in Asia on Track to Meet Target 10 of the MDGs? and Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDGs in Asia and the Pacific. A.4: Gender Equality Gender equality acquired greater salience in UNDP\u2019s agenda in Asia-Pacific in 2006. The first meeting of the Gender Advisory Board, along with establishment of a regional Gender Steering Committee, helped underscore the compact between the Administrator and the Director of the Regional Bureau. The choice of gender as the theme for the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report 2008 also reflected UNDP\u2019s strong commitment to the issue. The Asia-Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Programme (APGMP) served to turn the corporate Gender Action Plan into an integral and practical part of day- to-day work in the Country Offices, strengthening the consistency, coherence and quality of gender mainstreaming. Overall, the Gender Equality Team\u2019s work in 2006 was aimed at a) engendering economic policies and furthering women\u2019s economic rights, b) promoting gender-responsive governance and women\u2019s political rights and c) providing technical support and networking coordination to UNDP Country Offices and United Nations Country Teams. These strategic objectives were pursued through (1) providing support to Practice Teams and (2) providing support in designing and implementing capacity building in gender mainstreaming for Country Offices and their partners in governments, civil society, private sector and the media.

A unique opportunity for the team to think and act globally was provided at a joint community of practice meeting in Yerevan, Armenia, at which ideas for the first Asia-Pacific Gender Community of Practice were circulated [see below]. Policy advisory missions and gender mainstreaming training extended support to a number of Country Offices, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, DPRK, Fiji, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. Results have been primarily in the realm of development of CO gender action plans and gender mainstreaming strategies. The Gender Equality Team highlighted in its advisory services analysis of a wide range of good practices and lessons learnt to suit each country\u2019s particular perspective, enabling each CO to maximize its learning. Learning sessions also were organized at both Regional Centres to make staff more aware of gender issues in relation to their work. In addition, review of a number of publications produced by the two Centres and various Country Offices assured that policy recommendations stemming from such publications made reference to related gender issues. The Gender Equality Team brought to COs not only a conceptual framework in line with UNDP\u2019s global mandates in pursuing gender equality, but also technical expertise in gender mainstreaming in capacity development, programme and project formulation, and advocacy and networking. A series of steps taken in fostering close partnerships with gender focal points in COs resulted in boosting their competencies as well as deepening commitment to gender mainstreaming. Even so, more policy commitments must be supported at the country level. Attention to gender in country-level programming is still uneven. Although gender mainstreaming practices were initiated in a number of Country Offices, not all were followed through. An improved understanding is essential of how gender equality plays a central role in efforts to achieve the MDGs, so the Centres must become even more proactive on this front in 2007. The Gender Equality Team has begun consolidating its experiences from providing support services to Country Offices by setting up an Asia-Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Community of Practice. The substantive and technical framework for the Community of Practice was developed in 2006, with a view to launch the website in March 2007. The Community of Practice will provide a platform to the Country Offices in the region to exchange experiences and learn from each other, as well as to receive expert advice from the team. It also will enable the team to monitor, compile and analyze the gender Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 21 mainstreaming initiatives at the country level, with a view toward setting strategic directions for the region and ensuring standards in all initiatives. The Gender Equality Team\u2019s key knowledge product for 2006 was the production of the Development Case for Gender Equality - a regional think piece for UNDP staff to understand the multiple benefits of a long-term investment in gender equality. B. HIV/AIDS and Development The HIV Team\u2019s policy research, analysis and advocacy targeted issues driving the epidemic in the region in alignment with UNDP\u2019s role in HIV and human development; HIV and governance; and HIV, human rights and gender. Particular attention was given to trans-border issues of unsafe mobility and human trafficking; costing and integration of HIV into MDG-based national development strategies; developing the capacities of Ministries of Health and patent offices to adapt TRIPS flexibilities and safeguards for sustainable access to HIV medicines; and building commitment, capacity and leadership of national partners for generating multi-sectoral responses to HIV epidemics. Even as the HIV Team provided technical support to costing exercises in MDG-based national planning in Bhutan and Mongolia, developing a specific HIV costing tool represented a key initiative. A regional consultation on HIV costing was convened in November to examine existing tools, and a draft of the improved costing tool is to be finalized in early 2007. At the same time, the regional costing consultation also brought together leading specialists to develop options and methodologies for undertaking effective studies on the socioeconomic impact of HIV and AIDS at the macro and household levels. A framework was developed for China, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia. In collaboration with Yale University, the HIV Team also undertook an important study on the socioeconomic impact of stigma and discrimination in the region. In its work on mobility, the HIV Team lent technical support to the United Nations Regional Task Force on Mobility and HIV/AIDS Vulnerability Reduction in South East Asia.

The team also has received a request from SAARC to develop and implement a strategy on mobility and HIV in South Asia. In 2006, the HIV Team successfully completed a three-year regional project on human trafficking and HIV in South Asia.. The project benefited more than half a million people by bringing vital information, capacity, empowerment and an enabling environment to South Asia. More than 300 trafficked women and girls were rescued through activities supported by the project, and more than 8,000 were given assistance for small-scale economic activities. At the same time, a project to empower HIV-positive women was launched, with a focus on the economic burdens they face. Partners include the Thailand- based Population and Development Association and groups of women from Cambodia, China and India. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 22 The HIV Team undertook several key capacity building initiatives in 2006: Through a regional workshop with WHO and the Third World Network, UNDP was able to strengthen capacity of CSOs and key government officials from 11 Pacific countries in adopting TRIPS flexibilities and safeguards to secure sustainable access to HIV medicines. At an important capacity development event for Country Offices, HIV focal points from 20 countries received training in the areas of HIV response where UNDP has been designated as lead agency. Emerging best practices, as well as challenges, were shared from across the region. These exchanges helped shape the new Regional Programme, while closer synergies were built for regional and country-level initiatives in 2007. A large-scale programme for generating multi-sectoral HIV responses was rolled out in five countries. This strengthened the decentralization of Mongolia\u2019s HIV response, ensured that leaders in Lao PDR and Viet Nam are committed to HIV response as a national priority, and mobilized women and youth for strengthened national and sub-national responses in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Notably, the largest-ever broadcast initiative on HIV in the region was launched, in partnership with Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union. Three production workshops, involving 16 national broadcasters and facilitated by BBC World Service Trust and CNN trainers, were held before the final products were launched on World AIDS Day. The films are being telecast by national broadcasters across the region; an international package, with subtitles and English voice-over, is being made available for use by Country Offices. At the 16th International AIDS Congress in Toronto, the HIV Team helped unveil a global Red Ribbon Award for outstanding leadership and action on HIV and AIDS. Together with BDP, the team also created a community dialogue space where emerging best practices in HIV were shared, and where local-global dialogues were brokered between community activists and HIV leaders. Four important symposia and two satellite sessions on human rights, law, macroeconomics, poverty, resources and mobility, organized by the team, were broadcast globally and reached more than 1 million viewers. Policy advisory support on HIV/AIDS was provided either directly to Country Offices and joint United Nations programmes, or to other stakeholders through regional events. Policy advice was provided to Samoa to assist in formulation of the UNDAFs for 12 Pacific nations; Indonesia, for review and formulation of a strengthened National AIDS Commission, as well as the design of 15 project districts under the national programme; Mongolia, to help design and execute a Government-hosted meeting of 12 low- prevalence countries; and Pakistan, to help assess how best to strategically position UNDP\u2019s work and engagement on HIV. Four types of key knowledge products were created. In order to help CSOs undertake initiatives to prevent trafficking and HIV, the team produced a Trafficking Training Manual based on four years of experience in the field, both at the policy and community levels. The team also prepared a rapid assessment, a reference publication looking at the trafficking and HIV situation in South Asia that explores policy and programme options. Another key knowledge product nearing completion is the MDG-HIV Needs Assessment Guide, to be used in conjunction with the other MDG needs assessment processes in MDG-I rollout countries. The year 2006 also saw the production and dissemination of the film Celebration of Life, which advocates against stigma and discrimination; this has been made available in 24 regional languages. Also released was Bring Her Home, a short advocacy film on trafficking and HIV. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 23 C.

Decentralization and Local Governance, Public Administration Reform and Anti-Corruption, and Aid Coordination were most requested areas, and a total of 82 missions to Country Offices were fielded in 2006. Country Office support services were of a more cross-disciplinary nature in 2006, as evidenced in the support provided to Afghanistan and Timor-Leste. In Afghanistan, an RCB-led team formulated a strategic governance framework building on the National Development Plan. This resulted in the establishment of entire new cluster programmes in the areas of public administration reform, decentralization and local governance, access to information and ICT, parliamentary and judicial sector reform., including the new $43 million Afghanistan Sub-National Governance Programme, the 2.3 million US$ Accountability and Transparency project (ACT) and an important agreement by the donors and Government to establish a Capacity Development Facility for Afghanistan. In Timor-Leste, a multi-disciplinary team from RCB (governance and crisis prevention and recovery) and RCC provided support to the UN Assessment mission headed by the UN Special Envoy. In addition, a twinning of advisory support in Public Administration Reform with the Capacity Development team provided sustained support in the area of public sector management. With UNCDF support, a policy on local government was also adopted, which secured $2 million co-funding from Irish Aid. Additional examples of multi-service line support are found in advisory services provided to Bhutan, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Nepal during the course of 2006. In Bhutan, alongside RCC advisors, the RCB team helped align the Tenth Five Year Plan with the Millennium Development Goals [see also MDG-I] and supported new strategies for decentralized pro-poor service delivery, while building capacity for Bhutan\u2019s newly established Anti-Corruption Commission. In Cambodia, technical support and policy advice focused on evaluating and developing a new parliamentary programme, and formulation of anti- corruption strategies. In Nepal, policy advice on a new justice sector programme was complemented with assistance in formulating the joint UN-Donor Local Governance and Recovery Programme, helping establish a national policy on \u201cMinimum Conditions and Performance Measures\u201d for local governments. In Mongolia, again through MDG-I, we contributed to the formulation of priorities and costing initiatives designed to advance national goals with respect to its MDG-9 targets related to deepening democracy, protecting human rights, and zero-tolerance towards corruption. Country Offices in Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and Vietnam, also received policy advisory support on strengthening national policy frameworks for indigenous peoples. In China, we joined the European Union in advising on a pioneering programme, linking civil society developments with critical reforms in the justice sector. In Bangladesh, we helped upgrade a joint pilot project with the UN Capital Development Fund into a $200 million national local governance support programme, co-funded by the government, the World Bank and other donors. Advisory support to the Government of Maldives resulted in the policy and drafting of legislation to establish democratically elected local councils. In Vietnam, we supported the process of finalizing the multi-donor funded support project for the implementation of the Public Administration Reform Master programme. And in India, we helped adjust the strategic direction of the next national planning cycle in the areas of decentralization, local governance and ICT portfolio, and supported the access to justice programme. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 24 Advice was provided to Asia-Pacific COs in formulating strategies for preparation of expression of interests (EOIs) for the Democratic Governance Trust Fund tranche of 2007. COs in this region submitted a total of 20 EOIs of which 19 were approved for funding totaling $1,935,000. In 2006, the Centre\u2019s Democratic Governance programmatic efforts focused on three development outcomes: a) effective representation; b) access to justice; and c) transparency and accountability. The main actions of the Asia Regional Governance Programme and the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme included policy research and codified lessons; consolidating and expanding networks for enhanced learning and knowledge sharing; engaging in advocacy on development priorities, particularly through greater use of the media; and continuing to provide technical and advisory support to COs in the region.

Indigenous women from Myanmar and the Philippines benefited from training sessions of the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme in partnership with the Asia Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Pact and the Asia Pacific Gender Mainstreaming Programme. A Training Manual has been developed and will be published in 2007. The Programme partnered with national statistical offices in two pilot projects on data dis-aggregation as an effective tool for targeted programming towards MDG attainment in Nepal and the Philippines. RCB, working with the UNDP Global Parliamentary Strengthening Programmme, and the International Parliamentary Union, commissioned and disseminated 7 national case studies and a regional report on the Role of Parliaments in Crisis Prevention and Recovery. Guidelines for the international community on how to integrate parliamentary development, conflict prevention and post-conflict recovery strategies were also produced. Access to Justice programming focused on capacity building initiatives and building knowledge networks. Partnering with the global HURIST (Human Rights Strengthening) programme, a consultation was convened on a Human Rights Community of Practice bringing together CO staff from nine countries with resource persons from BDP, UNICEF, UNESCO and UNIFEM to identify strategic issues to advance human rights based programming and support to human rights institutional capacity development. An action plan for 2007 has been developed, including a collective demand driven decision to map Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) initiatives in the region, engage in human rights reviews of programming, undertake capacity assessments of human rights related institutions, and provide training for staff in COs. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 25 Constitutional Making in Asia emerged in 2006 as another pioneering initiative for the region, with the ground-breaking 10-day intensive training course focusing on practical experience in constitutional affairs and similar regional learning and advocacy courses focused on the concerns of other countries, especially in the Pacific, as well as demand-driven, in-country courses in Maldives and Nepal, and practical knowledge resources in the topic. The RCB, in partnership with the Philippines Supreme Court and the Federal Court of Australia, established an Asia-Pacific Judicial Reform Network (APJRF), which has also been awarded a UN Democracy Fund grant. The network comprising the supreme courts of 18 Asia-Pacific countries is the first of its kind and it is expected to share substantial knowledge on strategies for judicial reforms aimed at improving the accessibility of courts to people, especially those who are indigent and otherwise disadvantaged. The APJRF will as another of its key outputs, prepare a Handbook on Judicial Reforms working closely with its constituent members. Combating Corruption In the area of Accountability and Transparency a number of high-profile knowledge products and regional training events were produced in 2006. Studies on corruption and deficiencies in integrity, and related programme development were conducted in Afghanistan and Laos. A Comparative Study on Institutional Mechanisms for Combating Corruption was published in 2006, disseminated to COs and partners in the region, and translated into Mongolian and Khmer. Substantive leadership on the 2007 RHDR (Regional Human Development Report) on Corruption involved the preparation of the background paper for regional stakeholder consultations and advice on themes, resource persons and oversight for quality control for selected background studies. The Centre\u2019s communications and governance expertise was leveraged for a training event for 10 countries which linked anti-corruption strategies and media development. In concert with MDG-I, a project for building anti-corruption capacities for implementing the MDGs will be piloted in four countries, in partnership with Korean institutions. The two Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on Anti-Corruption, launched at the 2006 Management Board meeting have been proven to be a broadcast success [see also Communications and Programme Advocacy]. Local level adaptation and national broadcasting is expected to continue in 2007. Also in 2006, the Programme, partnered with the Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) and the UN Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD) in Building Capacity for Asia Pacific e-Government Initiatives. 20 case studies from 12 countries analyzed the challenges of utilizing national e-government initiatives for poverty reduction goals. Tracking Aid Programming in the area of Aid Coordination and Management produced tangible results in 2006. The Centre hosted a regional workshop, From Paris to Practice: Tools for Better Aid Management, harnessing lessons learned from 16 countries in the region and from donor and research partners including Asian Development Bank, United Kingdom Department for International Development, and the Overseas Development Institute.

The Centre backstopped the Philippines Country Office in the formulation and launch of a pilot model to improve access to safe drinking water in poor urban communities. Similarly, in India, the Centre helped formulate and launch a project on devising partnership mechanisms to supply raw materials for a waste-to-energy plant in Southern India. And in Bhutan, we advised the Country Office on ways to upscale a solid waste management project in Thimphu and formulate a Public-Private Partnership policy framework. Regionally, we developed and disseminated practical tools and guidelines on pro-poor Public-Private Partnerships and are planning for a regional project to support the development of innovative and flexible financing mechanisms and instruments that facilitate the flow of financial resources from households and communities, local commercial banks and other domestic sources to pro-poor Public- Private Partnership projects in urban services delivery. D. Energy and Environment Through close integration of activities funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UNDP core resources, including regional programme and trust funds, countries were assisted to address a broad spectrum of environmental challenges, as well as help countries and communities maintain and benefit from biodiversity and ecosystem functions and access to energy services. Activities concentrated on mainstreaming E&E in national development plans based on the MDGs, expanding access to energy services for the poor and empowering governments and local communities to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services. A new business plan emerging from a June 2006 Global EEG meeting in Goa, India, consolidates our work under two strategic pillars: 1) mainstreaming environment and energy; 2) catalyzing environmental finance. Revisions to the business plan are ongoing. GEF, MP, Climate Change, etc. will continue under the new Environment Finance Group (EFG), maintaining focus on traditional thematic areas as well as adaptation to climate change for SIDS and LDCs. There will be a particular focus on facilitating access to adaptation funds for Pacific Island States and LDCs. In preparing for GEF-4 significant restructuring is anticipated. Slow start-up and capacity weaknesses within COs and governments continue to impact 1 See http://www.tsunamitracking.org/undprcb/ 2 Additional information about the Programme is available at: http://pppue.undp.org/ Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 27 delivery rates and effective implementation of projects that have meaningful impacts on the global environment. A key focus will be to improve systems of delivery and capture of impacts through improved monitoring systems. Despite institutional and legislative developments, environmental challenges continue to erode the well-being of the people and threaten the sustainability of economic growth in the region. A top priority will be to ensure coherent integration of environmental considerations into sectoral planning and budgets. We will continue to assist COs and government agencies to meet MDG targets, and work with partners towards integrating strategic priorities, support countries in their transition to new funding frameworks, partake in joint missions and improve tools and processes required for more effective MDG based strategy preparation and implementation. Despite progress, environmental challenges continue to erode the well-being of people and threaten sustainability of economic growth in the region. In 2006, the Regional Energy Programme for Poverty Reduction (REP-PoR) developed policy options and advocacy for equitable access to energy services at the regional, sub-regional and national levels. Five project documents were submitted for a global Thematic Trust Fund on Energy. Regional studies were conducted on the impact of oil price rises, providing public policy options to protect the poor from adverse impacts and promote investments in alternative energy sources. Sixteen Country Office staff from the region were media trained using the findings, as part of the Centre\u2019s efforts to support national level advocacy work on access to energy services for the poor.

Twenty-one countries responded to a survey of experiences and key issues. The resulting strategy offered options to leverage carbon finance, including the CDM for accelerating poverty reduction. In land management and biodiversity, the Centre, along with the International Centre for Mountain Development, brought together 40 participants from five countries for a conference in Nepal on rangeland policy. The Centre, in partnership with the World Conservation Union (IUCN), raised an initial $10.2 million for the Mangroves for the Future (MFF) Initiative. MFF marshals the efforts of six tsunami-affected countries in the Indian Ocean Region (five in Asia and one in Africa) to conserve and restore coastal ecosystems to sustain human livelihoods, increase resilience and reduce vulnerability. The UNDP-IUCN team developed a comprehensive five-year strategic framework. Scaling-up the Poverty and Environment Initiative (PEI) helps countries fight poverty through sound and equitable environmental management, partnership building, and knowledge sharing at local, national and global levels. The Centre has been instrumental in forming partnerships to expand the Mekong Community Dialogues Initiative, a cross-border, community-to-community network providing a platform to advance issues that directly affect livelihoods. During 2006, Energy and Environment (E&E) specialists assisted countries to address a broad spectrum of environmental challenges. The Centre concentrated on mainstreaming E&E into national development plans based on the MDGs, expanding access to energy services for the poor, and empowering governments and local communities to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 28 Sustainable Land Management The Centre undertook 77 missions throughout the region. Specialists from the Centre aided in developing comprehensive E&E programme strategies for UNDP Country Offices in Bhutan, and India; provided policy advice on land management and biodiversity to Nepal; rolled out integrated services in Cambodia; and, through the MDG-I, assisted Country Offices in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Mongolia and Bhutan to strengthen MDG needs assessments and mainstream E&E into national planning. Centre specialists assisted the Country Office in Cambodia to develop a programme framework for an E&E cluster, as well as helping to draft a sustainable land management programme approach that integrates initiatives from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) rural development and GEF/ Sustainable Land Management (SLM). Technical support on energy for sustainable development was provided to Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Nepal and Timor-Leste under the Energy Thematic Trust Fund (TTF), influencing project document design which successfully mobilized $694,606. The Global Environment Fund team provided technical support in formulating and submitting project proposals, resulting in, significant amounts of resources that will be programmed through UNDP. For example, 90% of Thailand\u2019s allocation will be UNDP-implemented. GEF undertook the formulation of SLM policy mainstreaming and capacity building projects in six LDC/SIDS countries in Asia and 14 in the Pacific ($1m each for GEF with $1m co-financing), designed to catalyze UNDP and bi-lateral funding for sustainable land management. Under the Montreal Protocol (MP) the Centre provided policy support to the Fiji Multi-Country Office on chemicals management, as well as the Government of Bangladesh to phase out the use of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the manufacture of metered dose inhalers. Policy advice was also provided at regional network meetings in Bangkok, Jakarta, and Sri Lanka to share experiences and provide guidance to governments to phase out ozone depleting substances. In addition to the Centre\u2019s report entitled Will tomorrow be brighter than today?, which highlighted key gender issues in energy for poverty reduction and provided a number of policy options to mainstream gender concerns in national processes, dvocacy reports covering 14 Asian and 15 Pacific countries were completed.

This was accomplished with support from the Regional Capacity Building Program for Recovery in Tsunami-Affected Countries. In Sri Lanka, more than 4,000 historical disaster data cards have been compiled and validated. Through exceptional cooperation with the Indian State of Tamil Nadu, more than 10,000 historical data cards have been collected, analyzed and shared with key technical agencies and government officials from each district. In Indonesia, historical data collection has been slow, but 2,500 data cards have been collected and results of the preliminary analysis were presented to national authorities. In Thailand, working with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, data for the last five years has been collected. The Centre assisted district governments to quickly identify and mobilize available resources during emergencies, by supporting Maldives and Sri Lanka to adapt the India Disaster Resource Network system, which provides an on-line inventory of resources (equipment, expertise, and supplies) available at the district level. The Centre organized a series of learning events in participatory community-based multi-hazard risk mapping to help build capacity in Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. This included training of trainers to support Community-Based Early Warning Systems. A total of 890 national and sub-national officials have been trained across the region. In regional policy development, the Centre commenced a comparative review of institutional legislative systems. The analysis will identify gaps and outline policy options for decision makers. In cooperation with UNESCO-IOC, the Centre ensured participation of officials from tsunami-affected countries in the \u201cPacific Wave 06\u201d drill exercise in the Philippines, and subsequently in Indonesia. Following this exercise, the Centre produced a manual on Standard Operating Procedures on Tsunami Early Warning. The Centre helped develop and launch the Maldives Risk Profile. This project met the need for a comprehensive study of the risks associated with multiple hazards facing the country. Similar support to three states in India led to the development of disaster databases to identify hazard risks at disaggregated geographical levels and allow for specific mitigation measures. Sub-regionally, in collaboration with the Asia Disaster Preparedness Centre, the Centre developed and mobilized \u20ac256,683 for a joint program on disaster risk mainstreaming in the education sector. The program is targeted at Lao PDR, Cambodia and the Philippines. Following sudden crises in Indonesia (earthquake), Thailand (floods), the Philippines (landslide/oil spill/ typhoon), and the resumption of conflict in Timor Leste, the Centre responded immediately and rapidly to Country Offices. Working with country teams, the Centre undertook initial impact assessments and provided technical support to recovery coordination, as well as to develop early recovery projects. The Centre worked with the Bangladesh Country Office to develop program strategies for sustainable peace in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In Papua New Guinea the Centre collaborated with country teams to finalize a preparatory assistance project document and facilitated its funding. Working closely with Country Offices, the Centre formulated courses of action to address gaps and constraints in mine action policies and plans in Iran, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 30 Mapping Disaster Risk In the Philippines, the Centre helped develop a project proposal for disaster risk mapping and mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into development planning at sub-national levels. The Centre worked with national authorities in Sri Lanka to publish \u201cRoad Map for Disaster Risk Management Volume II\u201d, which advocates a developmental approach towards disaster risk management. Technical support from the Centre aided Bhutan\u2019s development and launch of its National Disaster Risk Management Framework. The Centre played a key role in conceptualizing, developing and delivering the Capacity Building Initiative for Entry Level DRM Practitioners in India. A key tool for enhancing the effectiveness of the Disaster Risk Management Programme in India, its success led to its institutionalisation within UNDP, and it will be contextualised for Sri Lanka and Pakistan in 2007. Harnessing regional skills and capacities, the Centre helped establish the Global Facility for Community Based Disaster Risk Management, enabling national- and community-level capacity building.

The publication Gender Dimensions in DRM: a Guide for South Asia was translated into Urdu and disseminated in Pakistan. We also produced a concept and terminologies booklet entitled On Better Terms to strengthen linkages between those working in DRM and climate change. The Regional South- South Cooperation Unit published a Handbook on Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction with Local Governance. F. Management Practice The High-Level Panel Report to the former UN Secretary-General has now been released, and the probable outlines of overall UN system reform are becoming clearer. With that report as a reference point, UNDP is now moving ahead to clarify its own internal change architecture, one component of which will be an updated position on the Management Practice Team (MPT) concept, including its place in an approach to regionalization. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 31 What has remained stable thus far, however, is the perception from both CO and Headquarters staff of the need for stronger management performance and support at this critical point in the evolution of the UN system - and of UNDP. The key issues therefore are most likely to be: (a) sharpening of agreement on work priorities, (b) elaboration of new funding arrangements, and (c) broadening the array of services offered. As UNDP builds up Management Practices in other regions, it may also be expected that inter- regional support initiatives will begin to appear. In early 2006, the Centre conducted a web-based survey of issues and priorities for the COs of the region. The results are shaping the staffing and activity planning, with current priority being given to procurement and finance. Though the MPT is primarily focused on improving the managerial capacities of UNDP COs, we provided on-site assistance to Afghanistan to design the staffing and reporting arrangements of three major governance and capacity development programmes. A week-long workshop focusing on Atlas productivity (Finance, Human Resources, Procurement) was hosted in Bangkok in collaboration with the Bureau of Management. Over 100 participants from 24 COs participated in the various tracks, including 35+ DRRs, both Operations and Programme. DRR participation was unique to the RBAP workshop. Regional COs placed top priority on programme and project management support. The Centre emphasized Capacity for Efficient Delivery for Achievable Results (CEDAR/RMG) Project roll outs, starting with Prince2. As a result, the RBAP and RCB established a distinct leadership role in this area. We visited 87% of the COs to support the CEDAR/RMG process. In fact, our regional missions account for fifty per cent of all CEDAR related visits to COs within UNDP. Enrolments and completion of the PRINCE2\u2122 foundation and RMG courses greatly exceed the levels achieved elsewhere in UNDP. The Centre supported CO and project management initiatives through missions to Cambodia (2), Afghanistan, India, Timor-Leste (2), Mongolia, Laos (2), Sri Lanka (2, of which one was an UNDAF workshop for the UN Country Team ), Indonesia (2), Fiji, Pakistan, Bangladesh (2), Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines (2), China, Republic of Korea, Myanmar (2), Samoa (2), Maldives, Thailand and Bhutan. Recovering Costs A former Regional Information Manager was contracted to provide on-site support to COs on a cost- recovery basis: Three missions were undertaken under this arrangement (Timor-Leste, Nepal, Iran). In the 4th quarter the Centre conducted an ICT status survey for the region, with 24 COs participating. The report, released in January 2007, will provide the basis for the development of a regional ICT strategy in 2007. Also, information gathered from the survey will provide the starting point for a regional ICT resource roster. Based on regional CO demand, the Centre developed and submitted to Headquarters a proposal to establish a Regional Chief Procurement Officer (RCPO) function. This was approved in late 2006, and the Regional CPO is to be recruited and placed in the first quarter of 2007.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01f0bd46-afd5-4724-ab8a-a19efdea7b92": {"__data__": {"id_": "01f0bd46-afd5-4724-ab8a-a19efdea7b92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d07446502fc18272e02ab05648087df95e695922292e11ae44d2362879626674"}, "2": {"node_id": "24283986-3cfb-4863-8dcb-96e2e959bfc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03d0d1ea0da1d770a2d6fb5b7c68c76565e6a51841d969ac386e729f868c0118"}}, "hash": "57c9f46e5c0c862e57aa7749ee95c02bd8b1ef1b7d318451e5ce50e086c1d5d8", "text": "Thirteen COs in the region attended a special workshop in Bangkok that addressed Atlas bank reconciliation issues.

The Centre must remain engaged with its various constituents to ensure that it completes its emergence into a sustainable and valued partner and support mechanism for regional management activities. This is the cornerstone of the Centres\u2019 efforts to help COs become more effective partners in development. The movement toward a UN \u201cdelivering as One\u201d will have a definite and direct impact on the Management Practice, which has thus far focused primarily on issues internal to UNDP. It may be expected that the next generation of MPT will be required to engage in cross-agency operational issues, and MPTs in regional centres should be well-positioned to do this. G. Cross-Cutting Areas G.1: Knowledge Services Knowledge sharing is a binding thread through all Regional Centre support services. Development effectiveness depends on appropriately promoting, coordinating and supporting knowledge sharing across Country Offices, the Regional Centres and partners in Asia and the Pacific. The key challenges with respect to the Regional Centres\u2019 knowledge sharing mandate in 2006 were: i) how to enhance knowledge sharing and collaboration within/across regions and between regional and global levels; ii) how to capture diverse country experiences and translate these into useful policy advice and programming; iii) how to create relevant and high-quality knowledge resources and ensure the effective application of their content at the country level; and iv) how to embed KM into UNDP\u2019s business processes at the regional and country levels. With limited resources available, and given the decentralized structure of UNDP and ensuing dispersion of knowledge across a wide and diverse geographical base, the Regional Centres strategically focused on building regional networks and Communities of Practice (COPs), enhancing CO access to UNDP- external expertise, creating select knowledge resources, providing research support to COs (comparative experiences), building CO and Regional Centres\u2019 KM capacity, developing a regional knowledge sharing and collaboration portal, and partnering on KM regionally. The Regional Centres built 15 regional Communities of Practice in 2006, with members internal and external to UNDP and the United Nations System. Overall, these live communities of practitioners have contributed to improved regional service delivery and knowledge base, regional policy development, and value addition to CO processes through focused learning and sharing of experiences and knowledge. At the country level, the Centres have actively promoted and supported the adaptation of India\u2019s Solution Exchange, with the first case in Bhutan. Through a unique partnership with Microsoft, the Regional Centres have developed a regional portal that will serve as a regional knowledge base and, more importantly, a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration within and beyond the region. The Centres have also developed a regional service tracker to monitor and report on services as well as to improve collaboration and coordination across Centres. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 33 With respect to the 49 knowledge resources produced at the Regional Centre in Bangkok, 41 percent (20) were in the domain of ICT for Development, with 20 percent in Democratic Governance (10). Seven products were produced on Capacity Development, 4 each on Management and Energy and Environment with the rest covering areas in PPSD and South-South. Of the 31 knowledge resources originating from the Regional Centre in Colombo, 42 percent (13) were produced by the HDRU and 35 percent by Trade (11) and the rest by KST, MDGI, HIV and Gender Equality [see also Figure 6, under Section 2.1, Part B]. In addition to Practice-related publications, the Centres also produced knowledge resources that are disseminated on a regular basis to meet the information and knowledge needs of COs (e.g,. biweekly donor intelligence briefs, quarterly development e-bulletins, and quarterly collections of good practices). The Centres also developed consolidated replies and comparative research papers as part of research support service to COs. In 2006, the Centres provided 139 research services to COs [see also Section 2.1]. At the country level, the Centres have begun rolling out the WIDE roster, starting with Afghanistan, and have supported the UN Heads of Agencies in Bangkok to set up the first common United Nations System expert roster. CO staff exchanges (7) continued to be brokered through the Mutual Support Initiative.

The Centres will continue to provide flagship knowledge services to COs while regional Communities of Practice will become a centrepiece of KM efforts in the region. These have proven in 2006 to be a powerful, efficient and effective way to work jointly with other United Nations Agencies to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration, while at the same time strengthening UNDP\u2019s practices in the region by contributing to policy development and supporting the core work of Regional Programmes. To guide the overall implementation of KM in the region, in the context of United Nations reform and an evolving KM effort at the corporate level, the Centres will seek to have a framework in place in 2007. It is clear the potentials for KM in the region are still not fully tapped, but it is hoped that through more cross-regional sharing of KM experiences, good practices and collaborations, as well as directional guidance and support from HQ, the Centres will be able to more effectively address other key issues related to knowledge sharing. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 34 G.2: ICT for Development Regional Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D) needs are shifting from awareness-raising and multi-stakeholder dialogues to strategic sector planning, implementation of pro- poor e-governance strategies, capacity building, and development of relevant low-cost ICT applications. Progress of ICT4D initiatives must be monitored closely and evaluated, and further engagement with national counterparts and Country Offices are essential to ensure that these initiatives are, in fact, achieving the development priorities of the countries. In line with this, the Regional Centres plan to strengthen their work in capacity building, pro-poor e-governance and development, and promotion of low-cost ICT applications for poverty reduction. In 2006, the Asia Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) continued to help countries target and focus regional ICT initiatives to achieve the MDGs by making ICT an integral part of development cooperation and solutions to address governance, economic, social and digital divides in more innovative and effective ways. A significant number of partnerships were fostered in order to carry out the regional programme on ICT4D. In 2006, $527,611 in cost sharing funds were approved.. With funding from the International Development Research Centre, three new sub-regional International Open Source Network (IOSN) Centres of Excellence were established to address the growing needs of the region for low-cost/ alternative technological solutions. Together, these IOSN Centres of Excellence are undertaking research and development, institutional strengthening, capacity building, and networking in sub-regional activities related to alternative low-cost technologies. In addition, the Regional Centres\u2019 e-governance and A2I initiatives undertaken in 2006 were implemented in partnership with either UNDP Country Offices, sister UN agencies, government agencies, CSOs and/or the private sector. The Centre continued to actively engage in policy dialogue and development activities. In Afghanistan, it contributed to the review of the ICT portfolio and in formulating a new programme on ICT for Development and Access to Information. This facilitated and strengthened the Country Office\u2019s expansion of its governance programme to the sub-national level. Similarly in India, the Centre undertook a mid- term assessment of local governance, access to information and ICT4D portfolio. This resulted in the alignment of ICT4D and e-governance to corporate priorities and government interventions in the field. Overall, e-government initiatives promoted in this area will eventually help to reduce transaction costs of development services. A wide range of audiences benefit from the team\u2019s knowledge products: national government counterparts, COs, parliamentarians, universities and schools, and broadcasters. The Centre continues to develop and disseminate policy research, analysis and advocacy materials in various forms (publications, e-notes, DVDs, and online video streaming) on a range of issues, such as governance, alternative technological solutions, anti-corruption, HIV and AIDS, and crisis prevention and recovery. In 2006, 13 knowledge products and 21 e-government case studies were completed and made available online.

With an additional CD specialist within the MDG-I, the two Centres have enhanced their capacities to respond to country demands. In 2006, some of the Centre\u2019s achievements were debuts of the Coaches and Advisors Programme for Afghanistan, the Young Leaders for Governance Programme, a significant partnership with SNV (Foundation of Netherlands Volunteers) working through five Country Offices, and regionally to support the MDGs. The Young Leaders in Governance Programme has completed its first phase with 131 graduates, and 16 graduates trained as leadership trainers. For its second phase, the programme has been accorded resources from the UN Democracy Fund. In this phase, national level engagement will be enhanced. A similar programme has been started in the Caribbean with technical support from the Centre. The Pacific has also been similarly supported. Capacity2015 is UNDP\u2019s focal point for the UNDP-SNV MoU(s) on \u201cCapacity Development Innovations and Capacity Development for achievement of the MDGs at the local level\u201d. Under this partnership, five countries in the region received policy advice and technical backstopping for developing programmes that will be financed through Capacity2015 resources. Grants have already been made to Bhutan and Nepal Country Offices. Regional activities are in the offing. A significant new area of work has been the collaboration with the regional MDG Initiative. The Centre has provided support to the specific areas of costing capacity investments in Bhutan, and to overall monitoring of capacity change. In India, at the invitation of the Resident Coordinator, the team conducted a workshop for UN Country Team heads of agencies, staff and UNDP staff on conducting capacity assessments and deriving capacity development strategies based on those. The India UNDAF/P has now incorporated capacity development interventions centrally into the new programme. In Vietnam, a similar presentation was made to the Country Office and some follow-up activities started thereafter. The Centre has been increasingly called upon to provide technical support to other UN agencies. Advisory missions on capacity development have also increased and the two key Practice areas of Poverty and Governance have regularly drawn on specialised advisory support. In Afghanistan, Timor Leste, Vietnam and India, capacity development advisory support has led to concrete outcomes in the form of new initiatives or a rigorous capacity development component within existing initiatives. To illustrate, in Afghanistan, as part of an overall initiative to support capacity development in the public sector, the Centre designed and negotiated a capacity development facility that will provide mentors and coaches to the Afghan civil service on an ongoing basis. Subsequently, the governments of Afghanistan and India have entered into a MoU where Indian civil servants will provide these coaching and advisory roles under the auspices of a UNDP programme and a UNDP-designed curriculum. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 36 In the Philippines, Capacity2015, the UNDP Country Office and Galing Pok Foundation (an NGO), initiated a programme on recognising and rewarding local level capacity innovations. The Centre has produced or contributed to the publication of two training manuals for Young Leaders in Governance. Both were used in the leadership trainings and the training of trainers under the leadership development programme. A compendium documenting experiences of local-level capacity innovations towards MDG attainment in selected local government units in the Philippines was also produced in cooperation with UNDP Philippines and Galing Pok Foundation. The first issue of the Capacity Development in Action series (CDiA) documenting the capacity development story in Afghanistan was published. The report summarizes developing systemic, organizational, and individual capacities under the challenging conditions prevailing in Afghanistan. This year the Centre produced 11 practice notes on various aspects of capacity development. The Centre substantially wrote or contributed to three: i) Capacity Diagnostics: Capacity Assessment Methodology; ii) Leadership Development: Leading Transformations at the Local Level; and iii) Institutional Reform and Change Management: Managing Change in Public Sector Organizations. G.4: Communications and Programme Advocacy The effects of chronic poverty, social exclusion, and water governance captured headlines, as millions continued to rebuild their lives following devastating earthquakes, tsunamis and mud slides. Uneven economic growth threatened poverty reduction efforts. A number of countries descended into crises as a result of emerging pressures on resources. The rapid growth of Chinese and Indian economies continued to influence trends in other countries.

These teams work closely and collaboratively together but respond to different mandates, with the Communications Team working directly with COs and the Office of Communications at Headquarters and the Programme Advocacy Team serving as an in-house mechanism focused on supporting RBAP and the Regional Programmes in Colombo, as a direct result of discussions with the Management Board. The Centres generated and sustained media interest by connecting their work to breaking news or by demonstrating concrete results of larger processes. Moreover, they confronted a high turnover of communications officers at the national level, which presented separate challenges in ensuring capacity and continuity. Two regional Public Service Announcements on corruption were produced and distributed to Country Offices. One ran on CNN, Star TV, and in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, through the Country Office distribution. The commercial won a silver prize in a Saatchi and Saatchi contest on broadcast for advocacy. It continues to be used in MDG regional conferences and training workshops. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 37 The Communications Team in Bangkok drafted the press kit for the Timor-Leste Human Development Report and worked in collaboration with the Country Office on the launch. Articles appeared in the Economist, Times of London, CNN International, BBC World TV and extensive multiple media in Australia. The Communications Team in Bangkok advised on media outreach material for the UNDP Human Development Award, in cooperation with the Country Office in Thailand and the UN Information Centre. The UN Secretary-General presented the Award to the King of Thailand. The UN team in Pakistan received media outreach support during the one-year anniversary of the earthquake. International coverage that resulted from the assistance included live pieces on CNN, BBC, and MSNBC. During the political crisis in Nepal, the Communications Team in Bangkok supported the Country Office in international media outreach. We communicated core UNCT Nepal messages that resonated with regional and international media outside Nepal, and we placed colleagues in live interviews on CNN International and BBC World Service TV. In Afghanistan, the Communications Team in Bangkok helped to promote the first national Information and Communication Technology Conference. A feature ran in the Economist. In China, the Communications Team in Bangkok edited an Opinion-Editorial on the Silk Road for the Country Office which ran in the South China Morning Post. The Communications Team in Bangkok engages in global and regional campaign roll-outs, particularly Millennium Development Reports and Human Development Reports. It assisted in the outreach for the \u201cStand Up Against Poverty\u201d campaign, which was spearheaded by the Millennium Campaign Office. It also served as a resource for advice and sharing of communications experiences within and outside the Asia-Pacific region. The Communications Team in Bangkok managed the content and organization of a regional training on media reporting on corruption for journalists across the region, in cooperation with BBC World Service Trust, the Asian Institute for Broadcast Development and the Asia Media Summit. The aim was to provide skills training as well as substantive information on ethics, corruption and governance issues in Asia. The trained journalists form a core resource group for coverage of the 2007 corruption report. The Communications Team in Bangkok trained 20 national environment officers in communications strategies and media relations to help Country Offices promote upcoming reports on energy access for the poor. For many, it was their first communications and media training. With BBC World Service, the Communications Team in Bangkok conducted a communications strategies workshop for the Country Office in Laos and drafted a national strategy in collaboration with the national communications officer. In other services, it advised Country Offices on a range of needs: developing content for websites, providing Terms of Reference for staff and identifying candidates for positions. Country offices requesting desk help included Afghanistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Pakistan, Timor-Leste, China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nepal, and Samoa. Effective communications are vital in helping every Country Office inform partners, the media and the public about UNDP\u2019s work as a global development network. Together with Country Offices and Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 38 partners, the Regional Centres must enhance capacity to shape core messages, and coordinate timing and resources. The high turnover of national communications officers will be addressed. Of the 30 officers who took part in the regional capacity building workshop in 2005, approximately half remain in place to carry forward the work. The Communications Team in Bangkok will aim to hold a regional training and capacity building workshop with all of the national communications officers in the Country Offices.

The Programme Advocacy and Media Team supported the finalization of the Report and developed an extensive media kit for regional use, while the Communications Team in Bangkok coordinated regional media coverage. Extensive coverage was recorded in national, regional and international media. Most notably, the Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, BBC, USA Today and CNBC provided in-depth analysis. A series of six international and national opinion pieces following the launch of the Report have run in publications from Far Eastern Economic Review to Utusan, a Bahasa Malayasia-language newspaper; more opinion pieces are scheduled as part of continuing follow-up. The extensive national and international coverage of the report helped to fuel debate and generate round-table discussions in Washington on technical trade issues \u2013 and UNDP\u2019s role in them. Through private sector funds raised by the Communications Team in Bangkok, more media development workshops will be held in the lead-up to the APHDR 2007 on corruption. 39 Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 Part 3 Organization and Management Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 40 3.1 Analysis of Human Resources and Staffing With the official inauguration of the Regional Centre in Colombo in April 2006, staffing at RCC largely finished its consolidation and totaled 71 at the end of 2006. Sixty percent were professional staff, encompassing locally and internationally recruited staff comprising 14 different nationalities, with half (50 percent) coming from Asia-Pacific. At the end of 2006, the Centre stood \u201cgender- balanced,\u201d with a female-to-male ratio of 1:1 and a programme-to-operations staff ratio of 4:1. The direct assumption of project execution responsibilities meant that the RCC was able to engage in delivering its services more efficiently than before, and to put in place cost-recovery systems. In January 2006, RCC initiated direct execution of regional projects, starting with the HIV/AIDS Regional Programme, previously directly executed by the India Country Office. The rest of the RCC programmes migrated to DEX in March. At the Regional Centre in Bangkok, the staff complement totaled 96 at the end of 2006. Fifty-six percent were in the professional category, with female staff overall numbering 55, while male staff totaled 41. In terms of nationalities, 23 countries were represented, with 64 staff coming from countries in Asia- Pacific (78 percent from Thailand).

To this end, the Regional Centres prepared a resource mobilization strategy aimed at meeting the resource mobilization targets established by RBAP at the time various Regional Programmes were approved. The strategy involved working with existing partners and exploring opportunities with new ones, in particular emerging donors and the private sector. It also included support to Country Offices\u2019 resource mobilization efforts. The resource mobilization (RM) challenge for regional activities is particularly acute for a variety of reasons, among which are: (a) very few donor institutions or countries have explicit and recurring allocations for regional interventions; (b) in a highly competitive environment for donor funds, funding has tended to remain at the global and country levels; (c) partnerships for RM purposes are a long-term effort and Regional Programmes\u2019 duration range from two to four years (the Regional Centres being a recent creation), with no institutional anchoring in most cases to sustain Programme interventions. To address these challenges, the resource mobilization strategy included the following key elements: \u2022 Establishment of a dedicated capacity for RM within the Regional Centres, with a strong coordination mechanism so that donors are strategically approached and RM efforts (at country, regional and corporate levels) are aligned \u2022 Development of better intelligence on donors and non-traditional partners, with a view to pursuing targeted partnerships and creative funding modalities \u2022 Development of an RM communication strategy for branding purposes of the Regional Centres, as well as to raise the value of regional public goods The results of the two Regional Centres\u2019 resource mobilization efforts in 2006, although limited, show potential for growth. As an initial step in approaching potential donors, the Centres co-organized two information exchange meetings with the Bangkok-based offices of bilateral and multilateral donor agencies. Twelve donor agencies participated in the first meeting and 14 in the second. Based on the interest generated to continue to identify concrete areas of collaboration, it was agreed that the first meeting in 2007 would focus on the environment and would be hosted by ADB in cooperation with SIDA. The Regional Centre in Bangkok served as a regional focal point for private sector partnerships, providing technical and operational assistance to the tsunami-affected countries, with close coordination and support by BRSP. An MOU was signed corporately by Coca-Cola under which this company provided funding for water supply and sanitation projects in tsunami-affected countries and seconded a staff member to RCB for one year to coordinate this effort and promote the partnership with UNDP. Beyond tsunami reconstruction, in October 2006, RCB signed a partnership agreement with the French multinational, Total, covering the areas of democratic governance and energy services. The ICT4D area (i.e., APDIP) continued its successful resource mobilization efforts with partners such as Cisco Systems, IBM, Oracle and Intel Corporation. In addition, APDIP was able to mobilize almost US$600,000 in cost- sharing resources through various strategic partnerships with other United Nations Agencies, bilateral and multilateral agencies. Partners include International Development Research Centre of Canada, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and Open Society Institute. Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006 43 At the Regional Centre in Colombo, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Republic of Korea as a result of which funding was secured for two proposals, namely: (a) US$ 600,000 for building anti-corruption capacities for implementing the MDGs, in collaboration with Korean institutions and (b) US$1 million for the MDGs in Mongolia.

The wide variations in individual programmes between 2006 and 2007 underscore the previously noted difficulty of persuading donors to contribute at the regional level.

At the same time, they recognize the huge challenges of delivering as \u201cOne UN\u201d and are preparing themselves to support the delivery of new Regional Programmes under the RPD 2008 \u2013 2011 in the larger programmatic context of the new Strategic Plan. In looking ahead at opportunities and challenges, the following are worth highlighting: 1. Strengthening Partnerships with United Nations Agencies and Donors The Regional Centres are at the forefront of forging partnerships with regional UN Agencies in the context of the \u201cOne UN\u201d agenda and via the programmatic framework of the MDG Initiative, the core underlying principle of which is engagement of United Nations Country Teams. The MDG-I is currently seeking stronger engagement with the Bretton Woods Institutions and ADB on MDG-based strategies and related macroeconomic policy choices. Similarly, the MDG-I has been undertaking collaborative work with the ExCom Agencies as well as with ILO, UNESCAP and UNEP. The ability of countries to easily access United Nations System-wide technical resources, as well as those available in bilateral and multilateral development agencies, to support their MDG attainment efforts should be at the top of the Regional Centres\u2019 support role to countries from 2007 onward. 2. Linking Better with Asia\u2019s Growing Intellectual Capital While the Regional Centres continue to increase their in-house capacity in the focus areas of the new corporate Strategic Plan, it also is critical to continue to expand the network of external expertise. This will reduce transaction costs of access to Asia-Pacific and global knowledge by Country Offices. MDG- I will organize a conference on regional intellectual partnerships in 2007, aimed at practical ways of utilizing Asia-Pacific\u2019s growing human capital for UNDP\u2019s regional public good provision, as well as for support to Country Offices. 3. Improving the Quality and Impact of Regional Publications The Regional Centres have produced some excellent publications that have attracted enormous media attention, particularly the APHDR 2006. Some publications have provided invaluable policy-oriented material, used at least in one instance by a Nobel Laureate. The Regional Centres will institute a quality assurance mechanism, including an institutionalized peer review process, for all regional publications. 4. Deepening Advocacy and Communications Effective advocacy is crucial to the success of the Regional Centres\u2019 work and can help them go a long way in influencing public interest and policy, as was indicated by the publicity attained from the launch of the first APHDR in 2006.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ad4b100-7c2e-44af-aab3-addc29c2e38c": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ad4b100-7c2e-44af-aab3-addc29c2e38c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Regional Centres in Bangkok and Colombo Annual Report 2006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed756eddb54e3f13193e9fd8379108cd48da2e709ea58d4aa9d83aa9ee59e04"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f9e3d3f-e789-4bef-bc57-e1b40bccc519", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-regional-centres-bangkok-and-colombo-annual-report-2006", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6140e2c13caf460332778c733270522069d81d55e52f807f98f949701a610dde"}}, "hash": "d1e750b1a7bb535b8265eeeb3364f422afdba724c38906de1804dc1bd4d393c7", "text": "Building on this success, it is important that the strategic communications outreach from the Regional Centres ensures that effective use is made of global, regional and national communications resources in UNDP and the wider United Nations family.

Gauging New Demands and Responding Rapidly to Country Office Needs If the Regional Centres are to truly fulfil their mandate as development hubs for Asia-Pacific, they ought to be able to fully gauge demand for development services and respond rapidly to those needs. To this end, shifting from a pre-planned project model to a more service-oriented model would be important, where there are fungible resources that can be used to respond rapidly to emerging issues of concern to the region and to clusters of countries with similar development contexts. 7. More Strategically Engaging with Civil Society and the Private Sector The Regional Centres have placed a strong emphasis on partnerships with civil society and the private sector. Important gains have been made in 2006, as documented earlier. However, many opportunities remain to be exploited, and a strategy is required to build partnerships with new dynamic civil society and private sector coalitions. 8. Securing Sustainable Funding as a Means to Stability and Long-Term Institutionalization For the longer term, it is important for the Regional Centres to not be seen as only funded by the Regional Programmes they directly execute.

A Future Within Reach 2008 Regional Partnerships for the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific For further information on the material contained in this document, please contact: Mr. Ravi Ratnayake Director Poverty and Development Division United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific United Nations Building Rajadamnern Nok Avenue Bangkok 10200, Thailand E-mail: escap-pdd@un.org iii Foreword A regional picture of progress toward the Millennium Development Goals must inevitably be painted with broad strokes. While each country prepares its own progress reports, regional overviews are constrained by the shortage of capacity and information, and by disaggregated data. Yet there is value in these regional MDG reports. For all their diversity, many Asian and Pacific countries, particularly neighbours in subregions, share significant cultural ties and similar social and economic challenges in implementing their MDG plans. A regional report can highlight opportunities for joint and cooperative action, encouraging countries to build partnerships for greater progress. It can also demonstrate the large challenges that remain, requiring the continued assistance of international organizations, such as the United Nations agencies and funds, the regional development banks and bilateral donors. This third MDG report for Asia and the Pacific attempts to shed light on questions that are difficult to answer. How many of the region\u2019s people are living in extreme poverty? How many children are going to school? How many women are dying at childbirth? As importantly, the report attempts to peer into the future: what will be the situation in 2015 \u2013 the target date for all of the MDG targets? Building on previous editions, A Future Within Reach 2008 takes stock of the significant achievements to date across Asia and the Pacific, and highlights the main gaps that remain. On the positive side, the region has an unparalleled singular record of freeing more than 350 million people from extreme poverty between 1990 and 2004. But the task of reducing and ultimately eliminating human, or non-income poverty is immense. The report therefore also includes recommendations for strengthening growth and implementa- tion efforts, adopting suitable policies, and garnering the additional resources needed to fill the remaining gaps. Action is clearly required at the national level, but this will need to be supplemented with the information, advisory services and human and financial re- sources of international bodies. It is essential that development partners contribute according to their unique characteristics and strengths, yet uphold the spirit, principle and practice of uniting to \u2018deliver as one\u2019. This report is a tripartite initiative of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We are grateful for the active support of a number of other United Nations agencies. We hope that the report will serve as a useful source of information and ideas, and a stimulus for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6fd09ee-bb5e-4bc9-933d-54c8e086b157": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6fd09ee-bb5e-4bc9-933d-54c8e086b157", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f364e96bb1c9eb742069247b6ed1ac982bd231a420e25cb54212bdce713f90b"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba255131-497f-4101-a86d-f29cdc1e991a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50d17564a948be75aca377b0cdd1edff26e0367b20128830b8eb081aa1c3dde5"}}, "hash": "2e1cd766eca359dbfa719e9db6df69eb61442e8c0e0c69b2f5344450004fd22e", "text": "innovation, investment, and regional cooperation as countries strive to achieve the MDGs and build a brighter future for all.

Fund for Women WDI World Development Indicators WHO World Health Organization WTO World Trade Organization 1 Overview T he Asia-Pacific region is an eco- nomic powerhouse, with some of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies. But it has been making slower progress with some of the Millennium Develop- ment Goals. Its greatest success has been with poverty, for which the region as a whole is likely to meet the 2015 target of halving the proportion of peo- ple living in income poverty. But most countries will miss at least some of the other targets and goals, and a number will miss their goal even for poverty. For each of the MDGs, countries can be classified as \u2018off-track\u2019, \u2018on-track\u2019 or \u2018early achievers\u2019. The targets for which the largest number of countries are off- track are: CO2 emissions; rural sanita- tion coverage; the proportion of children underweight; and rural access to clean water. But the region also needs to do more in a number of other areas. Among the targets and indicators of greatest concern are: Child mortality \u2013 Some four million chil- dren in the region die before they reach the age of five. Of the 47 countries for which data are available, 15 are off- track and several have regressed. The pattern is similar for infant mortality. Maternal mortality \u2013 Some 250,000 women in the region die each year dur- ing childbirth or from pregnancy-related complications. In 1990, developing Asia\u2019s maternal mortality ratio was 395 deaths per 100,000 live births, and by 2000 this had fallen only to 300. The high number of maternal deaths also contributes to a declining sex ratio, which combined with selective abortion or infanticide of girls, means that mil- lions of women are \u2018missing\u2019, an out- come that has been characterized as \u2018gendercide\u2019. Climate change and environmental sus- tainability \u2013 Rapid economic growth has had huge environmental costs \u2013 includ- ing deforestation and the destruction of wetlands and extensive pollution of air and water. Another major problem for the region is CO2 emissions. Of 48 countries for which data are available, 30 are off-track for meeting the 2015 emissions target. Climate change will This is the third in a series of regional reports on the Millen- nium Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region. It assesses the prospects of reaching the goals and targets, highlighting the potential gaps and indicating how these can be filled. It also looks at the potential for adding value to national initia- tives through broader international partnerships through which the United Nations and other international organizations \u2018deliver as one\u2019. Overview A Future Within Reach 2008 2 have a serious impact on the region \u2013 through rising sea levels and changing weather patterns. More positively, how- ever, the region appears to be making significant progress in reducing the con- sumption of ozone-depleting CFCs. Water and sanitation \u2013 Here the region performs poorly: 18 out of 38 countries investigated are off-track for providing their rural populations with access to safe water, and 17 out of 32 countries are off-track for providing rural areas with access to basic sanitation. Coun- tries across the region seem to have made greater progress in urban areas, but in some cases public service deliv- ery systems are struggling to keep pace with rapidly growing urban populations. Education \u2013 Primary education is one of the region\u2019s great successes: almost all countries have net primary enrolment ratios above 90 per cent and for many the ratio is approaching 100 per cent. The region\u2019s performance is less im- pressive, however, when it comes to repetition and completion. Empowerment of women \u2013 One MDG indicator of women\u2019s empowerment is their share in non-agricultural wage em- ployment. On this basis, in some coun- tries women are doing well, with more women employed than men. In several Asia-Pacific countries, however, women are some way behind. Moreover, even when women are working they are pre- dominantly employed in labour-intensive, low-value-added manufacturing and service sector jobs. Women are also poorly represented in national parlia- ments: in many countries the percent- age of parliamentary seats held by women is in single digits. Poverty \u2013 Between 1990 and 2004, the proportion of people living on less than $1 (PPP) a day in the Asia and Pacific region, fell from 31 to 17 per cent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "478aad39-f499-4a19-bf3d-5df7ff4139bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "478aad39-f499-4a19-bf3d-5df7ff4139bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a3a984b3a48762ce3dbb4ef71bcb2fddd8b5ab712cbe3f6bdb0ed5ee322a674"}, "2": {"node_id": "608bdb20-de53-49a4-b3fc-d909c7196804", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42edf5eab6c392f4bd5b001ca5cc68feef91312111a446d15be8b75196703392"}}, "hash": "4047e5f18538e88817235932f9e3d11a1d324973b0838140655cfb69cf8bb479", "text": "Moreover, during the same period, and despite population growth, the absolute number of poor people also fell, from 1,009 million to about 641 million.

Hunger and malnutrition \u2013 Around 545 million people in Asia and the Pacific are consuming less than the global standard of 2,200 calories per day \u2013 constituting 65 per cent of the world\u2019s undernourished. There has been some progress, and both the total number and the prevalence of undernourished people have fallen, but not fast enough to keep the region on track for the MDG goal of halving the undernour- ished population by 2015. Even more disturbing, 28 per cent of under-5 children are underweight: the region ac- counts for around two-thirds of the world\u2019s underweight children and is considerably behind its target for 2015. Communicable diseases \u2013 Across the region, HIV remains a major concern: 6 million people are infected with the vi- rus. Although the prevalence, at 0.3 per cent, is lower than in some other world regions, it is still some way from meet- ing the MDG goal of halting and revers- ing the spread of the pandemic by 2015. In addition, large numbers of people are infected by malaria and tu- berculosis. The Pacific subregion is hit hard by non communicable diseases which is a major public health problem. Asia-Pacific region also has two of every three people in the world infected with TB. Global cooperation \u2013 The eighth Millen- nium Development Goal calls for global cooperation through official develop- ment assistance (ODA), debt sus- tainability and international trade. In 2005, only five countries had lived up to the developed country pledge that ODA should constitute at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national income. Never- theless the volume of aid has in- creased: between 1990 and 2005, glo- bal flows of ODA rose from $23 billion to $44 billion. Goal 8 also recognizes the importance of international trade. In 3 1996, Asia-Pacific LDCs had the same level of duty-free access as sub-Saha- ran LDCs but by the late 1990s and early 2000s, their share of trade had declined. Goal 8 also calls for decent and productive work for youth, but that task remains largely unfulfilled: youth unemployment is on the rise almost everywhere, including the Pacific subregion. Another disturbing aspect of the re- gion\u2019s uneven MDG progress is the ex- tent of disparities within and between countries. Within countries, the poor and vulnerable groups, particularly those living in rural and remote areas are falling further behind. The region as a whole is thus likely to fall short in a number of ways \u2013 facing critical \u2018MDG gaps\u2019: growth gaps, strat- egy gaps, policy gaps, implementation gaps, and resource gaps. Figure below illustrates the interplay between these. Figure \u2013 Five interrelated gaps for achieving the MDGS Policy gaps Growth gaps Strategy gaps MDG gaps Resource gaps Implementation gaps Filling the MDG gaps One way of attempting to fill the gaps would be to increase economic growth. An analysis of 25 countries across the region suggests that this would have the most effect on income poverty: if per capita GDP rises by 1 per cent, the headcount poverty ratio tends to fall by 0.86 per cent. Growth has less effect on undernutrition: a 1 per cent increase in per capita GDP is associated with a drop of about half a per cent in undernutrition. Growth also appears to have a smaller effect on infant and under-5 mortality and on maternal mortality. Countries that rely only economic growth are thus likely to fall short. Even in the unlikely event, they boosted their projected per capita GDP growth by 3 percentage points, many countries would remain off-track. To achieve the goals they will need to improve the structure and quality of economic growth and make appropriate changes to national development strategies. To what extent are they making such changes? To assess current strategies, this report carried out a review of 14 Asia-Pacific countries. This showed that, while all countries had distinctive fea- tures they generally took a common approach.

To be effective, however, national MDG strategies should be \u2018need based\u2019, setting out national tar- gets and priorities that are consistent with reaching the MDGs. Good governance The effectiveness of all of these activi- ties will also depend critically on the quality of governance. The Millennium Declaration, which gave rise to the Mil- lennium Development Goals, stresses the importance of good governance which while increasing efficiency and transparency generally also involves in- corporating the views of minorities, those facing discriminations and those most vulnerable \u2013 empowering them to become agents of their own develop- ment. At the national level, this means, for example, cutting through the bureau- cratic jungle of laws, and devising more effective forms of service delivery. How- ever, in many cases governments will also need to decentralize power and authority from higher to lower tiers \u2013 and broaden the range of service pro- viders to include community organiza- tions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector. Governments will always retain their fundamental respon- sibility of ensuring that everyone has access to basic services at all times, but in some cases they can concentrate more on creating a suitable environment \u2013 encouraging the involvement of a range of providers, while setting stand- ards and carrying out functions of regu- lation and monitoring. Macroeconomic policies Raising standards of governance will also assist countries in their efforts to achieve \u2018pro-poor\u2019 growth. For this they can use four groups of policies: Economy-wide institutional and policy reforms \u2013 The aim is to exploit the country\u2019s comparative advantages \u2013 increasing exports and attracting foreign capital, especially foreign direct invest- ment. Typically this has implied a stand- ard set of policies: privatization, deregu- lation, liberalization of trade and the financial sector and capital account convertibility. While these policies have their place, they need to be phased in with care since, in the short to medium term at least, such policies can also harm the poor. Macroeconomic stabilization policies \u2013 Governments pursuing macroeconomic stabilization are generally aiming for low inflation. However, efforts to control in- flation through reducing fiscal deficit can easily restrain short- and medium- term growth. Often a better approach is to focus on supply management ensur- ing sufficient goods at reasonable prices for the poor. Sectoral policies and interventions \u2013 One of the priority areas for poverty reduction is agriculture and rural devel- opment. Interventions needed include investments in rural infrastructure, irriga- tion networks, farm-to-market roads and rural electrification. Other pro-poor sec- tors include construction and light manufacturing. 5 Pro-poor expenditures and revenue poli- cies \u2013 To improve the position of the poor, governments will need to change the structure of taxes, correct pro-rich subsidies and allocate public expendi- ture so as to increase the availability of services. If these policies to foster growth are accompanied by improvements in both physical and social infrastructure \u2013 \u2018MDG goods and services\u2019 \u2013 they will help achieve the Goals. This should be self- reinforcing process: expansion in the MDG goods and services sectors can also act an engine of growth, turning \u2018pro- MDG growth\u2019 into \u2018pro-growth MDGs\u2019. To what extent have governments been pursuing pro-MDG growth? An analysis has been carried out for 28 countries, using China and Thailand as bench- marks. The scale of the task facing each country is assessed by consider- ing how far it is from the benchmark. On the basis of this analysis, the areas in need of attention are finance, the macro-economy, education and trade and health. These 5 areas thus repre- sent a menu for any regional assistance strategy. Filling the implementation gap Slow progress towards achieving MDGs is often due to a gap between commit- ment and implementation. First, govern- ments need to back the MDGs fully at national and international levels, estimat- ing the costs, prioritizing public expen- ditures, setting out achievable targets, establishing clear timelines and devising practical strategies. Second, they will have to break out of the limited sectoral approach, to encompass a more inte- grated framework of policies. Finally, they should institute systems for con- tinuous results monitoring and evalua- tion to ensure that implementation re- mains on track and that some goals are not pursued at the expense of others.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38b140b2-8d41-43ea-a12c-07184b5b853a": {"__data__": {"id_": "38b140b2-8d41-43ea-a12c-07184b5b853a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42ba7ca9791aa3781e7b5bed8f10a4b05de6b6847d4eaca2c93f21f6fd0838f0"}, "2": {"node_id": "e875ab46-3b6c-44f7-b0f9-b9bbc3f6c089", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae0a6fe58f3861933d2954affefc1b99d211c117819d36d6894434677dbad377"}}, "hash": "c51d161e96bd75b6bc7b1c2c448c7b53ed3aecb5a210f512612e8edaa0aca6e7", "text": "A critical step in devising MDG policies is making realistic estimates of the costs so that these can be fully incorporated into national budgets.

Based on the costings made thus far, it is possible to make a rough estimate of the MDG resource gap for the group of all least developed countries in Asia and the Pacific. On this basis, the total require- ment to 2015 is $241 per capita per year, or $66 billion in total. Since cur- rently the available resources are around $212 per capita per year or $58 billion, the resource gap is thus $8 billion, per year, or $29 per person per year. Following a regional road map The primary and ultimate responsibility for achieving the MDGs lies with na- tional governments and organizations. But they need not act in isolation. They should also be able to count on the support of international organizations \u2013 the agencies and funds of the United Nations, the regional development banks and the bilateral donors. For this assistance to be effective, however, it should be offered in clear and coordi- nated fashion. For this purpose the outline of \u2018regional road map\u2019 was presented in May 2007 to the sixty- third session of the ESCAP Commis- sion where it received widespread endorsement. This road map identifies priority areas where progress towards MDGs is slow or lacking. Then it lays out a strategy with a number of products and services that can be delivered by the regional partnership. Finally, it establishes proc- esses of monitoring and evaluation to allow for \u2018course corrections\u2019. The 5 components of the road map are: knowledge and capacity-building, expertise, advocacy, regional public goods and resources. All should add value to national strategies and be de- Overview A Future Within Reach 2008 6 veloped in consultation with national stakeholders. The framework is de- signed to be dynamic; as time goes on each component is expected to high- light different priorities and emphases. Knowledge and capacity-building With their normative and analytical re- search capabilities, the regional partners can achieve significant economies of scale in accumulating and organizing knowledge and information. The part- ners can use this information to identify opportunities for regional and sub- regional cooperation, and areas and sectors for public-private-donor invest- ments and interventions. This should ensure that policy makers, experts and professionals are well informed and bet- ter able to use public and private re- sources, including development assist- ance. The end result could be a regional MDG knowledge hub under which a range of activities, including monitoring progress, examining national plans, assessing resources, and carrying out modelling and costing exercises could be conducted. While these activities are likely to be undertaken by different agencies, their coordination through a regional mechanism could provide a one-stop shop. Expertise This would cover, for example, advice on projects involving water and sanita- tion, transport and communications, tackling HIV/AIDS, delivering child-health services, building micro-credit institu- tions, developing new services in the financial system for small and medium- sized enterprises, improving trade intelli- gence and facilitation, disaggregating statistics and implementing gender strategies. One option for improving the delivery of expertise would be to create a coordi- nated regional advisory service mecha- nism. This could serve as a source of experts who could augment, local ex- pertise, particularly for complex projects. Advisers could also help build national capacity and disseminate up-to-date knowledge and information, through research studies and papers, online consultations, and by participating in national, regional and international meetings. Advocacy There is always the danger that the MDG process will become fragmented and lose momentum. The partnership will therefore need a strong advocacy component. This can be promoted through a series of regional and subregional MDG forums to create op- portunities for different kinds of network- ing, allowing governments, international organizations, NGOs and representa- tives of community organizations to form new alliances and work together more effectively. This could include parliamentary forums. With the support of training and orienta- tion programmes, parliamentarians, both men and women, should be better able to formulate the necessary legislation and policy in compliance with interna- tional treaties.

Beyond development assistance, the developing countries should also be able to benefit from increased trade, so partnerships should also be aiming to ensure easier market access for goods from the LDCs especially agricultural ex- ports. These initiatives will depend on the availability of resources, both internal and external. One significant recent step in this direction has been the creation of the UNDP-Spanish Millennium Devel- opment Goal Achievement Fund, but given the scale of the needs further innovations will be required, giving prior- ity to LDC and LLDC \u2018off-track\u2019 coun- tries and to those critical MDGs in which the region or subregions appear to be faltering. Delivering as one United Nations and other organizations need to work more closely together across the Asia-Pacific. When offering resources and expertise in support of national efforts to achieve the MDGs they should therefore aim to \u2018deliver as one\u2019. This not only simplifies the task of overstretched national administrators it also avoids overlap and makes interna- tional support more coherent and effec- tive. This type of coordinated activity, for example, through the United Nations Regional Coordination Meeting and the ESCAP Commission, becomes ever more urgent with the approach of the target year of 2015. The Asia-Pacific region still has a lengthy and urgent MDG agenda, and time is running out. Overview 9 1. Tracking the Goals T he Asia-Pacific region is an eco- nomic powerhouse, with some of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies. But it has been making slower progress with some of the Millennium Develop- ment Goals (Box 1-1). Its greatest suc- cess has been with poverty, for which the region as a whole is on \u2018on track\u2019 to meet the 2015 targets of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. But for the other goals, many more countries are off-track and a number of countries will miss their goal even for poverty. Unless the region can accelerate progress and achieve the MDGs, its people will face immense social costs. Some 641 million people will continue to live on less than $1 a day. Around 97 million children will remain under- weight. Four million children will die each year before reaching the age of five. Four hundred million people in ur- ban areas will have no access to basic sanitation, and a further 566 million people living in rural areas will lack access to clean water. This outcome is avoidable. Govern- ments should now be in a better posi- tion to capitalize on their strengths, knowledge and expertise and adopt ap- propriate economic and social policies. They can work with neighbouring coun- tries on cross-border issues. And they can also rely on support from the United Nations, its specialized agencies and regional banks. With determined national efforts and consistent and ef- fective backing from international or- ganizations pooling their resources and working \u2018as one\u2019, the Millennium Devel- opment Goals are still within reach. This report explores how to address the main gaps and constraints. It has three chapters. Chapter 1 tracks progress to date, assessing whether countries are on or off-track. Chapter 2 looks at the extent to which economic growth can help move countries towards the goals \u2013 concluding that they will need to complement economic growth with vig- orous economic and social policies. Chapter 3 explores the opportunities for regional partnerships, following a road Over the past two decades, the Asia-Pacific region has taken remarkable strides in accelerating economic growth and reduc- ing poverty. But progress in other areas of human development has been less impressive. This chapter tracks the progress to date for some of the most important targets \u2013 and assesses what needs to be done to meet the Millennium Development Goals. 1. Tracking the Goals A Future Within Reach 2008 10 There are eight Millennium Develop- ment Goals (MDGs) and correspond- ing targets, most of which are to be achieved between 1990 and 2015. 1.

Progress towards the MDGs The Asia-Pacific region has been mov- ing ahead on the MDGs but progress has been uneven (ESCAP/ADB/UNDP, 2007). On the positive side, between 1990 and 2004 it reduced the number of people living in extreme income pov- erty to from 1.9 billion to 641 million \u2013 due mainly to rapid reductions in South- East Asia and China. Health too has improved: more children are surviving beyond the age of five. There have also been significant advances in education. Millions more children are now going to school; indeed many countries have achieved almost 100 per cent net pri- mary school enrolment. In addition, the region has taken steps towards gender equality both in schools and in the workplace. Just eight years away from 2015, how- ever, there are still significant chal- lenges. Despite the poverty achieve- ments, the Asia-Pacific region is still home to more than half of the world\u2019s people living on less than $1 a day. Other areas of concern include disturb- ing levels of infant and maternal mortal- ity, high school drop-out rates, the spread of HIV/AIDS, low coverage of water and sanitation, the loss of forest cover with serious implications for cli- mate change, and weaknesses in sys- tems of social protection. Moreover throughout the region women continue to face discrimination in their homes and communities and many suffer harsh working conditions. While the MDGs are common to all countries, they also present particular challenges in the Pa- cific Island Developing Countries (Box 1-2). Another disturbing aspect of the re- gion\u2019s MDG progress is the extent of disparities within and between countries. Within countries, the poor and vulner- able groups, particularly those people living in rural and remote areas are falling further behind. This chapter looks at the MDG targets and indicators of greatest concern. It uses the revised series of MDG data issued in August 2007 by the United Nations Statistics Division, UNDESA. For regional and subregional averages it uses those in the MDG Progress Report 2007, (ESCAP/ADB/UNDP, 2007), which classified countries into four categories: \u2022 Early achievers- which have already achieved the 2015 target \u2022 On track \u2013 expected to reach the target by 2015 \u2022 Off-track slow \u2013 expected to reach the target, but after 2015 \u2022 Off-track slow/regressing \u2013 showing slow progress or slipping back- wards. Figure 1-1 presents an overall assess- ment, ranking the indicators according to the percentage of countries off-track. At the top, and in greatest need of attention, are: CO2 emissions (63 per cent of countries off-track), rural sanita- tion (53 per cent), underweight children (47 per cent), rural access to clean water (47 per cent), forest cover (45 per cent), reaching grade five (40 per cent), gender parity in tertiary education (38 per cent), under-five mortality (36 per cent) and $1-a-day poverty (32 per cent).

Tracking the Goals A Future Within Reach 2008 12 Of the five subregions of ESCAP, the success of Pacific Island Developing Countries (PIDCs) in implementing the MDGs has been less impressive. There has been some progress and the subregion has already met some targets, for example, on tuberculosis, the areas of environment brought un- der protection, CO2 emissions and CFC consumption. It also is ex- pected to meet the target for gender parity in secondary schools. How- ever, the subregion has yet to make progress on the other 17 MDG tar- gets. For Goal 6, for example, the subregion is off-track for treatment of HIV/AIDS and malaria, and for Goal 7 it is regressing for access to water and sanitation. The PIDCs may even- tually achieve some of the other goals, but only after 2015, as current progress is slow or slipping into re- verse. It should also be pointed out that for some targets it is difficult to track progress because of a lack of data. Part of the problem for the PIDCs is slow economic growth. In 2006 for example the estimated average eco- nomic growth rate for the PIDCs was 3.8 per cent, which compares with a 7.9 per cent average for the develop- ing economies of ESCAP. And even this modest growth has not been translated into improved standards of living for sizeable segments of PIDC populations. Population growth is out- stripping the capacity to generate employment and many countries look to emigration to provide the relief. Poverty is increasing both in the bur- geoning urban centres and in de- populated rural areas. Box 1-2 \u2013 Implementing the MDGs in the Pacific Island Developing Countries Another key constraint is the short- age of capacity for management and implementation. This in turn stems from a lack of will and skills. Other problems include shortages of fi- nances, and low levels of education and skill in the workforce. The PIDCs will need to find better ways of integrating the MDGs in na- tional sustainable development strat- egies. This will mean, for example, costing MDG activities, including both financial and human resource contributions, and incorporating these into national budgets. Current gov- ernment budgeting practice in most of these countries is based on out- puts \u2013 on delivering certain quantities and types of services. It would be better if budgeting instead were based on outcomes \u2013 on identifiable long-term improvements in stand- ards, though this will take some time to achieve. PIDCs will also need to improve data collection and monitoring, and estab- lish regular reporting systems, follow- ing standard formats \u2013 though some MDG indicators such as the propor- tion of the population below $1 per day need to be defined in the con- text of the PIDCs to make them more meaningful and relevant. Sur- veys should also include data disaggregated below the household level so that they accurately reflect the lives of women and children. Both the PopGIS and DevInfo data- base software packages have proved effective; they are complementary and will be used throughout the PIDC subregion. 13 Figure 1-1 \u2013 Proportion of countries on and off-track, 2007 CO2 emissions Sanitation rural Infant mortality Water rural Underweight children Forest cover Reaching grade 5 Gender tertiary Under-5 mortality $1 poverty Primary enrolment Sanitation urban Primary completion rate Water urban HIV prevalence TB death rate TB prevalence rate Gender primary Gender secondary ODP CFC consumption Protected area 80 60 40 20 0 20 40 60 80 100 Off-track On-track Early achievers Off-track On-track \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd 1.

Some four mil- lion children in the region die before they reach the age of five. Out of 47 countries for which data are available, 15 are off-track, and several have re- gressed; the situation is particularly dis- turbing in South Asia and Central Asia. The pattern for infant mortality is similar. But even countries that are \u2018on-track\u2019 or \u2018early achievers\u2019 have to remain vigilant as they can easily experience reverses. Child mortality is closely related to gen- der inequality. Prevailing patriarchal norms in several countries have resulted in preferential treatment for boys over girls so that girls\u2019 standards of health and nutrition are neglected. When coun- tries are monitoring child mortality rates, they should therefore pay close atten- tion to the sex ratios. Strategies under MDG 5 to improve women\u2019s levels of basic health and nutrition and to in- crease pregnant women\u2019s access to good health facilities will also help re- duce infant deaths. Maternal mortality For maternal health the performance of Asia and the Pacific has been deeply disappointing. Some 250,000 women in the region die each year during child- birth or from pregnancy-related compli- cations. The MDG target is to reduce the mortality ratio by three-quarters by 2015. In 1990, developing Asia\u2019s overall ratio was 395 deaths per 100,000 live births, but by 2000 this had fallen only 17 to 300. At the current rate of progress the region as a whole, and most coun- tries, will miss the 2015 target. Although the situation differs from coun- try to country, there are a number of common problems. These include gen- der discrimination in access to health services, the poor quality of services, the lack of emergency obstetric care, and the shortage of skilled health per- sonnel and community-level field work- ers. Another major factor is that many pregnant women are in poor health and are malnourished, often a result of their low social and economic status \u2013 espe- cially vulnerable women such as refu- gees, migrant workers, minorities, and women in conflict areas. All these deaths are avoidable. Indeed if all births took place in the presence of skilled attendants, and with access to emergency obstetric care, maternal mor- tality could be cut by 75 per cent (RightsBase, 2007). Countries in the region have been at- tempting to improve maternal and child health. They have made efforts to im- prove maternal health services, includ- ing emergency obstetric care and to provide skilled attendants during preg- nancy, at birth and during the postnatal period. But generally they have not been investing sufficient funds \u2013 which reduces the quality and affordability of services. Many countries in Central Asia and South-East Asia, for example, al- ready have well-developed maternal health care systems but are experienc- ing a deterioration due to a cutback in public expenditures. Progress in reducing maternal mortality has also been hampered by the lack of accurate statistics. Few of the poorest countries have effective systems for vital registration; for data on maternal deaths they usually rely on household and other surveys, which have their own limitations. It will be important therefore to introduce more effective systems for data collection. The missing millions The high number of maternal deaths also contributes to a declining sex ratio. In a number of countries, this imbal- ance is evident at birth. The sex ratio at birth (SRB), the ratio of males to fe- males, in industrial countries is between 1.03 and 1.07.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "321834e2-202b-4df0-bc84-f8c124fbce78": {"__data__": {"id_": "321834e2-202b-4df0-bc84-f8c124fbce78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d2c519ea3df1c62893601996a017fb06970f68ca1a904b1e3dcbfc3336da9b2"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbb90a83-d250-498b-a006-43aaf2de2906", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d85032354204dfdbb5ad064bcc5f9f444134fdcab97386db702c8977ec7fd510"}}, "hash": "d896357f2a3a0247ecc3eaf22288ba3b125bd39880070b33c37df2e28a2f5b0c", "text": "In China, however, the SRB is 1.2 and in India it is 1.08.

They have been better able to choose the sex of a child since the arrival of amniocentesis in the late 1970s and later with ultra- sound imaging technologies. One study in four countries in the region character- izes the skewed outcome as \u2018gendercide\u2019 (UNFPA, 2007). The ratio is further distorted by subsequent gender- based violence or neglect which costs the lives of millions of women and girls. As a result, across the region more than 100 million women, as Amartya Sen has expressed it, are \u2018missing\u2019 (Sen, 1990). This shortage of women is now leading to a number of social problems leading to increased gender violence, migration and trafficking. How can countries in the region tackle gendercide? The overall aim should be to promote the political and economic empowerment of women which has to start with ensuring education of the girl child. But education may not be suffi- cient. As a result of structural gender biases, education has not necessarily translated into better economic opportu- nities. Schooling needs therefore to be supplemented by range of other meas- ures, including the reform of laws and practices on ownership and inheritance, along with campaigns of gender aware- ness for men, and efforts to overturn discriminative religious, social and cul- tural mores. Above all, women need to be able to organize themselves for their own empowerment. 1. Tracking the Goals A Future Within Reach 2008 18 Climate change and environmental sustainability Across the region, many countries face increasing environmental stress and the threats of climate change (Box 1-3). Rapid economic growth has certainly been one of the main engines driving down income poverty. Yet in many countries, this has been at a huge envi- ronmental cost \u2013 including deforestation and the destruction of wetlands, along with increased CO2 emissions, and ex- tensive pollution of air and water. Envi- ronmental damage will further hamper the achievement of income poverty tar- gets since it hits hardest at poor and vulnerable groups. Environmental degra- dation and lack of access to natural resources have their most severe ef- fects on women who bear the primary responsibility for agricultural work, for collecting water and for providing food for their families. Despite efforts at reforestation, many countries have been losing forest cover at alarming rates \u2013 including Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Much of this has been the result of clearing land for plantations. Another major problem for the region is CO2 emissions. Of 48 countries for which data are available, 30 are off-track for meeting the 2015 emissions target (Figure 1-6). Climate change will have a serious impact on the region \u2013 through rising sea levels and changing weather patterns that, among other things, will heighten problems of food insecurity. More positively, the region appears to be making significant progress in reducing the consumption of ozone-depleting CFCs: 37 of 47 countries examined have already reached the target and another 4 are on track. Climate change could cause severe crop losses in Asia within the next 20 years \u2013 with potential food short- ages and a loss of livelihoods for the world\u2019s poorest people. In many countries of the Asia-Pacific region, almost 70 per cent of the population depend for their livelihoods on agri- culture. So efforts to fight poverty and hunger will demand closer atten- tion to climate threats and to food production \u2013 assessing where they are likely to occur and for which crops. Climate change models show that the impacts will vary substantially within regions according, for exam- ple, to biophysical resources and ag- ricultural management practices. Some areas such as the temperate Box 1-3 \u2013 Climate change, food security and the MDGs wheat-growing areas of China could benefit from climate change, at least in the short run. But South Asia\u2019s production of staples including millet, maize and rice are projected to drop by 10 per cent over a period when population will continue to increase. Typically, it takes 15 to 30 years for major agricultural investments to be fully realized, so work must start now to help subsistence farmers adapt to climate change.

Coun- tries across the region seem to have made greater progress in urban areas, but in several it seems that the early gains are fast disappearing as public service delivery systems struggle to keep pace with rapidly growing urban populations. Promoting education Most Asia-Pacific countries give a high priority to education \u2013 in which they invest significant private and public re- sources. This effort has paid off. Pri- mary education is one of the region\u2019s great successes: almost all countries have net primary enrolment ratios above 90 per cent and for many the ratio is approaching 100 per cent. Of 32 coun- tries with data on education, half have already reached their target, although 10 are off-track. The region\u2019s performance is less im- pressive, however, when it comes to repetition and completion. Many chil- dren have to repeat classes or drop out of school before reaching grade five. The problems are greatest for children from poor households \u2013 reducing the prospect of education lifting them out of poverty. Many poor households keep their chil- dren at home or withdraw them before they complete their primary education. They may do so partly because they do not appreciate the long-term benefits of education, particularly for girls who will leave their home after marriage. Or they may want their children to work. But they can also be deterred by the high cost of school materials, the low quality of teaching and, particularly for girls, the distance that children have to travel to school. There are also pressures for girls to marry at an early age. As a result, some countries have fallen short in gender equality. In Afghanistan, for example, 47 per cent fewer girls than boys enrol in primary school; in Paki- stan, that proportion is 29 per cent, and in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Nepal the difference is around 10 per cent. High discrimination in primary education leads to lower literacy rates for girls as well as low enrolment in secondary and tertiary education. This need not happen. A number of Asia-Pacific countries have shown that it is possible to eliminate gender disparity in education relatively quickly. But even in these there is still room for improve- ment at the highest levels: more than one-third of the 26 countries examined are off-track in achieving gender parity in tertiary education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbf296ba-8ba5-4926-a745-4ab13ddf699e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbf296ba-8ba5-4926-a745-4ab13ddf699e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcbb413d3c2df4c8839e1017bfe05be9f6ecccc99735d18c50f07fe0b4dc9021"}, "2": {"node_id": "7986169b-d779-4543-9fa1-7f40c3169c84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5520ab2275ad5587a6f46063c80f432cfd4eda82c4c8fb3df863bb597b8df04c"}}, "hash": "07ed77f583a056e26bc588d4483f8cb2c5c91c41b737946b71915157a7c91ae8", "text": "There are also dis- parities in the choice of subjects for specialization in colleges and universi- ties, with fewer young women choosing science and technology.

Tracking the Goals A Future Within Reach 2008 22 Policy makers have long recognized these complex interactions and have tried to devise appropriate interventions. Some involve legislation and enforce- ment \u2013 making basic education compul- sory, and strictly enforcing restrictions on child marriage. Others include re- ducing the costs of schooling and en- suring more and better trained teachers, especially females, and good sanitary facilities. Governments have also taken action to reduce gender-based violence, both within schools and in journeys to school. Women\u2019s economic and political empowerment Discrimination against girls and women is also widespread in the world of work. One useful indicator is women\u2019s share in non-agricultural wage employment. On this basis in some countries women are doing well: in Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and the Russian Federation there are more women work- ing than men. In several Asia-Pacific countries, however, women are some way behind. Moreover, even when women are working they are predomi- nantly employed in labour-intensive, low value-added manufacturing and service- sector jobs \u2013 vulnerable to domestic and global shifts in demand. As eco- nomic growth picks up in these coun- tries, there will probably be greater de- mand for labour in the non-agricultural wage paying sectors, including for fe- male labour, but given the kind of work women do these gains will remain frag- ile. Women\u2019s low status in employment is another denial of basic rights. But it also has economic costs. ESCAP has estimated that the cost to the region of continuing gender discrimination could reach $80 billion per year (ESCAP, 2007). Women are also less likely to hold posi- tions of political power. The simplest way to measure this is in national par- liaments, by looking at the percentage of seats held by women. Globally the average is quite low, around 15 per cent, but in many countries of the re- gion it is in single digits and since 1990 several countries have regressed. In the region, only in New Zealand do women hold more than 30 per cent of parlia- mentary seats. However, some countries have shown improvements. In India, the world\u2019s largest democracy, the repre- sentation of women in parliament has almost doubled. In Bangladesh the number of seats reserved for women was raised in 2004 from 30 to 75. And in Timor-Leste in 2007 women won 28 per cent of parliamentary seats (UNIFEM, 2007) Discrimination against women takes many forms so it needs to be tackled simultaneously on multiple fronts \u2013 in the family, in education, in the workplace and in society in general. All governments need to integrate consid- erations of gender equality in national legislation and in public policies, plans and programmes. Poverty The region continues to make progress in reducing income poverty (Figure 1- 14). Between 1990 and 2004, the pro- portion of people living on less than $1 (PPP) a day fell from 32.3 to 17 per cent. Over the same period, and de- spite population growth, the absolute number of poor people also fell, from 1,009 million to about 641 million. Data for 22 countries indicate that most of these were able to reduce poverty be- tween the early 1990s and early 2000s (ESCAP/ADB/ UNDP, 2004 and 2007). Moreover, in just two years, between 2002 and 2004, the number of people living in extreme poverty fell by 82 mil- lion. The MDG targets are defined according to the $1-per-day poverty line, which constitutes extreme poverty. Generally, however, a more appropriate measure is the national poverty line which is based on local incomes and prices and better 23 Figure 1-12 \u2013 Lowest shares of women in non-agricultural wage employment, percentage Pakistan Nepal India Bhutan Turkey Bangladesh Indonesia Brunei Darussalam Solomon Islands Papua New Guinea Marshall Islands Tuvalu Fiji Maldives Kiribati Malaysia Cook Islands Tonga China 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 15.1 17.9 19.2 20.3 22.9 29.7 30.3 30.8 32.1 33.2 33.9 34 36.7 37.4 38 38.2 38.6 39.2 9.7 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f6971cf-ea63-425b-80fa-d9e3447b03e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f6971cf-ea63-425b-80fa-d9e3447b03e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8987c0858df64b344bd1ab37e2a8a469e24e84dd298a22def93f65114597697e"}, "2": {"node_id": "48bb225c-bf17-45ff-aca8-d9c0d5b6f05d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da417ed67f62f627315f3c1610e353cd0f7b2c82194af6a1156b6303cbde961f"}}, "hash": "b85c0c1951f5cfbaba1c63fc960e46eb18243b53468060831cd8a0942de36258", "text": "Tracking the Goals A Future Within Reach 2008 24 Figure 1-13 \u2013 Proportion of national parliamentary seats held by women, percentage New Zealand Afghanistan Viet Nam Timor-Leste Australia Lao PDR Pakistan China DPR Korea Uzbekistan Tajikistan Turkmenistan Singapore Philippines Bangladesh Republic of Korea Azerbaijan Maldives Indonesia Thailand Kazakhstan Russian Federation Cambodia Georgia Bhutan Malaysia Japan Fiji India Mongolia Samoa Nepal Armenia Sri Lanka Kiribati Turkey Iran (Islamic Republic of) Tonga Marshall Islands Papua New Guinea 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 32.2 27.3 27.3 25.3 24.7 22.9 21.3 20.3 20.1 17.5 17.5", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aa286ca-2703-4584-8b43-07fa67b7c5ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aa286ca-2703-4584-8b43-07fa67b7c5ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d54adefe7160a5e5417f63333218ce24a397a7835b6f4ab3eae0f76affcd1069"}, "3": {"node_id": "a35d6407-f99d-4401-9938-bad6293e0dbe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60ce55c689e18a1b364f0fcbe53efacda93732f1cbc745d5b693bc3de44d2f1c"}}, "hash": "555944c05808ca3662f105a258a3d7183d734a25e7a1d00795acac4fb9ae675e", "text": "16 16 15.7 14.8 13.4 13 12 11.3 10.6 10.4 9.8 9.8 9.4 9.1 9 8.5 8.3 9.3 6.7 6.1 5.9 5.3 4.9 4.8 4.4 4.1 3.4 3 0.9 25 Figure 1-14 \u2013 Population below $1 per day, by subregion, 1990-2004, percentage 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 1990 2004 CIS in Asia Asia-Pacific South-East Asia Asia-Pacific (excl.

Tracking the Goals A Future Within Reach 2008 26 reflects national conditions. For most countries, the rates are higher than the international poverty lines, though in most of these cases the poverty rates have fallen. One of the region\u2019s great success sto- ries has been China which between 1990 and 2004 reduced the incidence of extreme poverty from 33 to 10 per cent, thus surpassing the 2015 target \u2013 and taking a vast number of people out of poverty. Sharp reductions have also occurred in Azerbaijan, Indonesia and Thailand. On the other hand, between the early 1990s and early 2000s, it is clear that some countries have slipped backwards. Moreover, despite falls in poverty, progress has been uneven (Box 1-4) and some countries, particularly in the recent past, have experienced sharp in- creases in inequality. An ADB study in 16 developing countries in the region, for example, showed that between 1993 and 2003 the aggregate Gini-coefficient increased from 47 to 52. Sharp in- creases were noted in several countries, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Another measure of inequality is the share of the poor in national income or consumption: except in Japan the share of the poorest 20 per cent remains less than 10 per cent and in several coun- tries appears to have gone down. Pov- erty rates for children defined broadly can also be higher than those for adults (Box 1-5). High income poverty and increasing in- equality accompanied by limited or no access to public resources, and a sense of powerlessness among the poor, can pose serious challenges for Even countries that have made ex- emplary progress in reducing poverty still have pockets of society that face extreme poverty, hunger and malnu- trition. The largest group is formed by the rural poor, who have often been neglected in national economic planning and policies. India \u2013 Many of the poorest states are predominantly agrarian. In the poverty-stricken state of Orissa, for example, nearly 85 per cent of the population live in rural areas and are dependent on agricultural resources and livelihoods. However, agriculture has experienced only weak growth in wage employment, and productivity is low. As a result, rural households find it difficult to escape poverty. Similarly in the state of Chhattisgarh, known as the rice bowl of Central India, 80 per cent of the total popu- lation live in rural areas. Approxi- mately 98 per cent of rural villagers and 96 per cent urban of dwellers live on less than $1 per day (CECOEDECON/IDS, 2007). Indonesia \u2013 Two-thirds of poor households are employed in agricul- ture. Moreover, the district and pro- vincial disparities have widened: in 2004 in the largely rural province of Papua, for example, the poverty rate was 41 per cent compared with 3 per cent in the capital, Jakarta.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a35d6407-f99d-4401-9938-bad6293e0dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "a35d6407-f99d-4401-9938-bad6293e0dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d54adefe7160a5e5417f63333218ce24a397a7835b6f4ab3eae0f76affcd1069"}, "2": {"node_id": "1aa286ca-2703-4584-8b43-07fa67b7c5ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "555944c05808ca3662f105a258a3d7183d734a25e7a1d00795acac4fb9ae675e"}}, "hash": "60ce55c689e18a1b364f0fcbe53efacda93732f1cbc745d5b693bc3de44d2f1c", "text": "In 2002, the official MDG report as- serted that the country as a whole were still on track to achieve the poverty reduction target by 2015, nevertheless, many provinces and districts with insurgencies and seces- sionist movements were far behind the national average of 18 per cent.

Women and girls in particular often suffer greater poverty often as a result of direct discrimination \u2013 including diffi- culties in birth registration, limited ac- cess to free primary education, and discrimination against women in laws relating to marriage, labour, inherit- ance and property. It will also be important to look specifically at the rights of children. Box 1-5 \u2013 Fulfilling the rights of children For adults, poverty measures are normally based on income. Poverty measures of children, however, should include other indicators, including whether the child has been vaccinated and is attending school. Child and adult poverty are poorly correlated, indicating that child poverty needs a different kind of attention. This has massive policy and resource implications, since in most countries children constitute one-third to one-half of the popula- tion. But further progress remains to be made to ensure that the MDGs capture the full scope of the Millen- nium Declaration in respect of child poverty and denials of children\u2019s rights. These include corporal punishment and other types of violence and abuse in homes, communities and schools, as well as incarceration of children with adults and other inappropriate forms of legal process.

These issues are compounded by weakness in governance, problems in service delivery, and persistent gender discrimination (Box 1-6). Hunger and malnutrition Hunger is a term for which there is no single, clear, and universally-accepted definition. According to the MDG stand- ard, the average daily energy require- ment for adults undertaking light activity is 2,200 calories. But there also de- grees of hunger. The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests three categories: the \u2018subjacent hungry\u2019, who consume between 1,800 and 2,200 calories per day; the \u2018medial hungry\u2019, consuming 1,600 to 1,800 calories; and the \u2018ultra hungry\u2019, consuming less than 1,600 calories (Jha, 2008). According to FAO, on the basis of the 2,200 calorie standard about 545 million people in Asia and the Pacific are un- dernourished \u2013 constituting 65 per cent of the world\u2019s undernourished. Of these, 300 million are in South Asia of whom 233 million are in India. Some 160 mil- lion are in East Asia, of whom 119 million are in China. South-East Asia has 65 million (FAO, 2004).

Underweight and malnour- ished girls grow up to be undernour- ished mothers, who with poor health care in pregnancy are in turn at risk of giving birth to underweight children. As Figure 1-19 highlights, there are many complex two-way interactions between nutrition and health. On the one hand, undernourished children are more sus- ceptible to infection and disease; on the other hand, regular infections, particu- larly due to unsafe water supplies, re- duce children\u2019s capacity to absorb nutri- ents. Moreover, children and women are also subject to other forms of malnutri- tion including micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies that put them at further risk. However, these forms of malnutri- tion are not necessarily the result of absolute shortages of food, especially given the small amounts that small chil- dren eat, but rather due to inadequate feeding, especially when children are being weaned. The various forms of malnutrition have enormous human costs.

The impact of hunger is worst on girl children and women, who typically eat least and last, often surviving on left-overs. There are also serious economic costs. Children whose physical and cognitive growth has been slowed have diminished work- ing capacity as adults. Across the re- gion, malnutrition and hunger each year cost billions of dollars of lost productiv- ity, earnings and consumption (FAO, 2004). There are also political risks: when people cannot afford to feed themselves and their families, there are likely to be social disturbances. Tackling hunger and malnutrition is a huge and complex undertaking (Box 1- 7), but one of the most basic tasks is to ensure food security and particularly grain security. This requires grain that is nutritionally adequate and socially ac- ceptable but also that people have full economic, physical and social access to such grain at all times. Unfortunately grain security is not guar- anteed. China, for example, is a major producer and feeds 22 per cent of the world\u2019s population with only 7 per cent of the world\u2019s available land.

All countries in the region need to strengthen their management of food production, distribution and reserves. But there are also measures that can be taken at the regional level. It is clear however that hunger and mal- nutrition are not due primarily to prob- lems with food production. Nor are they simply the outcome of poverty. In fact, the region has been more successful at producing food and reducing poverty than it has at reducing hunger and child malnutrition. Some of the prob- lems lie with the way the food is used. One of the most important steps will be to increase women\u2019s status. This not only fulfils their basic rights but also raises standards for other members of the household, since women who have better standards of education, and who have greater access to productive as- sets and resources will be in a better position to ensure that their children are well fed. Countries will also need to improved essential social infrastructure to relieve women of some of the burden of care-giving.

Large numbers of people in the region are infected by two other diseases \u2013 malaria and tuberculosis. Malaria is a major public health concern in many areas and in some places appears to have become drug resistant. Tuberculo- sis also remains a serious problem: Asia and the Pacific has two of every three people in the world infected by the disease. However, the region as a whole is making some progress: be- tween 1990 and 2003 the number of people infected with TB declined from 12.8 million to 10.3 million and the number of people dying each year fell from 1.1 million to 1.0 million.

Nevertheless the vol- ume of aid has increased: between 1990 and 2005, global flows of ODA rose from $23 billion to million to $44 billion. Also encouraging is that an in- creasing proportion of this is being de- voted to basic social services; in some donor countries more than 30 per cent. The proportion of bilateral ODA that is untied has also risen steeply and in the case of Ireland and the Untied States has now reached 100 per cent. International trade Goal 8 also recognizes the importance of international trade. The trends in duty-free access to developed-country markets for developing and least devel- oped countries seem to vary between regional groupings. In 1996, Asia-Pacific LDCs had the same level of duty-free access as sub-Saharan LDCs \u2013 about 60 per cent \u2013 but by the late 1990s and early 2000s, their share of trade had declined. Their position seems to be improving but it still remains much below the lev- els recorded for the sub-Saharan LDCs. The LDCs should be able to increase their exports to other countries in the region, including the larger developing countries. To do this they will also need better access. Of the developing coun- tries in the region, China and India have done most to allow LDCs duty-free ac- cess to their markets. Aside from the LDCs, the developing countries in the region are also affected by trade barriers applied by developed countries. China and South-East Asia appear to face the highest average tar- iffs imposed on agricultural products, textiles and clothing from developing countries. They also suffer because the developed countries maintain high lev- els of agricultural protection. Goal 8 also sets targets for other forms of co-operation. It calls for developed and developing countries to formulate and implement strategies for opening up decent and productive work for youth and thus integrate them in the MDG process. But that task remains largely unfulfilled (Figure 1-22). Indeed, the Asia-Pacific region now faces a very disturbing situation: youth unemploy- ment is on the rise almost every where and in several countries has reached double-digit levels. Although some countries they have narrowed the gap, overall young women seem to have higher levels of unemployment than young men. No-one left behind Countries in Asia and the Pacific thus have much to be proud of. In most countries, the next generation are likely to be less poor and better educated. The risk now, however, is that of rising inequality \u2013 that the benefits of develop- ment are increasingly being skewed to- wards the better off. As the Millennium Declaration makes clear, development is for everyone. The challenge now is to ensure that no-one is left behind. The ways of achieving this and of filling the gaps are the subject of the next chap- ter. 1.

Tracking the Goals 39 \u201cS ince their adoption by all United Nations Member States in 2000, the Millennium Declaration and the Mil- lennium Development Goals (MDGs) have become a universal framework of development\u201d \u2013 Ban Ki-moon, Secre- tary-General, United Nations, 2007. For the MDGs to fulfil their potential as this universal framework they need to find a place in national development strategies \u2013 and in particular those for promoting economic growth. Strong growth should make it easier to achieve the MDGs. But growth will not suffice. South Asia, for example, includes coun- tries that are strong performers eco- nomically but under-perform in relation to social indicators (UNICEF, 2007). This chapter analyzes the contribution, and limitations of economic growth for achieving the MDGs. The conceptual framework is illustrated in Figure 2-1. On the left side this indicates how inad- equate policies and strategies will not only hamper growth but also weaken the linkages to poverty reduction while undermining social services. These in- adequacies can be seen leading one of two gaps. The first is an \u2018MDG gap\u2019 \u2013 the likely shortfall in MDG indicators on the basis of present patterns of growth. The second way of looking at this is to envisage a \u2018growth gap\u2019 \u2013 the boost in economic growth that would be needed to meet the MDGs. The right side of the diagram, by contrast, indicates that a well-designed development strategy with MDG-friendly economic and social policies would ensure strong, pro-poor and inclusive growth and provide good quality basic services for the poor. The impact of income growth What effect does the rate of economic growth have on each of the MDGs? This can be estimated using standard statistical regression techniques to cal- culate the \u2018MDG elasticity\u2019 \u2013 i.e. the percentage change in the MDG indica- tor for each 1 per cent increase in growth. This has been tested for 11 indicators \u2013 primarily those for which there is a reasonably large data set. These and the socio-economic variables are listed in Box 2-1. The results of the analysis are detailed in Annex 1 and summarized in Figure 2- 2. They show that growth has its great- est effect on income poverty: among 25 2. Filling the MDG gaps Achieving the Millennium Development Goals will mean boost- ing economic growth. But this will not be enough. Even the most optimistic growth scenarios are likely to leave major gaps that will need to be filled by determined and imaginative action at both national and international levels. 2.

Note that this and similar conclusions are based on correlations across a group of coun- tries. They do not consider all the causes and effects. Nor do they mean that for every country a 1 per cent rise in income will consistently produce a 0.86 per cent reduction in poverty. Nev- ertheless they do suggest possibilities and general orders of magnitude. It should also be emphasized that they are by no means the only factors bear- ing on those indicators. Many other fac- tors have a bearing on poverty, for ex- ample, particularly for women (Box 2.2). Economic growth also has an impact on undernutrition, though the effect is smaller: a 1 per cent increase in per capita GDP is associated with a drop of about half a percent in undernutrition. Growth also appears to have a smaller effect on infant and under-5 mortality and on maternal mortality. A 1 per cent increase in per capita income is associ- ated with a 0.3 per cent fall in maternal mortality, a 0.43 per cent fall in child mortality, and a 0.46 per cent fall in infant mortality. Economic growth appears to have con- siderably less impact on education \u2013 on primary enrolment and on primary com- pletion. Growth also has a relatively small effect when it comes improving gender parity in education (GPI), though it rises with education level. Some evi- dence suggests that the gains for girls are greatest among higher-income classes who recognize the value of girls\u2019 education and act accordingly. The impact of other variables Of the other macroeconomic indicators for which data are available, the one with the greatest number of significant correlations with the MDGs is openness to international trade (Figure 2-3). Again the greatest effect appears to be on poverty: a 1 per cent increase in trade as a proportion of GDP is associated with a 0.7 per cent drop in the propor- tion of people living on less than $1 per day. Compared with growth, trade has less effect on mortality, but it does have a significant effect on education, even on primary schooling, perhaps because trade raises the value of skills: trade openness should increase the need for human capital, leading to higher returns for education and health. Conversely, trade can increase the supply of such services and thus help to achieve the relevant MDGs. It is noticeable too that trade appears to make a difference even for countries at the same level of national income: the degree of trade openness can re- Figure 2-2 \u2013 Impact of a 1 per cent increase in per capita GDP on selected MDG indicators Population below $1 a day Poverty gap ratio Population undernourished Infant mortality rate (0-1 year) per 1,000 live births Under-5 mortality rate per 1,000 live births Maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births GPI in primary level enrolment Primary completion rate Net enrolment ratio in primary education GPI in secondary level enrolment GPI in tertiary level enrolment \u20131.0 \u20130.8 \u20130.6 \u20130.4 \u20130.2 0.0 0.2 \u20130.858 \u20130.781 \u20130.483 \u20130.482 \u20130.430 \u20130.304 0.023 0.049 0.054 0.056 0.109 2.

This may be because differ- ences in trade openness capture differ- ences in the quality of growth (Ahmed and Sattar, 2004; Sawada et al, 2006). Due to a scarcity of data, the picture for other variables is less complete. The available data are presented in Annex table 1.1 but a few of the results stand out. One concerns the share of agricul- ture in GNP: a reduction in the share is associated with a significant reduction in poverty. Another concerns the food price index: an increase in the food price or consumer price index is associ- ated with a more than proportionate in- crease in the percentage of the popula- tion undernourished. The limitations of growth: growth gaps As these elasticities show, a rise in in- come is likely to have a beneficial effect on the MDGs. But countries that rely on income alone are likely to fall short for many of the indicators, with what might be called the \u2018income-only\u2019 gaps. These can be calculated by using the growth elasticities discussed in the previous section and applying them to the trend in economic growth. Details of these 43 gaps are given in Annex tables 1.2 to 1.4. The main findings are as follows: Poverty and education \u2013 In this case the \u2018income-only\u2019 gaps are quite low. The gaps or shortfalls are mostly 15 per- centage points or less for income pov- erty, the percentage of undernourished population, net enrolment in primary education, and the primary completion rate. For example, for income poverty, of the 25 countries examined, 17 are likely to fall short of the target, but only in 2 of these will the gap be greater than 15 percentage points.1 Gender \u2013 For educational enrolment, the majority of countries examined have projected gender parity gaps, which rise with level of education. Of the 29 coun- tries, 23 have gaps at the primary level but only in 1 is the gap greater than 0.2. For the secondary level, however, 17 countries have gaps, and in 7 coun- tries these are greater than 0.2. At the tertiary level, 18 countries have gaps and in 13 these are greater than 0.2. There are other serious gaps in the achievement of access to political deci- sion making and to capital, credit and resources. Health \u2013 Dependence on income-only growth will also leaves very large gaps in health-related indicators. Of the 30 countries examined, 27 would miss the maternal mortality target and 12 would do so by more than 100 deaths per 100,000 live births. For under-5 mortality all 30 countries examined will face gaps, mostly of up to 100 per 1,000 live births. One option for narrowing the gaps would be to boost economic growth. But this gap analysis demonstrates the limitations of such a strategy. Even if all 25 countries increased their projected per capita GDP growth by 3 percentage points \u2013 raising it say from 5 to 8 per cent, of the 17 countries currently off- track on the basis of current growth rates, 10 would still fall short of the target for income poverty (Annex table 1.5). The shortfalls for other indicators are likely to be even greater. For the proportion of the population un- dernourished, even with this substantial boost in growth only 2 of 19 off-track countries would meet the target. For primary school enrolment only 2 of those 15 falling short would achieve their target and for primary level com- pletion only 2 out 15. For gender parity in primary enrolment, only 3 out of 17 failing countries would reach their target and for gender parity at second- ary enrolment, none out of 18 would do so. Similarly for maternal mortality, for which all 30 countries had a gap, an increase of 3 percentage points would help only one country hit the target. In practice, increasing per capita in- come growth by 3 percentage points in these countries is highly unlikely. So economic growth alone is not the solu- tion. Instead, countries will need to im- prove the structure and quality of eco- nomic growth and make appropriate changes to national development strate- gies. Assessing national development strategies: filling strategy gaps To what extent are they making such changes?

Impacts of growth in other variables, enabling policies and institutions which have positive contributions to reducing poverty are not considered. Many of these have trend similar to income growth. A Future Within Reach 2008 44 A typical case for the preparation of MDG and PRSP reports is Bangla- desh. The 2005 MDG progress report was jointly prepared by the Government and the United Nations Country Team with other stakeholders. The first step was to establish Technical Working Groups (TWGs) which identified relevant MDG targets and indicators and the benchmark year from which the MDGs were to be monitored. The TWGs used econometric models to simulate the rates of growth required to achieve the MDGs, to show whether the country was on track, and to reveal the gaps and challenges. The report showed considerable progress in a number of areas, in- cluding immunization, micro-credit, female economic participation, birth control, physical mobility and safety nets. But some of the most striking achievements have been in primary and girls\u2019 education: the country is well on-track for universal primary education. Its main education chal- lenge now is to ensure sufficient fi- nancing to keep up the momentum. The report discusses a number of broad policies, including monetary and fiscal measures, structural re- form policies, and sectoral interven- Box 2-3 \u2013 The MDG and PRSP processes in Bangladesh tions such as infrastructure develop- ment, national nutrition programmes, social safety nets, and protection against natural disasters. The MDG report emphasizes the need for strong partnerships at national and global levels both to maintain devel- opment assistance and to achieve better access for Bangladesh\u2019s ex- ports. However, the report does not detail the programmes, measures and financial resources required to achieve those objectives. Nor does it provide in-depth socioeconomic analysis at the national or sub-na- tional levels. To complement its MDG Report, Bangladesh also prepared a PRSP which addressed the issues of pro- poor growth and human develop- ment. It established 12 groups each of which coordinated the preparation of a thematic background paper. The groups comprised senior officials from the line ministries and Ministries of Finance and Planning. Although the PRSP was prepared entirely by the government, the groups also included observers from NGOs and other civil society groups and donor agencies as well as bilateral donors and international organizations including the World Bank, IMF, ADB, UNDP, UNICEF, UNAIDS and UNFPA. Five countries had only MDG reports \u2013 China, Maldives, Myanmar, Thailand and Papua New Guinea. One of these coun- tries, Samoa, had only a national devel- opment plan (Annex 2). MDG reports and the PRSPs are inevi- tably closely related. They cover most of the same indicators and both are prepared through consultations with all stakeholders \u2013 which generally includes Ministries of Planning and Finance, concerned line ministries, NGOs, donors and international organizations (Box 2-3). The analysis of various reports from the 14 countries showed that while all countries had distinctive features they generally took a common approach. All emphasized the importance of stable, broad-based, inclusive and participatory economic growth. They also covered a wide range of policies, reforms and pro- grammes \u2013 which can be grouped un- der 9 broad headings: 45 \u2022 Sustaining macroeconomic stability and macro liberalization \u2022 Structural reforms in trade, industry, land, labour and capital markets \u2022 Sectoral priorities for poverty reduction and employment genera- tion \u2022 Development of physical infrastruc- ture and human capital \u2022 Conflict resolution, social develop- ment and environmental protection \u2022 Direct poverty alleviation pro- grammes \u2022 Improving legal and institutional frameworks \u2022 External aid coordination and harmo- nization \u2022 Strengthening systems for measure- ment, evaluation, monitoring and re- view All these areas are interrelated and thus need to be addressed together \u2013 though their coverage and intensity will depend on the country\u2019s size, level of economic development and socio-politi- cal environment.

The importance of good governance The effectiveness of all these activities will depend critically on the quality of governance. The Millennium Declaration, which gave rise to the Millennium Development Goals, stresses the impor- tance of good governance. This has 8 major characteristics: participation; the rule of law; transparency; responsive- ness to public will and needs; consen- sus orientation; equity and inclusiveness; effectiveness and effi- ciency; and accountability. A process of decision making and implementation with these characteristics will incorpo- rate the views of minorities and the most vulnerable \u2013 empowering them to become agents of their own develop- ment. It also helps ensure that the right policy choices are made that minimizes corruption thus saving resources. Good governance can help overcome many income and non-income barriers. Much of this will involve changing deci- sion-making processes at the national level, cutting through the bureaucratic jungle of laws, and exploring more ef- fective forms of service delivery. How- ever, in some cases it will also involve decentralization of power and authority from higher to lower tiers of government \u2013 and broadening the range of basic service providers to include community organizations, non-governmental organi- zations and the private sector. Govern- ments always retain the primary and ultimate responsibility for ensuring that everyone has access to basic services at all times, but in some cases they can concentrate more on creating a suitable environment \u2013 encouraging the involvement of a range of providers, while setting standards and carrying that functions of regulation and monitor- ing. Good governance is also open and ac- countable. A number of countries have, for example, experimented with public hearings and require government func- tionaries to publicly justify their actions 2.

Others, as in India, have promoted the right to information, requiring details of many government actions to be published, and empower- ing citizens to demand certain types of data. Good governance also has implications for the environment, since it enables countries to balance the needs of eco- nomic growth with those of environmen- tal protection. As countries get richer they typically raise their standards, in- vesting heavily in cleaning up water supplies, for example, and in better sanitation. And as their economies be- come more sophisticated they may also shift gear \u2013 for example from making steel or chemicals to manufacturing computer chips or to expanding serv- ices. But these changes are not auto- matic; they have to be supplemented by good governance that gives a high priority to environmental concerns.

Indeed, when economic growth is combined with good governance, it can strengthen environmental protection and combat climate change. Macroeconomic policies: addressing policy gaps Raising standards of governance will also assist countries in their efforts to achieve \u2018pro-poor\u2019 growth. Growth is pro-poor if the poor gain a greater share in national income. It also implies a process where growth occurs for the poor and is generated by the poor in their localities. There is no inherent trade off between poverty reduction and economic growth. Indeed, if growth is pro-poor it will be more inclusive and sustainable, starting a virtuous cycles of MDG achievement and economic growth. A high rate of economic growth increases the capacity of countries to mobilize resources for funding these interventions, though their success also depends on the political will of government leaders to pursue such initiatives effectively. Box 2-4 shows examples of specific interven- tions. Economic policies which enable pro- MDG economic growth can be classi- fied in 4 broad groups: economy-wide institutional and policy reforms, macr- oeconomic stabilization, sectoral poli- cies and interventions and pro-poor expenditures and revenue policies. Economy-wide institutional and policy reforms When developing countries are aiming to stimulate economic growth, they typi- cally adopt a standard set of policies: privatization, deregulation, liberalization of trade and the financial sector, and capital account convertibility. They trust that these measures will unleash the entrepreneurship and dynamism of the private sector, both domestic and for- eign, and enhance competition and effi- ciency. The aim is to exploit the coun- try\u2019s comparative advantages \u2013 increas- ing exports and attracting foreign capi- tal, especially direct foreign investment. But such policies can also harm the poor, at least in the short to medium term. The first phase of privatization in the 1970s and 1980s, for example, led to massive lay-offs, thus increasing pov- erty and threatening the MDGs. Re- forms therefore need to be accompa- nied by complementary policies, with active labour market interventions to maximize employment, along with ro- bust safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. Macroeconomic stabilization policies Governments pursuing macroeconomic stabilization are generally aiming for low inflation. This involves fiscal and mon- etary discipline, reducing both fiscal and current account deficits, keeping real exchange rates stable and interest rates moderate. In this way they hope 2.

The traditional \u2018Washington Con- sensus\u2019 interpretation of macroeconomic stabilization often overemphasized low inflation and demand management at the expense of growth and develop- ment. For example, efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit by cutting public expendi- ture, especially on physical and social infrastructure, can easily restrain short- and medium-term growth. Often a better approach is to focus on supply man- agement, for example stabilizing food prices through increasing food availabil- ity \u2013 which will benefit the poor. Sectoral policies and interventions One of the most important sectors for poverty reduction is agriculture which employs substantial quantities of labour, one of the chief resources of the poor. Policies to promote agriculture include investments in rural infrastructure, irriga- tion networks, farm-to-market roads, and rural electrification. Strengthening rural infrastructure in this way not only in- creases the income of the poor but also widens access to services and thus helps to achieve the other MDG goals. Pro-poor expenditures and revenue policies As well as promoting growth, govern- ments will also want to ensure that its benefits improve the position of the poor. To achieve this they will need to change the structure of taxes, correct pro-rich subsidies, and allocate public expenditure so as to increase the availability of services and ensure that priority sectors have access to bank credit. Providing MDG goods and services As indicated earlier, economic growth has a major and direct impact on Goal 1 by helping to reduce poverty, but has rather less impact on other Goals 2 to 7, which depend more on people being able to consume certain goods and services. To reduce maternal mortality, for example, pregnant women need to visit antenatal clinics and have access to emergency obstetric services. To in- crease enrolment, pupils have to be able to attend schools. In short, people need to be able to consume what might be called \u2018MDG goods and serv- ices\u2019 (Sarkar, 2007). Often they are prevented from access- ing these services by non-income fac- tors. Some obstacles may be legal: if children lack birth certificates they may not get access to health or education services. Other hindrances may derive from social practices and customs. For example, in many Asia-Pacific countries, pregnant women even from relatively rich families do not regularly visit medi- cal clinics, and many are deterred by the prospect of examination by male doctors. And in some societies people are denied access to services as a result of discrimination on the basis of gender, caste, or ethnic origin. People with disabilities will often face physical barriers and people infected with HIV can find it difficult to receive health treatment. Those who live and work in the informal sector may be excluded from all sorts of entitlements and social security. In addition, there are supply constraints \u2013 due to the weak capacity of service providers and the low quality of services which are often scant in remote areas. This in turn generates costs for the poor. For example, absence of health clinics and hospitals nearby will compel people to walk or hire transport \u2013 increasing the implicit price and inhibiting consumption. The absence of proper road infrastruc- ture will further add to the cost. 2. Filling the MDG gaps A Future Within Reach 2008 50 If economic growth is accompanied by improvements in both physical and social infrastructure, it will thus promote the MDGs. This should be a self- reinforcing process: expansion in the MDG goods and services sectors can also act an engine of growth, turning \u2018pro-MDG growth\u2019 into \u2018pro-growth MDGs\u2019. Benchmarking public policies To what extent have governments been pursuing pro-MDG growth? Given the shortage of data, this can be difficult to judge. This section attempts to assess this with an analysis of 27 countries across the region. It draws on country data for the period 1999 to 2005 com- piled from the World Development Indi- cators 2006 (Annex table 3.1). To avoid annual volatility it uses average values of the indicators over the period 2000- 2005. The indicator corresponding to a par- ticular policy variable is calculated using a number of associated indicators (Annex 3). The financial indicator, for Like any form of economic analysis the benchmarking methodology used in this chapter has its limitations. One concerns the selection of benchmark countries, since that choice inevitably affects the outcome. There are also difficulties in interpreting the results. For example, this approach which takes benchmark countries as \u2018good models\u2019, assumes that other coun- tries will get similar MDG outcome from similar actions, though the na- tional development context is often very", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "588f0419-0c60-4371-b9f9-e6425f7e6b29": {"__data__": {"id_": "588f0419-0c60-4371-b9f9-e6425f7e6b29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "423cb5a99e3952237eeb09ba807da48e329bb2d292b1be67a186633fe0d367bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "14591d69-83f5-4aba-aad9-65dd0d03fa98", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4350d1fbd8d4c74af5f0bd126b05ecf88a312caf209368561a3d963df3ddb547"}}, "hash": "5280c8574fd50527128300abbb9e645e348ee8b60e403e56f0ce954481440889", "text": "different. Another issue is the weight accorded to each indicator. This analysis as- Box 2-5 \u2013 Limitations of the benchmarking methodology sumes they all have equal value. Thus, if there is a 45 per cent gap in the ratio of health expenditure to GDP, but only a 30 per cent gap in the tax to GDP ratio, the implication is that increasing health expenditure should have a higher priority than increasing tax buoyancy. It could be argued, however, that tax issues should start out with an initially heavier weighting given its impor- tance for boosting public revenues. Nevertheless, with a careful selection of benchmarks, this form of analysis can be a useful way of identifying priorities for assistance, both financial and technical. example, is an average of 3 indicators: M3 as percentage of GDP; domestic credit as a percentage of GDP; the number of bank branches per 100,000 people. For purposes of comparison, this analy- sis selects 2 countries as benchmarks. One is China which has made exem- plary progress in boosting economic growth and reducing poverty. The other is Thailand, which has already achieved some of the MDGs and is on track to achieve many more. Some benchmarks are those of China; the others are from Thailand (Annex table 3.2). Other countries are then measured against these benchmarks. The scale of the task facing each country is as- sessed by considering how far it is from the benchmark, the gap being ex- pressed as a percentage of the bench- mark value. These gaps highlight the main problems \u2013 the size of the gap indicating the priority each area should receive (Box 2-5). The analysis considers 21 indicators grouped into 7 policy areas \u2013 macro, fiscal, finance, trade, business, health 51 and education \u2013 each of which is ac- corded equal weight. For particular country, the area with the largest gap is identified as Priority I, the next Priority II, and so on. For example, comparing Bangladesh with China and Thailand produced a 69 per cent gap in finance but a 55 per cent gap in macro. In Bangladesh, Priority I was finance, Priority II was fiscal and Priority III was education. The results of this analysis are aggre- gated for the 27 countries in Table 2-2. The first row shows that the most important priority in 13 countries is finance, while in 11 countries it is macroeconomic policy, in 2 it is educa- tion while in only 1 it is trade. Corre- spondingly, the second row shows that in 6 countries the second priority area was macroeconomic policy, while in 7 others it was finance and in 5 others it was health. Overall, the main priority areas are finance, the macroeconomy, education, trade and health. These 4 areas thus represent a menu, for any regional assistance strategy. Filling the implementation gap Poor progress towards achieving MDGs is often due to a gap between commitment and implementation. All stakeholders need to pay attention to this but governments, the United Na- tions system and the international com- munity in particular need to fulfil their various promises \u2013 making aid more predictable and effective and forging stronger country- and regional-level pro- grammes in support of the MDGs. The United Nations and other global forums have discussed these imple- mentation gaps in detail. In his report, Towards Achieving Internationally Agreed Development Goals, including Those Contained in the Millennium Declaration, the Secretary-General made recommen- dations that are equally applicable at the regional level.

A Future Within Reach 2008 52 lennium Development Goals by 2015\u2019. So far, few have followed through on this commitment. What needs to be done? First, govern- ments must back the MDGs fully at national and international levels, setting out achievable targets, clear timelines and practical strategies. Second, they will have to break out of the limited sectoral approach to encompass a more integrated framework. Finally, they should institute systems for continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure that implementation remains on-track and that some goals are not pursued at the expense of others. At the country level, this means that governments need to establish clear MDG strategies and budgets. At the regional level, all the United Nations agencies and the development banks have to establish a stronger partner- ships to make optimum use of their combined financial, technical and hu- man resources. Costing the MDGs: addressing financial gaps A critical step in devising MDG policies is making realistic estimates of the costs so that these can be fully incor- porated into national budgets. The di- rect costs include those for creating essential facilities: reaching health tar- gets, for example, involves building more hospitals and clinics, providing medicines and equipment, and appoint- ing sufficient doctors and nurses. The indirect costs can be even more di- verse, ranging from building rural roads to investing in advocacy aimed at re- ducing gender discrimination against women. In the least developed countries in par- ticular, where the private sector is often weak, such investment will come almost entirely from government. But govern- ments too will find it difficult to invest, since national savings are typically low and tax revenues limited. Many LDCs also already in debt so further large- scale borrowing is impossible. The in- evitable result is a large MDG resource gap. One of the first priorities therefore is to measure the gap \u2013 to estimate how much it will cost to meet each of the MDGs. With this information, govern- ments can make better choices be- tween different pro-poor strategies and policy options, and make more accurate needs forecasts that can be used to justify additional foreign aid. The aim should be to align MDG targets with national budgets, sectoral plans and foreign aid. Cost estimates should address institu- tional constraints and set out priorities to permit adjustments in the light of resource availability. They must be based on realistic assessments and be presented in a form that can support resource bids. When these estimates have been prepared and governments have made reasonable efforts to mobi- lize domestic resources, donors can then be urged to fill the gaps. Several approaches have been devel- oped to estimate the costs of the MDGs, at the global, national and sectoral levels. The World Bank, for ex- ample, has been estimating the costs of attaining Goals in the off-track coun- tries \u2013 assuming a conducive policy and institutional environment. For the whole world, it has estimated the cost to donors of achieving Goal 1 \u2013 reduc- ing income poverty and under nutrition \u2013 at $54 billion to $62 billion a year. For the other goals, it has estimated the global costs as $35 billion to $76 billion per year. However, it stresses that in order to avoid \u2018double-counting\u2019 these two sets of figures should not be ag- gregated since achieving Goal 1 will help to achieve the other goals. A background paper for the UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report 2003 took a broadly similar approach. It estimated 53 the annual investment cost of generat- ing poverty-reducing increases in output in developing countries at $76 billion \u2013 higher than the upper range of the World Bank\u2019s estimates (Reddy and Heuty, 2005). The World Bank has also estimated the financial requirements of achieving gen- der equality and women\u2019s empower- ment. For Bangladesh, over the period 2006-2015, it concluded that this would require at least $57 billion and for Cam- bodia $7 billion. The cost of meeting gender targets is of course closely linked with the costs of achieving all the other MDGs since over 90 per cent of the costs associated with achieving gender equality and women\u2019s empower- ment would be investments in sectoral programmes such as health and educa- tion (Box 2-4). An Asia-Pacific needs assessment One effort to measure this at the na- tional level in certain countries has been undertaken by UNDP: the MDG Needs Assessment (NA).

Key steps include identify- ing interventions, setting targets, costing them, and then linking them to the na- tional development strategy. The as- sessment involves all types of inputs or resources \u2013 financial, human and infra- structure. These are estimated using Ex- cel-based tools developed by the United Nations Millennium Project and other United Nations agencies. The NA and costing tools cover a number of thematic areas including ag- riculture, education, health, HIV/AIDS, energy, water and sanitation, environ- ment and transportation. For gender, environment, ICT, governance and com- munity development, the NA follows a two-pronged approach (i) incorporating the costings in sectoral needs assess- ments and (ii) conducting a separate NA for stand-alone interventions, poli- cies and institutions. A separate tool has been developed for independent costing of HIV responses, but this can also be integrated with the health tool. The NA has not developed a tool for the income poverty target. This is due to the multi-dimensional nature of pov- erty which is contingent upon many fac- tors such as the overall rate, composi- tion and employment intensity of growth and patterns of distribution. Such an estimate would require a macroeco- nomic model or framework to identify how much poverty reduction can occur with a given level of investment. So far only a limited number of coun- tries in the Asia-Pacific region have completed detailed assessments. Bhu- tan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan and Tajikistan have carried out complete NAs. In addition there have been as- sessments in Bangladesh and Cambo- dia by the United Nations Millennium Project. A summary of the results in some countries is shown in Table 2-3. As indicated in Table 2-3, the costs per capita per year can vary considerably, from a low of $45 for Nepal to $321 for Mongolia. Note, however, that this table can only give a general impression. Per capita costs are not directly comparable across countries as there are national differences in coverage, definition, and the base year for constant price refer- ence. Moreover, the costing in Nepal does not cover as many areas as in other countries, so its figures appear exceptionally low. Although the per capita cost numbers differ, it is clear that the education, health, agriculture, and road and energy sectors comprise almost four-fifths of the MDG investment requirements. In some countries, education and health alone comprise nearly three-fifths. 2.

Some could be called growth gaps, or strategy gaps, or policy gaps, but all are interrelated (Figure 2- 4). Filling them will require renewed determination, imagination and finance. It will also depend on greater regional cooperation, which is the subject of the final chapter. Policy gaps \u2013 Governments do not follow pro-MDG policies \u2013 Policies focus only on economic growth rather than on areas that help achieve the MDGs. Strategy gaps \u2013 There is a missing link between national development strate- gies and the MDGs. Countries lack na- tional MDG road maps and fail to budget for the costs of achieving the MDGs. Growth gaps \u2013 Countries have to in- crease current growth rates for achiev- ing MDGs. Countries cannot achieve the MDGs through growth alone. They may be able to use growth to meet targets for income poverty, but meeting the other targets in this way would require unfeasible rates of growth. MDG gaps \u2013 Estimated gaps in MDGs if the current growth rate in the coun- tries continue. 57 E arlier chapters have exposed a series of MDG gaps \u2013 in policy, strategy, implementation and resources. All of these need to be filled, and since they are interlinked they should be tack- led in an integrated fashion. The pri- mary responsibility for doing so lies with national governments which will prepare the necessary \u2018road maps\u2019. But they should also be able to seek the support of international organizations active in the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 the agencies and funds of the United Nations, the regional development banks and the bi- lateral donors. In strengthening national actions, the in- ternational community can offer support at two levels. First, it can provide indi- vidual, country-level assistance for im- plementing road maps at the national level. Second, it can work with many countries simultaneously, following a re- gional road map to encourage the ex- change of specialized expertise and ex- perience, address resource gaps, tackle cross-border issues, undertake com- parative reviews and monitor achieve- ments. Since this approach involves a number of different institutions, it is vital that they work in unison, transforming devel- opment assistance into a coordinated and inclusive regional programme capa- ble of adding value to national endeav- ours. ESCAP, UNDP and ADB are al- ready working together and are being joined by other United Nations agen- cies. These efforts will be redoubled and institutionalized through various channels, particularly the Regional Coor- dination Mechanism. This chapter considers how they can maximize their joint impact by following a regional road map. In 2006, member countries of ESCAP expressed the wish for such a document (ESCAP, 2006), and an outline was presented in May 2007 to the sixty-third session of the Commission where it received wide- spread endorsement. The first stage will involve coordinating the activities of ESCAP, UNDP, ADB and the United Na- tions agencies in general. The second stage will bring in subregional organiza- tions such as ASEAN, SAARC, ECO and FORSEC. 3. Following a regional road map and delivering as one Countries will be unable to achieve the MDGs through growth alone, they will also need to provide good quality services and address various forms of social exclusion. However, they need not act in isolation. They can also join forces with international organizations in regional partnerships \u2013 to share knowledge, build capacity, mobilize financial resources and monitor progress. 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "caf2f4bf-cee8-4898-bcd1-23a0be7704ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "caf2f4bf-cee8-4898-bcd1-23a0be7704ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3447748050783775dee1551df17e39f2f3e246add893baa94b97ac04c6dfe26"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a939059-49af-46ca-b2ed-0d1f6ee76910", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84b0520dcd9e9115015510dbd5582119931d45581919d243409c217ca17b2852"}}, "hash": "815643078b0fec88b2192198af737e800d8200c1ffdac71f206445f2477625a4", "text": "3.

The components are: knowl- edge and capacity-building, expertise, advocacy, regional public goods and resources. All should add value to na- tional strategies and should be devel- oped in consultation with national stakeholders, including government departments, the private sector, non- governmental and community-based organizations, the media and academia.

They can, for example, assess progress using data from various international organiza- tions, with a particular emphasis on gender-disaggregated data. They can also estimate the resource requirements \u2013 human, institutional and financial. In addition, the partners can use this infor- mation to identify opportunities for re- gional and subregional cooperation, and areas and sectors for public-private-do- nor investments and interventions. This should ensure that policy makers, ex- perts and professionals are well in- formed and better able to use public and private resources, including devel- opment assistance. The end result could be a regional MDG knowledge hub under which a range of activities could be conducted: \u2022 Monitoring progress \u2013 Identifying acheivements and obstacles and suggesting policy options and pro- grammes that can contribute to the achievement of targets \u2022 Reviewing national plans \u2013 Identify- ing best practices and areas of common concern. \u2022 Assessing gaps \u2013 Periodically analyzing fiscal, monetary and exter- nal-sector regimes for policy gaps, including resource gaps which have implications for achieving MDGs \u2022 Costing \u2013 Macro modelling and MDG costing exercises. While these activities are likely to be undertaken by different agencies, their coordination through a regional mecha- nism could enable governments to lo- cate the agencies in one place to which they could direct requests pertaining to their specific countries or issues. Expertise Each country has its own body of exper- tise, but many could benefit from assist- ance in specific areas especially in com- plex programmes and projects funded through development assistance. For this, they should also be able to take advantage of advisory services at various stages \u2013 from formulation and implemen- tation to monitoring and evaluation. These services would allow local and external experts to work together and help ensure better project outcomes. This would cover, for example, advice on projects involving water and sanita- tion, transport and communications, tackling HIV/AIDS, delivering child-health services, building microcredit institu- tions, developing new services in the financial system for small and medium- sized enterprises, improving trade intelli- gence and facilitation, disaggregating statistics and implementing gender strategies. Each of the participating partners has relevant expertise. ADB, for example, has direct experience in funding many types of project in infrastructure, environ- ment, regional cooperation and other areas of development and ESCAP and UNDP have substantial know-how in ad- dressing a range of sector-level issues, including pro-poor public-private partner- ships, cross-border infrastructure and the promotion of regional integration.

The advisers could also help build national capacity and dis- seminate up-to-date knowledge and in- formation through research studies and papers as well as by participating in national, regional and international meetings. A regional advisory service mechanism would need to be anchored in the re- gional partnership. ESCAP, UNDP and ADB have already established a Re- gional MDG Resource Facility which in- cludes knowledge sharing, coordination and joint planning. A mechanism could form an integral part of this and be coordinated through professional facilitators. Advisory services could be provided on-line \u2013 with a database of all available expert services. The initial list of experts would be provided by the regional partners, supplemented with suggestions from other organizations and agencies. Member countries could submit advisory requests through an in- teractive discussion forum. Advocacy Achieving the MDGs will require the combined participation of many institu- tions. With so many people involved, there is always the danger that the process will become fragmented and lose momentum. To help maintain com- mitment, the partnership will therefore have a strong advocacy component. For example, to strengthen regional and subregional cooperation, it would be useful to convene a series of regional and subregional MDG forums. These could act as platforms for reviewing MDG achievements and the implemen- tation of the regional road map, while exchanging information and expertise and disseminating the findings of ana- lytical reports. Just as important, such forums would create opportunities for different kinds of networking, allowing governments, in- ternational organizations, NGOs and representatives of community organiza- tions to form new alliances and work together more effectively. MDG parliamentary forums Achieving the MDGs requires strong po- litical will, so it is vital to ensure the participation of parliamentarians and other elected representatives. At present, however, many have incom- plete knowledge about the MDGs. To address this issue a meeting of parlia- mentarians was held in November 2007 to brainstorm on parliamentary advo- cacy for the MDGs. Five further the- matic forums will be held in 2008 at regional and subregional levels under the United Nations Millennium Cam- paign. These will address the following themes: poverty reduction and hunger, gender, education, health and environ- mental sustainability. These forums will involve people who are directly en- gaged in policy, budget and legislative processes for achieving specific MDG targets and indicators and will afford parliamentarians opportunities to meet with other stakeholders, including local authorities, private-sector representa- tives, civil-society actors, academics and the media. When their output has been consolidated, these forums could feed into the preparation of a compre- hensive policy advocacy tool for parlia- mentarians. The end result should be better \u2018MDG governance\u2019 \u2013 with the necessary sys- tems of oversight, representation and accountability and appropriate budgets. With access to training and orientation programmes, parliamentarians, both men and women, should be better able to formulate the necessary legislation and policy in compliance with interna- tional treaties. There should also be opportunities to involve parliamentarians from donor countries \u2013 who could visit \u2018off-track\u2019 countries to see the potential impact of official development assistance and help mobilize additional financial re- sources. 61 Regional public goods While most public goods are nationally based, a number have a strong interna- tional element and can be strengthened by regional cooperation. They include infrastructure such as energy security networks, cross-border transport net- works, transit facilities for landlocked countries, and water transport between island developing countries. Countries also need to cooperate on cross-border environmental problems, including haze and forest fires, and health hazards such as communicable diseases. Neighbour- ing countries can also work together on the prevention, early warning and management of natural disasters (Box 3- 1). A regional partnership can play a supportive role in all these issues, for example in formulating agreements and treaties on cross-border issues, and promoting cross-country campaigns such as those for green growth. Disasters can wipe out decades of development and hamper progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.

Following a regional road map and delivering as one A Future Within Reach 2008 62 Resources With very small tax bases and low rates of savings, many of the least developed countries lack the resources to fund MDG-related programmes. They are therefore likely to remain dependent on external aid for the foreseeable future, looking primarily to the developed coun- tries and multilateral institutions. The proposed regional MDG forums might incorporate regional donor forums to exchange information and data. To maximize the impact of external re- sources on achieving the MDGs, donors will need to pay greater attention to local conditions. The countries and the donors have to work together to create increased capacity for absorbing re- sources for using in the MDG areas. At the same time, both donors and recipi- ents need to channel new resources to support policies that reduce non-income poverty \u2013 particularly in least developed countries, landlocked developing coun- tries and small island developing states. This regional partnership can also be a powerful instrument for gaining addi- tional resources from the private sector. This could, for example, involve more co-financing between ADB and the pri- vate sector for infrastructure projects, such as rural roads and urban water and sanitation projects. For their parts, the receiving countries need to have a sense of \u2018ownership\u2019 of donor-supported programmes and en- sure accountability and transparency in using external resources for the stated purposes. They also have to develop the necessary skills and capacity, so that their national and local institutions fit the needs and aspirations of their citizens and they can better fulfil their commitments to the Millennium Declara- tion. Beyond development assistance, the developing countries should also be able to benefit from increased trade, investment and other financial flows, while also exploring the opportunities for South-South cooperation. The partner- ship should therefore also be aiming to ensure easier market access for goods from the LDCs especially agricultural ex- ports. For the longer term, governments will be looking to macroeconomic and sectoral strategies and policies to pro- mote pro-MDG growth. But in some areas, these policies may be comple- mented by interventions in critical and urgent areas where small financial out- lays can yield big results. One example would be combatting vector-borne dis- eases by developing the necessary in- frastructure and buildings \u2013 interventions that can provide immediate assistance to people in greatest need, while also establishing a sound basis for longer term programmes. Other areas where such interventions may be needed could include climate change actions, food security, water security and energy security. Many of these are strategies to the achievement of MDGs but could have cross border implications. These initiatives will depend on the availability of resources, both internal and external. One significant recent step in this direction has been the creation of the UNDP-Spanish Millennium Devel- opment Goal Achievement Fund (MDG- F) which helps countries to undertake national level activities in key MDG ar- eas. Seven ESCAP countries are eligible to apply \u2013 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Philippines, Timor- Leste, and Viet Nam. But given the scale of the needs and the required resources the countries of the region will need further innovation to be able to finance need-based initiatives that take into account the characteristics of different subregions and add value to country-level efforts. The partnership will work with govern- ments in consultation with civil society and community groups that can help identify beneficiaries and monitor the transfer of benefits.

Priority would be given to LDC, LLDC and SIDS \u2018off-track\u2019 countries and to those critical MDGs in which the region or sub-regions appear to be faltering. Thus, in South Asia, one of the priorities would be child malnutrition, while in the Pacific, it might be youth unemployment or non-communicable diseases. But whatever the issue, the initiative would be looking for ways to promote wom- en\u2019s empowerment and gender equality. Value-added initiatives at subregional level, as far as possible, need to take advantage of specialized funds and programmes of the United Nations. WHO, for instance, would be a partner for health activities, UNIFEM in the area of empowerment and gender equality. UNESCO for education, UNICEF in projects relating to child and maternal heath, ILO on the provision of \u2018decent work\u2019 and UNEP for environmental pro- grammes. These goal-specific interventions can help develop models of partnerships for MDG projects that can be up-scaled by member countries, while also encourag- ing public sector agencies to work with the private sector, establishing the basis for larger public-private partnerships. Delivering as one Across the Asia-Pacific region, the United Nations and other organizations need to work more closely together. When offering resources and expertise in support of national efforts to achieve the MDGs, they should aim to \u2018deliver as one\u2019. This not only simplifies the task of overstretched national administrators it also avoids overlap and makes inter- national support more coherent and ef- fective. To cooperate in this way, and to monitor progress and policies, organizations can take advantage of two existing mechanisms. The first is the United Nations Regional Coordination Mecha- nism (RCM). The RCM enables United Nations organizations to reach a con- sensus and identify opportunities for regional intergovernmental cooperation \u2013 and explore ways in which the United Nations system can support this proc- ess, taking into account the links be- tween national and regional actions and the interactions between humanitarian, security and development issues. For this purpose, the RCM also has The- matic Working Groups which can exam- ine the implications for the MDGs on key regional issues. A second cooperation mechanism is the ESCAP Commission. This intergovern- mental forum is a place where member countries and international agencies can come together to compare experiences and engage in policy dialogue on the MDGs. The Commission can also be used by United Nations family to show- case MDG achievements. This type of coordinated approach be- comes ever more urgent as the coun- tries of the region approach the target year of 2015. The Asia-Pacific region still has a lengthy and urgent MDG agenda, and time is running out. 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d512955-54d4-4be0-87b5-06772d580ab8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d512955-54d4-4be0-87b5-06772d580ab8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific MDG Report 2008", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ffb929c0991fe6b837e272518445b8b2e6539be0bd7a8b1ff960ec72d352beb"}, "2": {"node_id": "19118ea7-dab8-4a86-8f02-c23bf06805f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-mdg-report-2008", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe3fe48e5f489ae552c5db0df968d675aa1842bd66091aabfb4ac0f2275194b3"}}, "hash": "4709096e612967d8f8feadd5159752ea2b9408b5381e5352f40ffba019bc519b", "text": "3.

PLDC,t is the population in LDCs at time t. Step II Second, total MDG related actual expenditure in the immediate past (2005) for the LDCs is assumed to reflect total resources available for achieving MDGs in this group of countries in the region. Accordingly, the total MDG related expenditure is calculated according to the following formula: Total annual MDG related expenditure = Where Xi is the sum of MDG related expenditure in country i (i = 1\u2026.N). PLDC is the population in all LDCs in the region whereas Ps is the population in the sample countries for which related expenditure is available. Step III The MDG resource Gap is then defined as: MDG Resource Gap = IMDG \u2013 EMDG Data In the calculation of IMDG, the following data is used. n = 6 (to represent 6 countries namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Mon- golia, Nepal and Tajikistan in the sample for which MDG costing data is available). T = 2 (t = 1 to represent period 1 (2005) t = 2 to represent period 2 (2015) Annex 4 \u2013 Methodology to estimate MDG resource gap \u2211 \u2211 = = = n i PC i t MDG T t LDC t MDG I P I nT 1 ), , ( 1 , 1 \u2211 = = N i i S LDC MDG X P P E 1 Annex 4 \u2013 Methodology to estimate MDG resource gap A Future Within Reach 2008 74 In the calculation of EMDG, the following information is used N = 7 (to represent Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Vanuatu for which data on MDG related expenditure are available).

For those countries which did not have data for 2005, the latest data were used to estimate data for 2005 using nominal GDP growth with the assumption that MDG related expenditure would grow each year at the same rate as nominal GDP. 75 ADB (2007).

Working with stakeholders in the region to guide the direc- tions of the Asia-Pacific Human Development Reports is critical. It helps in shaping and prioritising issues, builds ca- pacity, provides an experience-sharing platform, helps dissemination and promotes buy-in. The AP-HDNet is therefore an integral part of the process leading to the preparation of the Asia-Pacific Human Development Reports (APHDRs), and it helps to disseminate the findings of the APHDRs. The Asia-Pacific Human Development Report The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Report (APHDR) is one of UNDP\u2019s flagship products. The Human Development Report Unit (HDRU) at the Regional Centre for Asia Pacific, Colombo Office coordinates the work of this initiative for the Asia-Pacific region. The APHDRs that have been published and disseminated so far are: \ufffd Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development in Asia and the Pacific. \ufffd Trade on Human Terms: Transforming Trade for Human Development in Asia and the Pacific (Winner of the 2007 Human Development Award for Excellence and Innovation). \ufffd Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia: Realizing the Millennium Development Goals. \ufffd HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2eb1a5f-6769-4e76-bd72-5decec702e0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2eb1a5f-6769-4e76-bd72-5decec702e0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4df92611593b63065e4949a24c1ed48d2e599505b7d64dc49b66607406706ef3"}, "2": {"node_id": "bcd287e5-3c58-4aae-a4ae-ee53577695b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3b6aed8b8a1260a44f12796d07a86d1503552501c66ef60246c8f2d30d252ba"}}, "hash": "77d3e57c6f9f912d8dc3634e808482f49b3fc4c322ec8828ad55145174db22d3", "text": "\ufffd HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia. The APHDR is considered a regional public good primarily because it serves as an important policy advocacy resource as well as a valuable instrument for stakeholders, enabling them to influence policies across countries in the region. Any theme for an APHDR must be based on a critical long term development concern and pass at least one of the three regional tests: \ufffd It must be of concern to several countries in the region. \ufffd It must have sensitivities that are better addressed at a regional level. \ufffd It must have clear cross-border dimensions. There is a rigorous process of participatory consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, starting from theme selec- tion to the advocacy of the report. This process hones the focus of the report through research, discussion and feedback using the AP-HD Network, developing the main messages, report preparation, launch and advocacy. Thus, by the very nature of its mandate, the HDRU works with a wide range of stakeholders who guide the direction of Asia-Pacific Human Development Reports.

Stakeholders include governments, civil society organizations, media, topical experts, academia, research institutions, UNDP country offices, United Na- tions agencies as well as a range of other interested parties. The Asia-Pacific Human Development Network In 2007 the AP-HDNet e-discussion on corruption covered seven themes. After the release of the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives members of the network debated ways and means of implementing the Seven-Point Agenda mentioned in the report. The forthcoming APHDR on gender is on the theme of \u2018Gender \u2013 Unequal Power, Unequal Voice\u2019. Unequal power is seen as fundamental to differences in opportunities between individuals. Under this overall framework and guided by regional priorities, it is important to focus on areas that are strategic for bringing about transformation \u2013 at both the individual and the aggregate levels - and that have concrete potential for policy. Stakeholders from across the region suggested that, within this overarching framework, the report should focus on politico-legal equality and economic equality. The strategic focus on equality in these two areas is seen as essential to catalysing transformation in gender relations, both in the personal and public spheres, while yielding clear policy guidance. Gender based violence, culture and identities (masculinity and femininity) cut across both of these sub-themes. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 1 TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Stakeholders across the region discussed issues around specific themes (economic equity, politico-legal equity, educa- tion, gender identities, gender mainstreaming, and folklore and historical stories) for a few months (September 2008- April 2009).

They greatly benefit the preparations for the upcoming Asia- Pacific Human Development Report on Gender with the overall theme of addressing Unequal Power, Unequal Voice. We are pleased to provide a synthesis of the discussion, first with a quantitative view of postings that members made to the sub-themes and cross-cutting issues: Almost 50 percent of postings were on the two main sub-themes which focussed on the areas considered strategic for bringing about transformation. These were Politico-Legal Equity and Economic Equity. The remainder of postings were focused on cross-cutting issues such as Education, Identities, Mainstreaming, and Folkloric Dimensions. The discussion commenced with postings on Economic Equity. The overriding consensus among members was that gender and economic equality is a critical component of human development and poverty reduction, and that its success depends primarily on promoting women\u2019s economic security. Members questioned the key barriers to Economic Equity, emphasising the particular importance of asset ownership and control of resources that help women cope with social and economic crises when they are especially vulnerable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eab2c5c1-e40f-4f0c-b651-6964a7128f9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eab2c5c1-e40f-4f0c-b651-6964a7128f9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e3eb67ce18b58da754c91b8ab9bd00f5ae2847e52dc9ebfd3269f78feedc0d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd746a33-9d40-498b-a1f1-2510222c7a8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6cf4c56e35a21f1ffc74c721d2d160bbeb7c17ff0d4742f6a21dafae38e4c41"}}, "hash": "cb3cda03c44f980f908a6401f0fc710852983e073e4be096539e277099c025ed", "text": "The key challenges that persist are primarily about women acquiring decision-making powers, which in the context of this discussion, concerns who actually gets to use land and property even when women \u2018own\u2019 these assets.

Asia Pacific Human Development Network 4 TABLE OF CONTENTS Synthesis of Discussion The discussion on the second of the two key sub-themes, Politico-Legal Equity, generated widespread interest and regional representation,. Countries that participated included Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Republic of Korea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. Contributors identified positive developments such as electoral reform initiatives and women\u2019s participation in coun- tries such as the Philippines, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Republic of Korea, and Malaysia. With regard to workplace reforms, there have been constructive developments in enacting and enforcing sexual harassment laws in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India. In the wider region, in the area of gender equity laws, members noted some action on operation- alisation, including national women\u2019s policies/action plans. However, implementation requires more active and com- mitted political will. Despite gains, there are persistent politico-legal equity issues. The salient point is that Asian-Pacific women do not actively engage at the national level in political and other public events to the extent that women do in other regions. De- spite the fact that some Asian-Pacific women do occupy high political offices, such representation does not imply \u201ctrue\u201d gender equality because they are still often denied an effective voice. Although the picture of participation is better at a local level, this does not extend to important decision-making. Additionally despite possessing good school attainment levels, this does not extend to the power to engage in public life. Politico-legal issues vary across countries. These include the struggle to transform traditional subordinate roles, cultural codes that dissuade most women from political participation, decision-making power that belongs to male-dominated political groupings, and CEDAW (Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women) compli- ance thwarted by de jure and de facto divergences. In the workplace, a primary factor for women\u2019s under-representation can be attributed to legal protectionism. The emphasis on women's reproductive functions undermines not only women\u2019s but also men\u2019s capabilities and economic strivings, and thus the well-being of all, regardless of gender. Members recommended the following crucial interventions: \ufffd Operationalise existing conventions and legislation using CEDAW as a framework. \ufffd Monitor conventions and optional protocols to ascertain whether women\u2019s rights under CEDAW hold up for other inextricable rights, and regarding negotiation between rights of different marginalised groups. \ufffd Use quotas or alternative tools to promote gender empowerment \ufffd Protect migrant women by developing a comprehensive national policy. \ufffd Promote capacity development, including at the family level, for acceptance of women\u2019s engagement in public life, so that grassroots women\u2019s and men's voices are recognized in policy making processes. With reference to the discussion on cross-cutting issues, firstly on Gender and Education Equity, key research implica- tions emerged. This involves the underlying reality that education is fundamental in shaping people\u2019s abilities to avail fully of opportunities. The technological and inter-generational impacts of education are equally important. In order to facilitate gender equality, education enables people to be active agents in the evolving social resources that humans assemble over time- hence the importance of qualitative aspects of education. Barriers to educational quality include school subjects that are too often designed, organised and examined in stereotypical and constraining ways. Further, whilst education can be instrumental in reducing violence against women and girls, this too requires qualitative shifts. Changes are needed in the kinds of text used regarding language/stereotypes. Further interventions are needed in staffing ratios, policy objectives, teacher training/pedagogy, etc. In many parts of the region, although there has been a perceptible improvement in girls\u2019 school achievements, this has not been accompanied by an improvement in social-economic gender disparities. In South Asia, members noted that a key problem was school access and attainment, with implications that girls\u2019 education is valued less than boys\u2019 educa- tion. Cultural infrastructure, including schools, renew and reinforce this problem. Ultimately, this adversely affects both women and men. Regarding strategic interventions, once again members stressed the need for a set of initiatives rather than a single one, and not just in formal education.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec75ea9c-9ae5-41af-b7b0-c700c3a7a065": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec75ea9c-9ae5-41af-b7b0-c700c3a7a065", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbf0dab9f40faf9d3e47f7ab992cfe737713423d5f140d474e74975b7c278328"}, "2": {"node_id": "087a277f-0db7-47f0-ab5b-8d266ffb88da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b2c4c84b64057277a954bcb486affca6631af0a7bb13d4a4b0f7cab0bcce231"}}, "hash": "f1149852059b3807e45d4f107dd99474888c536b9d0bbc3e9465729e082d602a", "text": "This is because the social background encompasses an unconscious education that shapes what societies expect of individuals, and that also transfers disorientations like gender inequality.

The dis- course represents a historical systemic shift from a focus on singular tools to alter discriminatory practices. Although this approach is good, a principal drawback in the systemic approach is its open-endedness. This makes mainstreaming a double-edged sword that acts against institutionalisation by promoting a wide variety of local beliefs and norms. Additionally, the idea of institutionalising gender implies unwanted links with neoclassical economics as the prevailing institutional paradigm. Special efforts are required to understand the context and power structures. A primary challenge remains the ability to respond to the wide spectrum of sites where power, riches, knowledge, capabilities and rights converge. This requires the fullest possible comprehension and responsibility grasped by a broad range of duty-bearers. Ultimately, members questioned whether institutionalisation is an apt endeavour given that gender inequity issues are sector-specific. They also highlighted the fragmented nature of policy-making institutions that hierarchical structures and politics conserve in patriarchal societies. With reference to practice or implementation, contributors noted that gender equality will not flourish if reduced to singular \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 plans, such as establishing a national entity for women\u2019s issues (especially at the cost of dis- solving gender units within ministries and agencies). Similarly, isolated initiatives such as a stand-alone gender policy, or gender awareness workshops, or a gender staffing ratio plan will not suffice. The end goal is to transform the insti- tutional environment through strategies and tactics that are built into all levels of policies and programmes from the outset at every point. Women\u2019s participation is essential at every step of the process. The starting point is gender analysis to provide an assessment of the differences in how women and men are expected to experience a particular project, programme, policy or law. This can be followed up by components such as a \u201cConcept Note\u201d that captures the assess- ment of stakeholders\u2019 gender sensitivity. What is essential is that such initiatives need to be followed-up by a time- and duty-bound action plan. For implementation, coordination, and ensuring policy-makers incorporate gender issues into national plans, CEDAW and associated legal mandates, including constitutional authority, are essential tools. A further effective entry point is quotas for mobilising greater political participation by women. On gender responsive budgeting, UNIFEM (United Nations Development Fund for Women) has achieved notable suc- cess through initiatives to track whether the money follows policies. In India, there have been successful initiatives to transform an economic system that undervalues \u2018feminised\u2019 activities. In the state of Kerala, decentralised gender budgeting has been effective. The discussion on Gender Identities emphasized the earlier earmarked links between education and the construction of gender identities. Members noted that formal education processes continue to reinforce the inequitable ways through which power operates. To a large extent this shapes who is included and excluded. Contributors urged an education policy to reflect data that illustrate the negative impact from co-education on girls\u2019 adequate access to the processes of learning, identity and sexuality, and on making satisfactory use of opportunities (getting jobs and pursuing livelihood options). Members noted how patriarchal social systems, as the object of transformation, bring women\u2019s movements and LGB- TIQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex Questioning) movements close together in the goal to expand choic- es and freedoms. These groups cohere through recognition that patriarchal systems socialise people in ways that are equally harmful to men and women, sometimes in official ways, and unintentionally at other times. The social impact of this is visible in risk-taking behaviours related to men\u2019s health. Impacts also materialise in education and livelihoods, where there is evidence that norms of masculinity restrict men\u2019s choices and freedom to act or belong. Economic and political empowerment for LGBTIQ groups has latent potential: there is the likelihood that governments and societies will make policy changes; however, a combination of measures is required to ensure this will happen. Moreover, it is important not to rely solely on law reform to overcome societies' fears of non-heteronormative persons. Socialisation initiatives are a crucial part of the programme mix. Members emphasized that advocacy and lobbying are likely to be more effective when mainstream movements and media join efforts simultaneously. Cases involving LGBT groups in Nepal and India were highlighted. They are working to gain economic and political power through initiatives that encompass law reform blended with practical action across the three social sectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d802686e-4ad5-440c-9c4c-a6cc93da3167": {"__data__": {"id_": "d802686e-4ad5-440c-9c4c-a6cc93da3167", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d137f4ff95d834dd855e2f9dc169c99fe695377fe334c1830dadb14bfa054ab1"}, "2": {"node_id": "86a1dcab-26a7-4ea0-a232-081b559f60a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2098d597dec1d68c04027c54ab14837077e8378ec9566b576e9f30f7b5e1e0c"}}, "hash": "a075520fe6563b8277e17e44337cec9c50ea4b2cfe999e923b63ece0f0e7101b", "text": "On the definition of \u2018gender\u2019, members pointed out that identity issues persist in India due to people\u2019s failure to grasp that \u2018gender\u2019 has different aspects: assignment, role, attribution, and identity.

There is a pressing need for these policy makers to move ahead and upgrade to the new thinking in social science and activism in developing more precise analytical terms, categories, and methods. This is essential for reasons that include measurement issues. Currently, many individuals are not counted if they are not free to proclaim their identity. A positive development is the fact that people are opening up gender spaces. Indian passport forms now include a third gender category. Additionally, there is a national transgender welfare board, and Tamil Nadu has established a third gender category for student admissions. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS Synthesis of Discussion However, the opening up of gender spaces can have mixed consequences. Thus, additional interventions are required to address stigma, discrimination and violence, both official and non-official. Specific interventions need to target workplace discrimination, as two studies from Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Indonesia show. They highlight how the market reinforces or even prescribes institutionalised and unspoken expectations that shut down choices and place boundaries around women\u2019s social mobility. This is due to the market\u2019s adherence as to how daughters or wives should behave as commercial actors. The roles that the market dictates for women in terms of behavioural expectations conflicts with what women choose or aspire to. Specific interventions are needed to transform the socialization/ideology that currently strips women and men of identity as \u2018respectable\u2019 bread-winners if they choose to work in certain spheres or sectors. While women face one set of constraints, the construction of masculinity generates other issues. Evidence from Indone- sia indicates that social values play a large role in shaping choices and in how power operates and shapes social inclu- sion. In populations of migrant men, researchers have found direct links between the strategies and values of belonging and the shared emotional experience of migration. An evidence-based social inclusion policy needs to factor in data that comes from not only local inter-personal networks, but also from beyond the local; it is increasingly important to collect and analyse evidence from a wider range of networks. In the final sub-theme discussion on Folklore and Historical Stories, members reflected on the importance of exploring modern ideas of gender through the lens of folk narratives. They raised questions concerning the universal enjoyment of folk tales, whether women are the main singers of tales, and the implications for equity and equality given that the gender discourse is a relatively recent phenomenon, at least in Asia-Pacific countries. In response to these questions, members noted that folklore remains relatively free of the ideological constraints that the predominant social environment dictates. Folk narratives tend to demonstrate popular imagination, in essence implying that they remain outside any official intellectual tradition with its associated disciplines and options. This introduces the likelihood of new forms of dissent against oppressive norms, and folk narratives transfer a potential to shift social thinking. Illustrating some of these questions was the story of Vihara Maha Devi, a woman who, for a time, before norms rel- egated her again to invisibility, played an unconventional, prominent role as a warrior in a Buddhist classic saga of war and peace. Also shared was an account of three stateswomen and commanders-in-chief (Razia Sultana, Rani of Jhansi, and Chand Bibi) who tackled formidable challenges not typically attributed to women in the history of South Asia. We read a story of a woman who spoke truth to power that caused the overthrow of an ancient despot in Afghanistan. A Cambodian folktale was also presented which featured a female protagonist, rare for this genre. Her good choices, by drawing on her capabilities for innovation, grace, perseverance, and loyalty, proved highly effective in transforming narcissism and duplicity. Folkloric songs often provide the core of silenced histories. They are not simply imaginative, but link with actual events. A prominent example is the account of Aisha, and her role during the early years of Islam as the young wife of Prophet Muhammad. Another story relates to that of Mahaprajapathi Gothami, who fought for the rights of women to be ordained in the Buddhist way of life, and against the idea that women\u2019s participation would have a negative impact on the institution of families.

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS Synthesis of Discussion Two legends from Malaysia were shared. They paint a picture that reinforces cultural or moral values: women\u2019s power is controlled by dominant males. Curiously, these legends are at odds with reality. This reflects the anxiety of power elites over the sharing of power, since women in Sarawak and Kedah are customarily strong and respected for their social contributions. Members also read a contemporary poem about historically remarkable women. Siv Cedering\u2019s poem is about the for- gotten, uncelebrated accomplishments of numerous female philosophers and scientists. In this genre members also read about Mirabai, a 16thcentury woman, who in a tradition of seer-poets, fully possesses the right to choose her own path, and finds liberation in nonviolent resistance. As a woman whose life and work resonates with contemporary Indians and European audiences, she is considered to be one of the early Indian feminists, even though she did not visualise herself as one. This wraps up the synthesis of the discussion on Gender: Addressing Unequal Power, Unequal Voice. Thank you again for engaging with these themes and cross-cutting issues. We hope you found the forum thought-provoking and useful in your respective work. All the best, Jim Chalmers AP-HDNet Facilitator Asia Pacific Human Development Network 8 TABLE OF CONTENTS Synthesis of Discussion Opening Messages 1 Elena Borsatti wrote: Dear Network Members, This is the opening message of the e-discussion for the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Human Development Report. The theme of the Report is Gender: Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice. Unequal power is seen as fundamental to differences in opportunities between women, men and people with other gender identities and sexual orientations. Under this overall framework and guided by regional priorities, the report will focus on areas that: \ufffd Are strategic in bringing about transformation \u2013 both at the individual and at the aggregate level. \ufffd Have concrete potential for policy. Politico-legal equity and economic equity have emerged as the two main sub-themes selected by stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific to focus on, with gender-based violence, culture and identities (masculinity and femininity) as cross-cutting issues. The discussion will run for about sixteen weeks. The first three weeks will focus on economic equity. Economic power can transform gender relations and facilitate political and legal empowerment as well. Promoting women\u2019s economic security is an integral part of reducing poverty and fostering sustainable development - under normal conditions, of course, and even more so in situations of crises. Overall economic growth and higher per capita incomes are important, but may not be sufficient to eliminate gender- based inequalities. As Asia-Pacific is one of the world's most dynamic regions economically, three critical questions come to mind: \ufffd What are some of the key barriers to greater gender economic equity at the individual and macro levels? \ufffd What are some of the concrete examples of successes and what are their limitations? \ufffd What are the recommended concrete policies to better address gender-based economic inequalities? Some of the areas that could be considered are: Gender-based asset ownership and control: Inequalities in ownership of economic assets such as land and other prop- erty tend to marginalise women. Even with equal property and inheritance rights, there are circumstances when 'custom' induces females to surrender these rights to male relatives. What are some of the key barriers to greater gender equity at both the individual and macro levels? What are some of the concrete examples of successes? What can be some of the solid policies to better address gender-based inequalities in asset ownership and control?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9ad80f5-191a-4c59-8739-443eee0f3cfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9ad80f5-191a-4c59-8739-443eee0f3cfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bb143acd6f898e3127b763846f1e1db57f10d767adea283a8f9abe226ef84e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "b330ede7-7f18-4152-9b4a-0002d2d4f67e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5986782f788a40bc4732af8c13e2dcdea2afbca978d1fcea663da20cf545a58b"}}, "hash": "3291f78f47ea9d1cd4eb03f173250a247f18eb58c0b3110abe4612296b03e9e4", "text": "Gender, labour markets and earnings: Gender inequality in the labour market is manifested by occupational segrega- tion/choice, wage gaps, women's disproportionate representation in informal employment, low paid and unpaid work, and higher unemployment rates.

What are the steps taken to reduce gender-based wage gaps? Are there suc- cess stories in the region where micro-finance has expanded the choices available to women? Have women been able to scale up their economic activities, bridging the earning gap between males and females? Gender, mobility and migration: In this progressively globalized region, women are increasingly migrating on their own, and are often the principal wage earners who remit money to their families in their countries of origin. Whilst mobility and migration provide the potential for new earning opportunities, new ideas and experiences, there is also the flip side. Often the jobs that most women find in the host countries are traditional female occupations (e.g. domestic la- bour or other lower end services) thus perpetuating the gendered division of labour. Trafficking and sexual exploitation is also prevalent. Gender inequality in the country of origin is one of the biggest motivating factors that urges women to migrate, and often when they reach their host country, they are faced with the double burden of being female and a migrant. This burden increases with regard to language and cultural barriers. What are the examples of facilitating safe migration like pre-departure training, safe money transfer, legal advice, etc.? We look forward to receiving your contributions which could also include historical/cultural and key studies, as well as success stories. We would be grateful if you could indicate your designation and affiliation in your message. We thank you in advance and we look forward to a lively debate! Asia Pacific Human Development Network 10 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity With best regards, Elena Borsatti (On Behalf of the HDRU Team) UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific Colombo Office Jim Chalmers wrote: Dear Network Members, Gender inequity not only prevails: it is also on the rise. This is evident from the chasm in assets and incomes of women and sexual minorities compared to men, in maternal and girl\u2019s under-nourishment, in female mortality and natality, and many other \u201cgaps\u201d. The impact is felt everywhere, as well as individually, within Asia-Pacific developing countries. Significant variations exist as to how societies represent inequity, through norms, beliefs, organisations, and acts of be- haviour. However, there is a basic kinship in the societal forms that sustain gender systems across different Asia-Pacific societies. Ultimately, experiences of inequity are traceable to institutionalised forms that preside over how power is implanted in the social pecking order. Further, as Amartya Sen tells us, gender inequity damages not only women but also men. This happens through causal links between biological dimensions, such as natal choices and childhood lack of nutritional care. But there are direct links too with norms that shape how we are expected to act. Gender inequity is pre- scriptive. Gita Sen notes that when the sources of inequity are embedded in the social system, the resulting differences are difficult to dislodge. Much remains to be done, but true empowerment must go beyond the surface to encompass substantive issues, voice and power. This discussion is a key part of preparing the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report. Its theme is Gender: Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice. It is a vital Report - extremely necessary for the next steps to transform policy that shapes everyday experiences. It will do this by bringing the human development lens to bear on identified issues, which will be supported by empirical analysis and data. Initial phase of the Discussion: Economic Equity Please post your comments, brief or lengthy, around this first topic. This initial discussion will focus on conceptual issues, gender inequality in ownership of land and other property, and in the labour market; evident in occupational segregation/choice, wage gaps, women's disproportionate representation in informal employment, low paid and unpaid work, and higher unemployment rates. There are also issues of micro-level credit, with its possibilities and shortcomings. Discussion questions: \ufffd What are some of the key barriers to greater gender equity at the individual and macro levels? \ufffd What are the specific factors deriving from gender power relations that drive gender equality, e.g. disparities in health care, social conditioning, damaging norms, etc.? \ufffd Why is gender equality a priority from the human development perspective? Does the human development per- spective provide a better framework for promoting gender equity? Is there a link from gender inequality to human development and back \u2013 that is, could a two-way relationship be posited? \ufffd In what ways is gender equality instrumental to the progress towards MDGs, in particular reduction of poverty?

She investigates the yearning of mothers and daughters for freedom and choice in a caste dominated society, and probes severe restrictions in women's private spheres. On a personal level, women experience inequity through irrational, hostile attitudes and actions that totally disregard their rights. On the collective level, there is a complex combination of unbalanced power situations involving economic and politico-legal regulations and cultural norms. This two-way dynamic enmeshes women and sexual minorities between hostile actions and entrenched power disparities. How women's voices and choices can be enhanced through economic empowerment and equity is a key question. Dear Network Members, Culture, Choice and Gender Equity I would like to reflect on gender equity through voice and choice. There is now a general understanding and agreement that gender equity and gender-equitable social relations could be better promoted through economic empowerment, legal rights and political participation of women. We still need a bet- ter understanding of how these processes really work in particular cases when culture constrains and binds women and when these cultural norms are deeply internalised by the women themselves through everyday patriarchal and social practices that normalise these constraints as the proper way of living and appropriate modes of conduct and action. When women are bearers and transmitters of culture through the domestic sphere, they play a central role in uphold- ing these cultural constraints even though they are restrained by them.

But it is the realm of marriage where choice for both girls and boys is severely constrained while being socialised in a caste society, and which has not received as much attention as it should. While marriage laws in the country may be progressive, social practices and opinion place severe restrictions on wom- en\u2019s private spheres. By and large, inter-caste and inter-religious marriages are discouraged, and those who have as- serted their free choice along these lines recount their experiences of severe friction in and disruption of intra-family relations on account of it. But what is even more alarming is the regularity and frequency of honour-killings in parts of North India that are re- ported in the media, a feature prevalent in neighbouring Pakistan and elsewhere and even found among certain South Asian immigrant communities in Britain. Assertion of free choice in marriage is seen as disruptive of the basic social order of kinship relationship and caste and as an attempt to redefine the prevailing notions of masculinity and femininity, and more importantly, as a threat to the patriarchal family structure. In parts of North India, where honour-killings are prevalent, it is common to note that the father or brother would kill the girl who elopes or enters into a forbidden marriage.This is due to the locally prevalent notion of incest taboo and also on account of caste and sub-caste transgression. More often, these honour-killings are sanctioned by the extra-legal caste panchayats (local level judicial courts) that are still in existence and have not been fully superseded by the legal judicial system. In my study of a village in North India, in a region where there are no honour-killings, I found an overwhelming major- ity of young women in the village aspiring to move out of the village and into urban centres through marriage to men based in urban areas. Many felt that the urban life would free them from the restrictions of village life, notably the veil- ing expected of even Hindu women after marriage in their marital villages. Most mothers also wanted their daughters to have a life free from the drudgery of village life. Many young girls also expressed the view that they were quite open to choosing their spouses on their own, but only so long as the boy was of the permissible caste. Caste socialisation therefore still remains very strong, though mothers and daughters yearn for and are willing to access some spaces and pathways of freedom. But the reproduction of the patriarchal culture in the village remains undisturbed for most young boys of landed households who are most likely to remain in the villages, want their prospective spouses to abide by the norms and traditions of village life, and would prefer their wives to follow the custom of veiling. Whether and how women\u2019s voices and choices can be enhanced through economic empowerment and political participation in such contexts of cultural reproduction requires more thought and debate. U. Kalpagam Professor G. B. Pant Social Science Institute Allahabad Lionel Siriwardena wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Lionel Siriwardena describes the sluggish progress of gender-sensitive national accounts figures. There is too little headway in recognising that these are socially constructed. Taught emphasis on self-interested seek- ing of satisfaction from consuming goods shapes national aggregated estimates in most countries. At the same time, productivity is discounted from another mode of socialization, where accent on care for others is targeted at women. Nor is the economy just about paid work. It is crucial that economic analysis encompass unpaid work, which women in many contexts do proportionally more. The foremost function of fiscal policy is distribution, and this is unlikely to be equitable until gender is accounted for. Dear Network Members, Exclusion of Real Values of Women\u2019s Work: A Major Distortion of Development and Growth Conceptual and methodological issues of analysing the impact of gender equality in economic development and growth are often perceived by most policy makers and development practitioners as a separate subject matter, to be dealt with by a ministry of women\u2019s affairs or a gender study division. Despite the availability of sufficient evidence on gender disparities, policy makers rely exclusively on economic growth-related variables and indicators to design policies and formulate development priorities. This restricted approach, driven only by technical possibilities, not only distorts the E-Discussion:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32fd2d2d-f039-49cc-82fc-4548d4b51728": {"__data__": {"id_": "32fd2d2d-f039-49cc-82fc-4548d4b51728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0afa8dc06cc43b82c1a2fc2987255262b05a68fa0312f013d85366a9dad77c5"}, "3": {"node_id": "255a500e-fcd3-4e2d-8cd5-5344b364f10e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cff92cb173b88b48699992706a033ac7ab4596a2608e07eb033ef0d4288d1d82"}}, "hash": "b731ed95e56f101101b1ccf3b0c81d85b71a7443de3d0eaf73caded1f8d492da", "text": "Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 13 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity reality of development but also undermines the gender dimension of human and social capital formation which contrib- utes significantly to economic growth and development. Distortion of development is a result of inappropriate policy-making that is based on inaccurate national statistics and that omits the real value of labour and output in human and social development in the national accounting system. The revenue structure is over-simplified and presented in isolation of the costs of gender inequality, which hinder develop- ment in terms of more poverty, increased deprivation and chronic failure to satisfy basic needs related to health, nutrition and education. Those cost implications are not properly estimated or accounted for in the national accounting systems. As estimated by UNESCO, the Asia-Pacific region is losing as much as US$ 47 billion of output per year from a lack of female participation in the labour market (UNESCAP 2007) and as much as US$ 30 billion is lost because of gender gaps in education systems (UNFPA 2000). Much of women\u2019s work is unpaid, and even when financial transactions are involved, such contributions are not in- cluded or are discounted in national statistics. A significant contribution, of women\u2019s work - both paid and unpaid - has an economic impact. Yet, their contribution is rarely noticed or fully quantified. In the Asian region, 70 to 90 percent of all farm and marine produce is traded by women. Women in street and market stands, including pavement hawkers and vendors, are in the under-recorded informal economy that generates an estimated 30 percent of urban wealth (UNFPA 2000). Women\u2019s economic contributions are underestimated primarily because they are mostly in the informal sector where the reporting system is rather weak. As a consequence, women are ignored in allocating resources or investment. As the data on the informal economy, diagnosing poverty and macrocosmic policies are rarely gender segregated, the system of national accounts is seriously affected by the statistical invisibility of women. Women\u2019s economic roles are poorly conceptualised due to the fact that inadequate attention is given to the combined value of household production, domes- tic work and unpaid family labour. If properly recognised, the value of women\u2019s unpaid farm labour would exceed the benefits or savings derived through an unequal process of development Although earning activities of family labour are included in the national accounting system, a family unit of produc- tion and reproduction cannot be simply separated on the basis of unpaid care work and paid work, as the care economy directly contributes to labour productivity and enhanced earning capacity of the family labour force. Rural women not only prepare but also grow most of the family food, and it is primarily girls and women who collect water, fuel for cooking and fodder for domestic animals. In addition to the direct contribution to family income, their contributions as efficient managers of the family budget and scarce family resources management experts are not reported. Women are the economically active majority in agriculture, processing and marketing. Yet, they own less that 2 percent of all land and receive only 5 percent of extension services (Bage 2003). The exclusion of women from intra-household resources like land and property limits their power and control over productive utilization of family resources and the emergence of women\u2019s agency.

With regard to economic equity, in my personal view, barriers need to be discussed at individual/household (HH), meso (community-district) and macro level. My contribution is on gender based asset ownership and control, a problem which is more acute in South Asia than South-East Asia. I am not too sure about the situation in East Asia. Barriers \ufffd Meso level: \ufffd Patrilocal system of residence (women shifting to a different residence) in much of South Asia; South-East Asian practices are different. I am not sure about China and other East Asian countries. \ufffd The practice of dowry in much of South Asia, makes it difficult for women to claim their rights to property vis-\u00e0-vis natal family. \ufffd Macro level: \ufffd Absence of legislation to the effect that all self acquired and inherited property of husbands should be jointly owned by the couple. \ufffd Women earn only 29 to 74 percent of income that men earn, with the lower end referring to South Asia and higher end referring to some of the South East Asian countries (UNDP 2007 - Table 29), though it is difficult to generalise. This is linked to both lower labour force participation of women when compared to men, and lower wages. \ufffd Absence of gender disaggregated data on property ownership at national/state/district level. \ufffd HH level: \ufffd High levels of poverty in South Asia (other than Sri Lanka, parts of Southern India) due to which poor do not own assets. Possible strategies \ufffd Media campaign (e.g. on the right of children to education) on women's rights to property, and the benefits of marrying daughters nearby. \ufffd Induct all poor women into self-help groups. It has been noted in micro studies that women who are members of self help groups tend to own immovable property (housing and then land) more than women non-members who were from a similar economic background at the time of group formation, Nevertheless, despite owning land, ownership of household property remains far from equitable. Many of the properties in women\u2019s names are ac- quired through loans taken by the women from the groups to which they belong (see Murthy et al. 2003). The dif- ference in ownership of movable property between members and non-members belonging to a similar background is fairly pronounced (savings account, jewellery). \ufffd All property - self acquired or inherited - of the husband should be jointly registered in both his name and that of the wife. \ufffd Any new assets created through government, donor and INGO programmes should be in the names of women (at- tempted after tsunami in India), with a clause that it can be passed only to daughters or daughters-in-law. \ufffd Any government programme on existing assets (e.g. loan with subsidy for irrigation) should make it compulsory that land be registered jointly to avail of the benefit. \ufffd Implementation of land reforms, with surplus land being registered in the names of women or at least jointly. \ufffd Fix targets for banks on percentage of women's savings accounts for residents in rural and slum areas. \ufffd Promote ownership of collective assets, e.g. ponds, quarries, waste land, and common village trees, by women's groups. This can go from one generation of women to the next (daughters-in-law or daughters). \ufffd Collection of gender disaggregated data on property ownership at a national level. \ufffd Legislation to the effect that traditional councils should include 50 percent women. They continue to solve village and HH issues in parts of South Asia.

First, we recognised that land and property ownership does not necessarily translate into control over these assets, use of the assets or decisions over how and by whom they will be used. Second, land and property ownership have clear links with HIV. There is growing evidence of links between wom- en\u2019s rights to inheritance and property and vulnerability to HIV. Women who own property or otherwise control as- sets are better positioned to improve their lives and cope when they experience crises. This is particularly true when women\u2019s economic vulnerability increases due to HIV infection. For example, women who are widowed and who own property are less likely to engage in risky behaviour, such as transactional sex, in order to survive. Women\u2019s ownership and control over assets also constitutes a household resource that women can use to deal with the social and economic consequences of HIV and AIDS, including costs of medicines, nutrition (particularly with the ris- ing cost of fuel), funerals and other associated expenses. Property also can serve as collateral for credit, enabling HIV/ AIDS-affected households to deal better with the personal and financial impact of the disease. Moreover, the economic security that property ownership provides women allows widows to keep their children in school for a longer period of time. (see Swaminathan et al. 2007). Property ownership and violence: Women who own property are less likely to face violence in the home. Research conducted by Panda and Agarwal (2005) in Kerala, India, shows that women\u2019s property ownership is linked with a sub- stantially lower risk of marital violence. Women who own land or a house are at significantly lower risk of physical and psychological violence, both in the short and long term, and are also able to exit violent relationships. Data show that among women without property, 49.1 percent experienced long-term physical violence and 84.2 percent experienced long-term psychological violence. In contrast, women who owned both land and a house reported dramatically less physical and psychological violence (6.8 percent and 16.4 percent, respectively). A multi-site study conducted by Inter- national Centre for Research on Women (ICRW) found similar results in West Bengal, India (Panda et al. 2006). Women with property reported less overall violence than those who did. not own property. House ownership, as opposed to land, was more critical. The reduction in violence is consistent across all forms and is most significant for sexual violence, with 20 percent of propertied women reporting violence, as compared to 35 percent of non-propertied. Despite these clear benefits of property ownership and inheritance for women, the issue of establishing these rights for women goes far beyond the crucial challenge of establishing the necessary legal, policy and human rights frameworks that enable women to own and inherit land and property. The fact that women in general cannot own or inherit land and other assets is not just the consequence of inadequate statutory laws (or the unenforceability of adequate laws), but more Asia Pacific Human Development Network 16 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity attributable to some customary laws, traditions, attitudes, social beliefs, values and norms that tend to be discriminatory. Therefore, institutional reforms to address this divide, though essential, are not a complete response. Individual and community change in attitudes, values, beliefs and norms is equally if not more important. For example, in one case in India, taken up by Lawyers\u2019 Collective, a woman was successful in securing a part of her deceased husband\u2019s property from her in-laws, but later discovered that the part allocated to her was barren, infertile and basically worthless. So even if the law addresses the problem, unless people at the individual level truly believe in equity, the situation is unlikely to change. I would like to point to work on this issue in Nepal. Women own less than 15 percent of land worldwide. Yet, according to Nepal\u2019s National Women\u2019s Commission, less than one percent of women in Nepal claim legal ownership of homes, properties and other assets (Duddy 2008). However, thanks to intense pressure from women\u2019s groups, and collectives of lawyers, in 2002 the government introduced the 11th amendment to the civil code, bringing about major changes not only in the country\u2019s inheritance laws but also in the provisions in the constitution relating to women.

Thanks in part to this scheme and to a UNDP UNIFEM UNAIDS joint initiative on women's inheritance and property rights in the context of HIV in Nepal, women's ownership of land and property has been steadily increasing, with infor- mal indications of it reaching almost 8 percent. I would like to add as a good practice the impact of the Asia-Pacific Court of Women on HIV, Inheritance and Property Rights held in August 2007 (see the UNDP 2008 publication listed under references). The regional court was the first ever regional summit on the issue of inheritance and property rights of women in the context of HIV. It was held in con- junction with the 8th ICAAP (International Congress on Aids in Asia and the Pacific) in Sri Lanka to compel the regions\u2019 policy makers and public to initiate concrete action. Organised by UNDP\u2019s Regional Programme for HIV and in part- nership with the Asia Women's Human Rights Council (AWHRC), UNAIDS, UNIFEM, and civil society organisations, the court brought together 22 testifiers from 11 countries in the region, along with legal experts, human rights activists and an eminent jury comprised of supreme court judges, leading development practitioners and community leaders from across the region. The court was successful in bringing inheritance and property rights into the policy and programme agenda of HIV stakeholders including governments, international organisations and NGOs in the region. The court has also led to several national initiatives in addressing the issue. Lastly, I would like to highlight that there is no historical evidence of the existence of matriarchy anywhere. It is often confused with matrilineal or matrilocal. In matrilineal society, the lineage is traced through the mother \u2013 property passes from the mother to daughters. Such communities may also be matrilocal, i.e. the husband comes to live with the wife who continues to live in her own home. Although the position of women in matrilineal and matrilocal societies is much better, they are still not matriarchal. In a matriarchal society, women would be in a dominant position, in control of state power, religious institutions, economic production, etc. (Bhasin 1993). In conclusion I would like to emphasise that structural reform and individual transformation need to go hand in hand if we are to achieve gender based economic equity.

Gender equity in contemporary Pakistan is the outcome of interac- tion between three key elements: customs and norms, economic and social mobility, and political assertion of women\u2019s rights groups. Conflict between the perpetuation of inequity and the struggle to change it has revolved around the fol- lowing issues. \ufffd Women are denied the right to own and inherit property. This results in denying women the right to marry outside their clan, tribe or blood relations. This is also one of the major reasons behind denying women the right to choose their marriage partners. This ensures that family property, especially land, is not transferred out of the family. Denial of the right to inherit property and marriage by choice is against both the state and Islamic law. However women upholding this right are targeted for killing in the name of protecting the family\u2019s honour. Perpetrators of this crime hide behind tribal laws and customs. It is surprising that in Pakistan, men from all shades of political opinion (with a few exceptions), have put their weight behind these violent killings. Women\u2019s struggles for legal reforms, enforcement of state laws, clear understanding of tribal and Islamic laws and mobilisation of public opinion against these brutalities has created space for women to assert themselves. However there is yet a long way to go. \ufffd While women are denied the right to inherit property, they are themselves treated as property (as they bring bride money to parents in certain areas and dowry to in-laws in other areas). In numerous documented cases, women who did not bring dowry to the satisfaction of their in-laws \u201cdied accidentally\u201d due to explosions of stoves. Vio- lence in the form of stove burning has been resisted by many women\u2019s rights groups but continues against all odds. Another form of violence is offering women for marriage by \u201cmen of honour\u201d to establish a truce in case of bloody conflict, to the aggrieved party. \ufffd Right to nutrition is denied in many ways. The worst form is a ban on eating meat by women in certain tribes. Similar discrimination is observed in the case of healthcare, education, work and decent workload. However rapid urbanization, emergence of the nuclear family in urban working classes, cross cultural marriages, higher educa- tion, freedom of media, civil society activism, legal battles and participation of women in the political process have countered these forms of discrimination. One can see interesting paradoxes in the transition to an equitable place for women in Pakistan. While women have been granted the right to vote, they have been denied the right to cast their votes in certain areas. However, women have found representation as elected officials from the same areas. Analysing and understanding these contradictions and drawing lessons from the field on strengthening eq- uitable relationships between men and women would be extremely valuable.

Even in the Mosuo context, where women ostensibly govern economic affairs, gender relationships have been shaped by a range of variables, in- cluding economic, socio-political and cultural factors. Not least, by any means, is the fact that Mosuo women have won their gains at the cost of doing most of the work. Dear Network Members, Gender Issues Among Mosuo People in China Gender equity is a complicated issue. It cannot be evaluated without taking socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts into account. Economic equity or control does not always lead to one gender\u2019s rule over the other.

Here women and men have equal rights. Women even have rights to choose their lovers and receive education. Estates and family properties are inherited by women, not men.

They do the cooking, cleaning, taking care of children and seniors, working in their fields, raising animals, running family hotels, etc. They are usually busy all day along, whereas men sit in the sun chat- ting and drinking tea. We were often told that women are in charge of domestic affairs or family affairs and men in charge of affairs outside the family, such as dealing with guests or government. We were often invited to dine in a Mosuo family. Women cooked the meal. Men would accompany us, drinking and eating together with us. Women would eat separately in the kitchen or another room with children. Local political affairs are run by men and political positions such as village head are held by men. Women\u2019s economic contribution and men\u2019s political authority leads to a stable relationship. Mosuo people often told us that in their society, women are valued but men are not ignored; the old people are respected and kids are loved. This creates a harmonious Mosuo society.

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 19 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Dear Network Members, Towards Equality Gender inequity prevails and is flourishing through institutional mechanisms. In India, the National Rural Health Mis- sion (NRHM), a flagship of the GOI, is perpetuating the system of putting unpaid care work for health (which the gov- ernment should be responsible for) on the shoulders of poor women, designated as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs). One of the key components of the National Rural Health Mission is to provide every village in the country with a trained female community health activist, who is selected from the village itself and is accountable to it. She should be a literate woman with formal education up to class eight. The responsibilities of ASHAs include: \ufffd Working as an interface between the community and the public health system. \ufffd Capacity building - ASHA is being seen as a continuous process. An ASHA will have to undergo a series of train- ing programmes. \ufffd Providing information to the community on determinants of health such as nutrition, basic sanitation and hygienic practices, healthy living and working conditions, information on existing health services and the need for timely utilisation of health and family welfare services. \ufffd Counselling women on birth preparedness, importance of safe delivery, breast-feeding and complementary feed- ing, immunization, contraception and prevention of common infections including Reproductive Tract Infection/ Sexually Transmitted Infections (RTIs/STIs) and care of the young child. The ASHAs will receive performance-based incentives for promoting universal immunization, referral and escort servic- es for Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) and other healthcare programmes, and construction of household toilets. ASHA in Hindi means \u2018hope\u2019. But these women, who bring hope to so many in the rural areas, have no hope of a better life for themselves or their families. They get paid a mere Rupees 1000 a month, which is much below the legal mini- mum wage of the country.

In some states in India like Rajasthan, agriculture land, if registered in the name of the woman, results in a reduction of stamp duty from 8 percent to 5 percent. Over 2 lakh women have benefitted from this. But there have been no studies to investigate if this has made a difference to the status of women. Besides this, the GOI has reduced income tax levels for women; hence unlike men, women who earn Rupees 1.50 lakhs do not need to pay any tax. Houses which are owned by women or are headed by women receive a 15 percent rebate on house tax. Earlier only farmers (those who had title deeds to the land) were allowed subsidies of fertilizer and seeds, as well as extension training in better methods of agriculture. This has been changed as the government realized that small and marginal farmers, who owned the land, generally migrated to cities, leaving the farming to be looked after by the women of the family. However, what also needs to be addressed is that during the harvesting season, when the men return home, they take the produce to the markets; hence the money for the produce is in their control. For women to be empowered, it is imperative that they have control over the money which they have earned. Some states in India give incentives to the girl-child in terms of a fixed deposit in her name when she goes to school; the amount increases as she gets into higher classes. Scholarships are also provided to girls from vulnerable castes. A key barrier to gender equality is the mind set which still believes that the son belongs to the family for life, whilst the girl-child is temporarily part of the maternal family and in reality belongs to the family to which she is married. This is in spite of the fact that more and more cases are emerging where the son has thrown out the elderly parents and they take shelter in the homes of their daughters. It is also quite common to see the girl-child being deprived of education and being sent to work in order to pay for the education of the brothers. At times, families have bought assets from the wages of the girl-child, and yet, if she gets married to a boy of her own choice, she is disowned by the very family who she helped to bring out of poverty. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 20 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Education can be a very potent tool in bringing about gender equity, but only if the curriculum does not perpetuate gen- der stereotypes. Education must actively focus on gender equality and point out that both boys and girls are capable of doing any kind of work if given the opportunity. With best regards, Benita Sharma Gender Specialist - Independent Consultant Udoy Saikia wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: The link between inequality, lack of education, and the economic burden from child bearing is ex- plored to understand the relationship between gender equity at the macro and individual levels. Dr. Udoy Saikia ex- plains how natalist ideologies in Khasi matrilineal communities undermine simple ideas of women's autonomy. Natalist ideologies emphasise child-bearing, creating direct and hidden pressures on women's ability to make social decisions. He highlights the importance of 'critical literacy' for women to help question received values and enable freedom of thought and action for greater gender equity. Dear Network Members, Intrinsic Capability: Vital for Women's Empowerment My comment is on the question \u201cWhat are some of the key barriers to greater gender equity at the individual and macro levels?\u201d The key point that I would like to try and show is that there is an inextricable relationship between in- dividual and macro levels, and that resolving the tension that exists between them is key to conceptualising women\u2019s empowerment. Prof. Amartya Sen\u2019s views on women\u2019s empowerment highlight this issue well. He points out a vital difference between \u2018intrinsic capability\u2019 and \u2018extrinsic\u2019 autonomy. Sen has understood that intrinsic empowerment is about women\u2019s ability and willingness to question received values. Only this can be seen as authentic empowerment. Anything less \u2013 even elevated levels of personal autonomy within the household \u2013 cannot necessarily be viewed as real empowerment. The point is that if the external socio-political environment does not enable women to translate individual autonomy into an intrinsically empowering process, it could merely serve to strengthen traditional masculine values.

A gender egalitarian society needs to encompass equity in both extrinsic control and intrinsic capability. My PhD work in Khasi matrilineal society in Northeast India demonstrates this well. In spite of enjoying a very high level of autonomy in household decision-making within a traditional matrilineal system, Khasi women are not intrin- sically empowered due to a ban on their political participation. Almost all of the communal and political decisions in Khasi communities are taken by male-dominated organisations (starting from grass-root organisations like the \u2018Drabars\u2019 and extending to state level organisations), and their choices are imposed on women. The impact of a recent cultural renewal movement in Khasi communities is a classic example of how political decisions that exclude women\u2019s voices tend to exploit women. To explain, there has been a heavy in-migration (both legal and illegal) from Bangladesh and Nepal and other states of India into Meghalaya (the state to which Khasis belong). This has brought about a strong fear of loss of cultural identity and land, particularly amongst Khasi political leaders. As a consequence, the various male-dominated Khasi political organisations have been promoting extravagant pro-natalist ideologies. For example, they award a cash amount of Rupees 15,000 to women who give birth to fifteen children (see Bhaumik 2007). This has created direct as well as more hidden pressures on Khasi women to produce \u2018more children\u2019 as a contribution to \u2018social values\u2019. In the final analysis the alarming result is a very high fertility rate (probably the highest in India). The individual autonomy of Khasi women at a household level is probably still much higher than women in the rest of India. But this has not resulted in Khasi women being encouraged, indeed allowed, to make social decisions. Clearly, the impact of women's empowerment, in terms of enhancing voice and influence, does help to reduce gender in- equality of many different kinds. It can also reduce the indirect penalties that men suffer from the subjugation of women. However, the growing phenomenon of natality inequality, in different parts of India and China, for instance, means we must raise our expectations about \u2018autonomy\u2019 or \u2018empowerment\u2019. When women \u2013 not just men \u2013 say they strongly prefer having boys rather than girls, the resulting natality calls for broader demands on women's agency, in addition to examining other possible influences. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 21 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity A simple view of women\u2019s \u2018agency\u2019 is no longer helpful. It is vital to take in account the received values, which prevail over and against the personal gains in \u2018agency\u2019 that women have won. Actions linked with anti-female bias, such as sex-specific abortion, demonstrates the hold that traditional masculinist values have over mothers\u2019 fertility decisions. What is needed is a combination of freedom of action and freedom of thought. Nothing less than women's ability and willingness to question received values (\u2018critical literacy\u2019) will be effective in combating inequality.

Further, in both countries the amount of time spent in domestic work is higher for women than for men. The gender division of domestic work and child care is a huge barrier, not only with regard to entry into the labour market, but also investing in acquiring higher paying skills, taking up skilled work or climbing up the ladder, which demand spending greater time away from home. \ufffd Slow agricultural growth: A greater proportion of women workers than men workers in Asia (other than in the Philippines and the Maldives) are in agriculture.

This is apparent if one compares female economic activity rate as a proportion of males (Table 32 in UNDP 2007, 83 percent for China), and women's earned income as a proportion of men (Table 29 in UNDP 2007, 63 percent).

Asia Pacific Human Development Network 22 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Solutions/Good practices 1. Reduce women's domestic work load and child care burdens: Address human poverty so that women have to spend less time fetching water, fuel, washing clothes etc. In the transport sector, prioritise roads to water point, bathing points, clothes-washing points, fuel-wood points etc. Further, strengthen child care services provided by the gov- ernment so that they are available till 6 P.M. And finally, of course, gender sensitise men. 2. Accelerate sustainable and gender-aware growth in the agriculture sector: At the macro level, insist that north- ern countries remove the subsidies they provide to their farmers so that prices in southern countries improve. Encouraging rural micro finance women\u2019s Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to take up sustainable agricultural practices and strengthen their marketing is another option. Gorakhpur Environment Action Group (GEAG), Uttar Pradesh, India promotes sustainable agricultural practices through 'greened' women's micro finance SHGs. All members of these SHGs are interested in sustainable agricultural practices (bio pesticides, bio-fertilisers, etc.) and marketing. A few women's micro finance SHGs have started farmers service centres wherein they sell organic seeds, organic fer- tilisers, bio-pesticides and equipment. The earnings of such 'greened' SHG members are higher than those members of the SHGs that have not been greened. GEAG staff closely monitor whether women have control over the increase in income earned, though not with hundred percent success. At the same time, women's federations and farmers\u2019 trade unions (mixed forum) formed by GEAG protest against any chemical industries that do not adhere to anti- pollution standards (GEAG 2004). M. S. Swaminathan Research Institute has introduced community managed internet kiosks (one-third women managed) in parts of South India so that women and men farmers have access to information on prices in different market places and can sell at lucrative prices. According to the women and men farmers, earnings improved by 15-20 percent. This could be attempted on a larger scale (Murthy et al. 2008). 3. Changing gender division of nature of work: It is crucial to bring women from unpaid work and low-end waged work to higher-end self-employed work. In Sri Lanka, Oxfam GB initiated a women-headed farmers project in the Hambantota district, under which single women \u2013 who were earlier agriculture waged workers \u2013 are now indepen- dently leasing/buying land and cultivating it. Some single women in Vavuniya are independently or collectively making eco-friendly bricks, when earlier they were either doing unpaid work or were waged workers. In all these cases, the earnings of women have gone up (Oxfam GB Sri Lanka 2007). 4.

Dear Network Members, Gender Equality: A Priority from the Human Development Perspective Thank you very much to those of you who have taken part in the discussion on economic equity. Your insightful con- tributions have inspired us to share our thoughts on why gender equality is a priority from the human development per- spective. Does this perspective provide a better framework for promoting gender equality? Is there a link from gender inequality to human development and vice versa \u2013 that is, could a two way relationship be posited? A human development perspective puts people at the centre stage of development. It is a process of enlarging people\u2019s choices and enhancing their capabilities - the range of things people do or be in life (Sen 2003). The process focuses on the creation of an enabling environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accordance with their needs and interests. Therefore conceptually, all human beings, irrespective of gender con- notations, should have equal rights and opportunities to pursue their goals. Therefore, gender equality is instrumental in maximising human development outcomes. People\u2019s choices can be infinite and change over time. But the three essential ones are for people to lead a long and healthy life, to acquire knowledge and to have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living. The Human Development Index (HDI) measures achievements of these three essential aspects of human life, which Sen describes as the evaluative aspect of human development perspective.

Does high human development imply high gender equality? Investigating gender inequalities (in the opportunities) received strong attention when UNDP, in its 1995 Human Development Report, introduced the Gender Related Devel- opment Index (GDI). While GDI penalizes the HDI of a particular country for existing gender inequalities, the index has attracted strong criticism because of conceptual and methodological shortcomings in measuring gender inequality (Bardhan and Klasen 1999; Klasen 2006). One of the major criticisms is that it does not meet the need of a measure of gender gap. While several other agencies have been attempted to measure gender gap, our focus here is on the gender gap index (GGI) of the World Economic Forum, as this index has some resemblance with the human development perspective.

Countries with high HDI (between 0.8 and 1) do not show corresponding achievements in the front of gender equality. Considering countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, Singapore and Korea score 0.953, 0.922 and 0.921 in HDI, while their respective scores in GGI are 0.65, 0.66 and 0.64. This illustrates that a significant gender gap still exists in the countries with high HDI. With regard to countries with medium HDI the figure shows the existence of a high gender gap, as for example in the case of India and Nepal. If women\u2019s achievements in the three essential aspects of human development are significantly lower than those of men, then the human development process would be discriminatory. This would have both direct and indirect negative effects at the macro as well as household levels, as indicated by several studies. High gender inequality hampers growth via distortions in education and labour markets and, indirectly, via fertility and child mortality which have inter-generational consequences (Braunstein 2007). At the household level it results in intra-household power dynamics and women\u2019s lack of bargaining power in decision making which further perpetuates gender inequality. Attaining gender equity is, there- fore, a critical component of the United Nation\u2019s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Asia Pacific Human Development Network 24 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Figure 1: Relationship between Human Development and Gender Gap Note: The Gender Gap Index (GGI) values vary between 1 (equality) and 0 (inequality). Low scores on GGI show high gender gap. Sources: UNDP 2007; Hausmann et al. 2007. What are the key challenges? Major challenges to gender equality in political, social and economic spheres persist. As the focus of the discussion is economic equity, some of the key challenges in this aspect are given below: \ufffd Unequal access to labour markets and to decent and productive employment \ufffd Wage gap between men and women for equal work \ufffd Unequal inheritance and property rights between men and women \ufffd Uneven ownership of assets and livelihood options between men and women \ufffd Unequal access to credit market for men and women We would take a closer look at challenges in labour markets and earnings in the region. This is crucial in the process of promoting greater gender equality. An International Labour Organization (ILO) study (2008) observed that the most successful region in terms of economic growth over the last decade, East Asia, is also the region with the highest employment-to-population ratio for women (65.2 per cent), low unemployment rates for both women and men and rela- tively small gender gaps in sectoral as well as status distribution. In South Asia there are 511 million women who are of working age and 540 million men, but only 174 million women have a job compared to 422 million men (ILO 2008). At the global level, women have a higher likelihood of being unemployed than men. In 2007, the female unemploy- ment rate (at the world level) stood at 6.4 percent compared to the male rate of 5.7 percent. Further, the phenomenon of increasing labour force participation by women is noticed largely at the low-wage and casualised work level. This indicates that, while the gap between male and female shares of total employment has been narrowing, the wage gap is growing in many countries (Heintz 2006). Another element of concern is the implementation of laws. In 1951 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) ad- opted the Equal Remuneration Convention (No. 100), which is one of the fundamental ILO conventions (ratified by 166 of the 174 ILO member states - http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C100). What has happened since then on the ground? In India, for example, the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 was introduced. It provides for the payment of equal remuneration to men and women for the same work or work of a similar nature. However, women in rural areas get lesser wages than men for equal hours of work (Express India 2008).

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing +5 are international commit- ments on gender equality. CEDAW provides the basis for realizing equality between women and men through ensuring women's equal access to and equal opportunities in political and public life, education, health and employment. Member states are obliged to take all appropriate measures, including legislation and temporary special measures, so that women can enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms. It should be noted that the Convention is the only human rights treaty which affirms the reproductive rights of women and targets culture and tradition as influential forces shap- ing gender roles and family relations (http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/). Another important declaration to promote women\u2019s rights is the Vienna Declaration (http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/ huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/A.CONF.157.23.En). In fact, it reaffirms the equal status and human rights of women. Some of its dimensions, relevant to economic equity, are the following: equal access to basic social services, including education and health; equal reward for equal work; equal protection under the law (including \u201ceradication of any conflicts which may arise between the rights of women and the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices, cultural prejudices and religious extremism\u201d); elimination of violence against women in both private and public life. R. K. Murthy, in her contribution to the AP-HDNet on \u201cGender and the Labour Market: Challenges and Potential Solu- tions\u201d, highlights some bottom up interventions, e.g. the initiative by the Azad Foundation which trains poor women as cab drivers; the Oxfam GB\u2019s women-headed farmers project in the Hambantota district, Sri Lanka. Microfinance programmes over the past two decades have helped poor and landless women to enter self-employment or start their own business. According to the State of the Microcredit Summit Campaign 2007 Report, as of 31 December 2006, 3,316 microcredit institutions reported reaching over 133 million clients, of whom nearly 93 million were amongst the poorest when they took their first loan. Of these poorest clients, 85.2 percent are women (http://www.microcreditsummit.org/ pubs/reports/socr/EngSOCR2007.pdf). These initiatives have a common ground as they attempt to expand women\u2019s capabilities and therefore promote gender equality and human development. We look forward to the continuation of the discussion!

The Women\u2019s Charter policy document of women of Sri Lanka and the National Plan of Action of 2007-2012 are formu- lated to remove gaps and, working in partnership with men and boys, to promote gender equality in the society. The Department of Census and Statistics in 2006 indicated that 49 percent of the population of working age were eco- nomically inactive, comprising 31 percent of males and 69 percent of females. Women engaged in household duties, the retired or old, the physically challenged etc. fell into this category. It is discriminatory to determine that women engaged in household activities are economically inactive, primarily because activities they perform within the households have an economic value. A majority of women are unemployed and concentrated in unpaid or low paid employment. Women lack information, skills and knowledge to be competitive in the labour market and as a result they are placed in low paid or unpaid employment or are underemployed. The mismatch between available employment opportunities and the stream of education selected by women is a main reason for the lack of employable skills. This has been a major draw- back to success in the job market. A high educational achievement rate and literacy rate is recorded amongst women in Sri Lanka, but a majority of women have followed either a humanities or arts stream, where employment opportunities are very limited. There are several government departments and non-government agencies which provide credit, training and skills for women to commence income generation activities and enterprises. But women find it difficult to establish proper market networks to sell their products. Women lack information and social contacts to find links to the market. It is important to have infrastructure development providing opportunities for rural women to directly bring their pro- duce to markets in lieu of going through a middleman.

Dear Network Members, Gender, Property and Inheritance Laws: Examples from Asia Property and inheritance rights have a direct impact on assets ownership and control. They play a crucial role in wom- en\u2019s economic empowerment. The full recognition of these rights enhances women\u2019s capabilities to lead productive and meaningful lives. With enhanced capabilities, women get more space to choose and avail of opportunities. Conse- quently, it is instrumental in accelerating human development process and promoting gender equity in the society. Can economic equity be achieved in the presence of discriminatory laws against women? Laws play a pivotal role in safeguarding the economic rights of an individual in a society. Discriminatory laws pave the way for further perpetua- tion of despicable social practices and marginalization of the poor in society, including women. Existence of discrimina- tory economic laws, including property and inheritance, is one of the key barriers in promoting economic equity. The lack of implementation of laws is another factor which impedes realisation of women economic rights. A brief analysis of the property and inheritance rights of a few Asian countries reveals a grim reality. The economic rights of women are trampled upon by society with little remorse. The examination focuses on some major legal and social barriers which deprive women of their legitimate economic rights.

In Pakistan the constitution of 1973 guarantees every citizen the right to \u2018to acquire, hold and dispose of property\u2019 (http://www.pakistanconstitution-law.com/const_results.asp?artid=23&title=Provision%20as%20to%20property). In addition it stipulates that \u2018no person will be deprived of his property\u2019. Apart from the constitutional guarantees, the legal instruments also uphold women\u2019s property rights. The Married Women\u2019s Property Act, 1874 entitles married women to separate property (http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/Laws/The-Married-Womens-Property-Act-1874.htm). Similarly the Transfer of Property Act 1882 confers equal rights to women to engage in sale, mortgage, lease, gift and transfer of immovable property deals (http://www.iiiglobal.org/country/india/THE_TRANSFER_OF_PROPERTY_ACT_1882. pdf). In reality, Pakistani women are deprived of their legitimate property rights. A combination of factors, such as custom- ary practices, social inhibitions, distorted versions of Islamic provisions on inheritance and unequal power structures, prevent Pakistani women from exercising their due rights. Many despicable practices remain unchallenged in the society. The practices are devised to make women powerless and voiceless in the power structure of the society. A practice of haq bakhshwana (giving up rights) is followed in southern parts of Punjab and Sindh. Under this tradition a girl member of the family is forced to stay single or is married to Quran. The main motive behind this practice is to keep property within the family and to prevent its division which is inevitable in the case the female member decides to marry. Watta Satta (exchange marriage, whereby one set of brother and sister are married to another) and cousin marriages are designed to prevent the break up of property. Aside from the deprivation of the right to acquire and own property, women themselves are treated as property. Pakistani media often carries reports of female killings by their own family members because they exerted their rights to marriage or property. Recently five women were brutally tortured and bur- ied alive as they had opted for court marriages of their own free will (Dawn 2008). Although honour killing is declared a criminal offence (http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/law-division/media/I-2005.pdf ), women continue to fall prey to this despicable crime. It is also quite common for women to transfer property to male members of the family under social pressure. The issue of inheritance rights of women in Islam is often the subject of intense debate. As per the Islamic injunctions on inheritance, a daughter in a family inherits one-third while a son is entitled to a two-thirds share of the property. It is based on the principle of \u2018to the male a portion equal to that of two females\u2019 (The Quran, Verse 4:11). The division of shares on this principle is discriminatory of female equal rights. Many writers on Islamic law (i.e. Parveen Shaukat Asia Pacific Human Development Network 28 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Ali) have argued that this law does not discriminate against women. Their main argument is that women inherit from three sources i.e. father, husband and son. However, men too inherit from other sources. One has to take into account the historical context of this law. The difference in shares between men and women is based on a corrective approach of the pre-Islamic custom of exclusion of women from any form of inheritance (Sardar Ali 2006). It is essential to revise the inheritance law through ijtihad (interpretation of Quranic injunctions on the basis of contemporary circumstances by highly educated Islamic scholars) to promote gender equality. Sri Lankan women enjoy the freedom to exercise their right to property and inheritance. Based on the general law, they have the freedom to acquire, retain and dispose of property. They are also entitled to equal inheritance rights as men (http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/consol_act/mrai69364.pdf).

For instance, a Tamil woman requires the written consent of her husband to dispose of any immovable property (http://www.asianlii.org/lk/legis/consol_act/mrai70396.pdf). Historically, in Nepal the inheritance and property laws were particularly harsh towards women. A daughter was entitled to inherit parental property if she was unmarried and 35 years old or above. Once married, she would have to return the property to the family minus the marriage expenses. A son, on the other hand, was heir of the ancestral property upon birth (http://www.aworc.org/bpfa/pub/sec_f/eco00001.html). However, Nepal reformed its discriminatory inheritance and property law in 2002, which provides for equal inheritance and property rights to men and women (http://www.lac- cnepal.com/eleventh_amendment.html). In Viet Nam constitutional and legal provisions promote the principle of gender equity.

However despite guarantees, only 3 percent of Land Use Certificates are registered in women\u2019s names and 3 percent are jointly held (Viet Nam Committee on Human Rights 2007). What are some of the commonalities which the above mentioned countries share with regard to women\u2019s property rights and inheritance rights? Firstly, the existence of discriminatory property and inheritance laws against women which mar- ginalise their economic status in the society. Secondly, the laws are not implemented in letter and spirit. The laws of the state are held subservient to the discriminatory customary practices which deprive women of their due rights. Thirdly the discrepancies between general law and personal laws prevent universal application of property and inheritance laws. Apart from the legal barriers, several other restrictions are imposed on women\u2019s property rights. R. K. Murthy in her contribution to the AP-HDNET (on \u201cChallenges to Asset Ownership and Control: How to Overcome Them?\u201d) identifies several obstacles at meso and macro levels including a patrilocal system of residence, absence of gender disaggregated data on property ownership at national /state and district level etc. In addition, Niranjan Sarangi and Elena Borsatti in their insightful contribution to the AP-HDNet (on \u201cGender Equality: A priority from the Human Development Perspec- tive\u201d) have mentioned that unequal inheritance and property rights between men and women is one of the key challenges inhibiting economic equity. In the contemporary world, societies should learn to question and discard those social norms and practices which per- petuate gender inequities. The human development process involves expansion of people\u2019s choices to live a dignified life. And \u2018people\u2019 are composed of both men and women. Let societies grant women the autonomy and freedom to claim their due rights which include their property rights. The autonomy granted will enable women to develop their full potential and lead productive lives.

Further, she is requested to call her relatives or the Panchayat within three months of reach- ing her destination, failing which the anti trafficking unit starts tracking the individual. At times, the missing person directly contacts the NGO or anti-trafficking unit. In addition to the anti-trafficking unit, the NGO Jabala does its own tracking of missing people within Kolkata or Delhi, but not in other places. If this model is successful, it will be replicated in other districts where trafficking is high (Murthy and D. Souza 2008). IFAD, in its proposed West Ben- gal coastal area development project (yet to be approved), proposes to modify the above system with a village level committee of women's groups doing the tracking instead of the Panchayat, and making enlisting voluntary. This is to ensure that those women leaving an abusive family situation are not forced to disclose their destination (Ibid). c. Ensuring safety of daughters left behind: Oxfam GB in Sri Lanka works on a project titled \u201cWe can campaign on ending violence against women\u201d. Oxfam GB's partners, through their discussion with change agents, heard that adolescent daughters of single women who leave the country for work are vulnerable to sexual abuse by male relatives and non-relatives. This is particularly true if the concerned woman is single or the father travels or is an alcoholic. The change agents hence have identified such girls, and advised the parents or the migrating single woman to leave the daughter with grandparents. However, if the father is responsible and takes care of the daughter effectively, no such move is made (Murthy and Peiris 2008). The women are encouraged to open their own bank account before leaving, and send a part of their earnings to this account, which is separate from their spouses or mothers accounts. d. Safe internal migration of girls: In the Bhiratnagar town of Nepal, UNICEF works with NGO partners to ensure the safety and education of girls and boys who migrate to the town as residential domestic helps in return for food, clothing and shelter. Through a partner NGO, it has formed locality and town-wise groups of child domestic work- ers, with fifty percent membership and leadership to girls. This group has negotiated with the host family to send the child to school once they finish the chores, for provision of a salary other than food, clothing and education, and handles any cases of violence - sexual or otherwise - against the girls or boys. While the long term goal is to prevent child labour, the abuse of migrant and resident child labour is a reality (UNICEF 2007). In Bangladesh, Save the Children Sweden-Denmark partners with NGOs who provide night shelter, food and basic lit- eracy skills to street children- boys and girls- who work as porters and domestic help. The shelters are separate for boys and girls. It also partners with NGOs to provide day shelter, bathing facilities, food, condoms and health services for sex workers - including adolescent girls- who want to continue with the trade. It supports BNWLA, a women's rights NGO, which rescues domestic workers and sex workers who are exploited and provides them with alternative employment.

This case study was prepared by me, with inputs from Mona Mehta (Global Programme Adviser, EVAW, Oxfam GB) and Kavitha Gandhi (Programme Manager, Oxfam GB), in 2007 as a part of a bigger initiative to promote Poor Women\u2019s Economic Leadership (PWEL). This case, I feel, mirrors the arguments others have put forward on promoting women's access and control over resources to change and challenge gender inequalities. I feel it is an eloquent example of having to plan holistically if we are to promote gender equality and change women's low status. In terms of policy lessons, to state the obvious - no single policy can comprehensively tackle the odds against women that limit their economic and business opportunities. Successful macro-economic policy would have to take into account the interconnectedness of women's lives and make provisions to do so. It would require complementary social policies that look at a range of issues such as: \ufffd Safe, secure and affordable transportation that supports women's mobility to engage in business enterprise/mar- kets in addition to inputs such as credit, skills etc. \ufffd Promote women friendly market practices through demarcated resources (including infrastructure such as toilet facilities for women, a space for women to gather to rest and bring their children to), as markets are often male dominated and poor women may lack the knowledge, skills and expertise to engage at first. \ufffd Affordable and efficient health facilities. This is because the biggest drain on women's time and resources is often poor health of family members and their own, thereby limiting their opportunity to engage in economic enterprise. \ufffd Encourage and support women's risk taking capacity given that prevailing gender roles and responsibilities and allocation of household and community resources support men's enterprise, and in all likelihood act as barriers for women's enterprise (refer case study). \ufffd Provision of ancillary services such as cr\u00e8che facilities and schools, so that girl-children do not end up adopting household responsibilities, as opportunities for women's economic enterprise outside the household increase, re- sulting in these girls being pulled out of school in the absence of suitable alternatives. \ufffd Mobilise men to take on domestic roles and responsibilities through a popular campaign so women's economic enterprise is not at the expense of women giving up scarce leisure time (if any). E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 31 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity The point I wish to make is that if we are to seriously promote women's leadership in the economy, it is essential to examine the possibilities of establishing horizontal linkages with various departments and policies rather than see it through the narrow prism of women's business enterprise. It is no mean achievement, but the case study sheds light on how you can tackle the various aspects of women's economic leadership through intelligent and consistent planning. It is these lessons at the grassroots level that provide us with vital clues on relevant policy. Cheers, Sunitha Rangaswami Regional Advisor - Gender and Humanitarian Oxfam Great Britain South Asia Regional Centre, New Delhi Making a Difference - A Story from Rajasthan\u2019s Thar Desert (*) (*) Not to be reproduced or published without prior permission from Oxfam GB Background: Chawa village lies in a zone demarcated as arid/dry in the western Barmer district of Rajasthan. A majority of its popu- lation is supported by a water body- a pond - that lies five kilometres from the nearest point in the village. The nearer source - the village well - can be used only by a small group of upper caste families due to social norms that are strictly enforced by powerful upper caste village members. So for two-thirds 2/3rds of the families, such as Amru Devi\u2019s (woman in the picture), in the village who belong to the \u2018Dalit\u2019 caste, it takes an average of two hours for a woman from the family to walk to and back from the pond, carrying two pots of water on every trip. The minimum number of trips for water to sustain a family's needs for a week is roughly eighteen trips. Apart from the water that a woman needs for the family's drinking, washing and cooking purposes, she has to source a supply for the livestock she is raising and for the small vegetable plot dedicated to food for her family. Chronic droughts and silting of the local pond add to women\u2019s difficulties. Often the village pond does not provide water for the whole", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bb75675-7322-4ae1-96b4-f64489cc848e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bb75675-7322-4ae1-96b4-f64489cc848e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ee221bd919ab1ea586b299c7b1c0b15ed600228068465db69c46e821db36f9e"}}, "hash": "2ee221bd919ab1ea586b299c7b1c0b15ed600228068465db69c46e821db36f9e", "text": "year and if nothing changes, the number of days when Amaru Devi has to go a longer distance of eight kilometres to the next water source will increase. For women such as Amaru Devi, water collection is just one of the many tasks that they have to do at home, on their fields or for wage work. The heavy work burden combined with poor nutrition (on an average, nutrition and health care levels in this area are poor) takes a heavy toll on their health. It also reduces the energy and time Amaru Devi can give to income generating activities for herself and her family. This severe water deficit puts at tremendous risk the three sources of income for most of the families in the region. These are rain fed agriculture, animal husbandry and wage labour. Inadequate water translates into inadequate income, which in turn forces the men to migrate to neighbouring states to supplement their meagre income. Thus women like Amaru Devi are left behind in the village, while also taking care of the elderly and children. Women in Chawa and its neighbouring villages live in a situation of financial dependency on the men. The women left behind experience the real fear of their men setting up second households in places where they work, an arrangement which may lead to their being eventually deserted by their husband. Despite the fact that the women maintain the homes and often through their work, their migrant husband\u2019s claim to inheritance, ownership of household and community resources (land, livestock, tanks, labour and even children) is with the men. Women have little or no control over these vital resources and often do not even have a say in the use of these resources. This acts as a major barrier for women such as Amaru Devi to access credit, sell produce, buy inputs or even obtain government support. It creates high levels of dependency on male income and remittances. Combined with social norms that constrain women\u2019s mobility outside their homes, it also means a loss in independent agency in most areas of women\u2019s lives. Many women are denied access to health care, even in life threatening situations, due to social norms that restrict women\u2019s independent movements and lack of cash income. Women\u2019s potential and initiative to engage meaningfully in the economy are often overlooked. Setting free this potential through a change in attitude could increase household resources and improve overall well being. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 32 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Project Intervention: If we isolate the three key factors that have a major impact on the lives of the women in this region they would be: \ufffd High burden of water collection and drinking water shortages characterised by distant water sources, neglect of traditional water bodies and depletion of ground water source supplied by government. \ufffd Low agricultural and livestock productivity mainly due to degradation of natural resources affecting income and food security. \ufffd Discriminatory social norms and practices that constrain women and promote caste, gender and religious inequality. Given this scenario, Oxfam GB, through its natural resource management (NRM) work, intends to reduce barriers faced by women by introducing a strategic shift in balance of power between men and women. Strategies include: \ufffd Increasing women\u2019s access to and ownership of assets. \ufffd Creating opportunities for women to adopt decision-making roles. \ufffd Ensuring women\u2019s representation in village level institutions. \ufffd Building women\u2019s technical skills and encourage women\u2019s leadership in supervision of technical works. The project included the restoration and construction of water harvesting structures that were undertaken to redress the acute water shortages. The project introduced a number of changes in the process to change gender roles and enable women to establish more control and ownership over the resources brought in by the project. For instance, women are involved in managing and physically undertaking the procurement and distribution of construc- tion materials from the district market. This not only created ripples within the village but also in the markets, which are male dominated. Women gained both in mobility (challenging the social norms curtailing their independent movement) and in status as they dealt with traders and suppliers as well as village men who were benefiting from the structures.

This is a first major resource that women own. The women\u2019s names are clearly painted on the side of the tanks proclaiming their ownership so as to make their ownership and the right of women to own assets visible within the community. Women were also provided formal certificates of ownership. In land development activities, women\u2019s right to equal ownership of land was raised. A number of partner organisations are exploring ways of enabling women to gain ownership of family-owned land developed by the project. Given both social and legal barriers, one option that is being tried out is to get male owners (husbands) to give the power of attorney to their wives. This action would enable women to gain control and make decisions over the use of land. The symbolic action, while not equal to actual independent ownership, would address some major social attitudinal barriers. For instance, many men believe that women cannot be trusted and if women had control they would abandon their husbands and family. For women, the symbolic action would allay their fear of desertion, as the men would not be able to sell the land without their agreement. Women are also being trained on new agricultural techniques such as diversification of crops, preparation of organic manure, vermicomposting and preparation of saplings in the nursery. They are also linked to agriculture universities and other specialists through exposure visits. Discussions on issues such as declining sex ratio and violence against women in the gender training workshops, organised for both men and women community members, deal with social discrimina- tion and challenges both within the household and community. The programme has also moved to equal, if not majority, representation of women in the village development com- mittees (responsible for care and maintenance of these structures). The aim is to enable women to play bigger roles in decision-making and challenge the exclusion of women from decision-making. Gender Analysis and Economic Leadership: How has this changed the life of Amru and her companions? To begin with, there has been a dramatic reduction in women\u2019s workload and time spent in collection of water. This frees up women\u2019s time and provides an opportunity for them to engage in other areas (both household and economy). Where E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 33 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity women had to previously walk five kilometres, they are now proud owners of tanks virtually at their doorstep. A major change for many of these Dalit women is not having to deal with the harassment and exploitation from the upper caste in whose hamlets the water sources were previously situated. There is a certain degree of pride and self-esteem as first time owners of an asset created from their skills and labour contributions. Acquisition of skills in tasks predominantly undertaken by men has also altered attitudes and perspectives towards what women can and cannot do. Women also have access to cash incomes through these newly acquired skill sets. Increased mobility through their involvement and procurement of supplies has meant women are able to access markets and related information. Many of these women had never been outside of their village until now. Supervision of con- struction works has given women both responsibility and powers to demand accountability, a role most often played by men in the past. Women\u2019s role in decision making through their representation in village level institutions has made it possible for women to articulate their views while simultaneously challenging the barriers restricting women from engaging in public spaces. Resistance from elderly men has been pre-empted by assigning them \u2018advisory roles\u2019 thus creating legitimate spaces for women to engage meaningfully, not just as household members. Women experience a greater sense of security and control as owners of land, apart from being able to engage in income generation and earn cash. Men can no longer mortgage or sell the land without first consulting her. It also demonstrates a certain degree of trust in women\u2019s abilities to own and manage a vital resource such as land. By acquiring new agriculture inputs, women themselves are better able to manage these resources (land); but it also gives credence to women\u2019s participation in agriculture on an equal footing with men, not just as an \u2018unpaid family labour\u2019. All of this has led to an increase in women\u2019s own self-esteem, as well as ushered in changes in perceptions of women as managers and owners of resources, skills and assets.

What is remarkable is that women and men have emerged as partners in a collective struggle to bring about change. These are no mean achievements given that women were once rendered \u2018invisible\u2019 behind the ghungat (veil) and seen as an extension of men in the community. Some Key Lessons: \ufffd Women\u2019s vulnerability can be reduced and their control and status as owners and skilled workers enhanced by appropriate strategies in programmes to addressing practical livelihood needs such as water and agricultural development. \ufffd Poor women\u2019s low literacy and lack of experience is not an impediment to acquiring new skills and knowledge. \ufffd Entrenched norms and practices can be altered given the right environment and strategies. Women as owners of water tanks, previously viewed as unthinkable, has become a reality today. \ufffd Interventions can be used to open up new areas and difficult issues \u2013 by providing women ownership over tanks this has paved the way for creative ways of giving them similar rights over other resources/assets, subsequently increasing their ability to influence decisions and stake their claim in the economy, community and household.

Dear Network Members, Self-Organisation of Women: The First Principle of Economic Power I would like to share with you a newspaper article and a note prepared in 2008 by Shoaib Sultan Khan, Chairman Rural Support Programme Network, Pakistan. As discussed in the last few weeks, women\u2019s access, ownership and control over resources is a critical issue that needs to be addressed to promote economic equity. Women in Pakistan are denied the right to inherit property in many areas of Pakistan. This economic inequality provides the basis for social inequality. To keep land assets as property amongst the male members, many landed families marry their daughters to \u201cQuran\u201d. In other cases women are killed in the name of \u201cHonour\u201d. The newly elected government in the Sindh province has introduced a new scheme to address this issue. Under this scheme, land will be distributed amongst women coming from landless families. This same province gave the first elected women prime minister (Benazir Bhutto) to the Muslim world. Sabihuddin Ghausi has narrated the story of reforms in Daily Dawn Pakistan (http://www.dawn.com/2008/09/22/ebr15.htm). I am sharing the note copied below as provision of micro-finance to the self help groups (SHGs) of poor and marginal- ized women has emerged as a very significant tool in reducing gender based economic inequality. It has helped to lift 8 million women above the poverty line in India, and government micro-finance sponsored programmes are operational since 1999 in the country.

By 2004 this had increased to 1100 crores. However, in 2004, the newly elected state government redeemed its promise made in the election manifesto and pro- vided an interest subsidy to SHGs of 75 percent of the interest paid by them to the bank. By early 2007, the credit uptake had shot up to 2500 crores and next year, SHGs hope to cross the 3500 crores figure coupled with the state government\u2019s directive to the banks for priority banking for the poor.

E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 35 TABLE OF CONTENTS Economic Equity Andhra has demonstrated a poverty reduction model unparalleled anywhere in South Asia. It has already impacted the livelihood of 8 million families and targets to reach another 3 million in the next two years. SERP has not stopped only at alleviating poverty, as most micro credit programmes do: it has also facilitated millions of poor and destitute families to emerge out of poverty. SERP\u2019s most effective strategy in scaling up its operations from coverage of 100 thousand households to 8 million households has been the use of Community Resource Persons (CRPs) from the SAPAP Mandals. Each of these Mandals has a pool of social capital comprising 250 to 300 CRPs. These CRPs form themselves into groups of five and normally two groups take up a Mandal for fostering SHGs, spending a fortnight a month for the next six months in the Mandal. The end result is one hundred percent coverage of the destitutes and the poor, comprising backward classes, minorities and also upper caste poor. The SHGs so formed federate in VOs and subsequently in MMS. The engagement of CRPs for social mobilization to achieve an institutional framework at the grassroots of SHGs/VOs/MMSs has given phenom- enal results at a pittance of a cost. The Orvakal Mandal in Kurnool district has 489 SHGs, 27 VOs with 5562 households as members represented by women. They have 978 leaders trained in different descriptions. SAPAP gave them a seed capital of 3 million rupees and SERP gave them 2.9 million rupees as community investment fund (CIF) since 1996. They accessed Rupees 11 crores and 65 lakhs loan amount from banks. Thus, during the last twelve years, by turnover of their savings, seed capi- tal, CIF grant and bank loans, the SHGs/VOs and MMSs gave 33,226 loans amounting to Rupees 18 crores to the 5562 members. The Orvakal MMS linked with 23 development programmes of the government and also forged partnerships with 7 donors and constructed their own building at a cost of 2 crores called Social Mobilization and Experimentation Learning Centre (SMELC). It has so far trained 18,000 women from all over the state. The Orvakal MMS designed its own programme for the landless, with a grant received from the Turner Foundation through UNDP SAPAP. It acquired 182 hectares of land and settled 98 landless families. Under the Jeevna Joyti (Life Saving) programme, the MMS supports 292 families suffering from malaria and TB. 23 VOs have their own Mahila Banks with a capital of 2 crores and 11 lakhs of 1149 members. Under the Bhavita programme, the MMS has provided 1050 child labourers residential schooling, leading to their admissions in educational institutions including higher education. The Mandal has been rid of bonded child labour. SMELC also runs a computer training centre. Empowerment has persuaded the government to link up with MMS at the Mandal level. MMS has been given a role in ensuring delivery of government services such as health, education, peace committee for policing and other government programmes.

All contributions noted this. Several went beyond to emphasise the ongoing, strenuous struggle of women over control of resources. They noted that land and property ownership do not necessarily translate into control or decision-making about who gets to use these assets. During times of crises when women are especially vulnerable (e.g. when HIV/AIDS infection increases economic susceptibility), asset ownership and control of resources helps women cope with social and economic challenges. Access, control and ownership are instrumental in promoting gender equity. Regarding discriminatory laws that impede this, the discussion noted that while various legal systems recognize women\u2019s economic rights to some extent, the gaps between the de facto and de jure legislation continue to marginalize women. Customs, too, often deny women their due rights. Barriers, at individual/household, meso (community-district) and macro levels continue to exist, and contributors at- tempted to identify possible solutions.

The consolidated reply for economic equity is now available at http://www2.undprcc.lk/ext/HDRU/EST_Gender_Economy.php The sub-theme for the next few weeks of e-discussion is politico-legal equity. Gender-based violence, culture and iden- tities (masculinity and femininity) continue to be cross-cutting issues. Political and legal powers have the potential to address underlying factors that result in unequal gender-based opportuni- ties, treatment and rewards. We would like to reflect on how gender in justice and political systems promote or hinder human development, including gender equity. What needs to be done? What is working already in the region? What are the implications for men, considering the perceived ideas of masculinity? Gender in Political Systems: Amongst law-makers and law-shapers, women tend to be marginalised. Political gaps may include lack of adequate representation in political parties, trade unions, student unions, national legislatures, pro- vincial assemblies and local bodies.

With best regards, Elena Borsatti (On behalf of the HDRU Team) UNDP Regional Centre for Asia Pacific Colombo Office Jim Chalmers wrote: Dear Network Members, Politico-legal equity is concerned with power. From a capabilities perspective, this puts the focus on mechanisms and laws, to examine how to generate greater autonomy and choice through gender equity. How could politico-legal institu- tions produce greater participation and liberty for women, as a matter of both lawful right and social reality? Here, the public policy issues relate also to norms and values, social traditions and behavioural patterns. These, in turn, enable and regulate gender identities and participation. The effects of important institutions like marriage and family are not just bases of social order: they distribute social power. Thus there is a subjective dimension involving expected ways of belonging, social self-identity and participation. States, religious institutions, culture and customs devise and legally enforce particular institutional/behavioural pat- terns. Yet, these are not etched in stone. Shifts occur over time and the goal is to plumb the ways that policy shifts could generate greater equity and freedom. In addition to the questions posed in HDRU\u2019s message, some other questions of interest to the discussion are: \ufffd What is your experience of women\u2019s access to or participation in the main political and legal institutions (justice systems, representative legislatures or parliament)? \ufffd How are women being politically empowered at different levels? \ufffd What are some of the discriminatory laws which impede advancement of women in political, social and economic spheres of life? What are some interventions that have helped rectify legally sanctioned discrimination against women? \ufffd Are the structures that implement laws, policies and procedures male-dominated in your country of work?

Women occupy just 16.9 percent of seats in Asian national parliaments and 12.9 percent in the Pacific. At central government levels in Asia, women hold only 8 percent of ministerial portfolios. She notes that the challenges include patriarchal social sys- tems, social and cultural prejudices, financial dependence of women, lack of available training, family and child-care responsibilities, and corruption in politics. Effective strategies could include gender quotas for party leadership roles. Others targeted efforts include, for example, reforming campaign finance regulations, eliminating campaign violence and the intimidation of women candidates and voters. Dear Network Members, Towards MDG3: Removing Barriers to Women\u2019s Political Participation in the Asia-Pacific Region This contribution to the e-discussion will focus on the political side of politico-legal equity. When women\u2019s political participation, or more specifically, their participation in national parliaments, was selected as one of the indicators for E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 41 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity MDG3, it represented an international consensus that raising the number of women in parliaments is a strategic means to removing the structural causes of inequality between men and women. However, increasing women\u2019s participation in legislatures is only one, albeit essential, aspect of the larger goal of achieving a broad-based inclusion and participation of women in all national power structures. We also need to increase the numbers of women cabinet ministers, leaders of local authorities, heads of government and state, political party leaders, and senior public service officials to fully reach equality in political participation and the gender-responsive governance and policies that are needed to achieve MDG3. Despite having made gains since the 1995 Beijing Conference, women remain largely underrepresented at most levels of government, but especially in ministerial and other executive bodies. In fact, in 2008, only 20 countries -1 from the Asia-Pacific region(*) - have reached the target set by the Economic and Social Council (**), of reserving 30 percent of seats in national governments for women. This target was set because 30 per cent is considered to be the critical mass needed in any institution to effectively influence policy outcomes. In the Asia-Pacific, Timor Leste, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Viet Nam and Australia are coming close to achieving this critical mass of women parliamen- tarians. However, the regional averages stand further from this goal, with women occupying 16.9 percent of seats in national parliaments in the Asia region (***) and 12.9 percent in the Pacific. In terms of parliaments therefore, we still have a long way to go to achieve a critical mass of women, let alone gender parity in parliament. Gender parity would require that women hold 50 percent of seats and truly exercise political agency in decision making.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e03aead7-0ffa-4d51-9c5d-4c9205bce3ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "e03aead7-0ffa-4d51-9c5d-4c9205bce3ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b72371ff92d9934febf8a24d1f27201239858bb9da85677df5143bbb1af20c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5e7a767-de68-4001-b9f9-5e2fe68f2a21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1057fabf8f820e2e442bd91447c03a29a43f5dcd3b41c96d855903774a2ab000"}}, "hash": "4c5b64d6d2117bce5018023e6121ac79da8a13e28af2324fa1d80fd5ba2c72ed", "text": "Women have been more successful in exercising power at the local than at the national level, but still remain largely underrepresented in local government.

While we continue to work towards gender parity in legislatures, we must also direct our efforts on achieving gender parity in other areas of governance where power is exercised. We must address women\u2019s under-representation in the cabinet and ministerial positions and as leaders of political parties, governments and states. For example, globally, only 16 women are currently heads of state or governments. Women hold only 16 percent of ministerial portfolios globally, and in Asia, only 8 percent. Women ministers and senior staff in the public bureaucracy alike continue to be, on the whole, assigned to gender stereotyped fields of government such as children\u2019s or women\u2019s affairs, social affairs, educa- tion and health, and rarely to top positions in the defence ministry or diplomatic affairs. Despite the available evidence that demonstrates the positive implications of increasing women\u2019s political participation on women\u2019s rights and development goals and targets, women continue to face barriers to enter into and influence the political decisions that affect their lives, at all spheres of political influence. The reasons for this vary by context, but in the Asia-Pacific, research suggests that the remaining challenges primarily lie in patriarchal social systems, social and cultural prejudices that discourage women from entering into politics. The financial dependence of women, the lack of training opportunities for women on effective political engagement, family and child-care responsibilities, the high cost of seeking and holding office and corruption in politics are additional factors that deter women from entering the political arena. In recognition of these constraints, the international community has supported initiatives to build women\u2019s capacity to participate in political life, both as political representatives and as voters. These efforts have included providing support for women\u2019s autonomous organisations. They have also involved helping create networks of women in politics through which women can share the information, resources and experiences they need to overcome the hurdles encountered in entering into politics and having an impact on policy outcomes. In addition, a number of successful initiatives have focused on redressing the other side of the equation: removing the entrenched institutional biases found in parliaments, political parties and public bureaucracies, by supporting efforts to institute affirmative action measures for women. Such measures have included quotas for parliaments and parties, and equal employment opportunity regulations in the public service so that more women can move into senior management positions. Moving forward, we will need to invest more in devising strategies to help women rise to leadership roles in all areas of political life. Towards this goal, it will be vital to work more concertedly with political parties. Efforts need to focus on integrating gender equality goals into parties\u2019 regulations so they champion gender equality in their work and promote women to party leadership. Gender quotas for party leadership roles could be one approach to achieving this. Further- more, a greater emphasis is needed on reforming campaign finance regulations so that women candidates have equitable Asia Pacific Human Development Network 42 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity access to public and private sources of electoral financing. This is essential for women to be able to run an effective and competitive campaign. A third area of work should be on eliminating campaign violence and the intimidation of women candidates and voters. Finally, there is a need for ensuring the public provision of care services, especially child care, so that women have the support they need to balance their family and work responsibilities, including the duties of public office.

Poverty and the urban-rural divide are also crucial. Dear Network Members, The Under-Representation of Women in Public Life in Fiji This contribution considers the question \u2013 why are women in the region marginalised in the political arena? Is it because of low educational achievement, culture or other reasons? The example here is Fiji. The argument is that we will not find as evidence low female educational achievement as such, but different kinds of pathways through education and into adult life. These are culturally-oriented and lead to different outcomes for men and women in public life, so few women appear in the political arena. Nazhat Shameem, the only Indo-Fijian female judge in the High Court of Fiji said: Fiji\u2019s glass ceiling is tough, because our community is driven by both ethnicity and patriarchy. I am a Muslim Indo-Fijian woman, and the combination of my race, religion and gender is very hard for many people to stom- ach \u2026 I have been called hostile, spiteful, manipulative, devious, cunning and power-hungry. It is not surprising that many women in Fiji decide that it is too difficult to continue to forge change. For all the rewards attached to my position as an Indo-Fijian female High Court judge, there are an equivalent number of sanctions (Shameem 2008). Overall, progress towards gender equality in Fiji has been mixed. Notable inequalities persist in women\u2019s access to economic and political participation, but these cannot be attributed solely or even largely to a gender gap in education at the present time. There are quite a few developing countries in the Asia-Pacific where levels of female literacy and participation in education are high, but the status of women still remains low. Fiji is one of them. E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 43 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity Education achievements Despite low female status, female literacy is high in Fiji and female educational achievement is not markedly lower than that of males. For example, Fiji had a gender parity index of 1.06 in secondary schooling in 2004. From 1995 to 2002, girls completed primary school in greater numbers than boys (Chandra and Lewai 2005: 25). The better results of girls in the Form Seven examination (Tavola 2000: 253), enabled their entry to tertiary education in greater numbers than males. More females than males now complete tertiary education in Fiji (ADB 2006: 35-37). In terms of Millennium Develop- ment Goal 3, this is cited as evidence of achieving gender equity in education (see Fiji National Planning Office 2004: 36). Nevertheless, the claim of gender equity in education warrants scrutiny. In 2005, female tertiary enrolments only outnumbered male enrolments in certain degrees at The University of South Pacific and at the Fiji College of Nursing, while male tertiary enrolments vastly outnumbered female enrolments in Training Productive Authority of Fiji (TPAF) training programmes and at the Fiji Institute of Technology (FIBOS 2007c). Despite marked improvements in female educational performance, the position of women overall in the labour market has not changed much. In 2005 only 55 percent of women were employed (ESCAP 2008: 76). In 2002, all salaried fe- male workers in Fiji took home only around 88 per cent of male earnings (FIBOS 2003; UNDP 2002). What are the barriers to women entering the political sphere? High-achieving girls still tend to emulate the career choices of older women in their families and communities, even in the current context of a marked reduction in labour market opportunities for the time-honoured \u2018white-collar\u2019 female occupations of teaching, nursing and public service work (Nilan 2009). With the exception of a few notable women from the Chieftain clans, there has not been a viable history of female leadership in Fijian public life since colonisation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f2cdb6b-e590-4d39-9bd4-6622392952d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f2cdb6b-e590-4d39-9bd4-6622392952d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1367d7e294554808b454938d931bb4939f7942189c9a10d776ef0e606deb0739"}, "2": {"node_id": "79eaeec1-761f-4844-91c2-6c660d8c7bd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2637e5a93ecfa60caee8c610168b37365016a4743d5588ffb442a97d316cd72"}}, "hash": "bd3877800066cc2b535d6d75f4eafc049a2da3dc093075d563db6a9935fa9912", "text": "There are, and have been, few women in politics.

Yet \u2018[Indigenous] Fijian cultural norms do not place restrictions on women\u2019s mobility or on most types of economic participation, and increasingly, Fijians value secondary and higher education for both girls and boys as a means of social and economic mobility\u2019 (ADB 2006: 3). Indo-Fijians have always placed great value on education. The agency of women is limited in conservative Fijian traditional thinking - \u2018in traditional Fijian culture, family hierarchy is \u2026 valued and specific gender-related and age-related roles are clearly defined. For example, children are at the bottom of this hierarchy, and older male family members are at the top\u2019 (Williams et al. 2006: 561; see also Vakaoti 2008: 62; Halapua 2003: 7; Leckie 2002: 176 for similar claims). This is similar elsewhere in the Pacific. Conclusion In conclusion, low female educational achievement is not common at all in Fiji, yet different kinds of pathways through education and into adult life are realised within patriarchal discourses of appropriate male and female behaviour which lead to different outcomes for men and women in public life. Poverty and the urban-rural divide are also crucial. The outcome is few women in politics.

Dear Network Members, A Gender Equality Strategy in Promoting Women's Voice in Politics By the end of the 20th century, countries in the Asia-Pacific not only saw globalization expanding fastest in the area, but also a general acceptance of a world order whereby sets of internationally agreed upon rights based conventions set the highest moral order in social organisation. Many Asian-Pacific countries have signed on to the important UN conference documents and human rights conventions and have even made attempts to incorporate international standards into their domestic legislative systems. To take China and India, as examples, not only have the two countries adopted legislation to promote gender equality and the protection of women\u2019s rights in the spirit of implementing commitments to interna- tional agreements, but they have also put in place institutional frameworks to oversee the implementation process. What is still lacking, however, is the operationalisation of the legislation. What is needed is a strategy to clarify legally E-Discussion: Gender - Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice 45 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity what constitutes an offence to women\u2019s rights, for example, by establishing clear definitions of discrimination, sexual harassment, rape and marital rape and so on. These definitions will not come through until women and progressive men at the grassroots level demand in organised voices. It is thus important to create channels for these voices to be recogn- ised in policy making processes. For instance, in China, the National Working Committee on Women and Children under the State Council and its counterparts at the provincial and county levels make efforts to design, monitor the implementation of and advocate government programmes and legislation that are in favour of gender equality. It also works with the All China Women\u2019s Federation on policy issues that are of concern to women. Moreover, at the local level, one of China\u2019s important democratization exercises has been the direct election of village leaders, which started in the 1990s. Inspired by the approach in India to adopt affirmative action in legislation to promote women up to 33 percent in the local panchayats, Chinese women\u2019s organizations and activists also argued for a fixed percentage of women\u2019s representation. Women\u2019s participation in village government is steadily growing in China. These above issues are often in focus of the UN and other international development agencies\u2019 assessments of gender equality and women\u2019s advancement. Interventions have focussed and largely been devoted to the implementation of in- ternational conventions with the help of women\u2019s machineries and the promotion of women\u2019s representation in political processes. These aspects are important. However, what is missing is the promotion of a system of policy consultation whereby grassroots women can voice their needs and interests and policy and programme interventions can be devel- oped to recognize women\u2019s needs, especially their gendered needs, and to meet these needs as their basic rights. In my recent book, Gender and Chinese Development: Towards an Equitable Society (Routledge 2008), I discuss ex- amples of policy consultation with the participation of grassroots women in local levels with the support of UN orga- nizations. What is needed is a strategy to promote systems of public policy making suited to different local conditions and facilitating consultation with women and women\u2019s organizations. Institutionalisation of public consultation takes a women\u2019s rights and men\u2019s involvement approach and is at the bottom of these systems whereby women can voice their concerns on needs to be met as their rights and also new women leaders enter public life and find strengths from their mentors among experienced women and men leaders. With best regards, Lanyan Chen Professor/Foreign Expert Institute of Gender and Social Development Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, China Julia Scott-Stevenson wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note: Julia Scott-Stevenson highlights that although almost all countries in the Pacific have high profile fe- male political representation, this does not imply true gender equality. There are still many barriers that prevent women from taking up positions in the political and legal spheres. However, some action is slowly being undertaken including national women\u2019s policies or plans of action; but implementation is conditional on developing political will. Towards this, actively involving males in all stages of the process has proved effective. Dear Network Members, Snapshot of Women's Politico-Legal Participation in the Pacific Almost all countries of the Pacific have high profile and successful female political representatives, who are at times pointed to as proof that women can reach the same positions as men. However, the achievements of a few successful women, often from privileged backgrounds, while not to be sneezed at, does not represent true equality. There are still many barriers that prevent women from", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "844ae427-7c70-4998-ab1e-7e44a2fc15af": {"__data__": {"id_": "844ae427-7c70-4998-ab1e-7e44a2fc15af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92307f18e02982afee8d680e72370d8d831039bca8cc6664f944e023b7953151"}}, "hash": "92307f18e02982afee8d680e72370d8d831039bca8cc6664f944e023b7953151", "text": "taking up positions in the political and legal spheres, and some figures can attest to this. In Samoa for example, women hold only 6 percent of parliament seats. There is one female cabinet minister (out of fourteen), and three of fourteen government ministries have a woman as Chief Executive Of- ficer. Much better is the representation at Assistant CEO level, where in 2005, 39.5 percent of positions were held by women (Mulitalo 2005). Some action is slowly being taken to improve this situation. For example, the Samoan branch of the Commonwealth Women\u2019s Parliamentarian Association (CWP) was launched in June this year by the Speaker of Parliament. The Pacific Representative for the CWP is the Hon. Fiame Naomi Mataafa, the Samoan Minister for Women, Community and Social Development, who noted at the launch that Pacific representation of women in parliaments is the lowest in the Commonwealth. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 46 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity A common method in the Pacific and indeed, globally, of addressing women\u2019s needs, particularly in the politico-legal sphere, is to draft a national women\u2019s policy or plan of action. This has met with limited success in the Pacific, as once drafted it needs political will to see it through to implementation. Samoa has a draft National Policy for Women, pre- pared by the Division for Women within the Ministry of Women, Community and Social Development (MWCSD), but which has yet to be approved by Cabinet. Tokelau also has a draft National Policy for Women, again yet to be approved and adopted by their parliament (referred as the General Fono). Tokelau held its inaugural National Women\u2019s Summit in March this year, but held off discussion of the policy in favour of starting first with an economic summit looking at income generation for women of the community, and with an inaugural Miss Tokelau pageant, designed as an event to inspire young girls and women to embrace their culture and see women as celebrated within the community. In Pacific countries such as Samoa and Tokelau for example, the village structure is such that the village council of chiefs or elders is separate from the women\u2019s committee, and while the women\u2019s committee does hold specific functions within the community, decision-making power resides with the usually male-only village council (some councils do now have female representatives). This may suggest why fewer women are seen in national-level political positions, as when power structures are so defined at the village level, it can be very difficult for women to break out of that mould. Particularly also in the Pacific, where it is still strongly felt that a woman\u2019s role is to take care of the home and family, spare time for political participation can be almost impossible to come by. The significant financial backing required from the family for a woman to run for parliament can also be a significant deterrent, given that women have less power to make major financial decisions within the family, and further they may be keenly aware of other competing family needs for financial resources. These factors can be difficult issues to address without having calls for change sounding like they are an attack on the culture in which the village system exists. One way of approaching this, which has been identified in both draft national women\u2019s policies mentioned above, is by actively involving men in the process from the beginning. In other gender is- sues as well, it has been shown that involving men and boys is a successful strategy, not least when addressing violence against women; the political system would also benefit from this approach. In Samoa\u2019s draft policy, objective five is \u201cTo actively involve men and boys in the advancement of women and the girl-child to achieve full community participation and support for this process\u201d (MWCSD 2007). As stated above, the Samoan branch of CWP was launched in June this year by the Speaker of Parliament, who noted the need for more female political representation. Statements such as this from men in high profile positions are one powerful step in this process. In terms of legal equality, CEDAW is of course the starting point for assessment. A review of CEDAW legislative com- pliance across nine countries of the Pacific, undertaken in 2007, found varying levels of compliance (Jivan and Forster 2007). It found each country had significant compliance in some areas, some progress in other areas, and complete non- compliance with others. Of course, legislative compliance does not automatically result in equality in fact, but without compliance there is even less chance of progress towards equality. Again, political will is needed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "585dcd2d-0cc2-4184-b45f-5d8b3e9dd3aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "585dcd2d-0cc2-4184-b45f-5d8b3e9dd3aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00314180f6f49c01ee73e03a4642efd29d6ccae3f08dce3ba89f92dd4d354fe0"}, "3": {"node_id": "107f081f-5ab8-4939-9c39-2858138938b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d5ced5123bc37507f12a428d4b1b2c54541763d321c505fe5293cde5cf9533b"}}, "hash": "dcac685c47ad909c4a2e9df73b119bd1023ba346823139f70b477188ee473725", "text": "to follow through with compliance and, in turn, implementation. Action is also happening in this area; for example, the Samoan Government has this month advertised for a consultant to draft domestic violence legislation as required under CEDAW. While steps such as this are positive, it should be noted that Samoa still needs to do more to be on track to achieve Millennium De- velopment Goal Three on gender equality by 2015. In summary, levels of female political representation in the Pacific are currently quite dismal and more needs to be done to address this. National Women\u2019s Policies are one approach, which can be successful if backed up by political will to ensure they do not remain documents on a shelf. Involving everyone in the community in this discussion, and particu- larly men, is the best way to ensure that lreal change can happen and endures.

Hasna characterizes the constitution's approach towards women as 'protective'. The penal code provisions only partially preserve women's rights. She observes that concerted efforts are required to bridge de jure and de facto gaps to address gender inequities holistically. Dear Network Members, Gender Equality: De jure and De facto Challenges in Pakistan Non discriminatory laws (ordinances, decrees, acts, executive orders and promulgations) play a critical role in pro- moting gender equity and thus human development in every society. They are instrumental in providing women with adequate legal safeguards and simultaneously protect their economic, social and political interests. Gender-equitable legislation paves the way to the maintenance of \u2018balance of power\u2019 between men and women. Relevant international legal instruments (declarations, conventions, resolutions etc) are essential tools to promote gen- der equality. These global instruments address the rights of women and girls. Some of the international bench marks on gender equity include: a. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) b. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights c. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights d. Convention on the Rights of the Child e. Convention on the Political Rights of Women f. Convention on Consent of Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) is an international bill of rights for women. CEDAW obligates States Parties to ensure the equal recognition, exercise and enjoyment of rights by women without discrimination on the basis of being a woman. CEDAW is based on three core principles: a. substantive equality for women b. non discrimination towards females c. state obligations to promote gender equity in all spheres and at all levels - within the family, community, market and state. In this message, I take the example of a few of Pakistan\u2019s constitutional and penal code provisions in order to assess their compliance with relevant CEDAW articles. The provisions under consideration include a few constitutional provisions, selected penal code sections, the Hudood Ordinance and Qanoon-e-Shahdat Order. The analysis shows that de jure and de facto challenges undermine efforts to ensure full compliance with CEDAW. It leads to marginalisation of women in society. Pakistan acceded to CEDAW in 1996 (http://www.iwraw-ap.org/conven- tion/parties.htm).

It states that there will be no discrimination on the basis of sex alone (http://www.pakistanconstitution-law.com/const_results. asp?artid=25&title=Equality%20of%20citizens). However it takes a protective approach towards women issues. The gender-specific protective measures in economic and social spheres (restrictions on work hours, night shifts etc.) per- petuate discriminatory practices, infringe on CEDAW principles. Asia Pacific Human Development Network 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS Politico-Legal Equity CEDAW strongly condemns discrimination against women in all its forms and recommends that \u2018sanction, penalties and compensation\u2019 be introduced to curb gender based violence. The Pakistan Penal Code 1860 provides limited pro- tection for sexual violations perpetrated against women and girls (http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/ actXLVof1860.html). The code criminalizes sexual offences such as rape, human trafficking, soliciting, honour killing, infanticide, sexual harassment at work places, incest, and Vani. Based on the Pakistan Criminal Code Procedure, 1898, courts provide compensation to victims of sexual assault from fines collected from perpetrators of criminal offences (http://www.punjabpolice.gov.pk/user_files/File/code_of_criminal_procedure_1898.pdf). However, criminal law legislation does not fully safeguard the rights and interests of women in Pakistan. The penal code provisions do not cover serious sexual offences such as marital rape and gang rape. Provisions for mandatory prosecu- tion for sexual abuses are also not included. At present no specific section in the penal code deals with \u2018abuses in the family\u2019. In addition, there are certain penal code provisions which are discriminatory against women. The Hudood Ordinance on rape was promulgated in 1979 and incorporated in the Pakistan Penal Code (http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legisla- tion/zia_po_1979/ord7_1979.html#f9). The ordinance is discriminatory against rape victims as it provides perpetrators of sexual violence against women im- munity from prosecution and punishment. This leads to their prosecution on false adultery charges. According to the Hu- man Rights Commission of Pakistan, in 2005 at least 4621 women were jailed under discriminatory laws including the Hudood ordinance (National Commission for Justice and Peace, and Democratic Commission for Human Development, 2007). Though some of its harsh provisions have been amended, this law is still discriminatory towards rape victims. Another harsh law is related with evidence. Under Qanoon-e-Shahdat Order, 1984, the value of a woman\u2019s testimony in court is considered half that of a man\u2019s evidence (http://www.jamilandjamil.com/publications/pub_litigation_laws/ qanuneshahadat1984.htm). Article 5 (sex roles and stereotypes) requires States Parties to abolish or modify customary practices that discriminate against women. Article 8 (1) of the constitution of 1973 states that any custom or usage which is inconsistent with the fundamental rights shall be declared void. The despicable social practice of honour killing has also been criminalized (http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/law-division/media/I-2005.pdf). The crime carries the punishment of death sen- tence or imprisonment of up to 25 years. Additionally an amendment in section 310 of the Penal Code has made Vani a criminal offence. Vani is a social practice where young women and minor girls are given in for nikah (marriage) to resolve different kinds of disputes. Despite harsh criminal punishments, women are victimised and exploited due to these discriminatory social practices. A quick examination of the above mentioned laws demonstrates that legal interests of Pakistani women are not fully guaranteed. The protective approach, as espoused under the Constitution, 1973, limits women\u2019s access to opportuni- ties in political, economic and social spheres. The criminal law provisions provide only limited protection to women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7bf0af1-0ca7-436b-8e6e-601e3f8228cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7bf0af1-0ca7-436b-8e6e-601e3f8228cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion: Gender \u2013 Overcoming Unequal Power, Unequal Voice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae0ac8ffa8311a4da295a2454dc3cefe74965faa239e50b8456d666260caa026"}, "2": {"node_id": "23f93445-a114-4ba4-975a-74506da41148", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-gender-overcoming-unequal-power-unequal-voice", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff292ffe5879d53bee583e3ef462e691c53aaf62a1473fe391b0fd4b6f5cf224"}}, "hash": "fa5b7cae4a32f0e53f8d8334fc6d5d1e8ac1aff48f6eabfe63ab48b059d61240", "text": "The criminal law provisions provide only limited protection to women.

Experience has shown that even in countries such as India, where there has been a strong labour movement in the organised sector, this problem was not taken seriously by the unions. The Technical Report of the ILO arising out of the Seminar on Action against Sexual Harassment at Work in Asia and the Pacific describes various negative impacts of sexual harassment on individual workers, business enter- prises and societies (Haspel et al. 2001). For the purpose of this discussion I am sharing some of the developments in the law. While I am conscious of the limita- tions of legislative intervention in addressing such a complex area that relates to unequal power relationships, including abuse and misuse of power, laws can provide a normative framework that can ensure employer responsibility and safety in the workplace. Studies on sexual harassment have shown two dominant categories viz the Quid Pro Quo harassment where sexual favours are demanded for employment benefits, and those that involve a constant abuse of power unrelated to favours that create a hostile working environment. While there has been an impressive development in western jurisprudence, the understanding of the problem is emerging only slowly in the region, despite such a vast number of women in the workplace. I am sharing a few positive interventions in this regard. These are not exhaustive. Under section 345 of the Sri Lankan Penal Code of 1883 as amended in 1995, usage of words and actions that cause annoyance or harassment to a person is sexual harassment (http://www.asianlii.org/lk/legis/consol_act/pc25130.pdf). In addition to this, unwelcome sexual advances by words or action used by a person in authority, in a working place or any other place, constitutes the offence of sexual harassment. The language of the law is gender neutral. In Bangladesh, the Suppression of Violence against Women and Children Act of 2000, Section 10 (2) is more gender specific. Under this law, any male who tries to illegally satisfy his carnal desires, abuses the modesty of any woman or makes any indecent gesture commits sexual harassment (Pradhan-Malla 2005). However, the legislation, by referring to \u201cmodesty,\u201d could shift the discussion on harassment to male behaviour standards. Modesty, by the way, is a referral point in the legislation of many countries in the region that address sexual assault by the legislative term \u201coutraging the modesty,\u201d and is a throwback to colonial laws and terminologies. The Indian Supreme Court gave a path breaking judgment in 1997 in a public interest litigation that was filed after a so- cial worker was gang raped for having tried to stop a child marriage (Supreme Court of India 1997). The court incorpo- rated the definition of sexual harassment from the General Recommendation 19 of the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and held that such behaviour was discrimination on the ground of sex. The court formulated guidelines and these bind public and private employers to a programme of prevention, enquiry and remediation to workers. The judgment has facilitated addressing the structural violation in the organized sector, but does not address those in the unorganized or agricultural sector. In the absence of any legislation in India till date, these guidelines have set standards for workplace conduct.
