en of diseases of females than males in these age groups. In the case of East Asia and Pacific (combined) this holds true only for the 80+ age group. \u2022 In both regions the burden of diseases due to childhood cluster diseases, maternal conditions (including abortions), dengue, meningitis, nutritional deficiencies, trachoma, sexually transmitted diseases (other than HIV), sense organ disorders, and musculoskeletal diseases was higher for females than males. \u2022 The global burden of disease is higher for males than females with regard to peri-natal conditions, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, digestive disorders, leprosy, genitourinary diseases, unintentional and intentional injuries. However, the burden of particular diseases may not take into account co-morbidities and the burden of these co-morbidities. For example, pulmonary tuberculosis in pregnant women increases the risk of obstetric morbidity. Genital tuberculosis in women can lead to infertility 56 (Sen et al. 2007). It is also not clear whether burden-of-disease calculations take into account sex differences in effectiveness of treatment for diseases, which in turn may lead to greater burden of some diseases for women than men. To give an example, women undergoing anti- retroviral treatment are more vulnerable to adverse side effects such as skin rashes, liver toxicity and mitochondrial toxicity than men (Forum for Collaborative HIV Research 2002). Like East Asia and the Pacific (combined), total DALY from all causes is higher for Sub- Saharan males than females. However, this does not hold true for the age groups 15-29, 60- 69, 70-79 and 80+ years where the reverse is true. Another important sex/gender difference compared with Asia-Pacific is that the burden of HIV/AIDS is higher amongst Sub-Saharan females than males, while the burden of nutritional deficiencies is higher amongst Sub- Saharan males than females (Lopez et al. 2006). 5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd50ba04-5e2e-4c64-b63f-fb0784c3821a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd50ba04-5e2e-4c64-b63f-fb0784c3821a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94f75493edb42084c5a5badc092659679266c4f85c5e921d9b844d8815ef428a"}, "2": {"node_id": "d6a06445-7721-4dc4-a872-7fc99a420d6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12a6fac6e22121dc63ed1ba34e2c23fbeab54d58f0edaea0b49bcb316fec79a7"}}, "hash": "e950ec2d6f8cb216c0a81c211465c135220bb1150af4af694c9569d542ca6843", "text": "2006). 5.

This section elaborates on the three causes, and at the end gives examples of the vicious cycle in operation between gender inequities in health, gender inequities in the economy and lack of power, voice and accountability 5.1 Unequal distribution of power based on gender \u2022 Unequal distribution of power in households: The unequal distribution of power in households is reflected, for example, in the social construction of men as household heads, and women\u2019s lesser decision making power over their lives (ARROW 2008). Data from Progress of the World\u2019s Women, 2009 on decision making by women on their own health reveals stark inequalities in how much control married women have in these areas in South Asia. According to the report, 54.2 per cent of married women in South Asia have no say over decisions on their own health, 25.7 per cent take decisions jointly and only 19.4 per cent of women take decisions on their own. The situation is better in East Asia and the Pacific (combined) where the comparative figures are 7.4 per cent, 29 per cent and 63.3 per cent. The comparative figures for 57 Sub-Saharan are 51.2 per cent, 19.3 per cent and 29.4 per cent, which suggests that women have greater decision making authority on health in this sub-region than South Asia, but not as much as in East Asia and the Pacific (UNIFEM 2008). Unmarried women in both the Asia and Pacific regions have greater say over decision making on health than do married women (UNIFEM 2008). The fact that half of all surveyed women do not have any say over decisions on their health in large parts of South Asia leads to delays in access to emergency health services. Such delays are one of the important causes of high maternal deaths in several countries in South Asia (see ARROW 2008). Delays may also be one of the reasons for higher death rates due to sexually transmitted diseases amongst females than males in South Asia but not in East Asia and the Pacific (Lopez et al. 2006, commissioned by World Bank). However regional aggregation needs to be viewed cautiously, as decision making power may be higher in Sri Lanka than the South Asian average and lower in China, Japan and Republic of Korea than the East Asia and Pacific average. Weak decision making power in South Asia is closely linked to patrilineal inheritance and patrilocal residence systems, as well as the practice of dowry where the bride\u2019s side has to pay money or goods to the groom\u2019s side during marriage (discussed in 2.2.3). In contrast, in Sub-Saharan Africa the system of bride price is common and women have access to land for food crops, although inheritance patterns vary (Blumberg, 2004). \u2022 Unequal distribution of power in community: There is little cross-country data on who dominates traditional community institutions. In large parts of the Pacific, during the post European colonization period, women lost their rights to joint community decision making with men (Griffen 2006). In Kiribati, it is now men who make decisions in traditional community meetings (ibid 2006). Male dominance in decision making is also true of large parts of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Islamic Republic of Iran where men from dominant economic and social groups take decisions in village councils and community councils. Rigid moral policing of women and girls by male leaders of traditional institutions continues, ranging from virginity testing at marriage in Kiribati, to violence against couples if they marry outside their caste in India, and flagging of women who have been raped on the grounds of adultery in Pakistan, though recently make illegal Griffen 2006; Sen et al. 2007). \u2022 Unequal distribution of power in market and state: Women occupy few senior positions in parliaments or as female legislators, senior officials and managers, as well as in local self governance institutions (with a few country exceptions). Country data from the Human Development Report, 2007/2008 on the proportion of seats in Parliament held by women was available for 28 of the 42 Asia-Pacific countries (UNDP 2007).lxxix Consolidation of this data reveals that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94a14706-8a7b-4017-822e-28351fc7cb48": {"__data__": {"id_": "94a14706-8a7b-4017-822e-28351fc7cb48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d32ce0631781d15ed4ff476d8bad372a93e4b350fc0cd48d732edadc1d0c7836"}}, "hash": "d32ce0631781d15ed4ff476d8bad372a93e4b350fc0cd48d732edadc1d0c7836", "text": "only 13.5 per cent of the seats in parliaments in the 28 countries were held by women (year unspecified). This figure is lower than the proportion of women in parliaments in Sub-Saharan Africa which stands at 17 per cent as of 2007 (World Bank n.d.). Within Asia-Pacific the percentage of women in parliament is higher in countries of East Asia at 16.8 per cent and lower in countries of the Pacific and South and West Asia both at 10.7 per cent. Comparatively, the proportion of women in parliament was greater in industrialized countries than in developing countries (23.9 per cent and 12.3 per cent), although the proportion of women in Japan is closer to the developing country average. While data on the percentage of women in local self governance institutions was not available for 58 all countries of the Asia-Pacific region, it ranged from 2 per cent to 33 per cent in 12 countries in 2000lxxx (Drage 2001). While there is little data on the power of sexual and gender minorities in societal institutions, few hold political decision making positions in the region. Women\u2019s presence in economic and political decision making provides a role model for younger women. Further, there may be health benefits of having women in local self-governance institutions, particularly for women. Drage (2001) observes (in a review of reports on 12 countries) that women leaders in local governments prioritize improving water, sanitation and health services more than men in such positions. Better water and sanitation services have a greater impact on women\u2019s health than that of men\u2019s given the division of labor, and their need for safe toilets. Further, women leaders were found to spend greater time to address issues of gender-based violence than men leaders at the local level (Drage 2001). More poor women (though still a minority) are found in local self-governance institutions when compared with parliaments, where the few women who occupy positions of power usually come from economically powerful groups. The percentage of female legislators, senior officials and managers was only marginally better than the proportion in parliament for the 20 countries for which this information was available from the Human Development Report 2007/8. It was 23.4 per cent for the region as whole, higher in the Pacific at 25.8 per cent, and lower in South and West Asia at 14.2 per cent (data was available only in Pacific industrialized countries, which raises the Pacific average to 36.5 per cent). Again the performance of industrialized countries (27.7 per cent) was slightly better than developing countries (22.6 per cent), with Japan coming close to the developing country average. While hard data is difficult to obtain, it is mainly women from privileged economic and social backgrounds who dominate the few decision making positions in economic spheres as well. Whether women\u2019s presence in economic leadership makes a difference to gender equity in economy is a moot question. Women are found more in Scandanavian countries in decision making positions, and these are the countries with better maternal and parental leave policies (UNDP 2007; Ray et al. 2008). 5.2 Unequal voice and agency Not only do women, sexual/gender minorities and men who question alternative masculinities rarely occupy decision making posts, but they are rarely consulted by power holders in community, state or market institutions. Unlike countries in Latin America, few countries in Asia-Pacific have passed legislation on the right to participation in public policy determination. A study on community participation in health sector reforms in Asia-Pacific in the late 1990s/early 2000s notes that few health sector reform projects were designed by the World Bank and governments based on consultations with women\u2019s rights groups, groups working on behalf of sexual and gender minorities or people\u2019s health movements. A notable exception was the Bangladesh Health and Population Sector Strategy, but nevertheless, consultations with sexual/gender minorities does not appear to have been undertaken (Jahan 2003). It is important that women, men who represent alternative voices (to dominant masculinities), and sexual/gender minorities have a say in public policy formulation, and it is equally important that they are aware of their rights and are willing to challenge deeply entrenched gender norms. The NFHS 2005-06 surveys in India, for example, revealed that 38 per cent of 59 married women with no sons preferred to have more children even when they already had two daughters (Government of India 2006). Studies on wife beating covering Cambodia, Bangladesh, India and Nepal note that acceptance of wife beating amongst women ranged from 29 per cent in Nepal to 57 per cent in India (Rani and Bonu 2008) Since the 1990s, poor women in Asia-Pacific have been", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c646c108-6f9a-4a4b-b9ae-3dd4912bedf5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c646c108-6f9a-4a4b-b9ae-3dd4912bedf5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6110f96c150a320542699f0ff5171bb16ff7b7f8e81dfc25e8621c5a57e95e46"}, "3": {"node_id": "42a7bb13-1572-4985-9435-5ebb337dd9eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cfebbf5dfc4893be07cf7578019b014526d064f70038d13294307160b387063"}}, "hash": "abd6aaf3971a0eb1f32433d3dda9704341059794e9c249ceaa410c6142647ee0", "text": "mobilized under micro-credit SHGs, with the proportion of women in SHGs varying across countries and within countries. In some countries they have been federated at village levels. While this mobilization has created spaces for women to meet collectively, access loans, have their own savings, better access health services, and push gender norms a little; they have not been able to dramatically alter power relations at household, community, local market or local government levels. However, this mass-scale mobilization of women offers the potential for challenging power relations, if groups are encouraged to combine micro-finance with gender empowerment interventions (Deshkmukh-Ranadive and Murthy 2005). Another important route is strengthening women\u2019s participation and leadership in trade unions, which is low in the region. According to Women of the World 2009, the proportion of women workers in labor unions in Asia ranged from 31 per cent in Viet Nam to 4 per cent in the Philippines, averaging 11.5 per cent for eight Asian countrieslxxxi for which data was available for the period 1994-2004 (UNIFEM 2008). Female-to-male earned income was highest in Viet Nam amongst the eight countries (UNDP 2007). 5.3 Weak accountability of power holders Weak accountability of power holders with regard to gender equity in health and the economy is another issue. \u2022 Accountability of state to gender equity in health and economy: Though 24 of 41 Asia-Pacific countrieslxxxii for which data was available had ratified/acceded to ICESCR and 36 of 41 had done so with regard to CEDAW (compared with 46 of 48 Sub-Saharan Countries, cited in UNIFEM 2008), few had passed legislation on right to health, right to livelihood or right to gender equity (computed from http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/3.htm). The Indonesia is one of the few exceptions which have passed a law on right to health (ARROW 2008). See Table 4 and 5. Unless a country guarantees right to health, right to livelihood or right to gender equity, it is difficult for women to demand accountability of the state for gender equity in health or the economy. While National Women\u2019s Commissions exist in some of the Asia-Pacific countries, they do not generally have judicial powers, nor autonomy from the ruling political party. Often they focus on issues of gender-based violence; however their emphasis on other gender equity health economic issues is less. National Human Rights Commissions have greater judicial powers in some countries, but do not focus much on gender equity in health or the economy, or rights of sexual/gender minorities (Asia-Pacific Forum on National Human Rights Institutions 2002). 60 Table 4.

Strengthening gender-aware health and social security coverage for informal sector workers is a challenge. While labor laws stipulate maternity leave and health benefits with contributions of employers for formal sector employees, they are weak on what health issues are covered under health benefits. Controversial (e.g. abortion) and costly services (e.g. treatment of couples for infertility or of gender minorities for sex- change surgery) are rarely covered under health benefits (Murthy and Ravindran 2005). Laws have little to say on coverage of health needs of sexual and gender minorities by employers. Further, regulations to promote accountability of the private health sector are limited. With over 50 per cent of people dependent on the private health sector in 36.6 per cent of Asia-Pacific countries this is an important problem. \u2022 Accountability of traditional community leaders: There is little information on how countries regulate the decisions of traditional community leaders on gender, health and economic issues. This is a matter worth researching. During the 2004 tsunami, NGOs found that there were no laws to regulate the functioning of traditional Panchayats in coastal Tamil Nadu, which distributed more relief to households with males engaged in deep-sea fishing and paying taxes than to those headed by women without male members engaged in deep-sea fishing (Save the Children 2006). Such economic inequities can have an adverse effect on the health of women heading households and their children. \u2022 Accountability of male household heads: Accountability of male household heads to gender equity in health and the economy is another issue. According to UNIFEM (2008) while 6 of 9 governments in South Asia have legislation on domestic violence, 63 6 of 9 do not have legislation on marital rape. In East Asia and the Pacific the situation is worse: 15 of 27 countries do not have a law on domestic violence and 24 of 27 have no law on marital rape. Cross-country data on gender equity in legislation on inheritance was not available, indicating how little governments attempt to hold male household heads accountable to leave land equally to women. Legislation is not the only route to promoting accountability of male household heads. Awarding men on International Women\u2019s day who have adopted positive practices like supporting women who are survivors of violence seems a good strategy as is being attempted in Bangladeshlxxxiii. 5.4 The vicious circle in operation in Asia-Pacific As explained in the framework in section 2.0, the inter-linkages between the three elements -- lack of power, voice and accountability, gender inequities in health, and gender inequities in economy \u2013 are not uni-directionally linear, but operate as a vicious circle with each element reinforcing the other two. This vicious circle at its most benign can lead to further deepening of the three elements and in its worst form can lead to death of the person. Women, girls and sexual/gender minorities are affected more adversely than men through this vicious loop. Some real life examples illustrate this: Sexual and gender minorities in Malaysia are vulnerable to social and legal prosecution and violence. This shows their lack of power in society and vis-\u00e0-vis the state. Transgender people in Malaysia can be detained under either the civil laws as well as the Syariah Criminal Offences Act (religious laws), showing how state and religious institutions come together to oppress gender minorities. Muslim transgender people (in particular male to female) are regularly arrested under the Syariah Criminal Offenses Act for \u2018wearing women\u2019s clothes for immoral purposes\u2019 and are fined US$200 to US$800 or imprisoned. Non-Muslims on the other had are fined US$7-14 under the civil laws (Kasim 2008). Such heavy fines on Muslim transgender people could plunge them into poverty, or further deepen their poverty and push them into prostitution for survival. Kalpana, a school girl aged 16 from Taratal, Bardiya, Nepal, from a lower middle class farming family loved a boy in senior grade school and had a physical relationship with him. They had no idea about contraception (as there was no sexual and reproductive education available), and she became pregnant. That is, neither the government nor the community leaders were accountable for providing SRH education to adolescents. Her family and community members forcibly married them.

She is likely to find it difficult to negotiate condom use by her clients and is hence vulnerable to AIDS. 6. GOOD PRACTICES IN BREAKING THE VICIOUS CIRCLE Several good practices have been used to break the vicious circle between gender inequities in health, gender inequities in the economy, gender inequities in distribution of power and voice and issues of weak accountability. Some have addressed all aspects of the linkages, while others have addressed one or two aspects. The eleven examples selected here are by no means exhaustive, but illustrate the range of strategies that have been adopted in this region. 64 The first six follow the \u2018development route\u2019 to breaking the vicious circle, while the last five have followed the route of expanding voice and agency of women, sexual and gender minorities and men who wish to challenge dominants constructions of masculinities. In the process they have strengthened accountability of power holders for gender equity in health and the economy. 6.1 Good Practice: Model 1 Interventions targeted to all on the surface, but in fact benefiting women more than men: The case of universal social insurance in Thailand which covers the health needs of all comprehensively. On the surface, increases in government health expenditure on health as proportion of total government expenditure (e.g. between 2000 and 2005, Nauru saw an increase from 11 per cent to 38 per cent), increase in government health expenditure to total health expenditure (e.g. between 2000 and 2005, Afghanistan saw an increase from 1 per cent to 20 per cent) and promotion of universal social health insurance are all examples of practices that target all household members. However, these interventions benefit women more than men as women use government facilities more (WHO 2008a). Such allocation and health financing interventions will indirectly foster gender equity in the economic sphere as women would as a result have more resources to invest in their economy activity, which would have otherwise, go to out-of-pocket expenses. The case of universal social insurance is illustrated below. \u2022 In Thailand, female-to-male earnings as of 2005 were only 62 per cent (data from UNDP 2007). Some 72 per cent of workers are employed in the informal sector, and this number is likely to include most women (ibid 2007). This implies that a majority of women have less access to cash than men and are not covered under insurance by employers. The Government of Thailand introduced universal social health insurance in 2001 to reduce the vulnerability of those in the informal sector. The social health insurance scheme provided for the establishment of a Universal Health Fund, with the support of government and local organizations, and co-payment from citizens. Poor groups may be exempted from co-payment. In early 2001, the government launched the \u201930 baht health policy\u2019. Anyone who is not in any other insurance scheme and whose name is in the house registration in the provinces is insured under the 30 baht health policy. Each person insured receives a universal health card or \u2018gold card\u2019. Users are required to show their identification card when utilizing services. The card entitles users to pay a subsidized fee of only 30 baht per episode of illness, provided they use public health facilities and follow the referral system. For emergencies, however, any government health service can be accessed. From the government\u2019s side, financing is from tax revenue. Per capita outlay is 1404 baht per year, part of which is paid to health care facilities according to the number of local residents registered with them. This includes costs of curative, preventive as well as promotive care. The government requires all hospitals to participate in the hospital accreditation programme to ensure that high quality care is available also to poor people. A Clinical Practice Guideline has been developed to assure the same quality of services. The 30 baht scheme covers all reproductive health services except obstetric services beyond the second pregnancy and infertility treatment (Ravindran 2005). However, it is not clear whether it covers treatment for sex change operations for gender minorities, 65 assisted reproductive technologies for lesbians or issues such as detection and treatment of cancer of testicles, penis and prostrate in men. Nevertheless, improving access of women to health services would lead to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86fb835b-8f86-42c2-ab29-afd0489136a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "86fb835b-8f86-42c2-ab29-afd0489136a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89646f6274aa74889645fd9adaf3cfecf9824d31a42af8edfeed614560bea05b"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a76816f-317e-405b-865e-c9f0f0000ea9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12ce284b1ad96a5a514aa8bf54e17f683bf508bf299de8e2803143d5026b02a8"}}, "hash": "9f74e73f9eef2d295aabe5565df0a72405efa950275b915178717322b25425a7", "text": "greater gender equity in the economy, which in turn can improve women\u2019s participation in the economic sphere. 6.2 Good Practice: Model 2 Interventions targeted at women that address financing of women\u2019s specific health requirements: the case of maternity insurance of enterprise workers, China. The Government of India\u2019s universal maternity cover under the National Rural Health Mission for institutional delivery in public facilities (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 2005) and the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s Maternity Insurance Scheme are examples of interventions targeted at women that address the financing of women\u2019s specific health requirements. Lower out-of-pocket expenditure on maternal health care implies less indebtedness for women and their families and greater resources to invest in their economic activities later. The Chinese example is summarized below. \u2022 In 1994 the Ministry of Labour in conjunction with the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other organizations, drafted the Proposed Methods for Maternity Insurance of Enterprise Workers, which came into to effect from January 1st 1995. The Methods provided that insurance resources be publicly pooled, with enterprises surrendering maternity premiums, calculated according to a fixed percentage of worker's wages, to designated insurers to establish a maternity insurance fund. Maternity benefits consist of a maternity allowance, maternity leave with pay and health care. By presenting their maternity certificates, women workers may obtain maternity allowances from the designated insurers and have their maternity-related health care expenses reimbursed. The pay for women workers on maternity leave is fixed at the level of the enterprise's monthly average in the previous year and disbursed by the Fund. By 1997, this reform was introduced in two-thirds of China's provinces (United Nations 1997). This procedure makes it easy for women to claim maternity insurance from employers who otherwise evade paying. This scheme is likely to strengthen access of women to maternal health care; and better maternal health in the long turn would also strengthen their economic participation. 6.3 Good Practice: Model 3 Interventions targeted at women that add gender and health concerns within economic programs: the case of BRAC in Bangladesh. With the growing presence of women\u2019s micro-finance SHGs in Asia-Pacific, several governments and NGOs have attempted to add a gender and health component to micro- finance programs. One example is the case of the Mahalir Thittam (women\u2019s scheme) in the Tamil Nadu Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Department, which has recently introduced community health insurance on a pilot basis and has sought through the SHGs to make two districts malnutrition free (Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Department 2003). Another example is the Bangladesh Rural Academy (BRAC) which has specifically added gender and health equity component to its capacity building of group members. As the impact of BRAC is better documented it is illustrated here. 66 \u2022 The Bangladesh NGO, BRAC, introduced initiatives in Matlab area to promote gender and social health equity for children of poor mothers who were BRAC members in the mid 1990s. Girls were found to be disadvantaged with regard to height-for-age indicators. Three rounds of surveys were carried out in the period 1995 to 1996 at approximately four-month intervals. Stunting (height-for-age) was used as a measurement of nutritional status, and comparison was made between rates of stunting amongst children of poor BRAC members, poor non-members and non-poor non-members. The absolute rate of stunting and gender differences in stunting reduced (almost disappeared) amongst BRAC member children, while gender inequity remained large amongst non-member poor children and non-poor non- member children. That is, integrating gender and social health equity education for BRAC members helps to reduce gender inequalities in nutrition amongst children (Khatun et al. 2004). Gender equity in nutrition amongst member children may have a long-term impact on maternal health, and on women\u2019s participation in the economy. However, a study carried out in 2004 indicates that where health awareness alone (with no gender component) is added to micro-credit programs (again the case of BRAC) members, health access may improve but gender disparities may persist (Ahmed et al. 2006). That is, strengthening gender and health equity messages to members is more important than health messages alone. 6.4 Good Practice: Model 4 Interventions targeted at women that add economic equity to reproductive health programs: the case of UNFPA in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a76816f-317e-405b-865e-c9f0f0000ea9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a76816f-317e-405b-865e-c9f0f0000ea9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89646f6274aa74889645fd9adaf3cfecf9824d31a42af8edfeed614560bea05b"}, "2": {"node_id": "86fb835b-8f86-42c2-ab29-afd0489136a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f74e73f9eef2d295aabe5565df0a72405efa950275b915178717322b25425a7"}}, "hash": "12ce284b1ad96a5a514aa8bf54e17f683bf508bf299de8e2803143d5026b02a8", "text": "UNFPA has been adding an economic component to their reproductive health programme in Bangladesh and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.

UNFPA is collaborating with the Women\u2019s Union and Ministry of Health Fund of Lao People's Democratic Republic to set up a seed fund which will be utilized to strengthen livelihoods of women and pay for two reproductive health workers per village. In Ban Bo Piet, a village of 54 households in one of the most inaccessible mountainous areas of the country, the seed money was used by the women to combine subsistence with sustainable cash crop production (cardamom), diversify agriculture, improve women\u2019s access to markets, and use the increase in income to better access reproductive health services. Two health workers were appointed to disseminate messages on reproductive health. As a result of these interventions women are marrying later, there is a reduction in the work burden of women, the cash earnings of women have gone up, and there is greater awareness about HIV/AIDS prevention, family planning methods and the location of health services. Women\u2019s utilization of health reproductive health services has also improved (UNFPA 2002). 67 6.5 Good Practice: Model 5 Reducing multiple sexual, reproductive health and rights violations through one action: the policy of secondary education of girls in Bangladesh In Bangladesh, and more recently in India, policy measures have been introduced to retain girls in school through the secondary level due to concerted advocacy by women\u2019s and girl child rights\u2019 groups. Better education of girls is likely to increase their wages once they become employed, which may in turn improve their health. Here the Bangladesh example, which has been cited as a success, is elaborated upon. \u2022 Secondary education of girls reduces sexual rights violations of girls (especially forced and consummated marriage before 18 years of age), improves girls\u2019 understanding of their own health and reduces adolescent pregnancies which pose high risks to girls. The Government of Bangladesh launched the Female Secondary School Assistance Programme in 1994 with the aim of increasing secondary school enrolment and the retention rates of rural girls. The programme provided full scholarships covering tuition fees and all other costs, increased the numbers of female teachers, educated communities and parents about the value of girls\u2019 education, improved school infrastructure, and added occupational skills to the curriculum. By 2002, the expanded programme was supporting 5000 schools in the 118 poorest rural districts with around a million girls getting scholarships, and with almost 40 per cent female teachers. The enrolment and attendance rates for girls improved sharply and surpassed that for boys. Furthermore the proportions of married girls aged 13 to 19 years dropped significantly (Herz and Sperling 2004 cited in Sen et al. 2007). 6.6 Good Practice: Model 6 Working with men and women parents and community leaders to promote equity in infant and child survival and access to education: the case of UNICEF in Nepal UNICEF has been working with pregnant women, husbands, parents (both fathers and mothers), and community leaders to promote access to maternal health services and gender equity in infant and child immunisation, nutrition and education. The impact of these measures on gender equity in the economy will be visible in the long run. Malnutrition in infancy and childhood continues often into adulthood and leads to a lesser ability to engage in physical work (Gillespie and Haddad 2001). An example is given from Nepal to illustrate the strategies promoted. \u2022 In Nepal, UNICEF observed that gender inequities disadvantaging girls persisted in access to immunisation, education, malnutrition (weight-for-age and height), and that women did not have adequate access to maternal health care (UNICEF 2006b). Through its programme, Decentralised Action for Women and Children, UNICEF formed Community Action Groups comprising community leaders, pregnant women, their husbands, and parents of young children. Each group had a meeting room and a printed board which facilitated monitoring of access of pregnant women to antenatal care, anti-tetanus injections and skilled birth attendance, as well as access of male and female infants and children to immunisation, nutrition (weight-for-age), and primary education. Registration of births and contraceptive use by eligible couples were also monitored, with details on methods of contraception. Poor maternal health, access to 68 contraception, gender-disparities, if any, that were found in immunisation, nutrition and primary education, and lack of 100 per cent registration of births were all discussed. Those families that needed financial support were linked to UNDP\u2019s community level economic programmes in the country. Reduction in gender- disparities was observed over time. Researchers observed that fathers (and mothers\u2019) pride was hurt when their daughters (and sons too in some cases) were publicly recognised as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b94de571-26c8-4aa7-8711-5a66f243db0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b94de571-26c8-4aa7-8711-5a66f243db0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f9c3b52cacba92b047fd2fb1c910104ba8ac4d9d81beacc5301ec7d96b2cc45"}}, "hash": "2f9c3b52cacba92b047fd2fb1c910104ba8ac4d9d81beacc5301ec7d96b2cc45", "text": "underweight, not going to school or not being immunised, or when their wives were seen as not having access to maternal health services (Murthy and Sachdeva 2007). 6.7 Good Practice: Model 7 Advocacy to ban community practices that are harmful to women\u2019s health: the case of Hudood ordinance, Pakistan As mentioned in the section on gender inequities in health, several harmful customary practices exist in Asia-Pacific, of which some have been legally banned in recent years; for example, women in certain parts of Nepal being obliged to deliver in cow sheds, the transfer of rape cases from Sharia to civil courts in Pakistan, the banning of female infanticide etc (Sen et al. 2007). These harmful cultural practices, where women survive, lead to stigma, depression and injuries reducing their ability to take part in economic work (in particular outside their homes. Here the advocacy of transfer of rape cases to civil courts in Pakistan is elaborated at greater length. \u2022 According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, there is a rape of a woman every two hours and a gang rape every eight hours in Pakistan. The promulgation of the Hudood Ordinance, 1979 under Sharia, which permits stoning to death of a married Muslim woman suspected of adultery and 100 lashes for an unmarried woman (and people of other faiths) suspected of having affairs has to be seen in the light of the fact that the border line between rape and adultery is thin, and whether adultery should be seen as a crime in the context of a unhappy relation is a moot question. The women\u2019s movement together with the human rights movement in Pakistan has been struggling to ban this ordinance, which is supported by extreme right-wing opinion. The efforts of rights advocates bore fruit with the passing by the National Assembly and the Upper House of the 2006 Protection of Women\u2019s Bill, which transfers the jurisdiction over rape cases from Sharia to civil courts. It also makes it easier for a woman to prove a rape allegation without being charged with adultery. Although consideration of the Bill had to be postponed earlier because of opposition from the far right, it was eventually signed into law (cited in Sen et al. 2007). While the practice of public flagging of women has not stopped in Pakistan, it has decreased since the passing of this Act. This is likely to have a bearing on the health of women, as well as increasing their mobility. 6.8 Good Practice: Model 8 Interventions targeted at men and boys to challenge violence against women: the case of Fiji women\u2019s crisis center and men against violence and abuse in India Several women\u2019s organizations and men\u2019s networks around Asia-Pacific are working with men and boys to end violence against women. UNIFEM and UNDP have been supporting 69 initiatives at the country and regional level. Violence against women is a violation of their right to health and bodily integrity. It also leads to lower earnings in the market compared with women who are not subject to violence (Mallicorca-Bernable n.d.) Here an example of an initiative of a women\u2019s organization from Fiji and a men\u2019s network from India to work with men to end violence against women are illustrated. \u2022 Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Center, which works on the issue of gender-based violence, initiated a \u201cMen\u2019s Program against Violence against Women\u201d, which involves training of male advocates on gender awareness, definitions and dynamics of violence against women, and exploration of men\u2019s attitudes toward women and violence. Through this programme the Crisis Center has produced television advertisements featuring men speaking out against violence, pamphlets targeted at men, and bumper- stickers condemning violence against women. The Crisis Center has conducted trainings for military and police to sensitize men on gender issues, violence against women and human rights (UNESCAP n.d.). \u2022 In Mumbai, India, an NGO called Men against Violence and Abuse run by men has been formed with the objective of initiating changes in male attitudes on masculinities and providing a forum for men to oppose violence against women. MAVA organizes preventive programmes, public discussions on violence against women, gender sensitization programmes, as well as mass awareness programmes on violence against women using media, street plays, posters and radio. It also provides counseling and guidance to couples facing marital conflict, organizes self-defense workshops for women, and publishes a men\u2019s magazine that addresses gender issues (UNESCAP n.d.). Reduction in violence against women (apart from protecting their human rights) is likely to improve their physical and psychological health, and their participation in the economy. 6.9 Good Practice: Model 9 Working with religious", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3ce9989-451a-429b-9748-01509f2f1787": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3ce9989-451a-429b-9748-01509f2f1787", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab9c29941f44abef256283f0e69353532db42e5096093316bb2256b30a854433"}, "3": {"node_id": "d412d5c2-266d-4e27-9c98-0d0e5479ecc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39808d5d5d9ec155a069ae96ef932ff784f098eedb8029188c07ddbeba7bca5"}}, "hash": "c77f63f3d33c1e5e426f9b799d31d54c2c42baf4cd9571d8d2f844e1f0e3b1a9", "text": "leaders to change community attitudes on sexual and reproductive health: the case of UNFPA in Cambodia NGOs like MYRADA have successfully called on Hindu religious leaders in Northern Karnataka to state in public that the practice of devadasi system is against the religionlxxxiv. UNFPA has been working with religious leaders in Cambodia and Islamic republic of Iran to change conservative attitudes towards adolescent sexual and reproductive health. Unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortions, Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and STIs amongst adolescent girls can lower their ability to engage in paid work. Here the work of UNFPA in Cambodia with religious leaders is elaborated as an example. \u2022 After Papua New Guinea, Cambodia has the highest rate of prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Asia-Pacific (WHO 2008a). In a survey conducted in the early 2000s, 80 per cent of adolescents believed that they could not contract HIV/AIDS. The knowledge of adolescent girls was poorer than that of adolescent boys on these issues. Monks and nuns play an important role in influencing social attitudes. There are 4000 wats or temples throughout the country, where 54,000 monks and nuns reside. There are two main Buddhist monastic orders, one for monks and another for nuns. These have played an active role in initiating medical centers in the community. UNFPA has been working since the early 1990s with the two Buddhist monastic orders to spread 70 messages through their sermons against trafficking and on prevention of HIV/AIDS. Along with the European Union, it is now developing strategies to disseminate messages on adolescent sexual and reproductive health through the sermons of nuns and monks (UNFPA 2004). Such measures are likely to promote the rights of adolescents to information, to reduce STIs/RTIs and in the long run contribute to the economy. 6.10 Good Practice: Model 10 Interventions aimed at strengthening the accountability of government to address women\u2019s health and young people\u2019s health: the case of Women\u2019s Health Rights advocacy partnership (WHRAP) in South Asia The Gender and Health Equity Network, International Women\u2019s Health Coalition, the Royal Tropical Institute and Asia-Pacific Resource and Research Center on Women (ARROW) have all worked towards strengthening accountability of government health services to needs of women in different countries of Asia. Here the example of ARROW has been chosen, as it has sought to improve public maternal health services and strengthen accountability to young people\u2019s health needs. Both measures contribute indirectly to greater equity in economic spheres for women (e.g. through reduced debts and earlier entry into the work force) and adolescent girls and boys (e.g. through lesser expenses on substance use). \u2022 The Women\u2019s Health Rights Advocacy Partnership was launched by ARROW with six partners in South Asia in 2003 (ARROW 2008). The strategy consists of building The capacity of women\u2019s community-based organizations to claim their health rights at local level, strengthening provincial and national level advocacy so as to push for health policies and implementation procedures that are more sensitive to women\u2019s and youths\u2019 health needs; and at the South Asian level to initiate regional policy dialogues between parliamentarians, health bureaucrats, women\u2019s ministries, and gender and health experts from the different South Asian countries. This strategy is now being expanded to other Asian countries. Early impacts are already visible. In Bangladesh, because of advocacy and monitoring by Naripokko and Bangladesh Women\u2019s Health Coalition (two WHRAP partners) and the community-based women\u2019s organizations, the number of physicians in the 12 upazilla (sub-district) Health Advisory Committees where WHRAP is operational has increased. At the beginning of WHRAP only 2 to 4 physicians were present in each of the upazilla health advisory committee. There are now 7 to 8 physicians including an obstetrician/gynecologist in each upazilla health centre (Naripokko 2006; BWHC 2006). In Sarso, a village in Uttar Pradesh, India, where WHRAP is operational through a partner NGO Sahyog, the auxiliary nurse midwife would visit the village infrequently and often charge for services that should have been provided free. The community women asked the chief medical officer at the concerned district for a photocopy of the midwife\u2019s mandatory visiting schedule, and started monitoring her actual schedule. As a result, the concerned midwife is visiting and providing pre- and post-natal services regularly (ARROW 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d412d5c2-266d-4e27-9c98-0d0e5479ecc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d412d5c2-266d-4e27-9c98-0d0e5479ecc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab9c29941f44abef256283f0e69353532db42e5096093316bb2256b30a854433"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3ce9989-451a-429b-9748-01509f2f1787", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c77f63f3d33c1e5e426f9b799d31d54c2c42baf4cd9571d8d2f844e1f0e3b1a9"}}, "hash": "b39808d5d5d9ec155a069ae96ef932ff784f098eedb8029188c07ddbeba7bca5", "text": "At the national level in India, a public hearing was held on high rates of maternal mortality, which has led to a regular monitoring committee being formed. 71 On the issue of sexual and reproductive health for youth, in the state of Gujarat, WHRAP partner Center for Health Education Training and Nutrition Awareness (CHETNA) and other NGOs working with youth were asked to draft a Gujarat Youth Policy in keeping with the National", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a83123d9-853c-44e2-8a12-444de2985856": {"__data__": {"id_": "a83123d9-853c-44e2-8a12-444de2985856", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03ceaad4a3c998560a3244b7bd316f2b5ebb54e64f84c266dfd24cb67b5908a0"}}, "hash": "03ceaad4a3c998560a3244b7bd316f2b5ebb54e64f84c266dfd24cb67b5908a0", "text": "Youth Policy.

Here the paper illustrates how in Nepal lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and inter-sexed (LGBTI) people came together to advocate for de-criminalization of homosexuality. The lesser the legal stigma attached to homosexuality the greater the ability to gain equity in the work place (although equity is not likely to follow automatically). \u2022 In Nepal, four LGBTI organizations including the Blue Diamond Society filed a writ petition in April 2007 (05/01/2064) demanding the Supreme Court to defend and protect equal rights of LGBTI people of Nepal, after a few LGBTI activists were arrested on the grounds that homosexual activity was a criminal offence. After three hearings, in December, 2007 in a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Nepal recognized LGBTI people as natural persons who should enjoy all the rights of other sexes/genders enshrined by the Constitution of Nepal and by human rights conventions to which Nepal is a State Party. The Court issued directives to the government of Nepal to ensure rights to live according to their own identities, introduce laws providing equal rights to LGBTI people and amend all laws that discriminate against LGBTI people. The Court ordered the formation of a committee comprising officials from health, law and other ministries, police, and the National Human Rights Commission to address issues faced by sexual minorities and study laws in other countries on same-sex marriages (Sarkar 2007; Pant 2008). Based on the recommendations of this committee, in November 2008, the Supreme Court gave its consent to same-sex marriages and asked the government to pass legislation to this effect (Narayanan 2008). 7. DISCUSSION ON GENDER (IN) EQUITY IN HEALTH AND ECONOMY IN ASIA-PACIFIC The paper described major gender inequities in health in the Asia-Pacific region that have a bearing on the lives of women, men and gender/sexual minorities and to examine how gender equities in the economy have a bearing on gender inequities in health and vice versa. It also analyzed how the lack of power and voice of the above groups and poor accountability of power holders has a bearing on gender inequity in health and the economy, and documented good practices on breaking the vicious links between gender inequities in health and the economy, and issues of inadequate power, voice and accountability. On the basis of this 72 analysis the paper has presented policy messages to foster gender equity in health and economy. Although the paper sought to document the spiraling positive effect of gender equity in health on the economy and vice versa, there is a scarcity of literature on this topic, and an attempt has been made to document some of the important good practices. Gender inequities in health exist in some form in almost all the 42 Asia-Pacific Countries. In the majority of Asia-Pacific countries the female biological health advantage at birth is eroded progressively, with this erosion more marked in South and West Asia than Southeast and East Asia. Sex/gender-specific health needs of women, men and sexual/gender minorities are not adequately addressed by public health services in developing Asia-Pacific countries, which constitute the majority, other than routine delivery care and contraceptive services (except for the Philippines). Controversial health services, such as safe abortion services for women and genital reassignment surgery for transgender, as well as expensive services such as breast or prostate cancer treatment are not easily available in the public domain in the majority of developing Asia-Pacific countries. There is evidence that the sexual and reproductive rights of women, girls, marginalized men and boys, and sexual/gender minorities are violated in all the countries, including the industrialized ones -- though the extent and forms vary. In most Asia-Pacific countries men and boys suffer from diseases and health conditions associated with high-risk behavior, including tuberculosis, HIV, intentionally inflicted and unintentional injuries. But gender norms are changing, and the male-female gap is reducing at least with regard to high-risk behavior such as tobacco use.

In all Asia-Pacific sub-regions, groups marginalized economically, socially and politically amongst women, men and sexual/gender minorities fare worse. While in absolute terms, IMR, under five mortality and life expectancy are worse in Sub-Saharan Africa (but not the proportion of under-five children who are underweight) than any of the Asia-Pacific sub-regions, gender inequities in these are not reported in Sub-Saharan Africa and neither are there reports of skewed sex-ratio at birth (UNDP 2007; World Economic Forum 2008). But DALYs lost by females due to HIV are higher than males in Sub-Saharan Africa and early marriage of girls and polygamy are more common. (Larson et al. 2006). Disheartening is the fact that levels of under-five malnutrition and gender inequities are higher in South Asia than Sub-Saharan Africa, though overall income poverty levels are higher in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Bank n.d.). Gender inequities in the economy in Asia-Pacific have a close bearing on gender inequities in health. This paper confirms the findings of existing research that the gender division of labor has a close bearing on gender-differentiated health exposures and risks of women and men. The paper also reiterates findings on the links between intra-household inequalities in the allocation of food, health care and education and gender inequities in health disadvantaging women and girls. Such inequities are not only found in South Asia as much of past literature has observed, but also parts of the Pacific and the Philippines (food allocation). Anecdotal evidence suggests that parents of children who exhibit sexual/gender orientation different from that commonly associated with their sex at birth are at times forced to leave the home -- thereby denying them access to food, health care and education. This is an aspect on which not much quantitative data is available. The findings of this paper suggest that where male preference in inheritance prevails (traditionally, may be kept down now under communist rule) or where female earnings as a proportion of male earnings are low, gender inequities 73 disadvantaging girls and women in sex-ratio at birth, and in infant, child and adult mortality may be higher. This includes countries including China, Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia and Singapore in East Asia; Tonga and Solomon Islands in the Pacific; and India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Maldives in South Asia. As reliable cross-country data is not available on land ownership and inheritance patterns for all countries to support firm conclusions, further investigation is called for. Studies from India also show the links between low levels of property ownership and high levels domestic violence. But greater economic activity and lower disparities in earnings may not on their own improve maternal health. Much depends on the level of and control over earnings, whether they are in the formal or informal sector, terms and conditions of work and the division of reproductive work. For example, Papua New Guinea and Cambodia record a female-to-male economic participation ratio of over 70 per cent in 2005 but also maternal mortality ratios of 400 per 100,000 births. Another issue is the sensitivity of labour policies to specific health care needs of women, men and sexual/gender minorities. In a majority of developing countries women and men are more often employed in the informal sector than in the formal sector, and the proportion of women is slightly greater than that of men workers. Government welfare policies for workers in the informal sector provide inadequate health security. Further, at best they may provide maternal health benefits, but not benefits to cover other sex-specific health conditions of women, nor of men and sexual/gender minorities. Lastly, the work place itself is a site of sexual and reproductive rights violations against women, sexual/gender minorities and men and boys from marginalized backgrounds. While many of these gender inequities in the economy are found in Sub-Saharan Africa as well there are two differences: women have access (not necessarily ownership) to their independent plots of land for growing and managing food crops (a greater proportion of women workers are in agriculture) and their economic participation and earnings as a proportion of those of men are higher than Asia- Pacific and particularly South Asian averages. Sex ratios at birth are not skewed and gender differentials in child malnutrition, IMR, and under-five mortality are not noted in this region. At the same time, maternal mortality ratios are also", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b91de50d-9f6f-41d0-836c-c10b97d5356c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b91de50d-9f6f-41d0-836c-c10b97d5356c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8264c2e48cbd2af0878011e5c4889898d0e86d2e2565d80c5cd8cc32fce1a83d"}, "3": {"node_id": "202747c1-3baf-4a81-b5aa-7610fcc9ef68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66a9f3a4fe245d150825351c74cb950bc1b90a3602d6ae0ab6e09741acf26a2b"}}, "hash": "23dc81e8e5255fbcd4bbb3c3c098b4d53b80ca94f911ed93ba2147d036de2ac7", "text": "higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than Asia- Pacific and particularly South Asia Gender inequities in health have a bearing on gender inequity in the economy. While there have been studies on how poor health and lower incomes are related, this paper points to sex/gender-specific linkages between the two. The greater burden of diseases amongst females in Asia-Pacific due to maternal conditions (including abortions), dengue, meningitis, nutritional deficiencies, trachoma, sexually transmitted diseases (other than HIV), sense organ disorders, and musculoskeletal diseases may result in greater loss of earnings of women due to these conditions. At the same time, the greater burden of diseases amongst males due to tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, digestive disorders, leprosy, genitourinary diseases, unintentional and intentional injuries may lead to greater loss of earnings of men due to these conditions. Overall, the burden of diseases is higher amongst females than males in the age group 15-29 years in South Asia (but not in East Asia and the Pacific), pointing to long-term impacts on their earnings and ability to move up the ladder in the economy. However, concepts such as DALYs do not capture the loss of access to household and community support systems for women with stigmatized health conditions who may be forced to leave the marital home in parts of South Asia, losing crucial economic resources, particularly with patrilineal inheritance. Women who experience widowhood because of the death of husbands due to stigmatized health conditions are at times denied rights to the husband\u2019s property and blamed for the disease. Another way in which gender inequities in health has a bearing on gender inequities in the economy is the case of certain sex-specific health services (a form of gender inequity in health) which are not available in public health 74 services; the costs incurred in private services are considerable for poor women, men and sexual/gender minorities. Such costs cut into long-term economic investments that women, men, sexual/gender minorities may plan for. Further, greater spending by men than women on substance use (at times taking away part of the earnings of their partners) may erode their economic resources as well as those of their partners. A major difference between Asia- Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa in the impact of gender inequity in health on the economy, is the greater economic costs to women of early marriage and of living with HIV in Sub Saharan Africa (Keyvan 2006). Three deeper underlying factors underpin gender inequities in health and the economy disadvantaging girls/women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities in Asia-Pacific. First, power within the family, traditional community institutions, trade unions, companies, local government, state assemblies and parliament is held mainly by heterosexual men (and, other than in families, by men from powerful economic and social backgrounds). The patriarchal ideology perpetuated by these institutions is internalized by women and men and practices such as dowry and son preference are perpetuated in some countries (South Asia, as well as some countries in other sub-regions). Second, few Asia-Pacific countries have enacted legislation on the right of people to participate in the formulation of public policies, legislation and budgets -- which would give women, men and sexual/gender minorities a voice. While women have been organized into micro-finance self-help groups in several developing Asia-Pacific countries, these collective forums do not significantly challenge power relations and gender norms which women have internalized as much as men. Organizations of marginalized men (other than trade unions in the formal sector) are much weaker, and it is only recently that sexual/gender minorities have begun to organize. As a result, the voice of women, marginalized men and sexual gender/minorities demanding equity in health and the economy is weak. Third, there are few mechanisms for holding to account power holders in state, markets, communities and families to address gender inequities in health and the economy. The optional protocol on ICESCR has yet to be opened to governments for ratification, and not all countries in Asia-Pacific have signed the optional protocols to CEDAW and ICCPR. National Women\u2019s Commissions have less power than Human Rights Commissions. Measures for holding informal markets to account for gender equity in health and the economy are few, and formal markets are only slightly better. Measures to hold community institutions and household heads to account to follow gender- equitable economic and health practices are even fewer. Not all countries consider marital rape as rape, and intra-household inequalities in food and health care distribution are ignored.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "202747c1-3baf-4a81-b5aa-7610fcc9ef68": {"__data__": {"id_": "202747c1-3baf-4a81-b5aa-7610fcc9ef68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8264c2e48cbd2af0878011e5c4889898d0e86d2e2565d80c5cd8cc32fce1a83d"}, "2": {"node_id": "b91de50d-9f6f-41d0-836c-c10b97d5356c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23dc81e8e5255fbcd4bbb3c3c098b4d53b80ca94f911ed93ba2147d036de2ac7"}}, "hash": "66a9f3a4fe245d150825351c74cb950bc1b90a3602d6ae0ab6e09741acf26a2b", "text": "If one compares power, voice, agency and accountability in Sub-Saharan Africa with Asia- Pacific there is one major difference: unlike the practice of dowry which is common in several South Asian countries (and a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a8eaf0d-75e1-4fb6-9052-ec70b24db7ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a8eaf0d-75e1-4fb6-9052-ec70b24db7ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9300dd7e019c0bee3761ac1a555473725d971d077d9edf8701c6dd0b100c8ef"}}, "hash": "f9300dd7e019c0bee3761ac1a555473725d971d077d9edf8701c6dd0b100c8ef", "text": "few in other sub-regions) bride price is the norm in Sub- Saharan Africa. Married women in Sub-Saharan Africa have a greater say in health decision making within the household than in South Asia, but less than in East Asia and the Pacific (UNIFEM 2008). Women in Sub-Saharan Africa have greater mobility than in South Asia. Bride price, rather than dowry is the norm in Sub-Saharan Africa, unlike parts of South Asia. When it comes to political leadership, women occupy a slightly greater proportion of seats in parliament in Sub-Saharan Africa compared with Asia-Pacific, but are still a minority. Ratification of the optional protocol on CEDAW and legislation on marital rape is weak in Sub-Saharan Africa as well These deeper underlying factors do not have a unidirectional linear relationship with gender inequity in health or gender inequity in the economy, but they form vicious circles which are difficult but not impossible to break. When controversial sex-specific health needs of women, 75 marginalized men, and sexual/gender minorities are not provided in public health services (due to inadequate power, voice and accountability) this increases costs and reduces incomes of these groups, which in turn leads to less access to health care for future morbidities. This in turn may reduce participation and earnings. Lack of access to paid sick leave in the informal sector (due to lack of power, voice and accountability) leads to lower earnings and poor access to health care services in turn. Higher proportions of women and gender minorities than men are engaged in the informal sector. Son preference \u2013 reflecting lack of power of women in societal institutions -- leads to higher female-to-male IMR and under-five mortality rates in some countries, which in turn may lead to repeated pregnancies and lower the health of women, as well as their earnings in the labour market, which again increases gender inequities in health care. There are, however, strategies to break this vicious circle between lack of power, voice and weak accountability, and gender inequities in health. Some organizations have sought to add a component of economic empowerment of women to strategies to address gender inequities disadvantaging girls in health. Others have added gender and health equity strategies to those which seek to promote economic equity amongst women. A few governments have sought to promote universal social insurance schemes covering several (but not all) gender/sex-specific health conditions of women and men (but not sexual/gender minorities). Some donors and NGOs have sensitized religious leaders and men heads of households on gender-based violence against women, as well as health needs of adolescents. Through a more activist mode, rights-based NGOs have challenged discrimination in laws against sexual/gender minorities (Nepal) and the Huddood ordinance (in Pakistan). Others have mobilized women for implementation of sound gender equitable health and economic policies. Last but not the least, there have been attempts to expand girls\u2019 education, which simultaneously benefits their health and potential earnings. At the same time there are several gaps in strategies to address the links between gender inequities in health and the economy. Few civil society actors have used human rights treaties or constitutional guarantees/directive principles to push for the right to participation, to health, to livelihood, and to gender equity -- all prerequisites for gender equity in health and the economy to be achieved. Few examples exist of holding to account leaders of community, market organizations and household heads (mainly men) on gender inequity in health and the economy. While there are examples of citizens engaging with government, strategies to make government provide controversial and low-priority health service needs of women or to address specific health needs of men and sexual/gender minorities have been less successful, and even data on these areas is far too limited. Ultimately, legal equity (for women, marginalized men and sexual/gender minorities) in general and political equity (so that they gain positions of power and decision making in social institutions) are vital. 8. RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROMOTE GENDER EQUITY IN HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY To replicate good practices in addressing gender inequities in health and the economy and in addressing gaps in bridging these inequities and underlying issues of inadequate power, voice and agency the following recommendations are suggested: \u2022 Make human rights instruments work for gender equity in health and the economy in the region: The countries that have yet to ratify ICESCR, CEDAW and optional protocol of 76 CEDAW should be encouraged to do so at the earliest. UN agencies, donors and NGOs should national legislation and policies for conformity with these treaties (http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/3.htm). An Asia-Pacific Human Rights Court along the lines of Inter-American Human Rights Court should be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8ca84dd-8bc4-4371-895e-a7ea9ea474d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8ca84dd-8bc4-4371-895e-a7ea9ea474d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da42f90bcc434ed427b6888101ac4cc9e2efce38cc952c3915242b53171e82f3"}}, "hash": "da42f90bcc434ed427b6888101ac4cc9e2efce38cc952c3915242b53171e82f3", "text": "established in the region for those whose rights have been violated under these treaties to secure redress when governments fail to respect, protect or fulfill rights. \u2022 Strengthen legal accountability of government for gender equity and rights to participation, health and livelihood: All Asia-Pacific governments should be encouraged to pass legislation on the right to participation, health, gender equity and livelihoods. This will make it easier for women\u2019s rights groups and groups working for rights of sexual/gender minorities and marginalized men to demand that economic, health and gender rights be extended to them as well. \u2022 Strengthen powers, autonomy and capacities of women\u2019s commissions and national human rights commissions at the country level: Governments of Asia-Pacific countries should be encouraged to strengthen the powers of national commissions on women, so that they have judicial powers and are autonomous of ruling political parties. Their capacities to take up cases of violations of women\u2019s rights and pass gender aware judgments should also be strengthened. National human rights commissions should be encouraged to investigate cases of health and economic violations against sexual and gender minorities, and of sex-specific health rights of men. \u2022 Increase government allocations to health (including sexual and reproductive health) and increase public expenditure as a proportion of total health expenditure. Universal social health insurance along the model of Thailand should be promoted in other developing countries of the region. Bilateral donors for their part need to fulfill their commitments to health made at ICPD 1994 and the Millennium Summit. \u2022 Government and donors should move beyond cost-effectiveness and adopt a rights-based perspective in health priority setting: The essential service package to be provided free by governments, and funded by donors in some cases, should be based on the principle of rights of all to health (including sexual and reproductive health), rather than principles of cost-effectiveness, which has left out several controversial health services needed by women, men and sexual gender/minorities (e.g. safe abortion other than for sex selection, treatment for ill health due to gender-based violence, sex reassignment surgery) and services low on the priority list of governments which are nevertheless important (e.g. sex-specific cancer treatment). More attention on the part of governments and donors to health needs of men and male homosexuals beyond HIV/AIDS is required, including vulnerability to traffic accidents, tobacco use, substance use, and high alcohol abuse. \u2022 Government and multi-lateral agencies should evolve additional indicators to monitor gender equity in health, economy and distribution of power/voice/accountability for example, the proportion of land and housing owned by women, the proportion of women reporting domestic and public violence, access of men to prostate cancer screening, legalization of abortion and homosexuality, intra-household decision making power of women and men on health, the proportion of women in local self-governance etc. Specifically, data are needed on all the 46 indicators mentioned in this report on which cross country data is not available. 77 \u2022 Engender public health and public administration systems, and promote multi-sectoral research. Measures to engender public health systems would include increasing government allocation for engendering health research and clinical trials free from gender bias, creating gender-sensitive medical and health education and strengthening the position of women health workers. Measures to engender public administrative systems would include engendering national budgets, engendering national statistics, training civil servants on gender equity, and promoting action research to promote greater gender equity. Further, officials involved in public health and administration should be better informed of the relationship between gender [in] equity in health and gender equity in the economy. Positive examples of the mutually beneficial impact of gender equity in both sectors need better research and documentation. \u2022 Strengthen accountability of the private sector in health and the economy for gender equity in health and the economy. This could be achieved through better regulation of the private sector by government, making it compulsory for the private sector to abide by legislation pertaining to health, social security, employment and gender equity, and giving tax incentives to those companies that promote gender equity for the poor in health and the economy. \u2022 Improve economic, social and health security of those in the informal sector which will benefit all the poor, and women and sexual/gender minorities more than men, since they are engaged in the informal sector more than men. Implementation of employment guarantee schemes with equal wages, access to small and medium-scale credit (presently cornered by men), safe markets with gender-segregated toilets, health and accident insurance for workers and pension schemes for those in the informal sector \u2013 could all help strengthen gender and health equity in the long run. \u2022 Integrate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "669473b8-d184-4d96-8a4d-1b75cb895de0": {"__data__": {"id_": "669473b8-d184-4d96-8a4d-1b75cb895de0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "371271f6c2c9d59564f6dcc97a777a5c947b3854bbeb26003ca12cd312bf1f56"}}, "hash": "371271f6c2c9d59564f6dcc97a777a5c947b3854bbeb26003ca12cd312bf1f56", "text": "gender and health with economic interventions targeted at women and sexual/gender minorities: As attempted by BRAC in South Asia, health insurance, gender and health awareness and awareness of health entitlements may be added to economic programs targeted at women. There is a great potential for doing this given the scale of women\u2019s micro-finance self-help groups in the region. \u2022 Integrate economic empowerment into health interventions targeted at women and sexual/gender minorities. This could take the form of special economic interventions with women in households where rates of anemia are high amongst females and where domestic violence persists, with single women and their daughters who are vulnerable of trafficking, and with sexual/gender minorities who are vulnerable to exploitation. \u2022 Initiate interventions through NGOs targeted at men and boys in households and communities (community leaders and religious leaders) that challenge dominant norms on masculinities (including on dowry, violent behavior and substance use) that harm their health and that of women; as well as lead to gender inequities in the economy, and address their sex-specific health needs. \u2022 Support programmes to strengthen voice and informed agency of women, sexual/gender minorities and men who challenge dominant masculinities at local, district, provincial, national, sub-regional and regional levels. The model adopted by ARROW and its partners through WHRAP could be broadened and extended to other countries and to 78 include sexual/gender minorities and men who challenge dominant masculinities. The organizations representing the above groups should hold the government, donors and markets accountable from below for implementing international and enlarged national laws and policy commitments. Overall, equity in two important spheres is important for the achievement of gender equity in health and the economy: gender and legal equity and gender and political equity. Legal equity refers both to formal laws that are enacted in Parliament and to informal customary laws that are determined by community norms and leaders. Political equity does not mean equity in participation and decision making only in formal political processes, but also in informal ones -- at the household, community and economic organization level. An overarching recommendation is that gender equity at these two levels is promoted by governments, donors and civil society actors. 79 Technical note 1 Definition of Indicators Adolescent Fertility Rate: The age-specific fertility rate for females ages 15-19, which is expressed as the annual number of births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 (WH0 2006b).

Although it has a low mortality rate, schistosomiasis often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs and, in children, impair growth and cognitive development. The urinary form of schistosomiasis is associated with increased risks for bladder cancer in adults.[1] Schistosomiasis is the second most socioeconomically devastating parasitic disease after malaria. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis] xv Elaborated in Section 4.1.1. xvi Though women may also be suffering from sexual dysfunction this has been much less researched. xvii The Global Gender Gap report has arrived at the female to male ratio of Health Life Expectancy Ratio of 1.06 by using the computations used by UNDP for calculating the Gender Development Index, which used a maximum of 87.5 years for females ad 82.5 years for males (World Economic Forum 2008, see page 24). xviii The greater vulnerability of females than males to contract STIs from infected partners is due to the greater surface area of mucous membrane exposed during sexual intercourse, greater infectiveness of semen, greater exposure to a larger quantity of infected fluid (WHO 2003b; Sen et al. 2008). xix The lone territory on which no data on Infant Mortality Rate was available from the World Health Statistics 2008 was Hong Kong, China (SAR)(WHO 2008a). xx The lone territory on which no data on Under-five Mortality Rate was available from the World Health Statistics 2008 was Hong Kong, China (SAR)(WHO 2008a). 96 xxi There was no data on Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth (2002) for Hong Kong, China (SAR), or gender differentials therein, in the World Health Statistics 2008 (WHO 2008a). xxii There was no data on Adult Mortality Rate (2006) for Hong Kong, China (SAR) in the World Health Statistics 2008 (WHO 2008a). xxiii The issue of how gender and sex interact to lead to greater obesity is not included in the main text, as it affects a small section of the population as of now. Sex differences (fat collects more easily on adult females than males) and gender norms (restrictions on women\u2019s mobility, women\u2019s time to exercise, and work force participation) together lead to higher obesity amongst adult females than males in all of the 16 countries on which data was available from the World Health Statistics 2008.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a965166-548a-4d00-a845-8c31d7bb681c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a965166-548a-4d00-a845-8c31d7bb681c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23cf25e5b4b4a748296d3a11d569140d2641183f10412c5f4a3038c6732e10f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "d96d0a01-ec11-48f4-a98e-b200ed73a6df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/03", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "109d949ac8c8f07ff747f1af2e333e6cdb74a41f5fe6ed4b5d48cb77cbecd582"}}, "hash": "211e55446f23213a795b546d303c3c62fafbb5cce710a90d6b5a548884eab459", "text": "The countries include China, Japan, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, India and Islamic Republic of Iran (WHO 2008a). xxiv The ICPD+5 sets a target of improved access to antenatal care and 80 per cent access to skilled birth attendance by 2005.

The analysis addresses two views that are widely held in the Pacific: 1) that gender is biologically determined, and 2) that culture is a sacred template should not be meddled with. Both these notions have attracted sound scholarly consideration in the Pacific, which has shown that rather than either being fixed, gender is socially constructed and culture is constituted by contemporary milieu as much as it is by its traditional and historical genealogy. Key words: culture, human development, Pacific, gender equality The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States. This paper was commissioned by the Human Development Report Unit as a technical background paper to inform the Asia-Pacific Human Development Report, \u201cPower, Voice and Rights\u201d.

To understand these kinds of cultural impressions for the purpose of ensuring gender equality and human development in the Pacific, a dynamic reading of both gender and culture are needed. Behind each of these activities, lie more complex realities. A closer analysis of these realities reveals a constant negotiation of social relations and an intricate entanglement of formal and informal institutions. The results of these negotiations could produce different effects at different times and different places. Most importantly, closer analysis reveals ways in which unequal voice and power is constantly being transformed. This paper is premised on an understanding of culture as a way of life as expressed by anthropologist Anna Tsing: \u201cculture\u201d in its most coercive, simplistic form: a way of life that draws us in, ready or not, sensible or not\u201d (Tsing 2005, 40). This understanding coheres with gender and development scholar Susie Jolly (2002, 8) who understands culture as \u201cways of life structured by power and representation\u201d. Jolly (2002, 8) notes that this is a \u201cuseful lens through which to uncover the dynamics and relations of power through which cultural norms gain their impact\u201d. Taking this approach it is possible to better understand the power dynamics involved in supporting or challenging cultural practices that impact woman\u2019s human rights. The analysis of culture is rightfully left to scholars of anthropology. This is especially so given the flourishing of recent critical ethnographies and critical reflexivity on the genealogy of anthropology\u2019s own complicity with imperialism, colonialism and development. Further, rights based development work is often challenged from cultural relativist positions that argue for respecting anything because \u201cit\u2019s the culture\u201d. Anthropology, as a discipline, now widely recognises that cultures are fluid 4 and changeable and that all cultures are simultaneously part of history and entangled in other cultures in an increasingly interconnected world. However, it is possible to identify many other scholarly disciplines usefully appropriating anthropological", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cace3eb8-d198-4c13-aaaf-d33f92428a97": {"__data__": {"id_": "cace3eb8-d198-4c13-aaaf-d33f92428a97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f895917c74cf27ee0452ecd6fa7953725d3cf717cb3f52ab3d9a6f3dc18c0fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "d91c72b0-e997-4252-af2d-b6cc15035ab0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "392074de0d65a356ae33e07d917b7d60e2670a6d4c4d9e7b72eb52cd47245ccd"}}, "hash": "48e7e21486eef41f323614ffc529e94f8da501c5652012c2f3607ffabaa089d7", "text": "concepts in deployment of their own arguments. One particular relevant example for this paper is way that economists are engaging more critically with the concept of formal and informal institutions from a cultural perspective (OECD 2007). In turn, applied anthropologists have another hook upon which to reign in and affect change in policy. To be effective, policies must be able to be implemented and this requires the identification of implementation entities. Formal institutions, with a juridical mandate, regulatory tools and often with a mandate to legally enforce policies, are important implementation entities. However, formal institutions are closely entangled with informal institutions, which are embedded with cultural values like trust, solidarity and equality. This paper delivers its analysis based on critical studies of gender and culture in the Pacific through this framework of \u2018entangled institutions\u2019. Working with a dynamic understanding of gender and culture in a region as diverse and geographically dispersed as the Pacific underlines an important caveat: generalisations about the region or its sub-regions, and undifferentiated reference to women as a single group is flawed. These practices conceal the more exciting possibilities for advancing women\u2019s equality and overall human development. Taking a more dynamic understanding also relaxes expectations of being able to provide a comprehensive survey. This is not an evasive technique. Rather it is allows for a closer reading of situations and a greater vigilance in applying policy interventions that work with accepted norms, especially those relating to the promotion of universal human rights for women. Rather than working with simple dualistic understandings of good and bad, positive and negative, this paper argues for the need to understand the broader contours of social transformation that leads towards fair and safe societies. This is not easy given the external environment that affects the Pacific, for instance Western popular culture, climate variability and global economic crises. However, while there is no doubt that social transformation is happening, we need to be able to navigate the diverse terrain upon which this transformation is moving so that universal human rights are not left out. 5 Politically, this is a critical shift in thinking that has implications for policy development in many areas. It encourages a clearer focus on the power dynamics behind how social relations are negotiated: precisely who is negotiating over what and with what results. All negotiations take place in complex constellations of power wherein all players have some power, even if it is the power to be silent, to actively resist, or to be forceful. Analysing these negotiations in the Pacific region shows how different ways and means of ensuring unequal voice and power can be more constructively addressed. Because we are working with dynamic concepts of culture and gender, the task of understanding the relationship between the two requires thinking in motion. Many people insist on taking direction from particular canons of truth, yet they stumble analytically as they search for ways of keeping people \u2018on track\u2019. In this paper, broad generalised views are avoided and are replaced with more deeply nuanced analyses of particular issues. This ensures that our understandings of gender and culture are clearly situated in place and time, without resorting to cultural relativism. Sometimes, in practice, this requires careful strategic positioning by women\u2019s movements but this is always done cognisant of the shifting micro-physics of power. Understanding Specific Regional Dynamics It is always worth repeating that the Pacific is a large and diverse region, geographically covering one third of the planet and comprising 20 to 30,000 islands (McCall 1996) grouped into 22 Pacific Island Countries and Territories1 (PICTs) with a combined land area of 550,000 km\u00b2 and combined population of 8 million people (SPC 2009). Spread across 29 million km\u00b2 of the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific region also includes the combined Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) which covers 15 million km\u00b2.

Diversity is also evident in the socio-cultural characteristics of the region. Papua New Guinea comprises many different socio-cultural groups within its 462,000km2 land area and 5.7 million population divided into over 800 distinct language groups. On the other hand, Niue, with about 1,800 inhabitants, and Nauru at just 24 km2 in land area, are comprised of just one socio-cultural group, although with a scattering of new migrants, and with a more sizeable disapora living in Australia and New Zealand. The Pacific is routinely divided into three sub-regions that evolved from colonial classifications of the racial-cultural nature of the inhabitants and the geomorphologic type of island. Melanesia in the western Pacific was understood to comprise large resource rich islands inhabited by dark \u201csavage people\u201d (Linnekin 2004, 8); Micronesia in the Northern Pacific was inhabited by people of fairer complexion living on scattered small islands and atolls with limited terrestrial resources but diverse marine resources and, Polynesia in the east was inhabited by \u201csensual hospitable people\u201d (Linnekin 2004, 8) also of fairer complexion but living on many and different kinds of islands with a variety of terrestrial and marine resources. Attached to these racial cultural groups were different forms of social organisation related to the nature of appropriating and distributing resources. In the East, social organisation was broadly distinguished by governance systems of inherited leadership such as chiefs, while in the West, leadership came about through earning rights to govern, such as \u2018big men\u2019 in Papua New Guinea (White and Lindstrom 1997). The connections between race, the nature of leadership and the appropriation and distribution of resources had particular implications for understanding gender relations, many of which survive into the contemporary understandings of difference in the region. Crudely, one commonly held opinion is that women in the more \u2018savage-like\u2019 Melanesian countries have a lower status than men because they are 7 regarded as a resource that can be bought and sold, i.e. with bride price. Notwithstanding the abundant evidence of women\u2019s inequality in the western Pacific, this crude analysis reveals a gross misunderstanding of the complexities of gender relations. Numerous ethnographic accounts reveal highly sophisticated practices of exchange of valuable items between men, including their sisters and daughters, which serve to further strengthen bonds between brothers and sisters (Busse 2007). More than anything the simplistic accounts of bride price, bride wealth and marriage exchanges exposes contemporary prejudices against \u2018Melanesian countries\u2019, and often diverts attention from more systematic practices that belittle many women in the Pacific in the contemporary era. It also diverts attention from the demanding but highly valued and critically important work done by women in many subsistence- based economies in the region. The sub-regions of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia have gained widespread currency in the Pacific, but their racist underpinnings and the growing scholarly evidence of other ways of understanding the diversity of different groups of people in apparently homogenous populations, such as for instance Melanesian Samoans (Liki Chang-Tung 2007) or Chinese Papua New Guineas (Nelson 2007), are challenging this orthodoxy (Thomas 1999; Jolly 2008; Linnekin 2004). However, recent political entities have appropriated these terms to make a critical statement of sub-regional identity as in the Melanesian Spearhead Group. With regionalism in the 21st century undergoing significant shifts (Fry 1997; Slatter and Underhill-Sem 2008) it is important to keep in mind the politicisation of cultural boundaries. Although it is clear that new labels are emerging to describe the \u2018sea of islands\u2019 that comprises the oceanic continent of the Pacific (Hau\u2019ofa 1993), in the paper, we work with geographical regions as much as possible as a way to liberate \u2018the discursive field so that the task of imagining alternatives can commence\u201d (Escobar 1995, 4). At times where we do employ these categories in this report, like Linneken (2004), we reject any notions that these categories equate to race, that they are fixed and that they represent some authentic cultural core. Another important way of grouping countries in the Pacific is to refer to the particular geo-strategic location and colonial history.

In the last two decades, various Pacific countries have faced the growing frequency of extreme climate events like hurricanes, the increasing devastation of natural disasters like floods, the complexity of political instability, the growth of emigration, of trade liberalisation, and of fluctuations in commodity prices. This is all laid on top of geographic isolation from major markets and the resulting high freight costs, the lack of economies of scale, a scarcity of local manufacturing capacity, growing unemployment and increasing rates of urbanisation (Naidu 2006). While the region\u2019s combined GDP was projected to grow by 4.5 per cent in 2008, up from an average of 2.8 per cent between 2005-2007 ( European Commission 2008; Naidu 2006), there are real causes for concern especially in the current global financial crisis. The Pacific is culturally rich and diverse, home to one fifth of the worlds languages, the majority of which are found in Papua New Guinea, with the South West Pacific particularly culturally heterogeneous in comparison to the rest of the region (Hunkin and Mayer 2006). The majority of Pacific people still live in rural areas engaged in subsistence lifestyles, though there are growing populations in urban and peri-urban settings. Low life expectancy, especially of women, poor human development indicators, low literacy rates and education outcomes depict the Pacific as a place where both infectious and life style diseases prevail. Lifestyle diseases such as high rates of diabetes, sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS co-exist with malaria, dengue and tuberculosis. HIV/AIDS rates reach epidemic levels in parts of Papua New Guinea, and the disease is also spreading at high rates in other nations (Gani 2008). The most at risk group is young women, but there are also high risk activities among groups such as sex workers and those involved in non-heterosexual activities, including men who have sex with men (MSM). 9 The majority of the Pacific is Christian, with significant Muslim and Hindu populations in Fiji, however there is a growing influence of Pentecostal and fundamentalist conservative Christian religions. Historians of religion in the Pacific, such as Swain and Trompf (1995) conclude that women rarely achieve leadership status in religious groups, unless they are from chiefly groups, where rank is more important than gender, or matrilineally organised societies. Often these two traits go together in the eastern Pacific, where sacred women were highly powerful (Gunson 1987). Swain and Trompf (1995) find little evidence of women leaders in religious organisations in the western Pacific. The embedded patriarchy and hierarchy of religious groups in the Pacific are often called upon to reinforce waning tendencies to subordinate women, as they are seen to have more power in the secular economic realm. In the contemporary context, understanding the influence and role of religious teaching and religious institutions within a framework of human rights for women is a challenge (Madraiwiwi 2006). While the situation differs from place to place, gendered issues like the prevalence of violence against women, the extent of polygamous behaviour and the notion of women\u2019s subordination can be seen to rest upon the widespread paradox that women have considerable power, so much that it challenges men\u2019s power often to the extent that they feel the need to violently control women. This is an issue that has been recognised by religious training institutions in the Pacific, but only recently has this been actively addressed. This is evident at a major theological school in Samoa that teaches Christian ethics and contemporary issues and in 2007 introduced a programme for the theological education for women, specifically for students\u2019 wives (author\u2019s personal communication with Rev Professor Perelini, Malua Theological College). PART ONE Culture, Gender, Continuity and Sexuality: Dynamic Definitions in Dynamic Times Many scholars have engaged in long and heated debates over the ideas behind culture and gender. There are two related claims that continue to be strongly contested. First, that gender is socially constructed, not biologically determined, and therefore is not unchangeable. Second, that culture \u2018never sits still\u2019 (Tsing 2005, 25) because 10 \u201ccultures are continually co-produced in the interactions I call \u2018frictions\u2019: the awkward, unequal, unstable and creative qualities of interconnection across difference\u201d (Tsing 2005, 04).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f063e63b-a600-4683-bf91-8001dd6be151": {"__data__": {"id_": "f063e63b-a600-4683-bf91-8001dd6be151", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c99ae2129f2252fe299ef3c7e1bd5f320781a689065c742a6ce7ad5d33bfc4a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e1d928c-a1a2-482f-81c9-59eac4df3374", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f880a3f0c54d0f175a11c25ffbf4b949d9f4576d8e8a109e1e347b33016dbbd"}}, "hash": "fb17a3206fe4902fe586e02825d444d0cd409c90306c3df2a117bc904aa529ce", "text": "Cultures are constituted differently at different times and in different places and therefore cannot be generalised.

However, this understanding is still evident in contemporary policies and popular arguments worldwide and in the Pacific. As Sir Michel Somare, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, recently commented: \u201cI realise that not all my colleagues are keen to positively discriminate in favour of women or to even recognise the value that both genders can add to the development process. Sadly there are some whose minds are already made up on the rightful place of women in our Pacific Island societies\u201d.2 Holding onto a view that women\u2019s place in the Pacific is subordinate to men might be understandable given rapid social change and transformations in livelihood activities. At a global level, such rapid shifts in political and economic events percolate through all societies generating a sense of uneasiness. At more local levels, rapid shifts in food production, environmental changes and population dynamics also challenge the confidence of people to cope with new situations. There is no doubt that communities in the Pacific are living in challenging times, and during such times the appeal to hold onto something firm is strong. Providing a general sense of well-being and the ability to collectively say \u2018yes we can\u2019 is something some leaders are able to do with remarkable success. However, the other key reason for holding onto a \u2018template\u2019 view of culture and gender is evident in cases of acute inequality, which is case in parts of the Pacific. Clearly, the powerful have much more to lose, and in much of the Pacific men as a group are more powerful. Often, culture is called upon to support this status quo around unequal power relations, thus careful interventions are needed to ensure progressive social transformation. 2 Press release source: http://www.forumsec.org.fj/pages.cfm/newsroom/press- statements/2008/nations-of-pacific-need-have-both-genders-parliament--sir-michael.html 11 There are two other thorny conceptual matters that merit discussion. First, because culture is highly valued for its links to the past, debates over the authenticity of culture is hotly contested (Jolly 2008). In the Pacific region, debates were recently aired following the Festival of Pacific Arts in American Samoa in 2008. In addition to the reported vibrancy of the Pacific cultural festivals (Chinula 2008), other frictions of difference around authenticity and respect for other groups were also evident (Ragogo 2008). Among other things, this highlights the difficulty of dealing with cultural continuities in rapidly changing social, economic and political times. It also highlights the difference between culture and tradition that is performed in special events and festivals, which are not the focus of this paper, and the everyday ways of living which that are expressed in routine performance. A separate project is required to examine the gendering of culture that manifests itself as, for instance, visual art, tattooing, tapa making, tivaevae making, weaving, singing, and dancing, all of which say something about the circumstances of everyday life. The second knotty issue concerns sexuality. The breadth and complexity of issues of sexuality highlight the importance of explicitly bringing sexuality into development discussions including those around the impact of culture on gender equality. As the UN Rapportueur on the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Heath, Paul Hunt (2008:1) cogently notes \u201cwhat is unnamed is more likely to be unsupported, ignored and misunderstood.\u201d Debates over the existence of sex work, abortion and same sex relationships increasingly appear in local and national news alongside more long- standing concerns such as teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and rape. Although there are those who consider these topics to be embarrassing and best left to individuals, families and churches to deal with, increasingly the significance of sexuality to development is becoming apparent. There is no doubt that the HIV/AIDS crisis brought the discussion of sexuality onto the public stage in the Pacific. The proliferation of awareness raising activities around the crisis has flushed out the importance of better understanding the disease. Yet, strong opinions remain about the extent sexuality can be openly discussed. Although, the rhetoric in the Pacific is that we are \u2018naturally private people\u2019 and \u201cit goes against the normal practices of Pacific communities, where Christian principles and values are deeply etched into its culture and values\u201d (Lemisio 2008, 104), this is a gross generalisation that glosses over the 12 many and varied ways in which sexuality is clearly a development issue in the Pacific (Lukere 2002; Jolly 1994, 1996, 1997; Tengan 2002; Butt 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59284923-6cd9-4f0a-a3ba-669cde4ebe4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "59284923-6cd9-4f0a-a3ba-669cde4ebe4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1682e0055d5e8017fadce72d169f7453500c57a9e31276e041d75c8591a297d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac4ace6f-a670-454b-b4a6-b2ce64e85992", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b64b032144ec67dec5c6df4bd30f0f5e25c2a47444c4da9215c37946e1374ed0"}}, "hash": "1865c6ca49030f4d2b878d267764341c5498d376b695ce7f54e2258c87e7a6c3", "text": "A major task looms in moving from the implicitly heteronormative debates that underlie much discussion about culture and gender in the Pacific.

In relation to Pacific masculinities, Tengan (2002) shows that because people are often situated in multiple complex ways, they are able to draw on dominant gender constructs for contradictory, even subversive purposes. Besnier (2002) shows how transgender performances in Tonga rest on tensions between local and trans-local identities and, like Raiskin\u2019s (2008) work in Samoa, signals the existence of alternative gender constructs. However, in the process, traditional cultural practices of gender are delineated and through the transgressions made by fa\u2019fafines (which means \u2018men who are like women\u2019), the boundaries women must respect are revealed and reinforced. One way to handle the dynamic interaction of gender and culture is to work from a perspective of entangled institutions with intersecting interests of rank, race, class and gender. While it is possible to recognise that some of these intersecting points are more fixed than others, such as rank, the concept of intersections allows for more complex analysis that deepens understandings of the nature of the relationships between different groups of people. Culture and Gender in the Pacific \u201cIt feels like nothing so much as \u2018culture\u2019 in its most coercive, simplistic form: a way of life that draws us in, ready or not, sensible or not\u201d (Tsing 2005, 40). \u201cThe challenge of cultural analysis is to address both the spreading interconnections and the locatedness of culture\u201d (Tsing 2005, 122). 13 These two quotes deftly raise the contradictory tendencies evident in the discussion of culture in the Pacific. On the one hand, culture is such a part of daily life that, everyone is part of it, intentionally or not. Rarely are cultures closed to the influences of other cultures, yet we are more likely to privilege some more than others. For instance, the refrain still widely repeated in the Pacific - that feminism is a foreign flower - stand in stark contrast to the relative ease with which sports such as rugby have captured the everyday lives of many people in the Pacific. In spite of these contradictions, where the gendering of preference for \u2018external influences\u2019 is clear, there have been many notable instances of significant attempts to transform the impact of culture on gender in the Pacific. Clearly, culture is more than a sacred template that should not be interfered with. For instance, Gampat and Chambers (2009:58) point to the UNDP Human Development Report for Bougainville in Papua New Guinea, which clearly recognizes that \u201cculture is not monolithic\u201d and cultural imperatives do not characterize a whole society (ibid). Communities are diverse. There are likely to be some parts with its foot more in kastom or culture than in modernity, and vice versa. The evidence is that a sector or even cultural majority of the population accord women high respect. But this does not deny the Report\u2019s suggestion of a cultural imperative against women's advancement especially in public decision-making and negotiation in post-conflict society. Rather, it clearly speaks of competing cultural interest groups. And while contested ideas are the norm, there is no place for ambivalence regarding equity and women's choices. In most parts of the Pacific, social organisation is based on some sort of hierarchical principle that governs gender norms \u2013 women are subordinate to men, as are commoners to high ranking persons, the youngest to eldest lineages, and younger to older siblings. In many parts of the eastern Pacific, these hierarchical principles work in ways that make rank more important than gender. Although hierarchy is often more important that gender, especially in the eastern and northern parts of the Pacific where elder sisters take precedence over men in cultural matters and women can hold high rank with paramount titles. But in many other parts of the Pacific, this is reversed with women being explicitly treated as property to be transferred between kin groups. Much has been said about bride price, bride wealth and the diversity of exchanges that 14 take place between groups when people marry (Modjeski 1982; Busse 2007). Even within small geographical areas, there are distinct differences in the understanding of marriage exchanges \u2013 such that one universal is that negotiation is a fundamental feature (Strathern 1984).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2c0858d-bb2e-4e1c-bd79-0a26d9190073": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2c0858d-bb2e-4e1c-bd79-0a26d9190073", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "602592200dafcf84c781fc5a0d948a4e60b9bcf9dc5755a2e320b2f37422d553"}, "2": {"node_id": "7bc39755-fc7a-491b-a79a-43041cf14a32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1f678f9def62095d49cf72648c323c262ee6fe1ef8f4abada3221997f48ac27"}}, "hash": "be166d304db57805457fd308ff421a95b646344ccad96fb37eefc106efe60b40", "text": "For instance, in one area in Papua New Guinea, where the understanding is that once \u2018bride-price\u2019 (not a word translatable into the lingua franca) is completed, their daughter or sister or niece \u2018belongs\u2019 to her husband\u2019s family.

On-going negotiation between these two Christian influenced villages will continue, with perhaps not surprisingly, the husband\u2019s village having the last word. The enormous number of ethnographies of Pacific societies, especially in the western Pacific, has contributed significantly to deepen our understanding of culture and gender.3 Unsurprisingly, this has generated contentious debates and commentaries, especially around the themes of cultural identity, custom and representation (Chappell 1995; Hereniko 1995). These issues have and continued to be deeply probed and widely debated resulting in a vast amount of scholarly literature and, often more succinctly, poetry as Grace Molisa\u2019s memorable words: \u201cCustom misapplied bastardised murdered a Frankenstein corpse conveniently recalled to intimidate women the timid the ignorant the weak.\u201d (Molisa 1995) Molisa\u2019s poem eloquently insinuates that men have used custom or traditional ways, as a pretext for controlling women. In addition, many men do manipulate custom to gain power for their own benefit, but they do not silence women poets. 4 More recently, Samoan novelist Sia Figel moved away from the innocent island women of the colonial past to vividly depict a young girl\u2019s life in Samoa. As Crowl (2005, 192) notes, \u201cmore women than ever before are writing and published, adding their voices 3 See for instance the prolific writings of Marilyn Strathern, Jocelyn Linnekin, Penelope Schoeffel, Phyllis Herda and Margaret Jolly. 4 See Konia Helu Thaman from Tonga, Jully Makini from Solomon Islands, Nora Vagi Brash from Papua New Guinea, Arlene Griffen from Fiji and Makerita Va\u2019ai from Samoa. 15 to advocating what is of value in their societies\u201d. Looking specifically at Vanuatu, Jolly (1997) argues that while women were part of grassroots independent movements in Vanuatu, as in many other places, it was independence for men not for women. Understanding culture is about understanding how to keep in play a tendency to want unity, cohesion and structure at the same time as the tendency to want to be creative, inventive and free. Success in keeping these opposing tendencies in play is where cultural systems become important so that inventiveness and creativity are hallmarks of culture (Siikalla 2005). Finalising meanings and fixing expression goes against the logic of culture because culture is not the order but the ordering system that allows for contestation to be accomplished. This is the way it creates unity. Many parts of the Pacific are colonial creations (almost all nation states for instance, as well as the cultural areas of Melanesia, Micronesia and Melanesia) with significant internal variation and many common features. Many cultures are tradition-conscious and specialised experts are understood to be guardians of traditional knowledge. These specialists and guardians derive contemporary significance in the ancestor- oriented social structures in various ways, i.e. advice on land matters, kinship obligations, naming, rites of passage and conflict resolution. In the process, cultural categories are generated and continuity is assigned to some activities and practices. This is the creative, inventive and generative nature of cultural systems. It enables certain cultural themes to be embellished with significance and others to be played down. This process of ordering is not random, however. \u201cWho says what, how and when is the systematic result of the culture as a metacultural system that determines the significance of phenomenon. Thus it also generates the arrangement of people into groups or other kinds of social collectives and their mutual relationships\u201d (Siikala 2005, 281). When culture is understood as a script to be followed, the social action of an individual is the execution of the existing system and therefore not the responsibility of individuals. However, when culture is understood as a conceptual system that defines what is significant, then one can interpret something unforseen into the script. This can be seen in the many instances of women taking on new economic roles, controlling their fertility, or being invited to have a public role.

The mostly widely accepted understanding of gender in the Pacific is that men and women are traditionally cooperative in their livelihood activities. Men did more physical work in gardens, rivers and seas while women did the maintenance work in gardens and around sleeping and cooking areas. This also allowed them to nurture the younger, sick and older members of their family (Fairbairn-Dunlop 2005). This perspective is reinforced by Christian references to the complementary roles of men and women. However, this view is increasingly contested as a growing number of scholars provide ample evidence to the contrary, without renouncing their Christianity (Liki Chang-Tung 2007). Despite this scholarly evidence, the inclination to take this overview is pervasive as many documents from regional organisations report. This is both an injustice to women and men who, in their routine activities, are equally proficient and competent in physical and nurturing activities. Anthropologists have always taken an interest in one way or another in the reproduction of societies. It is often in this context that women\u2019s childbearing and lactating capacities are discussed. Because of the association of women with nature and men with culture, Rosaldo (1980) argued that women were restricted to child- oriented spheres while men were free to move in more public spheres taking care of more significant relationships. And because of Eurocentric notions of culture being of a higher value that nature, women were subordinate to men. A decade later however, Ralston (1990, 65) challenged the argument that women\u2019s reproductive functions \u201cled to their closer association with nature, while men were concerned with the reproduction of culture\u201d. 17 How this plays out in terms of legal struggles for collective and individual rights varies, but the struggle is about incorporating dissent in successful processes of continuity. This is especially so in the case of accessing resources, land ownership, law and justice. Pacific peoples are all interested in continuities, especially since such continuities continue to deliver the resources that people need. Genealogies and folklore for instance work to embrace a notion of culture that has relevance in contemporary times and with critical threads from the past woven carefully in. Yet this is one of the biggest challenges in the Pacific as it undergoes rapid social transformation of many aspects of life. Culture retains its contemporary relevance by ensuring that key threads from past times and places in time and space remain recognisable in contemporary practices. Gender has a contemporary relevance because it is a concept that allows for flexible interpretations of the power relations between men and women. It is open for changing interpretations while still remaining rooted to particular times and places. Both are constituted by an array of interests and the remarkable strength of both is that they carry with the desirability of continuity. Intersecting interests and entangled institutions The sobering recognition of the huge gap between aspirations for social transformation and the limited although important gains, urges greater conceptual and analytical clarity. Gender inequality has been more stubborn than anticipated and in many areas of life women\u2019s inequalities have worsened (see Appendix), not improved. This is the case despite legislative reform. There is still a pressing need to make those changes in political and economic realities to use new laws because gains in one sphere (more women working) have produced new forms of inequality (gender based violence). Despite an emphasis on democracy, women still have to fight to get their voices heard. Part of the problem is that the norms that reproduce this inequality rest on gender relations of power, which is why they are so hard to change. Recognising the interactions between formal and informal institutions is useful because it provides greater clarity around their complex entanglements. Not all formal institutions are 18 good for women. Lay-offs due to pregnancy \u2013 because of concern for the child \u2013 and then mothers only being reinstated at entry level is hardly progressive for women\u2019s human rights. And not all informal institutions are bad for women. For instance, informal wealth rotation among women provides otherwise unattainable credit. As feminist economist Gita Sen (2002, 3) argues, \u201conce we acknowledge that informal formal institutions (like formal ones) can have positive and negative elements when viewed from the standpoint of gender equality and women\u2019s rights, we can better understand how women themselves attempt to adapt them to their needs wherever is possible\u201d. This entanglement of institutions is evident in the following examples presented in Part Two.

The current global financial crisis will affect many economic transactions undertaken by governments, which will affect women\u2019s livelihoods. The extent to which informal institutions can moderate the impact will be telling. 19 PART TWO The Economic Crisis and the Pacific Geography and the nature of colonial history conspire to create a challenging context of Pacific Island economies. Challenging factors include inadequate and deteriorating infrastructure, high utility costs, shortages of government revenue and inadequate funding to public services such as health care, education, police and welfare. Despite high levels of remittances and aid, the risk of deindustrialisation through moves towards trade liberalisation, and the severe shortage of capacity to report on and implement international commitments are troubling (Naidu 2006). Economic growth in the Pacific is also highly volatile, reflecting a range of factors such as narrow economic bases, dependence on a few commodity exports (agricultural, forestry, fishing and minerals) being sold into often volatile international markets in which the PICTs are price-takers, the impact of natural disasters such as cyclones, and poor governance and political (and policy) instability (Stewart 2006, 96). Furthermore, individual economies have been facing their own challenges. For instance, Fiji faced an economic downturn following the December 2006 coup and continued political instability that impacted tourism. The storm and floods in January 2009 further undermined tourism activities. Combined with the loss of sugar preferences and rapid decline in the garment industry (Harrington 2000), Fiji\u2019s economy is not in the best shape. The transformation of Pacific economies in the face of global economic conditions is not new. However, each new shift results in further transformations in the process of negotiating access to resources. These negotiations require a reconfiguration of power, and because men as a group are able to exert more power over resources than women as a group, regardless of claims that women are culturally respected, rarely do women end up better off. On the contrary, in situations of economic stress in families, households and countries, the less powerful often bear the physical signs of this stress. 20 This is where an understanding of the impact on the current financial crisis is important. In general, the Pacific is considered to be \u201clargely isolated from the short-term instability in the global financial markets, [though] will experience negative impacts over time\u201d (Caparas et al. 2008:18). However, in 2008 while Pacific economies were already facing significant challenges through global price rises in fuel and food, they are now faced with the global financial crisis, brought about through the collapse of the subprime mortgage markets in the United States. This has had a domino effect around the globe and has led to an international crisis of confidence in global markets with significant impacts in the United States, the European Union (EU), China, Japan and Australia, as well as New Zealand. The flow on effects of the global financial crisis to the Pacific is likely to be experienced indirectly through five factors: the impact on offshore investments, remittances, aid, tourism and commodity prices (and the net impact trade). Instability connected with superannuation and trust investments offshore, or reliance on international equity or property markets will mostly affect countries such as Tuvalu and Kiribati that have become \u2018overly dependent\u2019 on draw-downs from their off-shore trust funds or Revenue Equalization Reserve Funds (RERF) (Caparas et al. 2008:18). Superannuation schemes are relatively protected as, where possible, the larger Pacific Island countries invest most superannuation schemes locally (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and the Solomon Islands) meaning schemes would only be indirectly affected through downturn in domestic growth. However, Papua New Guinea is more exposed through the onshore investments in mining, oil and other commodity based stocks that have decreased in price (Caparas et al. 2008:18). Conversely, where sufficient local investment opportunities are lacking, as in the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu, superannuation schemes that have been invested offshore, such investments are likely to significantly decrease in value through the crisis though will rebuild over time, as long as countries have avoided investing in now-failed entities (Caparas et al. 2008). 21 Loss of remittances due to economic hardship for the Pacific diaspora could be an issue for remittance dependent countries. However, ADB reports that there is \u201cresilience shown by remittances to the Pacific to changes in economic growth in neighbouring countries\u201d (Caparas et al. 2008, 18).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56d8b137-76d9-4c5e-83aa-e9742bbdcc62": {"__data__": {"id_": "56d8b137-76d9-4c5e-83aa-e9742bbdcc62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa28b3532cbf15145f519d712182266261593d00294ed6da4060f0599b0c8dd7"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9da6441-e106-4e13-83c8-fb802e04ca42", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39725348182a8092de7b239a0795645b7e290a6ba297169c36ef5b0ff81579bd"}}, "hash": "77d8dc3506df843f71fb8049b18d199d80aa9fcf47ee553090a56267938a4e0a", "text": "2008, 18).

In Tonga, 90 per cent of households receive remittances, and in Fiji, 40 per cent. Aid is still more important than remittances, though remittances have been growing at 36 per cent (annualised average growth), as shown in Figure 1. (AusAID 2008). Source: AusAID 2008 Declines in remittances have had an impact on household finances and this could have a variety of gendered impacts. As household budgets tighten, any cash expenditure will be restricted, with a potential consequence being children being kept back from school or tertiary studies. In some contexts, this will disproportionately impact girls. Figure 1 Remittance volumes 1997-2005 22 Less money to pay for transport can mean potential access problems to health care, markets as well as any items like medicine and fuel. Poorer households that have less cash will be hardest hit. Rural areas with food security are likely to be buffered through their resilience of subsistence agriculture. Urban dwellers with expenses for basic necessities such as rent, electricity, and water may face food security risks, with impacts on nutrition. Particularly at risk groups include those that do not have access to credit or the option to return to clan lands, the majority of whom are women. For women in rural areas this can mean increased responsibility of cash cropping on top of subsistence living requirements. For women in urban areas this could mean seeking additional informal economic opportunities to fund household necessities. There is already evidence of impoverished households in Kiribati resorting to the prostituting of girls to fishing boats as \u201ckorekorea girls\u201d for income, as well as reporting of prostitution in Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Tonga (Lemisio 2008). Urban squatter settlements or small rural settlements with tenuous access to resources are at risk of resorting to selling sex to supplement livelihoods. There is increasing discussion about risk to aid flows due to economic downturn in donor countries. Key donors in the Pacific are Australia, New Zealand, the United States the EU, and increasingly China. The Pacific receives high levels of aid relative to other developing countries worldwide as well as per capita in some countries (see Figure 2). Approximately one third of aid goes to Papua New Guinea, one third to states in compact of agreement with the United States, and one third to the rest of the PICTs (Sampson 2005). Australia and New Zealand account for half the aid to the Pacific, the majority of which is from Australia (90 per cent) and goes to Papua New Guinea (66 per cent of Australian aid). Almost all American aid to the Pacific goes to its former territories, and 10 per cent of aid comes from multilateral donors. The real value of aid to the Pacific has fallen by 40 per cent over the past 25 years (see Figure 3) (Sampson 2005). China\u2019s interest in the Pacific has grown exponentially from an aid budget of US$33million in 2005 to US$78million in 2006 and then to US$293million in 2007, or between US$100-150 million if concessional loans are excluded. This was more 23 than New Zealand's aid budget for the Pacific, but was less than Australia's, which was US$560million in 2006-07 (Powell 2008).

Figure 3 Aid as a percentage of GDP (2000-03 average) Source: Sampson 2005. 24 Aid is more significant to Western Pacific countries as they do not have the same volume of remittances as the Eastern Pacific. Aid is a significant factor in Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Samoa and Tonga. The Asia Development Bank notes that while aid flows will decrease due to currency devaluation from Australia and New Zealand, as the main donor countries, this is offset by the fact that most imports of goods and services funded by aid come from these countries, so roughly the same volume of goods and services will be accessible (Caparas et al. 2008) Gender impacts from cuts to aid (aside from decreases due to currency fluctuations) could be significant as funds from Australia, New Zealand and the EU are responsible for the core gender initiatives in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a208e619-4f4b-438f-b8fe-725a65ffb086": {"__data__": {"id_": "a208e619-4f4b-438f-b8fe-725a65ffb086", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c61d95bd3b4e6daae059fefc6ded99ebaffa80573b44fe978e4b13035e2392a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3db13f69-6dd4-4144-b9d6-18fb0badcc6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20ed07b7cb02847f29a8b4861f5e9a44f81312b215cf38f06ba01d1fe6c55d3f"}}, "hash": "f679f5d623a0ade3060fd137830a740b048c87de6e0188cd76e68d37127658c6", "text": "Key institutions pushing the gender agenda in the region are SPC which has a regional reach, and is predominantly funded by AusAID and NZAID grants (see Annual Reports of SPC).

There may be decreases in tourism due to economic hardship in key tourist markets, particularly Australia, New Zealand, Asia, the EU and the United States. Tourism is driving growth in Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Cook Islands and Palau (see Figure 4) (AusAID 2008). \u201cIn 2005, tourism accounted for 49 per cent of GDP in Palau and 47 per cent in Cook Islands, and for 18 per cent of employment in Vanuatu and 13 per cent in Fiji\u201d. (AusAID 2008). ADB reports that visitor arrival numbers from Australia and New Zealand show greater sensitivity to events in the Pacific (political instability, or coups) than changes in their home economies, unlike visitors from Asia which fluctuate with economic climate (Caparas et al. 2008). 25 Source: AusAID 2008 Tourism comprises a significant proportion of GDP for both Fiji\u2019s and Samoa\u2019s economies (AusAid 2008) Drops in tourism numbers could mean job losses, loss of revenue for supply sectors such as agriculture, transport, retail and handicrafts. Reorienting of the tourism sector towards budget travellers is another possible implication of economic downturn in client economies. There are gender implications in employment loss in the tourism sector itself, where considerable numbers of semi-skilled women workers are employed as administration, cleaners, and for cultural entertainment services, as well as in cash cropping and farming industries that hotels use for supply of raw foodstuffs. The cultural handicraft and retail industries will be impacted by decreased tourist numbers, or \u201clower yield\u201d budget tourists. Traditional handicrafts are sourced at the village level, so has a direct impact on women\u2019s pockets and as a source of household income. Finally, the main overall impact of the global financial crisis is likely to be decreased government revenue, particularly in Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru. Papua New Guinea will suffer because it has enjoyed commodity Figure 4 Growth of tourism in selected countries, 1999-2007 26 price rises over the last few years, serving as the main driver of economic growth. For Tuvalu and Kiribati, government revenue comes, in approximately equal measure, from tax revenues, fish licensing, Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) and other non-tax revenue sources, such as aid (Ferguson and Sugden 2008). In the Cook Islands, decreases in government revenue may push back plans to borrow to repair and maintain deteriorating infrastructure, which would hamper tourism as well as local supply of utilities (Ferguson and Sugden 2008). The gendered impact of this further reduction in government revenue may be severe in some Pacific countries where structural adjustment policies have already instituted stringent financial policies. Government revenues have already been eaten away through various measures of economic liberalisation including reduction in tariffs and taxation. The global financial crisis has also resulted in fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly for key Pacific exports in minerals and agriculture, as demand drops in market uncertainty. Historically high commodity prices have driven economic growth, especially in minerals for the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea over the last three years, however now it is a point of vulnerability: With a banking and finance sector devoid of the toxic debt instruments that has been the source of international woes, Papua New Guinea\u2019s only major exposure is to falling revenue receipts on the back of lower prices for commodities (Nasfund 2009). While PICTs are experiencing relief in lower fuel prices, which may have a positive flow on the affects in tourism and manufacturing, much is offset by the drop in commodity prices of exports, as well as strengthening Pacific currencies against trading partners, particularly New Zealand and Australia. Falls in revenue from minerals will mostly impact government and foreign interests, however falls in agricultural export revenue will impact women and rural areas, particularly in PNG, where women have a strong hold of small markets as a way to generate cash for family and domestic needs, especially school fees. Advice to governments has been to \u201ctighten their belts, and improve revenue collection\u201d (Pacnews 2008,1). All this spells risk for those vulnerable and marginalised populations in the Pacific who have less power to negotiate better access 27 to resources. Strained economic times provide real challenges to uphold the important cultural principles identified in the Pacific. Caring for all members of one\u2019s family or wider household can put added strain on low-income earners. Honouring long- standing cultural exchanges and participating in reciprocal social engagements requires continued access to a wide variety of resources from cash to food that may be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46af885e-9a9f-4129-8576-2f223a27834f": {"__data__": {"id_": "46af885e-9a9f-4129-8576-2f223a27834f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e1faf7b6fbfe1574d4ed9b56b9c611eae3955f55a19353ce94ce2532fcd0a77"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7339535-e435-414b-9fd5-ac3ff9e5d04b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc68700a0ae668d49b321e1649973486fb2a5a0e87bb78496f872960e113441c"}}, "hash": "6487f7cd7ef8d280e11bfcbf52eed4316147fc35281ba0c7ec192da9434b5e71", "text": "receding. On the other hand, culturally sanctioned activities like sharing excess garden or marine food and contributing more to collective in-kind activities have in the past contributed to the resilience of many pacific communities. This is particularly so where there is a high level of food security, as in the western Pacific. However, this culturally inspired economic resilience is challenged in the face of transformations also occurring in the area of human security and the growing frequency and intensity of severe weather events. Women\u2019s Seats in Papua New Guinea's Parliament Papua New Guinea is the most recent country in the world to experiment with the use of policy instruments to facilitate women\u2019s participation in parliament. Policies on temporary special measures, such as reserved seats for women or party quotas, are already being used in the Pacific in Bougainville, New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Fortuna. (Clark and Rodrigues 2008). A successful example of the use of temporary special measures is Rwanda, which reserved 30 per cent of its parliamentary seats for women in 2003. At the time this paper was commisioned, 56 per cent of parliamentarians in the Rwandan legislature are women. The 30 per cent threshold is not a final goal, but is a percentage at which women in a legislature have been seen to achieve a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of influence (Clark and Rodrigues 2008:91). Over 10 years ago in 2000, the Women in Parliament programme (PNGWIP) in Papua New Guinea, put forward in a policy submission on the Organic Law of Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates, for a 30 per cent quota for women candidates. The result was that a provision was created for one woman to be nominated by any one political party (UNIFEM 2003). This clearly has not happened, thus in 2003, a new initiative emerged based on the constitution. It is intended to serve as an interim measure until an Organic Law on Gender Equity (which will include provision for reserved seats by elective process) is in place for the 2012 election (Post Courier 2008). 28 Historically, Papua New Guinea has had very low participation of women in formal decision making structures, especially parliament. With a population of 6.3 million, 109 constituencies and 109 legislators, Papua New Guinea only has one woman member of parliament, resulting in the percentage of women in parliament being 0.9% and one of the lowest in the Pacific (see Table 1) (Clark and Rodrigues 2008).

Three women first contested parliament in 1964. In 1972 there were 4 candidates and 1 was elected. In 1977, three women were elected into parliament out of the 10 candidates. Following a campaign to get women into parliament campaign in 1997, 55 candidates stood and two were successful (Sepoe 2002; Schoeffel 2004). In 2002, 75 of the 4,359 candidates were women, but only one made it into the National Parliament: Dame 29 Carol Kidu. In local and provincial government there have been however, over 1,000 women representatives (UNIFEM 2003).

The selection process began in late 2008 with 95 women registering themselves to be shortlisted to six, by a seven member panel of women. The shortlisted names will be submitted to Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare and Opposition leader Sir Mekere Morauta for deliberation and selection of the final three for nomination to parliament (The National 2009). This carefully considered move towards getting more women in Parliament has however met with some opposition on the grounds that these measures are undemocratic (Post Courier letters 28th May and16th December 2008). Technical concerns were also raised by constitutional lawyer Professor John Nonggorr who noted that the powers that the nominated person will exercise would need to be clarified by legislation and that if this is not done, major constitutional issues may be raised later on (ibid). Clearly, even once the three nominated women begin work in parliament, their powers are likely to be closely scrutinised. The provision for nominated women MPs is intended to last three years only, with the hope that there is special legislation for Reserved Seats for Women by the 2012 election (Kidu 2009). Reserved seating within the current constitution would mean 5 Section 101(1)(c) and Section 102 (nominated members) are the sections that allow up to three nominated positions, to be nominated by a two-third majority; respectively. 30 expanding the current parliament of 109 sitting members by 11 seats to 120, beyond which a constitutional amendment is required. To reach the 30 per cent threshold, the parliament would need approximately 41 additional seats to the existing 109 (Clark and Rodrigues 2008). Another option is to expand the number of seats in parliament, requiring a constitutional amendment. In Papua New Guinea, it has been suggested that consideration could be given to adding 20 reserved seats to Parliament, with one woman elected from each province, plus the National Capital District (NDC). This would result in women comprising 15.5 per cent of an enlarged Parliament of 129 members, well below the 30 per cent target. It would require 40 reserved seats, or two women from each province and the NDC, to bring the minimum percentage of women in the Parliament closer to this target, at 26.8 per cent (Clark and Rodrigues 2008:91). It is worth noting that Papua New Guinea has proportionately fewer MPs to constituents than other PICTs, with a ratio of one MP per 57,798 people. By comparison, the Solomon Islands has a ratio of one MP per 10,780 people, while in the Cook Islands the ratio is one MP per 687 voters (Clark and Rodrigues 2008). Therefore, to expand parliament would be entirely reasonable. Culture and power are significant factors in explaining women\u2019s participation in formal decision making bodies. Yet to reach the 30 per cent threshold of women in parliament, whether by expanding parliament or within the current system, would necessarily mean a significant number of voting constituents supporting female candidates. Historically, this has been difficult with a strong gendered bias against women in leadership positions throughout Papua New Guinea, even women do not vote for women (UNIFEM 2003). Statistics and the legacy of existing mechanisms are testament to the significance of cultural norms shaping women\u2019s participation. In the 2007 election there were 109 electorates, and 101 women candidates out of 2759 candidates (4 per cent). Out of the 101 women, 42 were endorsed by various political parties and 59 were stood as independents (Post Courier 2008). Papua New Guinea has a variety of programmes to improve women's participation in politics, such as having the longest operating 31 Women in Politics programme in the region started in 1993 (UNIFEM 2003). In 1995, Papua New Guinea's Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments was enacted allowing for one women\u2019s representative to be nominated in each of the 20 Provincial Assemblies and for two women to be appointed in the rural Local Level Governments and one in urban Local Level Governments as well (Huffer 2006; Sepoe 2006). However, the current electoral system is considered disadvantageous to women because the system itself gives rise to corruption and vote buying (UNIFEM 2003). The key challenges relate to addressing a very strong gender bias in social and political leadership. This can be seen in that women do not vote for women (UNIFEM 2003), 65 per cent of women are illiterate (UNIFEM 2003), and the women\u2019s department has been downgraded (Huffer 2006). Huffer (2006) further argues that the barriers and challenges facing women entering Parliament include male dominated cultural norms and societal values.

Societal stereotypes not only actively discriminate against women, though the promotion of particular gender stereotypes (the subordinate hard working wife and mother), the protection of male privilege in private space especially in relation to violent sexual behaviour, and the constant under-valuing of the work of women (Huffer 2006). So while the legislative and institutional framework is in place, entanglements with the informal institutions and the cultural values embedded in them dampened the otherwise progressive momentum towards addressing unequal power and voice. The Family Law Act, Fiji The successful campaign to institute the Family Law Act in Fiji is an example of achieving pro-women family law in the context of political instability, patriarchal society and religious conservatism. Pro-women law reform and instituting women\u2019s rights faced strong opposition from churches and conservative political actors: \u201cRace, religion, class and sexuality were all used to oppose changes to the family laws\u201d (FWRM et al. 2007, 16). Analysis of the campaign however, shows that actors 32 worked in a complex interplay between informal and formal institutions, to ultimately be successful after 12 years of work (Ibid) The campaign was able to achieve family law which is based on a no-fault principle of divorce, utilizes a non-adversarial counseling system and a specialist Family Division of the Court which prioritizes children\u2019s needs and parental support. It removes all forms of discrimination against women and grants them rights to enforceable custody and financial support for them and their children. It legitimates and requires recognition and implementation of the major UN human rights conventions affecting family law. From early results it appears that the new Fiji Family Law Act will substantially reduce the costly use of lawyers and Legal Aid (FWRM et al. 2007, 8-9). The content of the law reform objectives faced some serious opposition, particularly from the Methodist Church of Fiji, which is constituted by about 80 per cent of all indigenous-Fijians. There was considerable opposition from churches because of the fear that the bill would allow homosexuals to marry.6 In response, compromises were made including the exclusion of same-sex and de facto marriages. No fault divorce was also an issue because it was seen as \u201ca threat to Fijian patriarchal practices and religious beliefs\u201d (FWRM et al. 2007, 16). A survey conducted by FWRM found that there was a some misinformation and a significant level of confusion about the bill, so the campaign responded by continued engagement through materials and community consultation using indigenous vernacular (personal communication). The campaign was also marginalised structurally in that \u201cThe Government of Fiji was not, at that stage, and is still not ready to formally recognize the added value of working 'with NGOs.\u201d(FWRM et al. 2007,13). To work around this the campaigners (FWRM) established themselves as technically sound by working closely with the Regional Rights Resource Team. They also built their credible over seven years through close consultation with communities in rural and urban areas. They also forged strong relationships with key actors and institutions within the government such as the Office of the Attorney General, the Fiji Law Reform Commission, and the 6 For further information, please visit http://www.wluml.org/english/newsfulltxt.shtml?cmd[157]=x- 157-23006 33 Ministry of Women and Culture. Campaigners also strategically targeted sympathetic actors in various state institutions to gain insights on tactics delaying the law reform and how to assist with moving the law reform forward. Another key success factor in instituting the bill was the particularities of leadership and in especially the ability of the leader to negotiate contested spaces, using both formal and informal institutions. Navigating and performing culture is fundamental to this. In the 1990's, women's organizations in Fiji sought to \"emphasise the consonance between human rights values and custom. They referenced traditional ideas about the complementary nature of gender roles within customary practices\" (George 2008, 182), yet they also recognised that referring to these \"cultural protocols and beliefs systems...contributed to women's ongoing subordination\" (George 2008, 182). This kind of tactic was essential to establish credibility in a volatile patriarchal and militarized political context. While consistent funding over time necessarily underwrote a strong campaign that was technically proficient, well networked and had politically savvy leadership, it was ability to work with entangled institutions that ultimately resulted in success for gender equality. Religious Groups Empowering Women? Throughout the Pacific religious women\u2019s groups play an important social and spiritual role in the lives of many Pacific women. Such groups are perceived as conservative, and often discounted by development theorists and feminists alike as not empowering to women because of their welfare approach and focus on traditional activities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "739f507a-c4b6-4adf-9738-259a1db84e63": {"__data__": {"id_": "739f507a-c4b6-4adf-9738-259a1db84e63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4682a5125e86ecb94da869e0460a6d733e5f58b839262afd2338a520b8366248"}}, "hash": "4682a5125e86ecb94da869e0460a6d733e5f58b839262afd2338a520b8366248", "text": "such as sewing classes, pastoral care and social work (Scheyvens 2003). However, \u201cthis does not preclude women\u2019s groups from engaging in strategic activities for the empowerment of women\u201d (Scheyvens 2003, 24). In the post-colonial era, it is often asserted that the status of women had declined through the mix between indigenous and colonial institutions, especially through the institution of the church, which advocated for women to be domestic, not do burdensome work, with implications for gender power dynamics and the status of women in their communities (Scheyvens 2003). This does not do justice to the more sophisticated entanglements of both formal and informal institutions involved in the 34 practice of religious activities in the region. The church is an institution recognised across the Pacific. It is both indigenised (Douglas 2002), but it is also connected globally. It operated both as a vehicle for conservative patriarchal values and religious fundamentalism, but the church also provides a vehicle for promoting human rights and women\u2019s rights in particular. The principles of equality and peace are universal to all religious doctrines which is why churches are acknowledged for their role in conflict resolution and political crises (Douglas 2002) as well as having taken the lead on critical issues facing the region.7 The hierarchy of churches is mostly filled by men (Douglas 2002). It has traditionally been seen as \u201can arena for male power\u201d (Eriksen 2008, 99), but just as it cannot be assumed that women\u2019s organisations are necessarily avenues for women\u2019s empowerment (Sen and Grown in Scheyvens 2003), so too must we look at ways in which the church can become avenues for women's empowerment. As Scheyvens (2003) argues: The potential for empowerment comes through collectivisation of women. In addition to teaching women skills and involving them in the administration of the organisation, which builds their confidence and contributes to psychological empowerment, women\u2019s groups can contribute to social or political empowerment by providing a safe environment in which women can articulate their concern, develop solutions to their collective problems, and explore their potential (Scheyvens 2003, 28 ). Eriksen\u2019s study on Ambrym Island in Vanuatu (2008) found that the nature of power relations within the church, as communal, benefited women\u2019s status in the community through challenging male hegemony and opening new arenas in which women move and operate (Eriksen 2008). 7 Such as the World Council of Churches publication of A Peoples\u2019 Guide to the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union 35 Changing Gender Relations in Tari: Bride Wealth and Passenger Women Many Pacific communities are facing big changes that involve challenging cultural understandings of gender relations. This includes the spread of HIV/AIDS, economic changes, and labour migration in search of employment. In the Tari area in Papua New Guinea, gender relations changed in a significant and interesting way. A new dynamic was identified in a 2002 study that showed that some rural women were choosing to work as pasindia meri (\u201cpassenger-women\u201d or sex workers) due, not to economic necessity, but in response to their anger and frustration about male kin no longer upholding their customary obligations to them as women - especially after they had been raped (Wardlow 2002). Gender relations in Tari have been impacted by male labour migration to a nearby goldmine, which exacerbated frequent sexual liaisons between men and women who had no intention of marrying each other. This is tacitly tolerated to a large extent by most wives who remained at home in their villages. As in other places in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, in Tari, women\u2019s sexuality is connected to bride wealth. For example, a husband who has paid the bride wealth has the responsibility to protect his wife\u2019s honour. If she is raped, for instance, he is obliged to bring the case to the village court. One case is the story of a young woman who had been raped twice, and whose family had received reparation through the courts. At first the woman perceived this as solidarity from her family, but later she was angered and felt betrayed when her family who had received some of the compensation, refused to assist her with paying school fees, or to purchase other items such as soap or cigarettes. \u201cThe first time a man raped me I supplied 15 pigs for my father\u2019s family, and the second time a man raped me I supplied 15 pigs for my mother\u2019s family, but my relatives never give me anything\u201d (Wardlow 2002:144). In response, she decided to raise money as a passindia meri, reasoning that she did not need the money, but she wanted to punish her family by", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecd2aa66-27ba-4c54-957d-53ad5ce019f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecd2aa66-27ba-4c54-957d-53ad5ce019f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92af73ba0bf97b2d8289144a98ae8d24b4afbfc3622e7c76c0af3b5655ee92d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "6965beff-2dbf-4973-a115-8aea353e89f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/05", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6153239c27aeea0f7ec77c403362ce488476622945772f849b542596c57603e7"}}, "hash": "d07dfac8ddff107954f9f287df11df37b42d77791ca0b69e327bafcdfad2419b", "text": "depriving them of the bride wealth they were claiming by trading on her sexuality in the courts.

In similar stories, women in Tari who felt betrayed by their husbands and brothers have begun exercising the sanctity of their sexuality back on the men that have let them down by becoming pasindia meri and also through cases relinquishing \u2018womanly duties\u2019 such as gardening, caring for children, rearing pigs and even marrying at all, thus refusing to do the work of production and reproduction and thereby challenging both societal and economic power relations (Wardlow 2002). Though this case is complex and context specific to Tari (and should not be generalised to other parts of Papua New Guinea), it shows women\u2019s agency, and how gender power relations are evolving, first through male absence in society, their inability or refusal to fulfill customary obligations, and how this plays out in a particular context. Conclusion This paper has taken a non-traditional approach to understanding the complexity of gender and culture in the Pacific. As a complex and diverse region, which has attracted considerable scholarly work on this topic, there are many possible ways to deepen our understanding of unequal voice and power. The key messages from this paper are: \u2022 Gender and culture are not fixed, but are constituted by tradition and historical genealogies as much as by the contemporary miliue \u2022 Formal and informal instituions are entangled in ways that often allow particular agency for women \u2022 Sexuality needs to be a named part of culture in ways that make it inclusive of more than biological reprodution \u2022 Larger economic and political shifts need to be tracked for the challenges and opportunities they present for gender relations 37 References AusAID. 2008.

The study recognises four critical elements with GRB. First, mandatory earmarking of a certain percentage of budgetary allocation for women could only be no more than a second principle of gender budgeting. Second, homogeneous \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 gender budgeting policies set at the national level (top-down approach to GRB) cannot ensure gender equity in a heterogeneous nation. Third, increasing presence of women in governance (feminization of governance) can alter public expenditure decisions in the direction of the revealed preferences (\u2018voice\u2019) of women. Fourth, the advent of fiscal decentralization provides a logical entry point to manifest spatial mapping of gender needs; which is a step ahead of homogeneous \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 budget policies set at national levels. The paper analyses these elements broadly in the context of the Asia and Pacific region.

INTRODUCTION Gender budgeting is emerging as a significant socio-economic tool to analyze budgetary policies to identify their effects on gender equity. Gender budgeting does not mean making separate budgets for women nor is it confined to analysis of earmarked funds for programmes exclusively targeted for women within budgets. It refers to analysis of the entire budget through a gender lens to identify gender-differential impacts and to translate gender commitments into budgetary commitments. It enhances the transparency and accountability of revenue and public expenditure. Prima facie, the budget may appear to be gender neutral; but due to differences in the socially determined systemic roles played by women and men, budgetary policies have differential impacts across gender. As a consequence, gender neutrality of budgetary policies can turn to gender blindness due to the fact that the women and men are at asymmetric levels of development on the socio-economic scale. Gender budgeting is not \"women budgeting\"; rather, it is an analysis of budgets to ascertain the relative benefits (or losses) derived by each gender from a particular fiscal programme/project. Gender budgeting constitutes one among many macroeconomic policy tools to address gender equity; the prominent among other tools such as monetary policy, trade policy and financial deregulation policy. The discussion of gender budgeting in this paper is set within the overall framework of fiscal policy, and does not focus exclusively on public expenditure analysis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc0f4739-9748-4c0a-a59e-2a7c2e74c844": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc0f4739-9748-4c0a-a59e-2a7c2e74c844", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "987cd8deac3f55fcaff7a263f26c1952160cababdd343a9a9b44ae37e7b8cb00"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d23be70-fefe-4f6f-96d1-197eed926fb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce0ed7d995c559395c44b9d52ab454ec5911b088a3a41276c94214ca2a71db01"}}, "hash": "ce4e63968daf41a2bb50f9bba4fd880fb13780a070fba99c8d22e23b3dd4d0f7", "text": "The significant elements of fiscal policy viewed through a gender perspective are budgetary allocations, actual expenditure and taxation; fiscal decentralisation and ex-ante gender budgeting; fiscal devolution (intergovernmental fiscal transfers) and aid effectiveness.

The NIPFP study provides a gender diagnosis, a valuation of the statistically invisible care economy, and proceeds to analysis of budgets through a gender lens. It provides some selected indicators of the status of women in India, showing the degree of disadvantage especially in health, education and labour force participation and also evaluates the existing degree of gender inequality in the country, presenting an interesting application of Human Development Index (HDI), Gender Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) and its linkages with fiscal policy.2 1 NIPFP Working paper series: India (Chakraborty 2007); Mexico (Chakraborty 2006b); Morocco (Rao and Chakraborty 2006); the Philippines (Chakraborty 2006c); and South Africa (Chakraborty and Bagchi 2007). 2 Stotsky 2006. 4 In the same manner as these few studies, this paper also takes up the macro framework in which gender budgeting is analyzed within the overall context of fiscal policy and gender development. The paper takes the literature forward by identifying elements of equal power and equal voice intrinsic in the attempts at gender budgeting across Asian and Pacific countries rather than confining to the budget analysis through a gender lens in isolation from overall fiscal policy and the gender development framework. In the literature, gender sensitive budgeting and gender-responsive budgeting are used interchangeably; the same convention is adopted in this paper. The study recognises four critical elements with regard to gender-responsive budgeting (GRB). First, mandatory earmarking of a certain percentage of budgetary allocation for women could only be no more than a second principle of gender budgeting. Second, homogeneous \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 gender budgeting policies set at the national level (top-down approach to gender budgeting) cannot ensure gender equity in a heterogeneous nation. Third, increasing presence of women in governance (feminization of governance) can alter public expenditure decisions in the direction of the revealed preferences (\u2018voice\u2019) of women. Fourth, the advent of fiscal decentralization provides a logical entry point to manifest spatial mapping of gender needs; which is a step ahead of homogeneous \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 budget policies set at national levels. The paper will analyse these elements broadly in the context of the Asia and Pacific region. Technically, the process of gender budgeting involves a three-step procedure. First, an analytical framework is developed to analyze the \u201cgender intensity\u201d of existing budgetary allocations; second, to assess whether these budgetary allocations are being translated into specific results and outcomes that can be traced; and third, necessary modifications are made in budgeting classification and procedures to accommodate the changes, if any. This process assumes cross-sectoral policy dimensions, which require specific budgetary tools for gender mainstreaming, and monitor and quantify the desired outcomes in terms of gender. This process necessarily extends beyond the national level to sub-national levels, especially in the context of growing fiscal autonomy at the local level across Asian countries, and the increasingly effective presence of women in governance at lower levels. The gamut of gender budgeting experiences across Asian nations reveals that these range from apportioning a specific percentage of budgetary allocations for women and building budgets from below ex- post to identify local needs to attempts to change the budgetary accounting classification so as to mainstream gender in budgets. Gender auditing has also been used in several countries. The paper critically examines gender budgeting approaches in Asian and Pacific countries, against the backdrop of concepts of \u2018equal voice\u2019 and \u2018equal power\u2019. I.1 Rationale for Gender Budgeting The rationale for integrating a gender perspective into budgetary policy has two dimensions:: an equality dimension, and an efficiency dimension. Where there is increasing recognition that problems of inequality cannot be resolved by trickle--down effects of non- gender-aware macroeconomic policies, concerns for gender inequality need to be built into the macroeconomic policy framework. Apart from the basic principle of promoting equality among citizens, (the \u2018justice\u2019 dimension), gender equality can benefit the economy through efficiency gains.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5ff7ca0-5c51-48ca-a2a5-934a29aa3a51": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5ff7ca0-5c51-48ca-a2a5-934a29aa3a51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "982b83a2d31c375521f36dcceb52cd66b296e58b157ab499ada673011423d423"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8e0c280-a8a2-4aa3-865a-e5f32c28e37a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d7c386992c63a143fe401566231e907c62333bcc727cbd62a78c2ae4acc1be5"}}, "hash": "b6cf5dd2bbdc73206f608872cd8738a8b9f5a2274a316106c84fa60896171eea", "text": "From an efficiency consideration, what is important is the social rate of return of investment in women, which can be shown in some cases to be greater than the corresponding rate for men.

A rights-based approach, among other things, looks at the resource requirements (budgets) for human development. A rights-based approach provides values against which to assess budgets; it assists in choosing between different budgetary and policy options, and strengthens the demand for transparency and accountability.4 Last, but not least, the case for gender budgeting is based on the premise of ensuring transparency in the budgetary allocation for women, protecting these provisions from reappropriation and thereby enhancing accountability (\u2018voice\u2019). II. BRIEF HISTORY OF GENDER BUDGETING Worldwide there is a growing move towards the integration of a \u2018Sustainable Human Development\u2019 paradigm into the macroeconomic policy framework. This approach takes gender equality along with poverty eradication, environmental regeneration and democratic governance as its cornerstones.5 Among the logical entry points to such a paradigm shift has been gender-sensitive budgeting, pro-poor budgeting and environment-sensitive budgeting. As an outcome of the Beijing 1995 World Conference on Women, an international consensus document proposed the mainstreaming of gender concerns into macroeconomic policies. Against the backdrop of these developments, an attempt towards gender-responsive budgeting began in a number of industrialized and developing countries including Asia and the Pacific. Australia was the pioneer in developing a gender-sensitive budget statement, a decade before the Beijing Conference. In 1984, a comprehensive assessment of the gender- differential implications of a sub-national budget was introduced in Australia. It was found that expenditures specifically targeted to women and girls in South Australia made up less than 1 per cent of the total budget.6 In South Africa, gender-sensitive budgeting had two dimensions. A first phase was initiated in 1995, as a joint effort of parliamentarians and non- governmental organizations. This parliamentary-NGO initiative undertook a detailed gender- sensitive analysis of expenditure portfolios such as education, health, welfare, housing, labour, trade and industry, land affairs, agriculture, safety and security, transport, energy, foreign affairs as well as the cross-sector areas of public sector employment and taxation. A parallel initiative began in 1997 within the Department of Finance of South Africa, as a pilot for the Commonwealth initiative to integrate gender perspectives into expenditure policy. The Commonwealth Secretariat co-ordinated the implementation of gender-responsive budgets in Barbados, Fiji, St. Kitts and Nevis, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. Though the nature of gender responsive budget initiatives varies from country to country, one of the prominent features of the Commonwealth Secretariat initiative has been the direct engagement and co-ordination of the programme by Ministries of Finance (with the exception of some less-than-successful pilots such as that of Fiji).7 3 UNDP 2008. 4 For details on GRB using a rights-based approach, see Hewitt and Mukhopadhyay 2002. 5 \u00c7a\u011fatay et al. 2000. 6 Sharp and Broomhill 1990. 7 For details, see Buddlender et al. 2002. 6 In Mexico, UNIFEM in 2003 persuaded government to earmark 0.85 per cent of the total national budget for programmes to promote gender equality. Subsequently, 14 ministries have been required to report quarterly on these programmes. The GRB initiative in Mexico has filtered down to sub-national governments in Morelos, Queretaro and Chiapas as well; however, the initiatives have been limited to the health sector. In Oaxaca, although the initiative to integrate GRB was taken through legislation; effective fiscal decentralisation is a significant prerequisite to incorporate GRB at sub-national levels. A lack of flexibility of finance at local levels, since more than 95 per cent of the revenue of Oaxaca comes through intergovernmental transfers, has thwarted effective implementation of GRB, despite laws making it mandatory.8 In the Philippines, the GRB initiative was started in 1995, with the introduction of a Gender and Development (GAD) budget policy, which stated that government agencies must allocate 5 per cent of their budgets to activities related to gender and development. Subsequently, UNIFEM supported a GRB initiative under which the National Commission on the Role of the Filipino Women (NCRFW), the national women\u2019s machinery, was supported to intervene in the budget process. This initiative coincided with efforts to move from line-item to performance-based budgeting. The intervention of NCRFW was designed to create strategies to institutionalise gender responsiveness in the process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "069a6393-0a99-47b0-881a-efdff619c7d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "069a6393-0a99-47b0-881a-efdff619c7d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ab2a0f0bdafcc41e30a639407a28adb49936578488b40c449e7fc0502b1580a"}, "2": {"node_id": "dac08899-d927-475a-ad86-e1bca19165d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ac148f0d53d41a3142a7bae303102f3b105874972aa28bfc59ab4b5d0b791a2"}}, "hash": "5df1ff3ad059fbb4763a88d6b109d7f23f7985649a7bef799f884d92d804d3b7", "text": "With the advent of further fiscal decentralisation, a few barangays (local communities) were involved in sector- specific GRB initiatives, including the health sector of Hilongos and the agriculture sector of Sorsogon.9 In South Africa, initiatives on GRB have been largely outside government.

In the process, a series of Women\u2019s Budgets were published by a civil society organisation.10 In the UK, the Women\u2019s Budget Group has spearheaded the process of gender- sensitive budget analysis. Their core recommendations to the UK Government are the inclusion of a comparative \u2018gender impact statement\u2019 published with every Budget and Public Expenditure White Paper. The Women\u2019s Budget Group argued successfully that the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) in UK should be reformed to make it more effective by splitting it into two separate tax credits (an Employment Tax Credit and an Integrated Child Credit). The purpose was to reorient employment incentive effects in such a manner as to target men and women equally, so that work pays equally well for both sexes and a sharing of caring and earning roles between parents is encouraged.11 In Mozambique, the Ministry of Planning and Finance initiated a gender-sensitive budget exercise, with financial assistance from the Swiss Development Corporation. In Namibia, the staff of Ministry of Finance worked with consultants from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and produced an analysis of selected portfolios for the 1998 National Budget. In Uganda, the strong parliamentary Women\u2019s Caucus and the affiliated NGO Forum for Women in Democracy (FOWODE) have taken the lead in initiating 8 Chakraborty 2006b. 9 For details, see Chakraborty 2006c. 10 For details, see Budlender 2000. 11 Elson 2006. 7 a gender budget exercise, initially focusing on selected portfolios.12 The Asian and Pacific country experiences of gender budgeting will be discussed later in the paper. The early experiences mentioned above of gender budgeting across the globe reveal the following: \u2022 Most gender budget initiatives have been largely donor driven and lack institutionalisation and sustainability. \u2022 Gender budgeting experiences have been largely confined to the public expenditure part of the budget, leaving the taxation side largely untouched. \u2022 Civil society initiatives have focused on demystifying the budget exercise rather than mainstreaming gender into the existing budget process. The public finance lens of gender budgeting process has been weak in these initiatives. \u2022 The weak co-ordination between the various actors in the process of gender budgeting marks one of the distinct elements of failure in institutionalising the process around the globe. \u2022 Given that gender budgeting is a nascent experiment across countries and given that any new experiment requires appropriate institutional mechanisms to make the process sustainable, a significant prelude to any attempts at gender budgeting would have been proper institutional structures. Though theoretical frameworks and methodological tools of gender-responsive budgeting have been developed, the translation of these conceptual tools into practical implementation has encountered many hurdles in different countries. However, several Asian and Pacific countries have initiated gender-responsive budgeting exercises. The country experiences suggest that it is not that Ministries of Finance and Planning Commissions are gender blind per se; lack of awareness or understanding of gender-related issues is the main constraint. It is vital to provide a \u2018gender diagnosis\u2019 statement to Finance and Planning divisions prior to gender budgeting so that policies incorporate real gender concerns rather than focusing on mechanical technical exercises. III. THE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR GENDER BUDGETING The analytical framework for gender budgeting can be broken down into: (a) ex-post gender budgeting, in which the existing budget is analyzed through a gender lens and (b) ex- ante gender budgeting, in which the needs of the women are identified first and then incorporated into the budget. Ex-ante gender budgeting is relatively easy at sub-national levels of government in which the identification of needs of women at local levels is relatively easy. In other words, the ex-ante budgeting is basically what is desirable in gender budgeting; by contrast, ex-post is in effect a gender auditing process applied to existing budgets. An ex-post assessment of the budget in period \u2018t\u2019 can feed into the ex-ante assessment for preparation of the budget in period \u2018t+1\u2019 as well and ideally would become an integral part of budget planning and allocation. 12 Byanyima 2002.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c55232a-b31b-4c67-95c7-deb68e3b74ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c55232a-b31b-4c67-95c7-deb68e3b74ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ab18995f2e2b85327acc411737b57e579b994b8c5ddcc31ee081f23e55fbd2a"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8d4294b-703c-4671-9ed3-731f535befcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26e420908d11b7c2967783896d7f589510967dd22c0434c05d2021eb8243e737"}}, "hash": "91e0d17f031aef8f3042806faf8f69cc599bb9305e4f44dd0e2219325b41401b", "text": "12 Byanyima 2002. 8 III.1 Analytical Framework for Ex-post Gender Budgeting Ex-post gender budget analysis begins with the identification of three categories of public expenditure: (i) Expenditure specifically targeted to women and girls (100 per cent targeted for women); (ii) Pro-women allocations; which are the composite expenditure schemes with a women component (that is, a scale of 100to 30 - at least 30 per cent targeted for women); and (iii) Mainstream public expenditures that have gender-differential impacts (that is, a scale of 0 to 30).

But the challenge is that discerning what component of mainstream budget programmes has a \u201cpro- women\u201d or gender-equality impact is not easily done from simple perusal of the budget documents. Within the analytical framework of gender budgeting, matrices can be developed to categorize financial inputs from a gender perspective; these can be transmitted to the identified Ministries/Departments to obtain the budgetary allocations to make gender impact analysis possible. The above three matrices form a categorisation of public expenditure on a scale of zero to 100 in terms of the proportions of beneficiaries who are women. In other words, the first matrix collates programmes specifically targeted to women with 100 per cent of allocations; while the second matrix collates public expenditure programmes with pro- women allocations, defined as at least 30 per cent of the budgetary allocations which benefit women. Pro-women allocation can be ex-ante (if it is calculated on the basis of amounts \u201cearmarked\u201d for women), or ex-post (if it is based on the identification of beneficiaries). The third matrix collates the allocations, which may be deemed residual only in the sense that these programmes do not fall within the first and second categories. These significant residual expenditures are likely to have gendered impacts, if not proven otherwise. Allocations under the third category include gender-specific allocations of 30 to zero per cent. III.2 Analytical Framework for Ex-ante Gender Budgeting The ex-ante process of gender budgeting approaches gender equity in an iterative manner as follows: (i) Identifying gender issues by place, sector and across socioeconomic groups; (ii) Translating gender concerns into relevant objectives to be included in the budget policy and programmes; (iii) Defining gender strategies at the policy and programme levels, with targets; (iv) Defining gender-sensitive performance indicators; and (v) Costing interventions to form the gender budget and subsequently identifying the budget headings. Identifying the regional or local dimensions of ex-ante gender budgeting is a critical step. The gender issues differ from region to region within a country; for instance, within India, the needs of women in a Rajasthan desert village may differ from the needs of Kerala women in a coastal village. The gender concerns of a \u2018state-of-nature\u201d region in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands differ from the gender issues in the urbanised regions of Haryana with no forest zones. The interface between gender and environment is also crucial when one talks about the spatial dimensions of gender budgeting. In the context of local-level ex-ante gender budgeting in one of the barangays of the Philippines, the interface between gender and environment has been clearly mapped out in the identification of gender-and-development budget objectives such as revamping irrigation facilities to lessen female out-migration, and measures against river quarrying to lessen the environmental hazards. 9 III.3 Gender-disaggregated Public Expenditure Benefit Incidence Analysis Ex-post gender budgeting can be extended to gender-disaggregated benefit incidence analysis.13 Theoretically, there are two approaches to analyze the impacts of public expenditure: benefit incidence studies and behavioural approaches. The behavioural approach is based on the idea that a rationed publicly provided good or service should be evaluated at the individual\u2019s own valuation of the good; Demery (2000) called this a \u2018virtual price\u2019. Such prices will vary from individual to individual. This approach emphasizes the measurement of individual preferences for publicly provided goods. The methodological complication in the valuation of revealed preferences \u2013 based on microeconomic theory, with a paucity of unit- record data on the knowledge of the underlying demand functions of individuals or households \u2013 has meant that behavioural approaches have been less practical in estimating the distributional impact of public expenditure. However, time-use data can provide insights into the estimation of efficiency of public expenditure, based on the measurement of perceived individual preferences for publicly-provided goods. The second approach, benefit incidence analysis (BIA), is a relatively simple and practical method for estimating the distributional impact of public expenditure across different demographic and socioeconomic groups. The genesis of this approach lies in path- breaking work by Meerman (1979) on Malaysia and Selowsky (1979) on Colombia.

The analysis of the distributional impact of public expenditure on water supply and energy is difficult at a macro level due to a paucity of data on units utilized. However, time-use data may provide better information on unit utilization of other social-sector expenditures. Chakraborty (2008b) attempted an illustrative gender-disaggregated benefit incidence analysis of the water sector in India using time-use data. Benefit incidence is computed by combining information about the unit costs of providing publicly provided goods with information on the use of these goods. Mathematically, benefit incidence is estimated by the following formula: \u03a7j \u2261 \u2211i Uij (Si/Ui) \u2261 \u2211i (Uij/Ui) Si \u2261 \u2211i e ij Si where \u03a7j = sector-specific subsidy enjoyed by group j; Uij = utilization of service i by group j; Ui = utilization of service i by all groups combined; Si = government net expenditure on service i; and e ij = group j\u2019s share of utilization of service i. 13 In the mid-nineties, the Commonwealth Secretariat commissioned a study to develop tools for GRB analysis (Elson 1999).The six tools suggested by Elson for GRB are the following: (i) gender-aware policy appraisal; (ii) beneficiary assessment; (iii) gender-disaggregated public expenditure incidence analysis; (iv) analysis of impact of the budget on time use; (v) gender-aware medium-term economic policy framework; and (vi) gender- responsive budget statements. 10 III. 4 Gender Budgeting: Taxation-side Analysis Empirical studies on gender-responsive tax policy, in particular gender-disaggregated tax incidence, are scarce. The literature on tax incidence is skewed towards looking at the distribution of tax burden in terms of income categories.14 Only a few attempts are noted on gender and taxation in Asian and Pacific countries; a study on tax incidence across gender in the context of India;15 and impact of taxation on small enterprises through a gender lens in the context of Viet Nam.16 In some countries such as India, some greater tax concessions are given to women for reasons of gender equity. Studies on \u2018tax expenditure analysis\u2019 (amount forgone by the government to meet tax concessions for women) can also be attempted in future. A general analysis of impact of government revenues on women can be found in Barnett and Grown (2004). Another significant issue is the gender-differential impacts of policies related to prohibition and regulation of excise duties on alcohol. Studies are scarce on the tradeoffs between revenue enhancing through excise taxes and alcoholism-induced poverty and domestic violence. Among the scarce literature, in one noted study an econometric analysis has been undertaken on primary data from a rural survey of Karnataka state in India in 2003\u2013 2004, to determine whether ease of access to liquor has a statistically significant impact on the probability of a rural household consuming liquor.17 The study noted that the effort to assemble fiscal resources to reach the Millennium Development Goals should not be achieved at the expense of the state becoming a partner in promoting the consumption of a potentially addictive substance. In Australia, an early campaign centered around the \u2018dependant-spouse rebate\u2019 paid primarily to male breadwinners, which the Federal Treasury eventually acknowledged as a gender issue in one of the early Federal Women\u2019s Budgets.18 In various industrialized countries, recent work focuses on the gender aspects of the interaction between the tax and welfare system resulting in higher effective marginal tax rates for women. This has been a major criticism of the family assistance packages of recent UK federal budgets.19 Apps and Rees (2008) argued that recent reforms in the US, UK and Australia in lowering tax rates on high incomes and expanded tax credits, and family transfer payments are withdrawn on the joint income of a couple have led to high effective marginal rates across a wide band of middle earners, and to a shift towards joint taxation. They also argued that joint taxation results in high tax rates on secondary earners, with consequential undesirable effects on both work incentive and fairness of income distribution. The life-cycle analysis of time use and saving decisions applied in the study indicated strong negative effects on female labour supply and household saving. The study highlighted that debates related to direct taxes are yet to be incorporated into tax policy debates in most Asian countries. 14 Pechman 1985; Engel et al. 1999. 15 Chakraborty et al. 2008. 16 Akram-Lodhi and van Staveren 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc3fd56d-659a-4ae3-a82a-74339bdf258f": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc3fd56d-659a-4ae3-a82a-74339bdf258f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "325f44634a867bad189993b3d80c11b168eee9c188c2dd2f3bf26931c938c0fa"}, "2": {"node_id": "63123c40-6a70-415b-9317-a2202217a49c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0289c3ddcd8351b8a43d24aa8e4fff5e6e6d783c5d00c691b30fe2ba6e87f7bb"}}, "hash": "2519ec09534ef13c73ef2e1ac180cc0462713ab1d25f2a9de8f0611e08319aa8", "text": "2008. 16 Akram-Lodhi and van Staveren 2005. 17 Rajaraman 2007. 18 Sawer 2002. 19 Apps and Rees 2008. 11 IV.

The countries examined are: Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Fiji, India, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam. Much of the reporting of experience in gender budgeting is biased towards explaining the processes involved, such as sensitisation and awareness generation, rather than analytical and empirical exercises of examining fiscal data through a gender perspective. A few exceptions to this pattern are Australia, India, Nepal, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, where the reviews of processes and outcome are balanced. The discussion of comparatively developed GRB experiences is taken up in IV.2, while IV.1 reviews the GRB experiences in countries in early stages of the exercise. As noted earlier, a major limitation in conducting empirical analysis of gender budgeting Asia and Pacific countries is the lack of data analysis. Only a few countries undertake developed data analysis and support the gender budgeting process with statistical evidence. Few provide very recent data. The data requirements for gender budgeting can be categorised as shown in Table 1. Gender diagnosis and budgeting requires gender statistics to analyse the gender disparities and to identify potential budget interventions related to gender issues, through an analysis of expenditure budgets and detail demand for grants. Table 1: Data Requirements for Conducting Gender Budgeting Gender Diagnosis Gender Analysis of Budgets ( illustrative data, list is open-ended) Financial Inputs Outcome/Output Gender Indicators,, including Education Health Labour Force Participation Rates Unemployment Rate Care Economy Statistics Time Use Statistics Revenue Budgets Expenditure Budgets Detailed Demand for Grants Ministry Data/Information specific to Programmes/Schemes Performance Budgets Outcome Budgets This paper focuses on existing studies on gender budgeting; assessing the intensity of gender allocations in country budgets is outside the scope of the paper. Such a task \u2013 an assessment of the gender intensity of budget allocations \u2013 could be part of a research agenda for the future. The current analysis uses data from budget documents \u2013 which include revenue budgets, expenditure budgets, performance budgets or outcome budgets, if any; detailed demands for grants, gender statistical data to conduct benefit incidence analysis \u2013 for which the exercise can be difficult if the classification system of the budgets is not conducive to gender budgeting. For instance, since the budget of Sri Lanka broadly emphasises economic classification20, apart from providing object details of Projects, it is difficult to undertake a gender categorisation of expenditure exclusively from the Budget documents, 20 Economic classification of budget broadly categories expenditure in terms of wages and salaries, transfers, subsidies, grants and capital expenditure. 12 unless supplemented with information from individual Ministries. Chakraborty (2003b) carried out a gender budgeting exercise of the budget of Sri Lanka 2003, in co-ordination with individual Ministries. The author noted that unless the nature of programmes/projects is explicitly known, it is impossible to identify programmes that are specifically targeted for women or have a pro-women bias, apart from expenditure which is gender neutral. A further point to be noted is that the conduct of gender budgeting differs in a country where there is relatively more donor presence compared with a country which is able to rely on domestic resource mobilisation. Aid effectiveness and gender budgeting is an upcoming area of research, and country experience based on such research will be valuable in this field. Gender-sensitive analysis of budgets begins with categorising expenditure, but it does not stop there. Categorisation has to be followed by a number of exercises that examine what use has been made of expenditures and what impact these have had (from financial inputs to gendered outputs and impacts). However, existing studies, largely due to data constraints, are skewed towards the analysis of gender financial inputs, rather than how these financial inputs have translated into gendered outputs and impacts. IV.1 Nascent Experiences on GRB IV.1.1 Afghanistan Gender budgeting began in Afghanistan only in 2007. A unit on gender budgeting was created in the Ministry of Finance to assist the Government to meet its obligations regarding women\u2019s advancement by analyzing, reviewing and contributing to government policies, programs and budgets. Recognising that it is vital to institutionalize mechanisms to monitor and account for the impact of government spending on men and women, the Ministry of Finance has played a leading role in creating gender budgeting units after a series of deliberations with working groups from various Ministries in co-ordination with GTZ-GM (German Technical Co-operation Gender Mainstreaming Project). The aim of the Gender Budgeting Unit is to ensure that the budget process is just and fair, and that resources are equally distributed to all citizens.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b195322-c1a5-4d9c-a773-83e0f5ae89de": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b195322-c1a5-4d9c-a773-83e0f5ae89de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76d581f1bcedb591cb80ca15260e09c37c2dc455b53f5bebcd621c7c210afc7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "c052b606-7a3a-4f5a-b319-76264d83952a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a15809d78c770ed732aad9c0c411461bff0473880b4a0cf74d725d113aeecef2"}}, "hash": "64362d2f202348703a3098fc3666779e70a90cc2ff26d4e1603e874c0eb0dc7d", "text": "The Gender Budgeting Unit will also provide advice on gender-sensitive programming for all Afghan ministries. There was inclusion of a separate chapter on gender equality in the Master Plan of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), in the proposed Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) and in the National Education Strategic Plan (NESP) developed by the Ministry for Education; all, however, with no specific budgetary allocations. The rationale for conducting gender budgeting in Afghanistan is based on serious gender disparities in the country. The limited statistical evidence indicates that women and men in Afghanistan have not had equal access to education, land, credit and governance. The lack of gender disaggregated data is a major constraint in undertaking gender budgeting analysis in Afghanistan. There is no segregation of schemes and/or beneficiaries on the basis of gender in any Ministry. A major challenge to gender budgeting in Afghanistan is to undertake a public expenditure profile through a gender lens by quantifying budgetary allocations for women at national and sub-national government levels. This ex-post analysis of gender budget needs to be built in along with development of monitoring tools that would simultaneously generate 13 sex-disaggregated data and gender development indicators for all sectors. Capacity building to undertake gender budgeting analysis linking gender-sensitive policy formulation to programming and budget formulation is a key challenge.21 IV.1.2 Bangladesh In Bangladesh, integrating gender into national policies became prominent with the formulation of the Fifth Five Year Plan (1997-2002), which adopted the principle of mainstreaming women\u2019s development in the Plan. The declaration of the National Policy for the Advancement of Women, the adoption of the National Action Plan (NAP) for the Advancement of Women in 1997, and measures to implement the Beijing Platform for Action (PFA) are other noteworthy developments in this direction. Bangladesh has also been a signatory of several international treaties including CEDAW. There are 47 Ministries with Women in Development (WID) focal points and the task of gender mainstreaming has been assigned to the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. In 1996, 12 sectoral (line) ministries were assigned to assess the gender gaps and needs of their sectors and 12 sectoral needs assessment teams consisting of government officials and non- government experts were set up to review these ministries including Women and Child Affairs (focal ministry), Law, Justice, Industry, Agriculture, Environment and Forestry, Labour and Employment, Health and Family Planning, Information.22 It should be noted that macro-sectoral WID policies remain largely rhetoric; except for the crop sector, where 0.24 per cent of the total sectoral allocation is set aside for women in agricultural development, no other multi-sectoral programme sets aside an allocation for WID activities. Moreover, social sectors such as education and health do not provide sex-disaggregated allocation information. Against this background, a gender-responsive budgeting initiative began in Bangladesh in 1999, in collaboration with the World Bank. The initiative placed emphasis on beneficiary assessment and incidence analysis to serve as a baseline for the government to undertake gender budgeting.23 In the experience of gender budgeting in Bangladesh, one finds both government and non-government initiatives.24 Bangladesh Nari Pragati Sangha (BNPS), a national NGO has been conducting annual research on \u2018women\u2019s share in the national budget\u2019 since 2001 with financial assistance from the Bangladesh Freedom Foundation (Ford Foundation). In the BNPS-BIDS study, it is noted that more than 50 per cent of total government expenditure is revenue expenditure (current expenditure), in which salary and other amenities such as pension and gratuities of government employees constitute 30 per cent of revenue expenditure. But fewer than 15 per cent of government employees are women. The study also looked into gender-differentiated beneficiaries in pension and food assistance programmes. The methodology used by this study to analyse the expenditure side of gender budgeting categorised the Annual Development Programme (ADP) of the Government of 21 UNIFEM n.d. 22 Asian Development Bank 2001. 23 Budlender et al. 2002. 24One of the significant changes occurring in the last two decades is the increasing participation of women in public life. A proliferation of organized activities by NGOs has its roots in the 1971 post-war period, when NGOs organized for the first time to rehabilitate thousands of women victims of the war of Independence. ADB (2001) noted that this massive organization of rural poor women in Bangladesh is significantly different from the urban-based social welfare services undertaken by educated upper- and middle-class women\u2019s organizations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c052b606-7a3a-4f5a-b319-76264d83952a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c052b606-7a3a-4f5a-b319-76264d83952a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76d581f1bcedb591cb80ca15260e09c37c2dc455b53f5bebcd621c7c210afc7d"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b195322-c1a5-4d9c-a773-83e0f5ae89de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64362d2f202348703a3098fc3666779e70a90cc2ff26d4e1603e874c0eb0dc7d"}}, "hash": "a15809d78c770ed732aad9c0c411461bff0473880b4a0cf74d725d113aeecef2", "text": "14 Bangladesh into three components: (i) Directly growth-oriented programmes (in sectors such as agriculture, industry, rural development, power, transport, communication etc.); (ii) Indirectly growth-oriented programmes (in sectors such as health, education, science and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfc43647-e8b5-43af-889e-7a0bf2029066": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfc43647-e8b5-43af-889e-7a0bf2029066", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39bec203d4f00aaf9133f3040810e55871280c2c9996a024669045cec8b88d09"}}, "hash": "39bec203d4f00aaf9133f3040810e55871280c2c9996a024669045cec8b88d09", "text": "technology, labour and manpower etc., directed at social capital formation); and (iii) Welfare- oriented programmes which include all safety net programmes. Development programmes included in these categories were again subdivided into programmes which target women only, programmes which are gender-sensitive with partial impact on women, and programmes with no impact on women. This analytical framework broadly conforms to the ex-post type analysis discussed in section III. Majumdar (2002) analyzed the development budgets of the period 1997-98 to 2001- 02, which is the Five Year Plan period. The study findings revealed that only a few sectors such as health, education, social welfare and women\u2019s affairs had specific programmes for women, and the author concluded that Bangladesh conspicuously failed to mainstream gender into its macroeconomic plan. The study also highlighted the lack of efficiency in budgetary allocation, with a very high rate of unutilized budget allocation in various sectors. It recommended that women\u2019s development not be addressed as a welfare issue alone in the national budget; more development programmes should be designed for women, other than such safety net programmes as widows\u2019 allowance schemes, rural maintenance programmes, food assistance programmes, which target only women in distress. In Bangladesh, government initiatives on gender budgeting have mainly been limited to sectoral analysis. The Policy Research Unit in the Ministry of Health in Bangladesh has been engaged in linking sex-disaggregated beneficiary assessment with local service delivery. In the transformation towards output-based budget monitoring in Bangladesh, donor- supported sector programmes have been analyzed in terms of outputs and targets. A recent initiative in gender-sensitive public policy in Bangladesh has been engendering the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). A recent study noted that strengthening women\u2019s representation and participation in economic and political life can contribute significantly to poverty alleviation and to more effective and accountable governance and that one tangible way to respond is by formulating gender budgets.25 The study noted that experience to date has shown the potential of gender analyses not only to advance gender equality, but to improve transparency and good governance. It also noted that gender budgets have contributed to reprioritization of public spending and to other policy changes in areas such as child care, and combating domestic violence, literacy, and fostering political participation in Bangladesh. However, the institutionalization of gender budgeting within the government remains a great challenge in Bangladesh. The path towards institutionalizing gender budgeting began with a reference to gender budgeting by the Finance Minister in his budget speech in 2007-08. He noted that as part of ongoing budget reforms, Bangladesh had initiated preparation of pro-poor and gender budget design along with a Medium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) approach. The budget speech stated that currently direct and indirect gender equality expenditure taken together accounts for 22 percent of the total budget. The budget proposed that it will increase this share to 24 percent by 2008.26 25 Aminuzzaman 2007. 26 Aminuzzaman 2007. 15 The special feature of the 2007-08 budget is that figures on gender-equity-related allocations were made available to the general public for the first time, along with poverty- related estimates. However, the clarity of the gender budget statement remains limited. IV.1.3 Fiji Initially Fiji was the Pacific pilot for the Commonwealth\u2019s initiative. Commonwealth support for the Fiji initiative was subsequently postponed following the coup and Fiji\u2019s suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth. There is, however, interest on the part of Fiji civil society organizations. In July 2000 the National Council of Women Fiji issued a statement on the budget which bemoaned the lack of gender specific affirmative action as well as the lack of recognition of the need for peace and national reconciliation.27 Civil society organizations have also made contact with general budget initiatives in other countries. IV.1.4 Malaysia In Malaysia, strategies for mainstreaming gender have been incorporated both in five- year development plans and long-term ten-year Outline Perspective Plans. The Eighth Five- Year Plan (2001-05), integrated gender issues in national development, related to improving the skills and knowledge of women to cope with the challenges of globalization and the knowledge-based economy. The Ministry of Women and Family Development (MWFD) was established in January 2001 to ensure effective implementation and coordination of programmes for women and families. The MWFD has also established inter-ministerial committees and technical working groups to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and other international treaties endorsed or ratified by Malaysia including CEDAW.28 As part of the gender mainstreaming programme, Malaysia implemented a pilot gender budget analysis project in July 2003 in co-ordination with UNDP.

Malaysia\u2019s advantage in this undertaking was the already existing institutionalized performance-oriented budgeting system for the whole country. The Ministry of Women and Family Development (MWFD) coordinated and supervised the UNDP-Government of Malaysia initiative on gender responsive budgeting. Four ministries were identified for the pilot: Ministry of Education (Primary Education, Tertiary Education, Construction of Polytechnics), Ministry of Health (Family Health Development, Orthopaedic, Rural Health Clinics), Ministry of Human Resources (Training Services, Construction of an Industrial Training Institute) and Ministry of Rural Development (Community Development, Housing Aid for the Poor). 27 Budlender et al. 2002. 28 Malaysia follows a two-prong strategy in terms of gender. One is to integrate gender and family perspectives in the process of policy formulation and provide opportunities for women to improve their socio-economic well being and the other is long term developmental strategies including capacity building and motivational and entrepreneurship programmes. 16 IV.1.5 New Zealand New Zealand has undertaken a Time-use Survey to examine the extent of the inequality of women\u2019s and men\u2019s contribution to the unpaid care economy. This inequality constitutes a major obstacle in equal access to paid work and has an important impact on the time available for leisure and community activities. Therefore, one of the thrusts of gender budgeting is to lift the veil of statistical invisibility of the care economy and integrate it into macroeconomic policy making. Time budget statistics provide systematic cues as to the invisible contributions of women and men, and can provide guidelines towards fiscal policy making especially in terms of the care economy, such as child and elder care provisions. Another significant step towards engendering budgetary policy in New Zealand is the requirement that all papers going before the Cabinet Social Development Committee include Gender Implications Statements, supported by gender analysis. However, with the change of government in November 2008 and the demise of that committee, the requirement for such statements has been dropped. IV.1.6 Pakistan Gender-responsive budgeting initiatives (within government) in Pakistan are at a very early stage. UNDP initiatives on gender budgeting at the national level began with concept notes on 'Generating gender data and gender budget initiatives for Ministry of Women Development (MoWD's) 'Gender and Poverty' paper submitted for the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) in November 2001. Initially an information brief was prepared on 'gender budgeting' for MoWD in July 2002 and based on that, initial talks began with the Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance in July 2001 and September 2002. A more developed process of gender budget began in Pakistan at the end of 2005 with the recognition that a gender budget statement (GBS) is one of the key accountability tools by the government, since it links budget to the targeted objective and takes into account progress in terms of the government's intentions and its actual allocations. In 2005, the Federal Ministry of Finance launched the Gender-Responsive Budgeting Initiative (GRBI) Project, with the support of UNDP. In December 2005, a small group of nominated federal and provincial focal officials from the three pilot sectors of Education, Health and Population Welfare were introduced to the idea and practice of gender budget statements. In February 2006, these same focal persons alongside a number of civil society members were given training in preparing these statements. Simultaneously, the process was brought to selected sub-national levels; focal officials in the Punjab were provided training in preparing gender budget statements for three pilot selected sectors within the Government of Punjab, with external assistance. The process of gender budgeting in Pakistan has been one of institutionalizing the process within government rather than a civil society initiative. As part of this institutionalization process, focal persons in relevant provincial departments were requested to initiate the process of preparation of gender budget statements in collaboration with technical assistance provided by project resources. The format of the gender budget statements was prepared for each of the three selected sectors, providing for up to six sub-statements, with each sub-statement covering a different \u2018programme\u2019 or \u2018sub-programme\u2019 of the sector.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37720093-c45c-4818-93ea-ac355ca740ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "37720093-c45c-4818-93ea-ac355ca740ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b22fcb20c6a9246ce930a88e83a86b6cc5cad0a515b7425795d9d454970a04c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "625eb957-e34b-423a-8abc-08312dc4b5b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f91e0bc608c9a265d75fe6a11d009c2e9679d5ed0bfbc253f803c1a760a863f"}}, "hash": "54b7d7e25fcfb5513d5de2a8d70edf743e0788f6c430ae9834278d0277801ac0", "text": "The sub-sections for the gender budget statements were to follow an eight-step procedure as follows: (i) Programme name; 17 (ii) Sub-programme name (where relevant); (iii) Gender issues; (iv) Planned activities; (v) Budget for previous and current financial year (FY); (vi) Inputs (including targets and actual progress on ground); (vii) Outputs (including targets and actual progress on ground); and (viii) Overall assessment, with outcome indicators wherever possible.

The gender budget statements are asked to cover only those activities over which the province has fiscal autonomy, including untied grants from the federal government. The statements were not to include too many indicators, since the indicators are not meant to measure every single aspect of a programme, but instead the gender responsiveness of the programme. Based on this framework, the process of preparing gender budget statements began as pilot in the education, health and welfare sectors. Under the broad analytical framework of ex-post analysis of gender budgeting discussed in section III, in 2007 a study was done by the Ministry of Finance, unpacking the budget for fiscal years 2004-05 and 2005-06 in terms of overall and gender-focused expenditures. The study was based on the detailed budgetary allocation and expenditure pattern as recorded in the \u201cDetails of Demand for Grants and Appropriations, 2005-06\u201d, Volumes I & II and \u201cMedium Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) 2005-08\u201d for the Ministry of Health and Population Welfare published by the Ministry of Finance; budget information is reported in these publications from an \u201cEntity-cum-Object\u201d29 perspective.30 The study noted that it faced methodological challenges in unpacking the budget in terms of object classification, which required the disaggregation of expenditures by sex within categories. It found that a focus on salary expenditures could be one approach, since these expenditures could be disaggregated by sex. Further, these often constitute the largest chunk of expenditure. However, the study also noted the methodological difficulty in doing so is that such an approach has a limited scope; it provides sex-disaggregated information about the service provider only, and not about the users of services. In the event, such a breakdown was not possible in the Pakistan study, due to the unavailability of sex-disaggregated employment numbers in the budget documents.31 The study found that only a few categories of federal government public expenditures have gender-specific and pro-women expenditure components. For instance, only about 5 per cent of the development budget and 1 per cent of the current budget could be classified as gender-specific and pro-women in Pakistan (for the 2005 budget). Further, the study pointed out that many categories of expenditure in the budget other than those identified may have pro-women components; however, these are difficult to identify due to the manner of reporting. Education, health, food agriculture, livestock, water and power are examples of public expenditure categories that may have more pro-women component than reported in the study; second, most of the expenditures of the federal government are non-rival in consumption and cannot be categorized as directed towards males or females; for instance, expenditures on defence services to protect the whole country cannot be classified as pro-women or pro-men. In this context, reference will be made below to a similar study in Sri Lanka, where these methodological challenges were appropriately tackled by designing sectoral matrices to categorize expenditures to provide 29 \u201cEntity-cum-Object\u201d perspective describes which entity is expected to spend resources on what objects of expenditure such as employee-related expenses, utilities etc. By comparison, a functional classification of expenditure budgets provides a perspective about the purpose for which money is to be spent, such as general public service, defense affairs etc. In addition to these two categories, MTBF provides the summary of expenditure under different policy heads, for health and population welfare sectors only. 30 Sabir 2007. 31 Sabir 2007. 18 full information on the gender intensity of all budgetary allocations for selected sectors.32 The details of the study are explained in the section on Sri Lanka. IV.1.7 Samoa In Samoa, gender budgeting was introduced in 2002-03. The emphasis in Samoa was on youth- and gender-sensitive budgeting, rather than on all age groups. The initiative was broadly part of Public Expenditure Management reform. Such disaggregation of budgetary policies not only by sex but also by age groups has been the significant contribution of the Samoan experiment. Against a backdrop of increasing recognition of a \u2018demographic dividend\u2019 in several countries in the region, the emphasis on youth in gender budgets is well placed. However, the process is still in an early stage. In Samoa an ADB-assisted pilot was undertaken for 18 months with a focus on budgeting for its new youth policy for which it subsequently obtained donor funding. Following this pilot, as a result of work done at the regional level and a relatively strong women\u2019s unit, interest moved toward gender budgeting as opposed to youth-sensitive budgeting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eeda4d63-c311-4a2c-8e51-8bc7ebd14503": {"__data__": {"id_": "eeda4d63-c311-4a2c-8e51-8bc7ebd14503", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37b782a2a5cf36ed875952f4eacea24eaba6a5a93db245cfdfa1419520491e80"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee6cd375-0546-4ea6-9783-1aee7154db03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f3f4cb45431b2c262d834433468130a4875c7c3e9229463a0e5fb217da94502"}}, "hash": "656b93b8ced16fe7747d2fa306b647c6fd0f7fa14caf6f2e0a3d9e54038a8baf", "text": "IV.1.8 Singapore A matter of concern, however, has been the falling birth rate or, technically, the falling Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which in Singapore is 1.4.33 Empirical evidence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85f6d4bd-9b0a-4fc2-9b09-10181882aa98": {"__data__": {"id_": "85f6d4bd-9b0a-4fc2-9b09-10181882aa98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1447545a241a07e2a4a2886337a3b02ab7ceec101b644d90bbd1d08541e0d21a"}}, "hash": "1447545a241a07e2a4a2886337a3b02ab7ceec101b644d90bbd1d08541e0d21a", "text": "also showed that the falling TFR has links to the rising educational attainment and in turn work participation of women in the Singapore economy. It is not apparent that Singapore has undertaken gender-responsive budgeting initiatives. However, looking at budgetary policies through a gender lens, it is apparent that in recent years, budgetary policies have introduced several programmes to address the issue of falling TFR through encouraging parenthood. In Singapore, ICT tools are used in efforts toward empowering women and to improve their ability as entrepreneurs; these may include e-learning, knowledge management, customer relationship management (CRM) among others. Like other APEC economies, Singapore faces the challenges of globalisation and the advent of new technologies in the New Economy. To better equip industries to meet these challenges, the Singapore government established an Economic Review Committee to fundamentally review its development strategy and formulate a blueprint to restructure the economy. While it would be of value to introduce gender-responsive budgeting analysis in Singapore, such an initiative does not appear to be on the immediate horizon. IV.1.9 Viet Nam Viet Nam\u2019s National Strategy for the Advancement of Women to 2010 and its associated 5-year Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women constitute the key policy documents relating to gender in Viet Nam. The overall objective of the National Strategy is to improve the quality of women\u2019s life, as well as establish the enabling environment for women to enjoy their fundamental rights, and to fully and equally participate in and benefit from all aspects of socio-economic and political activity. Each of the 64 provinces in Viet 32 Chakraborty 2003b. 33 Total fertility rate refers to \u201clifetime births per woman\u201d. 19 Nam also develops its own plan of action for the advancement of women, and a socio- economic development plan reflecting needs in the provinces. The five objectives of the National Strategy are to: (i) Achieve women\u2019s equal rights in labor and employment; (ii) Achieve women\u2019s equal rights in education; (iii) Achieve women\u2019s equal rights in health care; (iv) Enhance quality and efficiency of women\u2019s performance in the political, economic, cultural and social fields resulting in more women being recommended for and elected to leadership positions at all levels and in all sectors; and (v) Strengthen efforts to build the capacity of the government machinery for the advancement of women. Although the Ministry of Finance has issued a guidance document on expenditure on activities for the advancement of women, it only states that expenditure should be financed from recurrent spending and does not clearly specify norms and concrete spending for activities. Dual constraints of inadequate financial resources and lack of technical capacity has hindered Viet Nam from undertaking gender budget analysis. So far there have been no attempts within government to take up gender budgeting. Though the recent attempts of gender budgeting in Viet Nam on public expenditure incidence analysis and beneficiary assessment is yet to bear fruits, an empirical study was conducted in 2003 on the revenue side of gender budgeting with regard to the a gender analysis of the impact of indirect taxes on small and medium enterprises in Viet Nam. The study by Akram-Lodhi and van Staveren (2003) brings together gender analysis, small-scale enterprise analysis, and gender budget analysis in a development context. The paper demonstrates that gender matters not only to the ownership of an SME, but also to its most likely principal activity, the stock of the assets that it possesses, the labour that it utilizes, the costs that it faces, the revenues that it generates, and the profits that it earns. In particular, lower earnings for female-owned SMEs can be attributed to the different input cost structures facing female and male-owned SMEs, which in turn are influenced by the indirect tax system. The process of gender budgeting in Viet Nam is still undeveloped, and sex- disaggregated benefit incidence analysis of public expenditure may be a logical starting point to integrate gender perspectives in fiscal policy making. IV.2 Countries with Relatively More Advanced GRB Experiences In Asia-Pacific IV.2.1 Australia Australia was the pioneer in developing a gender-sensitive budget statement. The first gender budget was conducted by the federal government in Australia in 1984 as a pilot project, although some preliminary 'women's impact statements' had been introduced in the early 1980s. The federal Australian Women's Budget was a comprehensive statement analyzing the government budget through a gender lens, although the focus of the exercise was broadly confined to analyses of public expenditures and not of revenues. For a number of budget cycles, a comprehensive assessment of gender differential implications of the federal budget was presented. Government departments were asked", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d58f9c7-a19e-4e9d-af56-bb96f021a68f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d58f9c7-a19e-4e9d-af56-bb96f021a68f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5308ee56965b6e9797c1d2af3c9510bc18763574513f6c1e7ffe023597d7a4d"}}, "hash": "d5308ee56965b6e9797c1d2af3c9510bc18763574513f6c1e7ffe023597d7a4d", "text": "to produce an analysis of public expenditure for their gender impacts and the Treasury annually published these analyses as official budget papers. In 1990, the analysis evolved to using gender equality indicators to highlight their trajectory toward meeting equality goals. By 1994, each department within the 20 Australian government began using the same gender equality indicators to evaluate their own progress on an annual basis. The analytical framework for gender budgeting at sub-national levels - most of the state and territory levels of government (developed initially for South Australia in 1985) - involved breaking public expenditures into the following categories: (i) Expenditures exclusively targeted to groups of men or women, boys or girls; (ii) Equal employment opportunity expenditures by government agencies and their employees; and (iii) General budget expenditures to be analyzed for their gender impact. This broadly conforms to the concept of ex-post analysis discussed in the section on analytical framework. The analysis of the 1985-86 South Australia budget showed that direct allocations specifically targeted to women and girls amounted to less than one percent of allocations.34 This account highlights the fact that six state and two territorial governments in Australia have undertaken explicit GRBs for lengthy periods; subsequently, the Australian Capital Territory has included a gender section in its budget papers since about 2006. In this sense, Australia provides an example of fiscally decentralised gender budgeting. However, the challenge of focusing on general expenditures helped raise awareness in the bureaucracy as to the impact of general expenditures on women, even though initially some agencies had believed that their policies and budgets were gender neutral. The Australian Women's Budget also helped bring gender issues into economic policy debates in unprecedented ways.35 Another commendable achievement in recognition of the care economy is that since 2006, the Census has included questions on unpaid work. The Government provided funding to include these questions to make it possible to analyze the level of involvement in unpaid work in the home of women and men of different ages and living arrangements. The new data report the numbers of unpaid care-givers for children and for people with disabilities and the numbers of volunteers working through organizations or groups. This initiative has provided greater capacity to analyse the contributions of women and men to national wellbeing. Having recognized that the budget is more than a technical exercise on revenues and expenditures, the Australian government went a step further to incorporate The Family Law into budget considerations. The objective of this measure was to provide new services to help families who are experiencing relationship difficulties or have separated. IV.2.2 India At the national level, The Department of Women and Child Development (DWCD), Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, in collaboration with UNIFEM, took up a gender budget initiative in India. A study was entrusted to the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), an autonomous research institute of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), in October 2000 (Box 1). This can be considered the first step advocating the mainstreaming of gender in the budget process. The discussions of NIPFP with the DWCD team have been quite insightful in identifying country gender specifics to be incorporated in developing a gender-responsive budget process. The NIPFP is the first 34 Budlender et al. 1998. 35 Sharp and Broomhill 2002. 21 institution in India to undertake a systematic exercise to initiate gender budgeting. A series of studies on the subject were carried out at NIPFP under the project and its successors. Box 1 NIPFP Study: Best Study in the Region on Gender Budgeting The idea of introducing gender budgeting in India gathered momentum with the study done by Lahiri et al. (2003) of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (hereafter, referred to as the NIPFP study).To provide the analytical framework for gender budgeting, the NIPFP study constructed an econometric model to link spending on public education and health to the Gender Development Index (GDI), showing the positive effect of such spending on this indicator of gender inequality. This approach does not refute the widely explored link between economic growth and (gender-sensitive) human development, rather it emphasizes that it is transmitted substantially through higher public expenditure, particularly through health care and education. Given the limited scope of trickle-down effects of economic growth-promoting strategies, the role of fiscal policy in gender-sensitive human development proceeds from market failures of one kind or another. Fiscal policy, is a key policy instrument to ensure human development and in particular gender development, which rests on the contention that the functioning of the market cannot, by itself, activate the signalling, response and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1681709e-94df-4d55-890b-e55b1b2c06e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1681709e-94df-4d55-890b-e55b1b2c06e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67f73b56600caddb4801278586c0bc21046db97569bb8619330c136070963d08"}}, "hash": "67f73b56600caddb4801278586c0bc21046db97569bb8619330c136070963d08", "text": "mobility of economic agents to achieve efficiency in both static (allocative efficiency) and dynamic (shift in the production frontier) terms. This is all the more relevant at the sub-national levels of fiscal policy, where the provisioning of merit goods like education and health are vested. The rubric of gender budgeting owes its roots to these analytics. Accepting that earmarking money for women through the Women\u2019s Component Plan (WCP) is only a second-best principle of gender budgeting, the NIPFP study attempted an analysis of the whole budgetary process through a gender lens. The WCP would have been more effective had there been a differential targeting of expenditure based on an identification of appropriate programmes for women in various sectors. In other words, reprioritizing expenditures based on a generic list of appropriate programmes and policies for women might be more effective rather than ad-hoc targeting of 30 per cent across sectors. The major debate in India on gender budgeting in the initial phase went much beyond the mechanics of adopting a homogenous 30 per cent through WCP to the very rationale of conducting gender budgeting itself. The gender diagnosis analysis carried out by NIPFP justified the need for conducting gender budgeting based on the empirical evidence that as women and men are at asymmetric levels of socio-economic development in India, the existing gender neutrality of budgets can lead to many unintentional negative consequences, translating the gender neutrality of budgets into gender blindness. The study provided some selected indicators of the status of women in India, showing the degree of disadvantage especially in health, education and work participation. The study also evaluated the existing degree of gender inequality in India, presenting an interesting application of HDI, GDI and GEM (Stotsky 2006). The NIPFP study also postulated that integrating a gender perspective into budgetary policy has dual dimensions of equality and efficiency. From the efficiency consideration, what is important is the social rate of return of investment in women, and in cases, this can be greater than the corresponding rate for men. The study highlighted that gender inequality is inefficient and costly to development. Through these discussions, the NIPFP study was rooting its rationale for gender budgeting in externalities, a notion which encompasses equity as well as efficiency considerations. Gender budgeting intrinsically recognizes these dual dimensions; and assumes that fiscal policy can be used to internalize the externalities through various policy instruments including taxation, subsidies and public expenditure. While discussing the externalities through a gender lens, an important point to be highlighted is the labour force exogeneity in the treatment of the care economy in prevalent macroeconomic policymaking. The intra-household gender asymmetries in the intensity and allocation of time and choices regarding labour force participation in the care economy have always been invisible in 22 macro policies. Recognizing that the dynamic interaction between the dual sets of economic activity \u2013 that is, the statistically invisible care economy and the visibility of the market economy \u2013 which underlines the micro-foundations of engendering macroeconomic policies, the NIPFP study applied global substitution criteria of price variables to the time-use budgets to value the care economy across selected states in India (within the framework of the extended production boundary of the System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993) and in turn integrated these values into macro policies. Realizing that the allocation and efficiency of time spent in the care economy might be more important to economic welfare than the market economy through its positive externalities, the study recommended the integration of the inferences from time-use budgets into gender budgeting. In this way, as well, gender budget policies related to the care economy would be more effective at the decentralized levels of government through social multiplier effects. The methodology adopted by NIPFP for gender budgeting received wide attention due to its simplicity and practicability in conducting gender budgeting within the country and between countries. Stotsky (2006) noted that it represented an interesting effort at focusing on the gender- differentiated effects of budgetary spending and although the linkages of such spending to gender disparity measures and economic growth and welfare are only treated in brief, it provided a framework for such analyses to support sensible budget making. Within the analytical framework of gender budgeting, a few matrices have been developed by NIPFP to categorize financial inputs from a gender perspective. These analytical matrices for categorizing public expenditure through a gender lens were as follows: (i) Specifically targeted expenditure to women and girls; (ii) Pro- women allocations, which are the composite expenditure schemes with a significant women\u2019s component (that is, a scale of 30 <= E < 100; at least", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6e5f4b2-50a2-4118-a0ab-0f1569f39ffa": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6e5f4b2-50a2-4118-a0ab-0f1569f39ffa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89c850736b699d6075947ff120caf3d32b423bb093fbfe8bf16223e746a4ebdd"}, "3": {"node_id": "fec52b23-ce78-4ddf-a38d-8cc06433732f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "701d8f8c7bebb561c51170bd2d469d4c8a3e5a5fb71970a2408b9a847e2fd2f4"}}, "hash": "b08162da38a7f3df1b202f81bdf378ff0c0ca95b70814da4e7c7a43c6f06fedc", "text": "30 percent targeted for women); and (iii) Residual public expenditures that have gender\u2013differential impacts (that is, a scale 0 <= E < 30). These three analytical matrices neatly fit into the existing programme budgeting framework in India. These matrices hold good even with the transition of the existing accounting system to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Government Finance Statistics, where government budgets are broken down into functional and economic categorizations. This is possible through organizing budget data either by examining sex-disaggregated public expenditure, by Benefit Incidence Analysis (BIA), or by the segregation of gender specific allocations in the budget and accounts by introducing a new budget head of account for distinctly identifying gender allocations at sub- major head level in the budget documents for the second and third categories of public expenditure. Gender-disaggregated public expenditure BIA involves the measurement of unit cost of providing a particular service and the number of units utilized by gender. Unfortunately, the paucity of sex-disaggregated data on services utilized constrains such benefit incidence analysis for a variety of public services. Furthermore, theoretically, not all public goods and services can be gender partitioned. The policy series of ex-post gender budget analysis based on NIPFP methodology was revealing. Higher budget allocations for women per se does not translate into higher spending, as there has been significant deviation between budget estimates and actuals. It is important to note in this context that gender-sensitive analysis of budgets begins with categorizing expenditure, but it does not stop there. The NIPFP study recognized that categorization has to be followed by a number of exercises that examine what \u2018use\u2019 has been made of expenditures and what \u2018impact\u2019 this has had (that is, from financial inputs to gendered outputs and impacts). Thus linking gender budgets to outcome budgets and performance budgeting are equally important. Expenditure tracking surveys are also required to analyse the implementation aspects of these programmes and to analyse leakages in financial allocations, if any. What budgetary reforms are therefore required for gender-sensitive public policy? The policy solutions suggested by the NIPFP study are mainly twofold. First, to ensure transparency in the allocation for women through adequate changes in budgetary classification to protect these provisions from reappropriation and thereby enhance accountability. Second, with the advent of fiscal decentralization, to strengthen gender-sensitive budgeting at the sub-national government levels as provisioning of merit goods such as, education and health, are primarily the 23 responsibility of sub-national governments. The first policy solution is addressed by the Ministry of Finance (MoF), Government of India through the setting up of an expert group on \"Classification of Government Transactions\u201d in 2004, one of the terms of reference of which was institutionalizing gender-responsive budgeting process at the national level. Based on the recommendations of the Expert Group, gender budgeting has been institutionalized in India through MoF since 2005-06. Against the backdrop of the recommendations by the Expert Group, the Finance Minister introduced a statement on Gender Budgeting in the Union Budget of 2005- 06, covering 10 demands for grants highlighting the gender sensitivities of budget allocations. In t following year, the Finance Minister was able to enlarge the statement to include 24 demands for grants. Prima facie, it appears as an \u201cunpleasant gender arithmetic, as the gender intrinsic allocations under these 24 Demand for Grants constitutes only 5 per cent of the total budget. The second policy solution of strengthening gender budgeting at the decentralized levels achieved mixed results. The NIPFP methodology for gender budgeting has been accepted by the Government of India to carry over this exercise to state-level. Sources: Chakraborty 2006a; Lahiri et al. 2003; Stotsky 2006. NIPFP's involvement in Gender-responsive Budgeting resulted in its first visible outcome in the inclusion of a chapter on \u2018gender inequality\u2019 in the Economic Survey of India, 2000-2001 (a document prepared by MoF and placed before Parliament annually a day before the Union Budget of India).

NIPFP has been invited by various women\u2019s groups and NGOs to deliver training modules on gender budgeting including lectures on ex-ante and ex-post budget analysis through a gender lens. These training modules of NIPFP helped women\u2019s groups and civil society organisations in India firm up their technical knowledge on budgets so as to highlight gender concerns to MoF and the Planning Commission of India in ex-ante rounds of budgetary making. The Final Report of the NIPFP study submitted to DWCD and UNIFEM was published by UNIFEM-NIPFP as the \u2018Follow the Money\u2019 Series (Volume III) in November 2003.38 The NIPFP study includes the diagnosis of existing degree of gender inequality in India through sex disaggregation of relevant macro data, quantification of existing non-SNA unpaid care economy work of women, econometric investigation of the link between public expenditure and gender development, budgetary policies through a gender lens and identification of policy alternatives to build in a gender-sensitive national budgeting process. 36 Lahiri et al. 2000. 37 For details, refer to Beneria 1992. 38 Lahiri et al. 2003. 24 Subsequently, the MoF constituted an Expert Group on the \u201cClassification of Budgetary Transactions\u201d under the chairmanship of the Chief Economic Advisor to the Government, where one of the terms of reference of the Committee relates to gender- responsive budgeting processes and priorities at the national level. In the 2004 Budget Speech, the Minister of Finance stated that the Government would examine the Expert Group\u2019s recommendations in this regard, and he hoped it would be possible for him to implement some of them in the Budget for 2005-06. An inter-departmental committee was constituted in November 2004 with his approval. It was chaired by the Secretary, Department of Expenditure, MoF, and includes the Secretary of the DWCD among its members. Its terms of reference include looking at the categorization of expenditures based on the matrices developed by the Expert Group; transparency and accountability of budgetary allocations and effective targeting of public spending by translating gender commitments into budgetary commitments. The 2005-06 Union Budget included a separate statement on the gender sensitivities of budget allocations under 10 demands for grants. It also required all departments to present gender budget statements. In due course, the gender budget statement increased to include more demands for grants. The gender statement also broke down gender- sensitive allocations into specifically targeted programmes for women and public expenditure with pro-women allocations. Coming to subnational initiatives on gender budgeting, DWCD, Government of India has begun gender budgeting exercises using NIPFP methodology for 15 major States in India. The heterogeneity of the team working with DWCD, Government of India and UNIFEM, inclusive of academia, feminist economists, macro policy makers including MoF and the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Parliamentarians and leading feminist activists, has been the strength and sustainability of the DWCD-UNIFEM initiative on gender budgeting at NIPFP. This gender budgeting team in India provided a smooth platform for a feedback mechanism between budget experts and gender experts as well as macro policy makers and micro-level functionaries. The rigour of NIPFP macro-level empirical analysis of budgets through a gender lens coupled with micro-level efficiencies fed into sectoral studies at sub-national levels marks the strength of the 'Follow the Money Series' studies published by UNIFEM in co-ordination with the Government of India. The lack of disaggregation of data by sex on the tax revenue side thwarted a detailed analysis of the tax side to a considerable extent. However, looking at the income tax rules documents through a gender lens in the NIPFP study, only one tax exemption is identified under Section 88C for women. Tax exemptions under Section 88C marginally affect women in India as only 4 per cent of economically active women are in the formal sector. Currently, a study is being conducted at NIPFP looking into the plausibility of analysing gender on the taxation front, through both direct and indirect taxes39 and a policy workshop has been conducted by NIPFP to brainstorm the policy options to integrate gender concerns in taxation.

This CDS Report41 not only attempted an ex-post gender analysis of the Kerala State Budget 2007-08, but also provided a roadmap for institutionalizing gender budgeting within the Kerala Department of Finance, thereby introducing a Statement on Gender Budgeting in the budget documents. Subsequent to the recommendations in the Report, a significant move in this direction began in Kerala with the announcement by the Finance Minister in his Budget Speech 2008 that from next year onwards a special Statement on Gender would be submitted to the legislature along with the Budget, as is done at the central government, along with other policy announcements for institutional mechanisms. However, own resources at the local level are too meagre for most States, and the third tier of the government depends heavily on intergovernmental transfers from higher tiers of government. Among all the countries in the region, India shows a distinct great leap forward in gender budgeting at national and sub-national levels; and also in building sustainable institutional mechanisms. India\u2019s best practise example has been emulated by certain countries in South Asia. To summarise, in the light of the hypotheses, the Indian experience highlighted that mandatory earmarking (30 per cent Women Component Plan in Ninth Five Year Plan) of earmarking of funds is only a second-best principle of GRB as it neither ensures appropriate apportioning of funds linked to the gender needs in the sector, nor an accurate identification of programmes for women. However, in the case of Kerala, at the local level, the Women Component Plan worked relatively better as there was an ex-ante identification of gender needs via the institutional mechanisms of grama sabha before the budget. The Kerala experience also highlighted that feminisation of governance can lead to appropriate expenditure decisions favouring women; while grama sabha consultations also highlighted that incorporating spatial gender needs turned out to be a better model than \u2018one size fits all\u2019 homogeneous policies set by central governments for all rural and urban local GRB practices in India. IV.2.3 Nepal The process of mainstreaming gender into macro policy making began in Nepal since 1994, with a UN initiative with the National Planning Commission of the country. It was a sectoral initiative, in which sectors of the Eighth Plan, including agriculture, energy, tourism, labour and industry were analysed through a gender perspective. Subsequently, the Planning Commission developed a gender auditing module, which was incorporated into the Ninth Plan (1997-2002). The Tenth Plan has continued to employ the same module, with the metamorphosis of the process into gender budgeting. Since then, gender auditing of the budgetary process has been conducted, for both taxation and expenditure, to identify gaps that create gender inequality. This facilitated taking corrective measures. 40 CDS is an academic institute in Kerala affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru University. 41 Chakraborty, 2008a. 26 Gender budgeting in Nepal was initiated by UNIFEM in co-ordination with a research institute. UNIFEM commissioned a study to undertake a gender analysis of the budget process, its allocations, expenditure and sources of revenue. Apart from the research component, UNIFEM also initiated a series of within government activities including sensitising the Gender Focal Points of line Ministries on gender budgeting. In Fiscal Year 2003-04, UNIFEM supported the implementation of guidelines for the Ministry of Finance for the inclusion of gender perspectives in the budgetary policy of sectoral Ministries. These guidelines were further revised by the Planning Commission to undertake gender budgeting at sub-national levels. Simultaneously, the Ministry of Women, Child and Social Welfare in co-ordination with National Planning Commission instructed all Ministries and Departments to incorporate gender perspectives in the formulation of the budget in consultation with gender focal points. The second phase of gender budgeting was undertaken by UNDP with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Local Development for the conducting of gender-responsive budgeting at local levels. This strategy seeks to involve local government officials in carrying out this work.

UNIFEM facilitated the exchange of technical expertise from India, which successfully ensured the institutionalisation of gender budgeting and hence its sustainability as well. UNIFEM supported visits of Ministry of Finance officials to India to learn the process of institutionalisation since mid-2000.42 In 2005, the Ministry of Finance explicitly announced a policy of initiating gender budgeting through a Budget Statement. A Gender Budgeting Committee was instituted in the same year to operationalise the gender budget policy. The task of the Committee was to identify the intensity of gender allocations in the budget sing a scoring methodology. Each programme/project was to be rated on a 100-point scale, with each of the following five indicators allocated 20 potential points: (i) Participation;, (ii) Capacity building; (iii) Benefit sharing; (iv) Increased access to employment and income earning opportunities; and (v) Reduction in women\u2019s work load. With these indicators, a score-based classification of budget allocations in terms of gender was arrived at as follows: (i) Directly gender responsive allocations, if the score is 50 per cent or higher; (ii) Indirectly gender responsive, if the score is 20 to 50 (>20 to 50); and (iii) Gender neutral if the score is less than 20 per cent. However, this score-based classification is still in experimental stages and this methodology involves a significant amount of subjectivity in the analysis. The subjectivity in deciding the scores based on each indicator 42 Yet another entry point of gender budgeting within macro policy making is the PRSP process, in which Nepal attempts to integrate gender budgeting. However, until the 2008 budget, the process of gender budgeting was still in early stages with only references in government documents including the National Economic Survey of Nepal and the Tenth Five-Year Plan document, and the National Planning Commission Budget Guidelines. There were successful sectoral initiatives on gender budgeting by UNDP in education, health and agriculture. Later, UNIFEM reentered the process and successfully led the government towards an institutionalization process. 27 itself is the major limitation of this methodology. The criteria developed in Nepal though broader assessment than just benefit analysis, focusing on empowerment components, has been innovative; nevertheless, improvements are needed to operationalize the approach.43 IV.2.4 The Philippines Gender budgeting in the Philippines is a good example to calibrate how the process can transcend national budgets and could effectively be carried out at sub-national levels. The Philippines is an archipelago of 7,100 islands and home to people speaking as many as 87 languages and dialects. This may explains why, historically, the political structure of the Philippines has been of a decentralized nature - each barangay or village was ruled by its own chieftain, spoke its own dialect and formulated its own laws based on tradition and needs.44 However, the substantive process of fiscal decentralization started in the Philippines with the enactment of the Local Government Code (LGC) only in 1991. The LGC institutionalized the systematic allocation of powers and responsibilities between the national and local governments.45 Fifteen years into the implementation of the Code, however, integrating gender in the planning and budget policies of local government is a relatively new approach. Gender-responsive budget policy initiatives started at the national level in the Philippines with the GAD (Gender and Development) budget in 1995. The GAD budget made a provision for earmarking at least 5 per cent of all departmental expenditure on programmes for women in national and sub-national budgets. Chakraborty (2006c) noted that fixing a floor for spending on gender resulted in a misallocation of resources in various departments. It also resulted in the marginalisation of gender issues from mainstream budgeting, as floor limits were taken as ceilings in various departments. As we have noted before, earmarking a specific proportion of budget allocation for women is only a second-best principle of gender budgeting and may not be the most appropriate tool to sensitize the budget to gender. Under quota-based gender budgeting, money was earmarked for such activities as ballroom dancing in certain Departments. As there was no penalty for not utilizing the GAD budget fully and efficiently, many Departments ended up with an unspent surplus in the GAD budget.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f2637ff-ebc3-476c-bddb-ca7afc2223b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f2637ff-ebc3-476c-bddb-ca7afc2223b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "858bfcc922d9e4dbc8d7c612dcab2b95dfaab0e270a4bf4a68b3a829afec0528"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f5fc6b0-6182-47c6-ae93-c95a9dab9812", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b53ec6d378c35ab7e165ac69f9b135f154721cef21efb6b1fc9a23f9e9875a0"}}, "hash": "d262e96b3be43e5cb7409f46cc31f6644799130b390874cc749749ee197ab0cb", "text": "Chakraborty (2006c) noted that by comparison, differential targeting of expenditures based on the identification of appropriate programmes for women in various sectors, or a reprioritizing of expenditures based on a generic list of appropriate programmes and policies for women might be more effective than a uniform targeting of 5 per cent across board. 43 Information shared during the South Asian Regional Meeting on GRB (Kathmandu, 2008), organised by UN", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2757c54a-3a8b-4d9c-83be-31e3046f7fcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "2757c54a-3a8b-4d9c-83be-31e3046f7fcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3092bcdcae12d56b3eb033059e6944719a10ed536f13e2205367e407bc985858"}, "3": {"node_id": "c06bea88-581d-4ca0-ac80-e512f4025609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42905d49385262154be2c9963f3cb76486e2503186a4e9beba41c52ed4e3a192"}}, "hash": "34ac1a670dd9610283205aeb24b8a8368e296b8b51dfcc11f3aa13eff6d2be95", "text": "Women. 44 These rudiments of the decentralized system in the Philippines were strongly affected by the period of colonial domination. A centralized ruling structure was a prominent characteristic legacy of the Spaniards, the Americans and the Japanese conquest of the country. However, since independence in 1946, the Philippines moved towards decentralization. In the 1946-72, period many laws related to local autonomy were enacted, such as the Local Autonomy Act of 1959 and the Decentralization Act of 1967, to grant fiscal and regulatory powers to local governments. The 1973 Constitution also made it mandatory for the state to \u201cguarantee and promote the autonomy of the local governments to ensure their fullest development as self-reliant communities\u201d. However, twenty years of authoritarianism in the form of martial rule acted as a barrier to the attempts towards decentralization. Termination of this era saw the re-emergence of democracy through people\u2019s empowerment. 45 Section 17 Republic Act 7160, Local Government Code of 1991. See Chakraborty 2006c. 28 However, with the strengthening of the fiscal decentralization process in the Philippines, local government units (LGUs) were provided with more opportunities gender- responsive budgeting, and encountered more challenges as well. The devolution of basic functions like health, social welfare and agricultural extension to the LGUs created more space to incorporate gender needs at the local level. Some LGUs have indeed used this opportunity to initiate gender-responsive policies. Chakraborty (2006c) noted, however, that as devolved functions were largely unfunded mandates, and since intergovernmental transfers and budgetary process at the local level were largely politically determined, the resource gap posed serious challenges for effective decentralization and for gender budgeting initiatives as well. Gender budget initiatives at the local level can be found in a few barangays in the Philippines, particularly in Sorsogon and Hilongos, where selective attempts were made to identify specific gender needs before drafting of the budget. These initiatives, which came from the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (NCRFW) with the support of UNIFEM in 2004, took a step forward from GAD to the identification of entry points for results-oriented gender-responsive budgeting. This approach falls broadly under the category of ex-ante analysis of gender budgeting discussed in section III. However, local level GRB has been a highly sectoral process in the Philippines. In Sorsogon, the initiative was taken in the health sector; where gender-related MDG health goals were identified and budgeted. In Hilongos, the initiative was taken in the agriculture sector. At first glance, agriculture might appear to be a gender-neutral sector. Strengthening the agricultural sector has clear gender-differential impacts, potentially reducing the forced migration of women, and enhancing their income- earning opportunities. There has been no direct attempt so far to incorporate gender concerns into inter- governmental fiscal relations in the Philippines. Given the asymmetries in the assignment of functions and finance, a significant prerequisite of gender budgeting is to overcome the issue of unfunded mandates. Chakraborty (2006c) noted that intergovernmental fiscal transfers in the Philippines have conflicting aspects. On one hand, there is a well-defined formula-based transfer system of Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), where 40 per cent of central government collection of own revenue is allocated to the LGUs. On the other hand, there are arbitrary fiscal transfers of pork-barrel funds, distributed through political patronage, which are regressive and inconsistent with the principles of devolution. In spite of the institutional reforms in fiscal devolution attempted through the Local Government Code 1991, the existence of politically determined fiscal transfers led to the continuation of unbalanced central-local sharing of finances. Though the inclusion of legal and institutional mechanisms for the participation of sectoral representatives and civil society in local governance has been one of the remarkable features of the Local Government Code, the gender balance of these structures is not satisfactory. Chakraborty (2006c) noted that even the formula-based IRA were distributed on an arbitrary basis, resulting in a highly politicized system that reinforced greater control over local governments instead of enhancing local autonomy. Another important question is whether the fiscal transfer system in the Philippines has an equalizing impact.

Given the systemic economic differences between the sexes, such neutrality should not allow fiscal transfers to ignore gender-specific needs. A centrally determined \u2018one size fits all\u2019 gender policy through a national GAD budget cannot be a solution to redress gender inequities in a country with 42,000 barangays, 115 cities, 1492 municipalities and 80 provinces. Given the heterogeneity in the efficiency of public service provisioning across jurisdictions, Guevara (2004) noted that it may be timely to consider an asymmetric federalism48 approach in the context of the Philippines; one way of looking at this would be a process of accreditation where LGUs which pass minimum standards in service and product delivery and specific attributes of governance would be given greater autonomy in functions and finance. This requires benchmarking the governance of local governments, which may catalyse horizontal competition among LGUs. It can bring about gains in efficiency and an increase in productivity through the \u2018Salmon mechanism\u2019 in which intergovernmental competition is activated by benchmarking the performances of other governments in levels and quality of services, levels of taxes or more general economic and social indicators.49 Voters and opposition parties compare the supply performance of their governments with the benchmark performance, and in so doing influence supply decisions.50 In most developing countries, the institutions required for benchmarking intergovernmental competition do not exist; however, in the context of democratic decentralisation in the Philippines, where there is a heightened level of public consciousness on local governments through participatory governance, benchmarking of local governance could be relatively easy51. This might quite appropriate for gender assessment, since LGUs are the entry point for implementing programmes that promote gender equity along with poverty reduction; and agencies are involved in ranking the performance of local governments in terms of public service delivery. For instance, UNDP ranks LGUs relative to an index that measures efforts of communities to improve the life of the poor. UNICEF 46 Chakraborty 2006c. 47 Guevara (2004) noted that Congress applied a literal interpretation of equity, that is, giving each local government the same share regardless of its needs and resources. Yet, there was nothing in the grants system that equalized resources of LGUs with their expenditure functions, or any factor that equalized disparities in their resource capabilities. Further, due to the lack of factors in the distribution formula to equalize tax capacities and expenditure needs, grants not only failed to equalize, but have been counter-equalizing as LGUs with more revenues, higher taxable capacity and more expenditure outlays receive more grants. The formula has even introduced perverse incentives for a LGU to split so as to receive additional IRA resources. The IRA formula provided an incentive for the conversion of a municipality into a city. As a consequence of the vertical assignment of IRA, 23 per cent of the Allotment is shared by 115 cities, as compared with 1492 municipalities that share 34 per cent. 48 \u201cAsymmetric federalism\u201d refers to federalism based on unequal powers and relationships in political, administrative and fiscal arrangements between the units constituting a federation. Asymmetry in the arrangements in a federation can be viewed both vertically (between central and states) and horizontally (among the states). If a federations is deemed an \u2018indestructible union of indestructible states\u2019, and t center and states are seen to exist on the basis of equality, neither has the power to make inroads into the defined authority and functions of the other unilaterally. See Rao and Singh 2004. 49 Salmon 1987. 50 Breton 1996; Salmon 1987, cited in Rao 2006. 51 The Philippine Center for Policy Studies, Galing Pook awards Foundation and Synergeia Foundation are among the organisations in the Philippines that benchmark governance of local governments (Guevara 2004). 30 evaluates the efforts of LGUs in making their communities child and women friendly52. Chakraborty (2006c) noted that gender-sensitive benchmarking of local governance can empower women to compare the relative performance of their governments in terms of the tightness of Wicksellian connections53 and influence supply decisions of their jurisdictions to design and implement appropriate policies and programmes to ensure gender equity. Yet another point to be noted here is that the benefits of decentralised public service delivery can critically depend on elite capture.54 The risk of fiscal decentralization is the dominance of elite groups within the jurisdiction, and their influence in control over resources and in the decision making related to investments in public goods and governance.55", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cbfaee1-2d4b-448a-848f-870cb972c00f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cbfaee1-2d4b-448a-848f-870cb972c00f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62ab405ffd4bdb6f6bf7cc681768c3d79327011fa38bda0e50d039aaf104294f"}, "3": {"node_id": "74cba726-bef4-4d98-afd1-3a67da452d3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6dc4ca86a1c3125ca76d40d5917dd844eafa2dcd0dd9733d633451a7a14d1ba"}}, "hash": "cfa2dcb11b044332398ba3d6db601759cf8a7c32a62bf608e91133f871926a28", "text": "There is growing evidence that power at the local level is more concentrated, more elitist, and applied more ruthlessly against the poor than at the centre.56 A study noted that local governments in the Philippines are not consistently responsive to local preferences; and information flow to constituents tend to be at the discretion of local leadership. When leaders limit the available information, the potential for elite capture of local government is enhanced.57 This may explain the apparent weakness of local accountability. In particular, the \u2018voice\u2019 of women may be neutralized by pressure groups. In addition, if the women in governance are comparatively less empowered, with minimal or no education and basic capabilities, their ad hoc decisions on the systems of public goods and services will not have any major impact on poor and needy women. If local elites capture the benefits of decentralised socio-economic programmes, this will in turn result in under-investment in public goods and services for poor women. This is particularly true in the context of heterogeneous communities and underdeveloped rural economies.58 The above analysis of gender in fiscal decentralisation in an eclectic paradigm applies to the aggregate level. However, to better understand the nuances of gender in fiscal decentralisation, it is important to go beyond the aggregate analysis of intergovernmental fiscal relations. The Local Government Code of 1991 transferred broadly five basic functions from the national government agencies to LGUs, viz., agriculture, health, social welfare and development, environment and natural resources, public works and highways.59 Chakraborty (2006c) examined the decentralisation process of a few sectors to assess the effectiveness of fiscal decentralisation in gender budgeting. She assessed two LGU units, Sorsogon and Hilongos in the health and agriculture sectors. Though these two units are small given the total number of LGUs, the process of local-level gender-responsive budgeting initiated by them helps illustrate the both the process and the context of fiscal decentralization in the Philippines. The study noted that the early phase of the Philippines experience indicates that decentralization per se does not always improve efficiency, equity or the effectiveness of the 52 Asian Institute of management ranks cities in terms of their competitiveness, eg., adequacy of infrastructure, transparency in dealing with the local bureaucracy (Guevara 2004). 53 In simple terms, a Wicksellian connection is a link between the quantity of a particular good or service supplied by centers of power and the tax price that citizens pay for that good or service. Breton (1996) argued that competition between centres of power, if it was perfect and not distorted by informational problems, would also generate completely tight Wicksellian connections. In the real world, competition is, of course, never perfect and informational problems abound and, as a consequence, Wicksellian connections are less than perfectly tight. Still, as long as some competition exists, there will be Wicksellian connections. See Breton and Fraschini 2004. 54 Bardhan 2002; Bardhan and Mookherjee,2000. 55 Prud\u2019homme 1995. 56 Griffith 1981. 57 Meagher 2000. 58 For details, see Bardhan and Mookherjee 2000. 59 Local Government Code, Section 17 (b). 31 health sector; instead, it can exacerbate inequities, weaken local commitment to priority health issues and decrease the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery by disrupting the referral chain. The effectiveness of fiscal decentralization further constrained when, for example, financing of health sector in the Philippines by national and local governments is confined to only 30 per cent, while 47 per cent of health sector financing is through out-of- pocket expenditures of households. Given that health care utilization is responsive to pricing, the implication of disproportionately high reliance on out-of-pocket payments is that poor households are likely to be pre-empted from facility-based care due to price barriers. Chakraborty (2006c) noted that with the increasing feminisation of poverty, the regressive nature of out-of-pocket payments has an adverse impact on poor women in their access to the health care system. Women are also constrained by non-price barriers in utilizing health care; these include knowledge and information, attitudes and values, distance and time. In terms of pricing and location advantage, it is the public health care network, including provincial and district hospitals and barangay health stations, that is most accessible to poor households, especially to rural women. With the strengthening of fiscal decentralisation and the GAD budget initiative in 1995, a revamping of the health sector became necessary to overcome the initial disequilibrium of the devolution of health service delivery to the local level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74cba726-bef4-4d98-afd1-3a67da452d3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "74cba726-bef4-4d98-afd1-3a67da452d3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62ab405ffd4bdb6f6bf7cc681768c3d79327011fa38bda0e50d039aaf104294f"}, "2": {"node_id": "3cbfaee1-2d4b-448a-848f-870cb972c00f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cfa2dcb11b044332398ba3d6db601759cf8a7c32a62bf608e91133f871926a28"}}, "hash": "c6dc4ca86a1c3125ca76d40d5917dd844eafa2dcd0dd9733d633451a7a14d1ba", "text": "Sorsogon attempted a scientific approach to ex-ante local-level gender-responsive budgeting in the health sector by identifying gender-related health needs at the local level.

In other words, the process identified gender needs, translated them into GAD medium-term targets, and prioritised them for inclusion in annual budgets. A heterogeneous group consisting of sectoral organizations, civil society, doctors and representatives from community-level organizations prepared the GAD plan and budget. The gender balance of these groups was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, the Local Health Board had to approve the GAD plan and the budget before submitting it to city councillors for approval. This local-level GRB process divided GAD plan and budget into organization- focussed projects (e.g. capacity building) and client-focussed projects (e.g. Under-five Clinic (UFC) programmes, nutrition, CDD and ARI Surveillance etc.). However, GAD objectives suffered from insufficient funds for gender and health services as the committed expenditure within the health budget remained quite high, and local government remained highly dependent on fiscal transfers (IRA) as well. Gender issues in the decentralization of the agriculture sector are very wide. Food security is a major concern.. Since women are key contributors to intra-household food and nutrition security, decentralization has implicit gender dimensions. The Philippines has been classified by FAO as a food-deficit country, and is at risk of missing its MDG target of halving the proportion of malnourished people by 2015.60 However, a 2005 study61 conducted for Bulacan Province in the Philippines on the relationship between decentralized governance and food security - based on a randomized experiment with ninety-six farmers and ninety-six rural housewives in from twenty-four barangays in eight municipalities - revealed that decentralization improved farmers\u2019 productivity to increase the supply level of 60 See Edralin and Collado 2005. 61 Edralin and Collado 2005. 32 basic food items and their continued availability. The study also noted that decentralisation improved people\u2019s livelihood opportunities through diversifying their income sources, which has reduced their dependence on a single resource (farming), and their vulnerability to natural hazards and uncertain returns in volatile markets. It showed that devolution has also empowered local communities to address their own basic needs. Stagnation in the agriculture sector is one of the factors behind \u2018inter-regional labour mobility\u2019, especially by women, in the Philippines. Theoretically, citizens who are dissatisfied with the public provisioning of services by one local government can \u201cvote with their feet\u201d by moving to another jurisdiction that better meets their preferences. In practice, there are many constraints on such mobility, especially in the case of women. Nevertheless, there is evidence of inter-jurisdictional labour mobility by women for wage employment. One component of the local GRB in Hilongos was revamping the irrigation system and strengthening other policies to increase agricultural productivity with an objective to decrease the migration of women to urban areas to become domestic workers. Indeed, labour mobility may be a form of local accountability, when citizens reveal their preferences by strengthening \u2018exit\u2019. To summarise the Philippines example, the discussion has shown the weakness inherent in simple mandatory earmarking of funds. The 5 per cent GAD budget did not meet the intended objectives because of inappropriate identification of programmes for women in some sectors, and underutilisation or misappropriation of funds in other sectors. The Philippines example also highlighted the fallacy of homogeneous policies on GRB at the national level, which failed to translate into intended outcomes. The country later moved to results-oriented budgeting and GRB at more decentralised levels. The examples of local level GRB in two barangays highlighted the significance of spatial mapping of gender needs before budgeting. However, the Philippines experience of local GRB has not tested the potential of feminisation of governance to transform expenditure decisions in favour of women.

Sri Lanka\u2019s overall index of gender-related development has improved over the years and women in Sri Lanka enjoy high life expectancy, universal literacy and access to health, compared to other South Asian countries.

Sri Lanka's commitment to gender is explicit. Sri Lanka signed CEDAW in 1980 and ratified it in 1981, without any reservations. Key policy documents, \u201cThe Future \u2013Regaining Sri Lanka\u201d and \u2018Poverty Reduction Strategy\u201d identify gender equity as one of the priority 33 areas.62 However, these policies were implemented in the context of a protracted fiscal crisis, manifested in a debt-to- GDP ratio of 105 per cent and negative economic growth of 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2002. Gender budgeting initiatives in Sri Lanka have taken place in two phases. Sri Lanka joined the Commonwealth countries pilot project in 1997, which was the first phase. The initial gender-sensitive budget analysis in Sri Lanka was co-ordinated by the Department of National Planning. It focussed on the portfolios of health, education, public sector employment, agriculture, industry and social services. The report found that there was equality of access and usage in mainstream public expenditure - 48 per cent of recurrent expenditure benefited females in the education sector, in the health sector the share was 56 per cent, and in other social services it was 57 per cent.63 However, in production sectors such as agriculture and industry, the access and participation of women in government- supported programmes was low, and the intrinsic assumption that these programmes are gender neutral is likely to leave unchanged or widen gender disparities in these sectors. The report stressed that there is no need for an increase in funding for women; what was needed was an evaluation and redesign of existing programmes, and devising appropriate benefit impact monitoring systems that would be sensitive to gender imbalances. The immediate visible outcome of the Commonwealth study was the specific reference to women's contribution to the external sector of the economy in the 1999 Budget Speech. However, the exercise was not sustained, but was confined to a one-off analysis of a few sectors, with little dissemination of the initiative to relevant Departments, academia and civil society. For these reasons, the initial phase of gender budgeting in Sri Lanka did not continue. The second phase of gender budgeting in Sri Lanka was a UNIFEM initiative. Against the backdrop of the new economic programme \u2018The Future \u2013 Regaining Sri Lanka\u2019 (FRSL), the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs in co-ordination with UNIFEM, South Asia, undertook a second round of gender budgeting in December 2002. FRSL was part of the Government\u2019s \u2018Poverty Reduction Strategy\u2019 (PRS) in consultation with government agencies, donors, NGOs and the private sector. Gender was identified as a priority area for effective tracking of PRS implementation. Government is committed to mainstreaming gender in all anti-poverty efforts, and to build a society free of violence against women and children. The new initiatives were proposed to combat gender discrimination, to protect women\u2019s rights, promote employment and income opportunities and entrepreneurial development programmes for women, quality early childhood and pre-education for all children, support for victims of violence against women, support to female-headed households and the conducting of gender sensitization programmes. UNIFEM carried out high level consultations with the Government of Sri Lanka, specifically the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Ministry of Finance and other relevant Ministries, the Finance Commission of Sri Lanka, academia and civil society. Technical experts on gender budgeting from India also participated in this high-level consultation. The second phase of gender budgeting initiated by UNIFEM through these consultations focussed on national budget analysis broadly following the NIPFP study done in India. \u2018Macroscan of Union Budget 2003 through a gender lens\u2019, commissioned by UNIFEM at the government\u2019s request, examined the amount and allocation of programmes 62 Government of Sri Lanka 2002b: pages 78 and 179. 63 Commonwealth Secretariat 2000. 34 for women from the expenditure budgets.64 Because of very high debt servicing obligations, the share of interest payments in total expenditure has been growing over time. Since interest payments are a committed expenditure of the government, their growth affects other non- interest expenditures. Unlike India, where Expenditure Budgets are in 'programme-based classification', the budget of Sri Lanka emphasises broadly economic classifications.65 This made gender analysis of the budget more difficult. Apart from providing object details of Projects, it was difficult to undertake a gender sensitive categorisation of expenditure exclusively from budget documents, unless supplemented with information from the individual Ministries of Sri Lanka.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7514aa2-ce31-49e1-8918-9808be6f14b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7514aa2-ce31-49e1-8918-9808be6f14b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c556d2a42b928027a0a6996d39f4745483a0e7c45ef42cc2b7696728e0cf8ace"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcfdb4ba-3436-4538-b115-c749d6382b5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c0fb5f007d865676b3bef2f902d52c41b7b41e89aec3b5128318541bb4dcdca"}}, "hash": "0cb859deae098daf7eb5418d3b539a705561fb8e05ae861312ca4d3dbc51a7b1", "text": "Five matrices were sent to the selected Ministries to obtain the budgetary allocations in terms of gender budgeting.

The study was conducted in close association with the Ministry of Finance. The study was translated into the national languages and disseminated to government and non-government agencies.66 The study analyzed three categories of expenditure: (i) Gender-specific programmes with 100 per cent of the budget allocated to women; (ii) Pro-women programmes with at least 30 per cent of the budget allocated to benefiting women; and (iii) Programmes with allocations that did not fall under the other two categories. Prior to the gender analysis of budget programmes, a situation analysis was undertaken, along with an assessment of aggregate budget trends for 1999-2003. The situation analysis examined the unequal positioning of men and women in different sectors of society through the use of selected gender indicators (education, health, nutrition and labour force). The study concluded that programmes for women comprised a negligible 0.09 per cent of total budget allocations across ministries. The study called for the improvement of information systems for the collection of sex-disaggregated data. Subsequent to the study67, in the budget policies of 2004 there were two specific announcements related to gender. One was that the Ministry of Women's Affairs has prepared a set of guidelines on allocation and disbursement of funds to women under various sector development projects. The other related to Ministries allocating 10 per cent of expenditure in their budgets to programmes for improving the status of women.68 V. DISTILLING GENDER BUDGETING EXPERIENCES: LESSONS LEARNED The overall review of gender budgeting paints a very bleak scenario regarding the progress of gender budgeting in the region. Country experiences suggest that South Asian countries have advanced in terms of gender budgeting when compared with other countries in the region. The process of institutionalisation has been materialised only in the context of 64 Chakraborty 2003b. 65 Economic classification of budget broadly categories expenditure in terms of wages and salaries, transfers, subsidies, grants and capital expenditure. 66 Chakraborty 2003b. 67 Chakraborty 2003b. 68 Budget Speech of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance, Govt of Sri Lanka, Colombo. 35 India. One of the main reasons for the success stories within South Asia is the attempt to integrate gender budgeting processes within government rather than limiting the approach to sectoral initiatives by civil society organisations. UNIFEM and UNDP have played a crucial role in integrating gender budgeting within the government, especially in the South Asian region (Box 2).

While countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan looked at the entire budget through a gender lens, in other countries like Fiji and Malaysia, attempts were largely sectoral. With the advent of fiscal decentralization, a few countries have attempted to start the gender budgeting initiatives at subnational levels. India, the Philippines and Australia are the prime examples. Sri Lanka has been trying to begin the process in co-ordination with the Finance Commission of the country. In the context of India, the Expert Group Report on \u201cClassification of Budgetary Transactions\u201d by the Ministry of Finance -- the Report which led to the institutionalization of gender budgeting in India \u2013 stated that in line with the central government methodology, the State of Karnataka would undertake gender budgeting at the sub-national level in India. However, within- government initiatives in Karnataka have not progressed far. Nonetheless, the State of Kerala has advanced in terms of providing policy pointers for institutionalizing gender budgeting within government through the budget announcement of 2008. The success stories suggest that involvement of academic institutions which enjoying acceptability with government \u2013 especially with the Ministry of Finance \u2013 is a significant prerequisite in the success of gender budgeting. A judicious mix of quantitative and qualitative, as in the case of India, the study by NIPFP may be a successful approach for other countries. However there cannot be a one- size-fits-all approach. The gender diagnosis and fiscal data analysis of countries showed the heterogeneity of fiscal and gender settings in different countries in the region. It is impossible to develop a homogeneous template for gender budgeting for all countries. No blueprint can be attempted for gender-responsive budgets across countries. Once the preparatory analysis of gender budgeting is done, advocacy with government is the next significant step. UNIFEM and UNDP have successfully carried out the advocacy role in South Asian countries, using the academic work done on gender budgeting. UNIFEM published the \u201cFollow the Money Series\u201d, on gender budgeting studies in the region. The political and bureaucratic commitment emanating from this advocacy using hard research has great significance in creating an enabling environment to initiate and sustain gender budgeting within government. The heterogeneity of stakeholders is another element for successful gender budgeting process. The prime stakeholders include ministries of Finance and Women\u2019s Affairs, sectoral ministries, parliamentarians, academia and civil society organizations. Partnership between academia, civil society and the Ministry of Finance is crucial in institutionalizing gender budgeting. This trio can catalyze the process; and country experience suggests that the co- ordination of research organizations and the Ministry of Finance is the best catalyst to institutionalize gender budgeting in a sustainable manner. The involvement of research institutions dealing with public finance can help to avoid lack of clarity in gender budgeting, helping incorporate gender factors in budgetary classification. In such cases, the empirical evidence based on rigorous statistical analysis by research organizations can help the Ministry of Finance understand and appreciate the equity and efficiency dimensions of integrating gender budgeting. Another limitation of gender budgeting initiatives in the region is that most experiences are short-lived and lack institutionalization, with India being the only exception. Coordination between Ministry of Finance officials with academia and civil society is important in taking the process to long term goals. UNIFEM has been co-coordinating the 37 activities among stakeholders in the region towards sustainability and a few countries have shown results as a result of their activities. UNIFEM attempts focus on building up technical expertise, creating awareness generation and capacity building exercises, developing training manuals on gender budgeting etc. Monitoring the outcome of the gender budgeting process is as important as monitoring the inputs. The country experiences suggest that monitoring is broadly confined to financial inputs, with little work on outcomes (impacts). The experiences suggest that there is hardly any systematic mechanism for evaluating the process of implementation of gender budgeting across the region. Inclusion of gender-disaggregated \u2018outcome indicators\u2019 is significant to assess the effectiveness of a gender-budgeting process. A prerequisite to conducting periodic gender-disaggregated benefit incidence analysis is the sex-disaggregated unit utilization data. It is relatively easy to collate unit utilization data related to education and health, such as enrolment data, in-patient hospitalization data etc. However, even within the education and health sectors, the data compilation process is not yet complete in many countries in the region, particularly completion rates in education, and disease-specific morbidity data by sex. The widening of unit utilization data to sectors other than education and health is important to benefit incidence analysis in other social and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b29f105-6dba-4ac2-b7b9-9c23252af8b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b29f105-6dba-4ac2-b7b9-9c23252af8b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "184b0e46d9c1521b251ac3a502640a0748834c8641770cafa1c587c8c8b13fd1"}}, "hash": "184b0e46d9c1521b251ac3a502640a0748834c8641770cafa1c587c8c8b13fd1", "text": "economic sectors including water budgets, agriculture budgets, environmental budgets, labour budgets etc. A tremendous amount of confusion exists on the concept of gender budgeting. While some countries rightly focus on budgets through a gender lens and proceed to expenditure tracking analysis and outcomes, others focus on demystifying budgets for common people from a gender perspective, limited to developing awareness among civil society. Relating to the analytical framework of gender budgeting, the country analysis of gender budgeting revealed that India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka utilized the ex-post analytical framework while Kerala (India) and the Philippines have used some elements of ex-ante gender budgeting. Only India and Sri Lanka have conducted benefit incidence analysis. In assessing the intensity of gender sensitivity of allocations, only Nepal has arrived at a few indicators, such as participation, capacity building, benefit sharing, increased access to employment and income earning opportunities and reduction in women\u2019s work load. VI. POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND THE WAY AHEAD Gender budgeting is a powerful socioeconomic tool for evaluating the gendered impact of macro-economic fiscal and budgetary policies, regularizing gender monitoring as a part of the annual overall monitoring system, increasing the transparency of the budget systems and thus enabling gender advocates and civil society to hold their governments accountable to their national and international commitments, and increasing resources for women and gender equality. The empirical analysis of gender and budgeting for fourteen selected countries in Asia and Pacific -- Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Fiji, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam \u2013 has indicated that South Asian countries lag behind in redressing capability deprivation across gender relative to East Asian countries. The budgetary analysis of these countries showed that GRB initiatives are mainly a function of the size of government in economic and social services, availability of resources after 38 meeting the committed liabilities of government and the overall responsiveness of government to initiate GRB in the country. The analysis of gender-responsive budgeting across these fourteen countries indicated that India is taking a huge lead in the process of gender budgeting at national and sub- national levels, with the Philippines the next best example. Australia has been the pioneer in the process of gender budgeting since 1984; though the initial process lost momentum after a point of time; recently, since 2005-06, the Australian fiscal policy package resumed with gender-sensitive programmes, especially in the care economy sector. Countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh, though starting initiatives in the late nineties, have not achieved institutionalisation, and hence the sustainability of the process is still not clear. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Malaysia are in the initial steps of gender budgeting, their experiments are very recent and in formative stages; while in Fiji, Singapore and Viet Nam the initiatives require clarity. VI.1 Categorization of Countries based on the Degree of Analysis of Gender Budgeting: Best Practices and Missing Ingredients The countries in the Asian and Pacific region are at distinctly different stages of adopting gender budgeting. Ideally, it would be preferable to classify countries as per the share of budget devoted to gender or in terms of the categorization of expenditure mentioned in the section on analytical frameworks. But the paucity of data in most countries regarding the allocations in the budget prevents classification in these terms. The second-best approach is adopted in this section in which the classification is carried out based on the stages of development of gender budgeting. The countries can be broadly categorized as the following four. 1. Setting the Stage: The countries in stage one are those which have made initial attempts to introduce gender budgeting, either as a within-government initiative or a civil society initiative; whether donor driven or not. The activities at this stage can be awareness generation workshops, gender sensitization workshops for budget officials or high-level consultations of UN organizations or other multilateral organizations with government officials on the scope of introducing gender budgeting. 2. Preliminary Analysis: Countries belong to this category are those that have attempted an academic exercise of gender analysis of existing budgets, and/or attempted sustained capacity-building workshops for the concerned officials in partnership with academia and/or have developed gender budgeting training manuals for catalyzing the understanding of various stakeholders around concepts, tools and methodologies for undertaking macro or sectoral gender budgeting. These initiatives are broadly from within government organizations such as a Ministry of Women and Child Development in close association with academia and civil society organizations, whether supported or not by UN agencies or other multilateral or bilateral agencies. 3.

The first and foremost activity in this stage is providing mechanism designs for institutionalization. The initiative for institutionalization broadly comes from the Ministry of Finance (through a budgetary announcement or setting up committees for incorporating gender budgeting or building up an institutional arrangement for conducting gender 39 budgeting) and/or a Ministry of Women and/or other social sector Ministries to integrate gender concerns into fiscal policy making. In the process, gender budgeting cells within Ministries may be set up to provide feedback to incorporate gender into budget documents. 4. Tangible Outcome: Tangible outcomes can be in three phases. One, budgetary announcements related to earmarking gender allocations in budget, such as the GAD budget in the case of the Philippines, with 5 per cent of all ministries\u2019 spending earmarked for gender-related spending. This way of gender budgeting, though not the best principle of gender budgeting, is in a way a tangible outcome in conducting gender budgeting. Two, the incorporation of Gender Budget Statements in ostensibly gender-neutral documents to enhance the transparency of allocations and hence accountability. These gender budget statements assume importance as a first step towards the analysis of budgets through the reprioritization of expenditure, expenditure tracking, impact assessments of gender-related allocations etc. Three, the incorporation of gender budgeting statements in outcome budgets, which no country in the region has so far attempted. The first two relate to integrating gender in financial inputs, while the third refers to the integration of gender in output and outcome.

To be sure, gender budgeting is promoted in some countries as rhetoric rather than substance. For instance, in Korea, sponsoring beauty contests, beautician courses etc. became part of gender budgeting, which reinforces stereotypical notions of femininity rather than addressing real issues relating to women\u2019s empowerment. Even in the case of the Philippines, the example of the earmarking of 5 per cent of expenditures for ballroom dance courses. Although Domestic Violence is an issue of urgent concern across many countries in the region, hardly any gender budgeting initiatives focus on these issues. In the case of India, specific allocations are in the budget to address problems of domestic violence, such as budgetary allocations for short-stay homes for the victims of domestic violence. However, these are budgetary allocations designed as ex-post interventions for domestic violence rather than fiscal allocations to support preventive measures. It is high time that fiscal policy measures supported the implementation of Domestic Violence Acts. VI.2 Comparative Matrix of Specifically Targeted Programmes of GRB in Asia: Distribution (%) Analysis in Total Public Expenditure Within these countries, only India has advanced much in terms of \u2018within Finance Ministry Gender Budgeting initiative\u2019, while Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Nepal and Pakistan tried to involve the Ministry of Finance through an institutional network of gender budgeting initiative at very early levels. No single country demanded higher budgetary allocation as a result of GRB, but several stressed reprioritization of expenditure and enhancing efficiency. A country gender budget matrix has been developed to identify gender-sensitive budget allocations across countries. The empirical analysis of gender-responsive budgeting of selected countries where data was available shows that the budgetary allocation in terms of specifically targeted programmes for women is negligible across countries historically, in spite of a plethora of programmes for women ranging from 29-60 across these countries (Table 3).

Within fourteen countries, only India and Sri Lanka have attempted illustrative benefit incidence analysis of selected mainstream expenditures. 43 Integrating the unpaid care economy in budgetary policies is yet another area of urgent attention. As argued by Becker (1965) in his seminal paper on the theory of allocation of time, the allocation and efficiency of non-market working time may be more important to economic welfare than that of market working time. Yet the attention paid by economists to the market economy skews any paid to the latter, and non-market time continues to remain statistically invisible. Time use data, in this context, are increasingly important as they capture non-market work in addition to the market economy, which in turn has significant macroeconomic policy implications. There is a growing recognition that public investment policy can redress intra- household inequalities in terms of household division of labour by supporting initiatives that reduce the time allocation of women to unpaid work. Examples of such government interventions are improved infrastructure in the water sector, rural electrification, sanitation services and better transport infrastructure. The public infrastructure deficit in rural areas may enhance rural poverty due to the time allocation across gender skewed towards unpaid work, which is otherwise available for income-earning market economy activities. Public investment in infrastructure, such as water and fuel, can also have positive social externalities in educating girls and improving the health and nutritional aspects of the household. For instance, studies noted that easy accessibility to drinking water facilities might lead to an increase in school enrolment particularly girls; in Madagascar, 83 per cent of the girls who did not go to school spent their time collecting water, while only 58 per cent of the girls who attended school spent time collecting water.69 Chakraborty (2008b) analysed the implications of time-use statistics for fiscal policy making especially in terms of public investments in infrastructure in the water sector. The paper provided new evidence on the link between public infrastructure investment and time allocation across gender in the context of selected states in India. The direction of regression coefficients suggests that public infrastructure investment affects market work, non-market work and leisure time in different ways with evident gender differentials. The overall conclusion of the paper is that fiscal policies designed to redress income poverty can be partial if they do not take into account aspects of time poverty. However, despite the growing recognition of integrating the care economy into budgeting policy, only Australia has made commendable beginnings in integrating the care economy into fiscal policy making since 2005-06, from which other countries in the region can draw lessons. Despite the growing recognition of fiscal decentralization in gender development and its growing prevalence in public policy making, there have been relatively few attempts to assess fiscally decentralised policy determination of gender development. Specifically, attempts at fiscally decentralised gender budgeting are scarce; a few related attempts were reviewed in the Philippines and India. Decentralised gender budgeting is important especially when almost all nations in the region allocate a major component of social sector expenditure at the sub-national level. While the Philippines is comparatively advanced in sub-national gender budgeting, India has started initiatives at sub-national government levels, with Kerala the pioneer. The new-found policy space of feminisation of local governance coupled with devolution of functions and finance to the third tier in India provides a channel to adopt a \u2018gender lens\u2019 more effectively in formulating budgets, in two ways. First, it provides a logical entry point for spatial mapping of gender needs ex-ante to budgeting; which is a step forward from \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 gender budgeting policies. Second, greater fiscal autonomy with effective participation of women in governance at lower levels can change public expenditure decisions corresponding more to the preferences (\u2018voice\u2019) of women. An MIT study by 69 Bredie and Beehary 1998. 44 Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2001) has measured the impact of feminization of governance at local levels on outcomes of decentralization with data collected from a survey of all investments in local public goods made by the village councils in one district in West Bengal, India. They found that women leaders of village councils invest more in infrastructure that is relevant to the needs", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7292fde8-b4da-4c1e-8c7a-c0bdcdb6cd23": {"__data__": {"id_": "7292fde8-b4da-4c1e-8c7a-c0bdcdb6cd23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c384c4cbdd3e1dd41c3eb44ce43a5cf5ef3539f402a8f164afb12b5dfc57b343"}}, "hash": "c384c4cbdd3e1dd41c3eb44ce43a5cf5ef3539f402a8f164afb12b5dfc57b343", "text": "of rural women, such as drinking water, fuel and roads, and that village women are more likely to participate in the policymaking process if the leader of their village council is a woman. Thus, placing women in leadership position in governance at the local level can change the expenditure decisions of local bodies and in turn chang the types of public good investments at local levels.70 However, the study has encountered a few criticisms. Bardhan (2002) noted that without direct evidence on the nature of women\u2019s preferences relative to men\u2019s, and since women\u2019s reserved leadership positions in local government were not linked to the distribution of women in the village, this study does not quite address how local democracy may enable underrepresented groups in the village to implement their desired outcomes. The revenue-side analysis of gender-responsive budgeting is at an embryonic stage due to lack of gender disaggregated data with respect to access and utilisation of revenues such as direct taxes, indirect taxes, user charges etc. The differential incidence of taxation across gender is also not possible to quantify due to the lack of sex- disaggregated data on units utilized in the countries under study. India has attempted a study on the gender disaggregated tax incidence of VAT. The results reveal a clear regressivity in the incidence pattern especially in the case of food related commodities and health care.71 Though gender budgeting initiatives have been taken in many countries, further advance is required to mainstream gender in macroeconomic policy in all the countries. The major obstacles to be overcome are changes in budgetary practices, development of required technical expertise in the Ministry of Finance to conduct GRB, and collation of sex- disaggregated data in all departments and ministries. VII STRATEGY AND WAY AHEAD Broadly the major ingredients for the sustainable process of gender budgeting are the following: \u2022 Given that most countries in the region at the initial stages of the process, more work needs to be done in awareness generation and capacity building through technical assistance. UN agencies have an important role to play to strengthen the process. The dissemination of successful country experiences is one of the effective ways of demonstrating the concept of gender budgeting in those countries where the stage of development is limited. \u2022 With the advent of fiscal decentralization, and with significant portion of merit goods allocated at sub-national levels of government, gender budgeting limited to national levels will only be partial analysis. Equally important is sector gender budgeting analysis, not confined to the health and education sectors. 70 Stern 2002. 71 Chakraborty et al. 2010. 45 \u2022 The analysis of the revenue side through a gender lens needs to be deepened. Only two countries in the region -- India and Viet Nam - have attempted the tax-side analysis of gender budgeting. The gender differential impacts of direct and indirect taxes have been analyzed in the context of India through a direct tax code analysis and gendered tax incidence of VAT, while in Viet Nam the gender differential impacts of polices at micro enterprise level has been examined, though not through gender budget analysis. \u2022 Incorporating the statistically invisible care economy is very important for gender budgeting. \u2022 Any new experiment requires new appropriate institutional mechanisms. The successful country experience of India suggests that institutional mechanisms are an important prerequisite in sustaining the process of gender budgeting. \u2022 The transparency of budgetary allocations for women needs to be ensured, together with the accountability of these allocations. Opening of a new budget accounting classification on \u2018gender development\u2019 is the best policy regarding ensuring transparency; but this requires technical skill and political will. Another successful attempt would be to open a page on gender budgeting\u2019 in budget documents, as in the case of India, where gender budget statements would be published within the budget documents annually. \u2022 Monitoring output rather than input; integrating gender budgets into outcome budgets; performance budgets linking resources to results. \u2022 Too many programmes on gender with too little money; avoid token provisions for gender issues in the budget, consolidate programmes with little budgetary provisions. Convergence of programmes is important for gender budgeting. \u2022 Earmarking a certain percent of the budget for women is only a second-best principle of gender budgeting; integrating gender into the whole budget is the best option, and plausible changes in classification of budgetary transactions need to be undertaken to ensure transparency and accountability. The broad conclusion is that gender budgeting is neither primarily an issue of additional resources, nor is it confined to specifically targeted programmes for women. But gender budgeting is making the entire", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f98f4285-3b18-435e-a2eb-da016c912926": {"__data__": {"id_": "f98f4285-3b18-435e-a2eb-da016c912926", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "519b52dca75c151f51456f534784a285cdc61f6efb28b8baf88000bf4429256d"}, "3": {"node_id": "14bac828-dc3c-49b6-bc04-5643257d7acd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/06", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9abf7858b32fac62ddb9f97552f4b0a142d349b0f0b7d98d2d956f46ea84d385"}}, "hash": "b26655895fb673cd8f8837014bc440f2480a5f14049f34804d3e9f305b189bc8", "text": "budgetary exercise more responsive to gender issues.

In fact an inverted U-shaped relationship tends to exist between development and gender gap. This study makes an attempt to examine the inequality in the labour market and poses the question as to what are the prospects for more equality in the labour markets contributing to economic and political equality, and wider equality in other spheres of life, at the household and at the macro level? Finally it argues that there is a need to pursue conscious efforts for promoting gender equality and for providing protection to the women workers who are vulnerably placed in the labour market. The study examines in detail various aspects of labour market inequality in the Asia- Pacific region. An important dimension of the analysis is that labour market inequality aggravates inequalities in other spheres of life including the ability to participate in the decision making process. In particular it results in poor human capital formation which not only reduces the capabilities of the women workers and restricts their upward mobility but also tends to show deleterious effects in inter-generational sense. The existing situation tends to suggest that women\u2019s labor market participation is an outcome of their practical needs in search of a livelihood but hardly their strategic needs are met as gross inequalities often characterise their socio-economic and political life. In assessing various aspects of labour market inequality the study looks into labour market participation, work force participation, employment growth in relation to value added growth, employment structure, unemployment rate, wage levels and wage growth and informal sector employment of women vis-\u00e0-vis men. There is indeed propelling evidence in favour of existing inequalities. Particularly in relation to the informal sector which accounts for a sizeable percentage of workers in the developing countries, and more so in the case of women, it is observed that with limited human capital endowment women often have to combine domestic work with earning opportunities outside home which results in sub- optimal outcomes by reducing their accessibility to full-time and productive work opportunities. Other than being part timers they often face constraints like inability to travel long distances for work. Besides, the nature of job market channels which they access to draw information on the labour market lead to a low equilibrium situation by resulting in overcrowding in certain activities. Informal networks which are again highly limited in nature", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6312980-67b9-4a3b-bae5-bd1368da30cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6312980-67b9-4a3b-bae5-bd1368da30cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1dd3f92730cdacf191eaa81feb0048ac6c122eb53d232361a790b141038b5f79"}}, "hash": "1dd3f92730cdacf191eaa81feb0048ac6c122eb53d232361a790b141038b5f79", "text": "tend to result in information asymmetry leading to segmentation of the labour market, and the network concentration of a particular type give rise to excess supplies of labour in certain activities and in certain pockets. Thus, the wages for the women workers dwindle at a low level and tend to experience sluggish growth over time. Further, the wage inequalities are not only confined to informal sector activities but also many other non-traditional and modern activities. Based on the limited information on the wages in the manufacturing sector and the commonality of the base year wage differences have been studied. Notwithstanding the limitations of the data gender differences are quite perceptible. Based on the detailed occupational data, the female to male nominal wage ratio has been calculated to reflect on the gender discrimination in the labour market in terms of wage inequality. In a large number of countries and for a number of years and occupations female wages have been lower than the male wages. 3 The study noted that labour market inequality spills over to inequality in education, health, political involvement and results in other demographic vulnerabilities. On the other hand, improvement in labour market equality results in reduction in gender inequality in other areas by generating higher levels and better quality of human capital endowment and by enhancing the productive capacity of women. Hence, an important linkage exists between labour market and empowerment in terms of involvement in the decision making process. On the other hand, reduction in gender inequality, particularly in the labour market, results in higher economic growth as women\u2019s contribution to the production process increases with human capital formation. Feminisation of poverty and ever-growing proportion of female population working as cheap labour, growing unemployment, decline in the social power of labour and an increase in temporary, part-time, casual and home-based work are some of the outcomes of the changes that are taking place in relation to globalization and economic reforms. While women increasingly participated in irregular forms of employment, they continued to be responsible for the domestic work. The other pattern which can be discerned in the context of globalization is rising wage inequality, particularly along the lines of skill and education. Women in general being less skilled and less educated, globalization is expected to have aggravated the wage inequality across gender. Though the open unemployment rate is not expected to be very high in the developing countries (for, not too many can afford open unemployment for long), some of the countries like Indonesia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka reported a very high open unemployment rate (either in double digit or close to that) among the females. The other striking pattern is that some of the countries experienced a decline in the female unemployment rate over time but later in the recent past the unemployment rate again seems to have shot up. Shrinkage in the overall employment opportunities because of recessionary tendencies are expected to have dampened the female labour demand. The percentage of female work force engaged in agriculture has been larger than its male counterpart in several countries and in manufacturing it has been just the opposite. Limited spread of the industry, technological reasons and factor price distortions leading to limited demand for labour in the industrial sector are some of the reasons of sluggish labour absorption in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, in several countries the share of services in female work force has been larger than that of males. Many countries are experiencing rapid tertiarization and hence, absorption of female workers in services has possibly been more spontaneous though, whether this pattern of transition will be able to contribute to growth in a sustainable fashion, is an unresolved question. Women\u2019s employment in the service sector is said to be vulnerable to and disadvantaged by the increased competition. The rapid spread of the IT sector has indeed generated employment opportunities in the services sector and both male and female job seekers seem to have benefited in the process. However, most of the benefits have reached only those who are in the higher echelons of the socio-economic ladder. In the recent context of economic reforms several studies have argued in favour of the labour market deregulations. In other words, without labour market deregulations several other macro and trade reforms are expected to be ineffective in generating employment. However, the other pattern which can be discerned in the context of globalization is rising wage inequality, particularly along the lines of skill and education. Besides, the wage 4 premium for the skilled workers is on the rise.

Much of the passion has been shown in deregulating the labour market. However, what is more important is the provision of social safety net and health and educational benefits to the informal sector workers who actually explain much of the poverty in the developing countries. Within the informal sector women are particularly more vulnerable than their male counterparts as their accessibility to resources is meager and their bargaining power in the labour market is poor. Hence, the policy focus cannot afford to ignore the gender dimension. The study recommends certain policy initiatives for reducing the various forms and quantum of inequality in the labour market so as to generate greater human capital formation with which women\u2019s strategic needs can be met and they can be empowered to participate in the decision making process both at the macro and the household level. In the light of our analysis the following policy suggestions are made: (1) Explicit policy interventions would be required to curb inequality in the labour market and make growth more equitable and pro-women. (2) The complementary relation between female and male work participation rates is only marginal. Hence, policy interventions will be required for women\u2019s strategic needs to be met instead of leaving it to the market forces and waiting for demand to grow and bridge the gender gap. (3) Labour intensive technology which will be in compliance with the available skill of women needs to be adopted in various components of the high productivity sector including the large scale manufacturing. (4) Skill formation and entrepreneurial training facilities need to be provided to women workers including those who are outside the labour market. This can enhance the labour market participation rate among women and with enhanced capacities they will be able to access productive jobs. (5) Health related support system for women has to be developed more efficiently. (6) Biases of the employers against women workers need to be eliminated through legal measures so that with equal levels of skill and education women workers should be able to derive the benefits that their male counterparts are able to draw. (7) Several supportive measures to encourage girl children to enroll in schools and for their continuation of studies need to be initiated on a large scale. (8) Working women, particularly in the informal sector, should be able to receive benefits which are usually available only to the formal sector workers. For example, maternity leave and other health related support can secure them against pay loss. (9) Availability of maternity benefits etc. which are accessible mainly by the regular women workers leaving aside a large proportion of women workers engaged in the informal sector are also not adequate to reduce the division of labour at home. What is, therefore, more important is initiation of policies which can sensitise the individuals and ensure involvement of males in child care. To begin with, collection of data on constraints at the home front which impinges on gender inequalities in the labour market is indeed essential. (10) Our findings on women\u2019s employment in the informal sector have important policy implications. It would be useful and cost effective to evolve supportive measures rather than pursuing direct interventions, and in doing so the beneficiaries need to be involved in a big way. Urban specific employment programmes with minimum wage legislation need to be implemented, which would also raise the on-going wages for women workers in activities that they have already been pursuing. Information on job prospects in 5 different parts of the city can be consolidated and communicated to the seekers, and this can be expedited through the initiatives of NGOs. Institutions for skill formation are indeed important for enabling women to experience upward income mobility. Their entrepreneurial interest can be cultivated in terms of such efforts. Besides, the public transport network connecting different geographic locations in the city needs to consider the requirement, timing of travel and the places of destination and origin of these workers from low income households. (11) Expansion of the rural non-farm sector and the involvement of women workers in this sector are indeed crucial for improvement in labour market equality. A shift in self- employment to wage employment is endemic to enhanced access for higher income opportunities.

INTRODUCTION Women can be engaged directly in the development process and they can experience the benefits of growth more equitably by generating increasingly productive employment opportunities for women (Behrman and Zhang 1995). However, there is no country in the world in which women\u2019s quality of life is equal to that of men - quality of life being measured in terms of longevity, health status, educational opportunities, employment and political rights (UNDP human development report 1993). Further, in developing countries the situation is not only uneven but also distressing (Nussbaum and Glover, 1995). In several countries the work participation rates of women are substantially lower than that of men. Even when women are employed they face pervasive wage discrimination not to talk about the long hours of unpaid household labour. Besides, there are several other issues relating to intra-household inequality in terms of consumption, assets and even participation in the decision making process relating to the determination of the family size, education of children and the overall welfare of the household. Though the household head is expected to be an altruistic agent, often the male household head is neglectful of females, whether wives or children, and make decisions inimical to those interests (Nussbaum and Glover 1995). Out of the many issues affecting women\u2019s quality of life in the developing world this study focuses on the employment aspect because it plays a pivotal role in relation to other capabilities of women such as health care and nutrition, self-respect and autonomy and full political functioning (Nussbaum and Glover 1995). Biases against girls/women lead to inaccessibility of girls/women to education and health which results in poor human capital development and a low labour force participation rate among women. This in turn adversely affects the future human capital formation, female labour productivity, individual welfare, health and participation in the decision-making process and also the overall economic growth (United Nations 2007). Other than skill differences between females and males, biases of employers against women employees also restrict their accessibility to high-income jobs. Patriarchy\u2019s gendered division of labour often does not allow women to participate in the labour market on full-time basis, which in turn adversely affects their job market experience and bargaining power (Mitra 2005). That some of these issues can be dealt with in terms of policy initiatives motivates us to undertake this study. Countries under consideration are those within the Asia-Pacific region. Most of them still belong to the developing world and several have witnessed structural reforms and pursued industrialization and liberalization policies vigourously in the recent past. The Asia- Pacific region has made good progress in reducing gender discrimination in recent years, but appalling disparities remain (United Nations 2007). The diversity of the Asian experience is not limited to rates and patterns of economic growth only. Unequal power and unequal voices and certain disadvantages faced by one gender relative to another are some of the primary concerns. Initial conditions, ongoing experience with government plans and policies, and governmental and non-governmental programmes, differences in the political environment, differences in commitment to poverty alleviation and gender equity within each country, traditional gender hierarchies and their impact on women\u2019s participation in work outside the home, the sexual division of labour, migration and control over income all tend to vary across countries and within a country across regions (Sen 1994). In response to globalization, some of these aspects are undergoing changes and new challenges are emerging. All this justifies an in-depth study of the existing inequalities across sexes in these countries. 7 This study takes the position that with improved equality between males and females in terms of work opportunities and other employment characteristics in the labour market, several positive outcomes in terms of economic equality, social equality, political equality, equality in education and health and improvements in demographic status of women will emerge in a significant way. All this would subsequently enhance the overall social status of women and their participation in the decision-making process. Going a step ahead, this paper further argues that labour market equality can lead to higher growth as well, which will indeed be sustainable in the long-run. All this however, must not make an impression that reverse causality is not possible: for example, reduction in inequality in the health sector between females and males can essentially lead to reduction in inequality", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00b4116a-dd98-4a71-9291-e2626e336ee6": {"__data__": {"id_": "00b4116a-dd98-4a71-9291-e2626e336ee6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1782c0389f1041d3eb620775d0afa47a48d0b2972a683ab523329ba8059b89a"}}, "hash": "a1782c0389f1041d3eb620775d0afa47a48d0b2972a683ab523329ba8059b89a", "text": "in the labour market. However, in this analysis keeping in view the affordability issue we perceive the positive outcomes of reduction in inequality in various sectors and a greater voice for women at the household and macro levels being linked to labour market inequality. Since equality is an abstract concept and can be contested endlessly, it is more meaningful to talk about equal opportunities for sexes. These opportunities relate to various aspects of economic, social, demographic, educational, health-related and political life and one must realize that these domains are not mutually exclusive of each other. Each impinges on the other and therefore inequality in one respect spills over to another. Keeping in view the objective of overall human development in an economy, inequalities \u2013 rather unequal opportunities - must be reduced substantially. Human development implies an expansion of human capabilities, a widening of choices, an enhancement of freedom and a fulfillment of human rights. In other words, people\u2019s well-being is the end of development while economic growth is a means (Fukuda-Parr and Kumar 2003). So the first question that arises is whether economic growth is able to generate equal opportunities for both the sexes in the labour market? Second, as mentioned above, what are the prospects for more equality in the labour markets contributing to economic and political equality, and wider equality in other spheres of life, at the household and at the macro level? However, before moving on to these specific questions a central question that remains, relates to: should gender equality in employment be construed as gender parity? Gender disparity in occupations exists all over the world and at times it is deliberately chosen by women for a variety of reasons ranging from personal to attitudinal to gender-specific qualities. On the other hand, as indicated above, gender equality is a much larger concept, overlapping several dimensions of life. Thus, labour market disparities are not necessarily related to gender inequality manifested in terms of economic, social, cultural, demographic, health and educational aspects. With these limitations all that we can assess is if access to equal opportunities for both the sexes in the labour market can lead a society one step further towards gender parity in other areas and if it can enhance capabilities of the disadvantaged sex and help them voice their say in the decision making process. There are various mechanisms by which economic inequality and other forms of inequality can be curbed and only one of them is accessibility to productive employment opportunity. One can talk about property rights which can also result in women\u2019s empowerment in the decision making process (Agarwal 1994). But ownership of property to women will not reduce gender inequality \u2013 it will only change its existing bias in favour of one gender (male) to another. That is the reason why the labour market approach is considered to be a more practical one. In fact, some of the studies while highlighting the importance of women employment, argued that it is better to be exploited in the labour market than at home (Mitra 2002), thereby implying that access to employment offers women 8 to speak against injustice and initiate steps against deprivation. Productive employment enhances the individual capabilities and, more importantly, empowers one to take part in the decision-making process. In the context of women employment, extensive citation has been made of the fact that arise in work accessibility of women improves the accessibility of children, particularly that of the girl children, to education and a nutritious diet. In fact, as the popular saying goes, by offering an opportunity to one woman, the welfare of two individuals can be enhanced \u2013 her own welfare and her child\u2019s welfare. Moreover as we look into the composition of poor households, a sizeable number are women-headed households. Mitra 2006 noted that with the household head being woman the probability of being poor increases significantly. Work opportunities for women in poor households will, therefore, not only reduce poverty in the country but also help them contribute productively to the growth process. Critics may find fault with the employment approach being a basic means of human development and generating pro-poor growth: particularly if women are largely employed in the informal sector, it can hardly result in human capital formation. Therefore, we explicitly highlight the concept of productive employment, which can contribute to human development and curb inequalities not only in economic terms but also in other respects. In fact, Yu (2001) noted that in Taiwan, Province of China, many self-employed and family enterprise women workers in the informal sector possess human capital comparable to formal sector employees", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7f410b5-459e-4d6e-a9a8-8641d6fa2eca": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7f410b5-459e-4d6e-a9a8-8641d6fa2eca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f56c3e1aa9081e118a463802f8652daa7e24b9091659822160bea2a906e0605d"}}, "hash": "f56c3e1aa9081e118a463802f8652daa7e24b9091659822160bea2a906e0605d", "text": "in private enterprises and self-employed women may even have more social capital and receive slightly higher earnings than formal sector employees. So distinctions need to be made between types of employment rather than between sectors. The main objective of this paper is, therefore, to examine the extent to which women have been absorbed in productive employment opportunities relative to men, and this is analysed by critically assessing the labour and work participation rates, elasticity of employment, unemployment rates, employment structure, status of employment, sector of employment and wage inequalities and finally the contributions of increased equality in labour markets to overall gender equality. With a somewhat different perspective, a woman\u2019s role in society can be divided into three main dimensions: (1) reproductive work, (2) productive work and (3) managing work (Moser and Levy 1986). The problem of triple burden in the case of women-headed, low income households are exacerbated, which in particular contexts may result in specific policy implications. As far as women\u2019s interests are concerned, Molyneux (1985) offered a three fold conceptualization, which when translated into planning terms can be identified as women\u2019s needs, strategic gender needs and practical gender needs. The analysis of women\u2019s subordination and identification of an alternative to those which exist at present enable one to derive the strategic gender interests and needs. Practical gender interests and needs on the other hand arise from the concrete conditions of women\u2019s positioning by virtue of their gender within the division of labour. Practical interests are usually a response to an immediate perceived need, which is identified by women within a specific context, and they relate to inadequacies in living conditions faced on a daily basis. So strategic gender needs are the ones which help attain equality. From this point of view, as we pursue labour market analysis and bring out the labour market disparities, they all help us frame policy dimensions that can change the existing conditions and usher in greater equality. Policies for women in developing countries are not to be formulated in isolation but in relation to macro-level economic and social policy approaches to the overall development of these countries. Women\u2019s policies have witnessed a major shift from a welfare approach to an equality approach, and finally to an anti-poverty approach. It is interesting to examine 9 whether each of these three approaches meet both the strategic needs and the practical needs of women. As Moser and Levy (1986) argued, the welfare approach covered the practical needs of women only; however, welfare programs are popular primarily because they are politically safe and do not question the traditionally accepted views on women. The equality approach, on the other hand, meets both needs; with greater equality between women and men it aims at increasing economic growth. The anti-poverty approach links economic inequality between men and women with poverty. Inequality between men and women is expected to get reduced \u201cnot only because the focus is specifically on low income women but also because of the tendency to encourage productivity projects in sex-specific occupations where women concentrate or which are particularly targeted at women-headed households\u201d (Moser and Levy 1986). Among the new challenges that countries are facing, one relates to many women and men who have become the victims of change that globalization has ushered in. Growing casualisation and informalisation of employment, much of which lies outside the purview of labour legislation, social protection and representation, are characterized by low incomes; and high levels of insecurity have affected both men and women. However, women appear to be more disadvantaged than men in certain situations due to withdrawal or denial of state- provided social services, which in the face of an already heavy workload affects women adversely. By and large women appear to be at a greater disadvantage than men in the context of transition (Greve 2000). In a recessionary context when enterprises reduce their employment levels to cope with new situations women seem to be the first to be laid off and in greater numbers than what can be explained in terms of occupational segregation (Einhorn 1993). Once they enter the phase of unemployment it continues for a longer time than for men because their income is thought to be less vital for the family budget (ILO 1993). Though there have been improvements in terms of women\u2019s labour market participation, quality of the work they have access to is still poor. Discrimination and inequalities still persist, forcing women to concentrate in certain jobs and occupations, making their career progression more difficult, denying them equal remuneration, and hindering their access to training and to other resources vital to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d98d171-8554-451d-86fc-5bb134eb9fd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d98d171-8554-451d-86fc-5bb134eb9fd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20466a737d1e0b3485ec2d1e784e7aad5631097963a183963e4497450e64367f"}}, "hash": "20466a737d1e0b3485ec2d1e784e7aad5631097963a183963e4497450e64367f", "text": "their advancement (Greve 2000). Keeping in view the gross inequalities which existed between sexes and given the socio-economic changes that are taking place at a rapid pace, the present study aims at undertaking a detailed analysis of women employment relative to their male counterparts. The organization of the study is as follows. Section 2 reviews some of the available literature relating to women employment. Section 3 focuses on the empirical analysis bringing out the discrepancies in the labour market. Section 4 based on the macro data at the cross-country level tries to demonstrate contributions of labour market equality to reductions in inequality in other spheres. Section 5 deals with the policy issues and the major conclusions are summarized in Section 6. 2. LITERATURE REVIEW Western societies and developing societies are often kept at two extremes assuming that there is a linear relationship between economic development and reduction in gender inequalities. However, Boserup (1970) argues that there is a curvilinear relationship between economic growth and the status of women, implying that the gender gap starts declining only at higher stages of growth. Dutta and Panda (2000) noted that gender inequality gets manifested not only in terms of work and income but also in education, nutritional support and health care. Jalan (2000) supports a \u201cGender Kuznets Hypothesis\u201d over a cross-section of developed and developing countries: for a number of health and education indicators the gender gap shows a tendency to increase with economic development up to a threshold level, and then decreases 10 with further economic progress, exhibiting an inverted U pattern. (Also, there is evidence to suggest that gender inequality reduces economic growth.) Some of the recent evidence also suggests that higher human development index (HDI) does not necessarily ensure gender equality in terms of gender development index (GDI): In the Asia-Pacific context Japan and Korea have the highest HDI-GDI gap while Thailand and China whose HDI and GDI are both lower in absolute terms than Japan and Korea demonstrate lower gender gaps (Murayama, 2005). Gender norms and systems vary widely across cultures but they shape people\u2019s lives and interactions in all societies (Hayase 2005). In general as women\u2019s education improves, gender systems become more egalitarian (UN, 2001). And gender equality is not only a matter of social justice but also good economics: reduction in gender inequalities leads to significant productivity-gains, provides large societal benefits and enhances poverty reduction efforts (World Bank 1995). Therefore, consecrated efforts need to be made to heighten economic growth with reduction in gender inequality. In the context of late industrialization (i.e., economic development under globalization), the development pattern tends to be uneven and telescoped because the country\u2019s modern sector absorbs advanced technology while the other sectors utilize traditional technologies. Since women are largely located in the sectors that do not have access to advanced technology, income differentials across sexes tend to increase (Nogami 2005). Under free market conditions gender differentials in terms of incomes are considerably high across most of the occupations. One explanation is usually offered in terms of skill or productivity differentials across sexes. But within the informal sector many activities do not require highly skilled workers, yet income differentials are high. This can partly be explained in terms of the employers\u2019 bias against women, treating many of them as less productive. However, the actual reason might be somewhat different. Due to household responsibilities, many of the women workers are not able to take up jobs on a full time and regular basis which leaves ample scope for employers to exploit them: part timers possess weaker bargaining power compared to the full timers. Often they are hard pressed to combine multiple tasks on the home front with several jobs in the informal sector, as evidenced in a large number of studies (see Heyzer and Sen 1994; Kalpagam 2001, Kapadia 1992; and Mitra 2005)1. Consequently with greater intensity of work they continue to receive low wages, and at the same time by compensating others\u2019 consumption within the household they eventually remain unfed and undernourished. Mitra (2005) made an attempt to offer a profound explanation of such low earnings for women workers in the informal sector by linking their participation in the labour market to their constrained choice to work near their place of residence, the mechanisms they adopt to search jobs and the physical segmentation of the labour market. 1 Also see Chen 1991; Agarwal 1994; Sen 1994; and Jhabwala 1997. Besides, Jain and Banerjee 1985; Sharma and Singh 1993; Standing 1991; Banerjee 1997; and Bhatt 2001 bring out several interesting aspects of women employment in the informal sector.

Even within the informal sector, which offers lower wages compared to the formal sector, women workers get a bad deal (Mitra and Mukhapadhyaya 1989; Mukhopadhyay 1999; Institute of Social Studies Trust 1997; Kalpagam 2001). Also see Moser and Levy 1986; Chen 1989; SEWA 1989; Sen 1994; Breman 1996; Jhabwala 1997; Unni 1997; Bhatt 2001 and Kalpagam 2001. 11 Even in middle and high-income jobs, women who take career breaks interrupt their accumulation of human capital and end up paying a penalty in terms of lower earnings. Secondly, women who take child related career breaks could pay a further penalty because within the class of women who interrupt their careers, employers might discriminate against those who interrupt careers for family-related reasons. Besides, women who take child- related career breaks might not be able to return to the same type of job and this could generate an income penalty (Arun, Arun and Borooah 2004). Women in general suffer from two sets of discrimination in the labour markets: (a) pre-market discrimination involving lack of access to education, training, experience - factors which increase human capital and enhance the marginal product of labour, and (b) post- market discrimination involving differential wages for a similar quantum of human capital. These constraints imply that a large proportion of the women job seekers land up working in the informal sector which does not require much education or skill (Moser 1989; Tinker 1990; National Institute of Urban Affairs 1991). The study by Lim (1993) on women's participation in the labor force in Asia-Pacific countries suggests that the feminization of labor had contributed both to economic gains and to undesirable consequences. Women were engaged in insecure forms of economic activity, pursuing under poor working conditions. During the 1960s and 1970s, Asian countries grew economically faster than most other regions and female employment, particularly in the non- agricultural sector, grew rapidly during these years. Rapid economic growth coincided with fast industrial growth. Though women in export processing zones contributed more than 80 per cent of total labor in some countries, they received wages covering only the basic cost of living. During the 1970s, women's employment in manufacturing grew faster than that of males in all countries of the region, with the exception of the Philippines (Lim 1993). Female employment was attractive to multinationals and to the service sector as well, as female labour was cheap and the supply was steady. However, the oil crisis affected women more than men. During the structural adjustment, female employment shifted to the informal sector and also out-migration took place. Gradually, labor supply adjusted to the demands of labor- intensive rapid industrialization and export-led development strategies. During the 1980s, the number of adolescent workers declined and older workers increased. UNESCO (2002) confirmed that female workers in developing countries, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Africa, do not have wage jobs. Further, the lower the income level of the country, the higher the percentage of female workers engaged in agriculture. The study by ILO (2000) on Asia-Pacific countries suggests that women's share in total employment is generally lower than their share in total labour force in many countries because the unemployment rate tends to be higher for women than for men. 2.1 Views on Labour and Work Force Participation Rate of Women An important way in which labour market analysis can be pursued at the aggregate level is to examine the labour force participation rate or LFPR (the proportion of labour force, i.e., work force plus the unemployed, to the total population) and the work participation rate or WPR (defined as the proportion of working persons to total population). Both these ratios are a function of a large number of variables falling into the domain of social, cultural, demographic and economic aspects of life. While some of the supply side variables such as the fast natural growth of population and immigration, raise the supplies of labour, some 12 others such as the rise in school enrolment and human capital formation tend to reduce the participation in the short run. On the other hand, demand side factors like rapid urbanization, industrialization and commercialization provide an impetus to work participation. In fact, it is one of the most complex outcomes of social, cultural, demographic and economic forces.

For example, poor households cannot afford to remain unemployed for long, and hence would prefer to join the entry-free low productivity informal sector in the absence of any better alternative. This would mean the coexistence of high work participation rate and poverty. Similarly, women are often burdened by the household responsibilities, which tend to reduce their explicit participation in the labour market. To interpret a low work participation rate in such a case in terms of the lack of demand for women labour can be completely faulty. As economic growth takes place, gender inequalities in terms of access to employment opportunities, work conditions, nature of work, and earnings tend to decline as per the neo-classical approach (Forsythe, Korzeniewicz and Durrant 2000). This would mean a rise in the women work participation rate as the phenomenon of discouraged dropouts would tend to disappear - with improved and equal status in the job market women would be encouraged to participate in the labour market. However, in low income households too, the women participation rate is as high as their male counterparts as neither males nor females can afford to remain without work, and more importantly, work is an integral part of the survival strategies of these households (Mathur 1994). Cagatay and Ozler (1995) suggest the possibility of a U-shaped relationship between long-term development and women\u2019s share of the labour force. With urbanization and industrialization, female-dominated home-based production is expected to decline, as it would be largely replaced by male-dominated factory production, justifying the falling part of the U-curve (Boserup 1970). However, with further economic development, the women\u2019s labour force participation rate is expected to increase as enhanced industrialization, more education for women, commodification of domestic labour, and falling fertility rates help women workers participate in the labour market more explicitly (Oppenheimer 1970; Boserup 1970). Among various socio-economic factors, fertility, cross-regional cultural norms, attitude towards manual work, the relative incidence of low caste and tribal population, the size of the agricultural sector, cultivation techniques, participation of males in the job market, the degree of industrialization, expansion of the government sector, and the increasing role of the government, to spread literacy are some of the determinants of female work participation rate (see Miller 1981; Rosenweig and Schultz 1982; Sen 1985; Agarwal 1989). Also, there may exist a positive association between work participation rate and the percentage of workers engaged in the tertiary sector as these activities provide greater employment opportunities for women and teenage workers (Warren and Gilory 1976). However, low productivity activities are mostly concentrated in the tertiary sector, and hence, as the share of the tertiary sector in total employment increases, dropouts from the labour market are expected to be high, thus reducing the work participation rate (see Nord 1989; Mitra 1992). Keeping in view the issues mentioned earlier, this paper analyses the labour force participation rate, work force participation rate and the elasticity of employment with respect to growth, for female and male workers separately, informal sector employment, 13 unemployment rate, wage inequality and finally the links between labour market equality and equality in other aspects of life. 3. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS The database of the study is drawn mainly from ILO\u2019s Key Indicators of Labour Market (KILM) analysis. French Polynesia, Guam and New Caledonia are not included in the TOR of UNDP. However, they fall into the Asia-Pacific region, as given in the KILM dataset.

Information on labour force participation rate, work force participation rate and unemployment rate for Macao, China (SAR) and Hong Kong, China (SAR) have been made available for various years including the ones for which they had remained as a part of China; similarly for Timor-Leste, which had remained as a part of Indonesia. 3.1 Labour Force and Work Force Participation Rates The study by ILO (2000) on Asia-Pacific countries argued that women's labour force participation was universally lower than that of men's in 1996. Level of development did not appear to be an important determinant of women's labour force participation while socio- cultural context was. Further, it pointed out that the male-female differential in labour force participation was smallest in the transition economies and largest in South Asian and Pacific countries. The differential in the fast-growing economies of East and Southeast Asia and in the advanced industrialized countries was somewhere in between the two extremes; and, among the advanced industrialized countries, it was largest in Japan. The share of females in total labour force ranged from 26 to 42 per cent in South Asia, from 37 to 46 per cent in East and Southeast Asia, from 41 to 44 per cent in the advanced industrialized countries, and from 45 to 53 per cent in transition economies. At the same time, women predominated in those categories of the labour force that were not officially recorded in most countries, e.g. subsistence agriculture (ILO 2000). Our analysis based on the KILM dataset of ILO shows that the female labour participation rate has considerable variations across countries (Table 1 and Figure 1). At two time points, for example 1980 and 2006, there are countries such as India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka that show a participation rate of less than 35 per cent while in countries such as like Cambodia, China, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and Viet Nam the rate has been nearly 70 per 14 cent or more. These wide variations are reflected in the coefficient of variations pertaining to the female labour force participation rate. The role of factors such as education, attitude towards female work and other socio-economic conditions which influence the female work participation rate cannot be ruled out in the context of these cross-country variations. However, what is interesting to note is that over time these variations are declining, indicating that some of the countries are experiencing a rise while some others experience a decline with an overall decline in the cross-country differences (Table 1). Though at this stage it is incorrect to suggest that there can be a unique participation rate around which many countries may tend to converge, the decline in the cross-country variations is a matter that needs further investigation. As regards variation within a sub-region we note that countries within shows wide variations with respect to female labour force participation rate. For example, within Northeast Asia, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea reported a figure of only 48 per cent, while Cambodia peaked as high as 75 per cent. These variations are expected to result in variations in other socio-economic profiles of women including human capital formation. Figure 1: Labour Force Participation Rates of Females and Males (2006) Note: Names of all the countries included in the analysis do not appear in the graph for want of space. Source: Based on KILM dataset (see Table 1). In contrast to female labour force participation rate, the male LFPR shows less variation across countries (Table 2). The ratio of female-to-male participation rate also shows wide variations: while the female-male differences are extremely high in the case of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, countries such as Viet Nam, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, Macau, China (SAR), and Thailand show minimal differences between the sexes. The variations in the ratio of female-to-male participation seem to have declined over time. Since the variation in male labour force participation rate is not high and since the magnitude has not undergone any major change over time, the variations and the change in the variations in the female-male differences (measured in terms of the ratio of female-to-male participation rate) are largely 15 caused by the variations and the change in the variations in the female labour force participation rates respectively.

In fact, the extent of correlation between the female and male labour force participation is very low (0.18 for 2005), though positive. Secondly higher is the male labour force participation rate lower is the female to male participation ratio and also higher is the female labour force participation rate lower is the female to male participation ratio though the degree of association is extremely weak (-0.17 and -0.20 respectively for 2005). This would again tend to suggest that female and male participation rates have a positive association between them possibly indicating that as opportunities grow both male and female labour supplies respond positively. In other words, the substitutability hypothesis between male and female labour does not seem to be consistently valid. However, the complementary relation is not too strong as the co-movement takes place only marginally. Hence, policy interventions will be required for women\u2019s strategic needs to be met instead of leaving it to the market forces and waiting for demand to grow and bridge the gender gap. The other point relates to the change in the labour participation rate of women over time. Countries which experienced a decline in the female labour force participation rate between 1980 and 1990 to the extent of around three percentage points include Timor-Leste, Fiji, Maldives, and the Philippines. Countries that experienced a decline in the labour force participation rate between 1990 and 2006 are Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and Cambodia. On the other hand, countries such as the Solomon Islands, French Polynesia, the Republic of Korea, Macau, China (SAR), Singapore, Sri Lanka, Guam, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam experienced more than three percentage points increase in the labour force participation rates between 1980 and 1990. And, the following countries registered an increase of more than three percentage point in the female labour force participation rate between 1990 and 2006: the Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Timor Leste, Hong Kong, China (SAR), Tonga, the Philippines, Bhutan, Macau, China (SAR) and Maldives. Why these countries have shown such large changes in women labour participation rates over time is an important issue. Whether the countries that recorded an increase in the female labour participation rate also witnessed improvements in human capital and whether a drop in the female labour participation rate in certain other countries was largely due to shrinkage in job opportunities leading to discouraged drop-outs are some of the interesting angles for further exploration. Like labour force participation rate, work force participation rate also seems to have large cross-sectional variations in the case of females compared to the males. The other interesting point relating to the female work participation rate is the extent of the recent rise (2000 to 2006), which is greater than that during the period 1995 to 2000 (Table 4). The youth and adult illiteracy rate among females is high though it does not appear to be abnormally high in comparison to males (Table 5). In some of the countries for which information is available for two time points, the rate seems to have declined considerably. 16 The school enrolment ratio is not impressive in many countries particularly at the primary level but it has improved over time (Table 6). Table 6 shows that expenditure per student particularly at the tertiary level is quite high and there is a strong possibility that after women complete higher levels of education, they tend to participate in the job market. All this would presumably support the view that education has played a crucial role in enhancing the work force participation rate of females, which in turn is contributing to human capital formation among the younger girl children. In the process of growth, the women work participation rate may decline as women may not be required to participate in the job market. However, Behrman and Zhang (1995) noted that in Asia the labour force participation rate of females aged 15-64 did not show a U shaped relationship with respect to per capita income, which Goldin (1995) posited in the process of development. They noted that in some of the Asian countries it increased over time (Pakistan, Malaysia and Singapore) but in others it remained basically stable (Hong Kong, China (SAR) and Japan) or fallen (Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey).

The regression of the ratio of female to male work participation rate on per capita GDP does not show any significant relationship, thus suggesting that growth alone cannot result in a reduction in inequality in the labour market by generating human capital formation for the disadvantaged sex. Explicit policy interventions would be required to curb inequality in the labour market and make growth more equitable and pro-women.

Source: Based on figures from KILM data and Human Development Report 2007/2008, UNDP. 3.2 Employment Elasticity The next issue relates to the employment sensitivity of economic growth or the employment generating capacity of economic growth. Since most of the developing countries (and even some of the developed countries like Japan where sluggish employment growth has become a serious issue) are not merely interested in the magnitude of economic growth, but rather the employable capacity of growth, particularly keeping in view the issue of productive 17 absorption of the unskilled and semi-skilled work force, this paper focuses on the summary measure of employment elasticity. However, most of the studies have looked at this index in aggregative terms and not gender-wise. We, therefore, in this paper pose the question how employment and gender sensitive economic growth has been in countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In doing this it has not however been possible to decompose value added in terms of contribution made by female and male workers separately. We merely define it as the ratio of employment growth of female (male) workers to aggregate GDP growth. 1993-97 Female employment elasticity defined as the ratio of female employment growth to aggregate value added growth appears to be quite low in South and West Asia with a few exceptions such as Maldives and Nepal (Table 7). In Southeast Asia, with the exception of Brunei and the Philippines the elasticity is again on the low side. In Northeast Asia, Hong Kong, China (SAR) is an exception with female employment elasticity of 0.7 while in China it is pitiably low at 0.12 \u2013 in fact, lowest among all the 29 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. All three Pacific countries on the other hand seem to have a relatively higher estimate of elasticity of female employment. 1997-01 While most of the South and West Asian countries in Table 7 experienced a rise in the elasticity of female employment during 1997-2001 in comparison to that in 1992-97, Nepal observed a major decline from 0.82 to 0.39 over the same period. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia reported a negative figure during this period while in other countries the magnitude improved relative to the preceding period. (Though Brunei witnessed a mild decline it still persisted at a very high level.) The bright picture of the Pacific as observed between 1992 and 1997 seems to have undergone deterioration: the elasticity declined in Fiji, became negative in Solomon and only in Papua New Guinea it improved further. In countries in the Northeast region, the elasticity by and large improved though the magnitude of the rise in China was only nominal (from 0.09 to 0.12) 2001-05 The Northeast Asian countries, however, experienced a decline in the female employment elasticity and some of them, in fact, became worse relative to the estimates for 1993-97. All three Pacific countries witnessed improvement relative to the preceding period and two, relative to the first sub-period as well. Although in four of the six countries in Southeast Asia the elasticity declined, the estimates are quite diverse in this region. Interestingly in South and West Asia, four of the seven countries show an estimate of unity or more than that, while Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka have lagged behind - in fact a marked deterioration in the case of Bangladesh and India while Sri Lanka has been dwindling at a low level. Too high an employment growth rate (or employment elasticity going beyond unity) may imply sluggish labour productivity growth. Therefore, the interpretations drawn on the basis of employment elasticity need to be viewed carefully. Since employment elasticity is a ratio we need to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3c85b6c-ff53-4aca-ab47-1b7377691fcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3c85b6c-ff53-4aca-ab47-1b7377691fcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "998a5c1e2692b5997a5a0b33590d0d047c0db82469cba2d745d8d647e6fa808a"}}, "hash": "998a5c1e2692b5997a5a0b33590d0d047c0db82469cba2d745d8d647e6fa808a", "text": "examine separately, the employment growth rates. In spite of a high employment growth rate, employment elasticity can turn out to be low if the value added growth rate exceeds the employment growth rate substantially. On the other hand, the employment elasticity may turn out to be high, despite the fact that both employment growth and value added growth are unimpressive if the former exceeds the latter. In fact, Papua New Guinea in the Pacific sub-region is a good example of this situation, that is, with a sluggish female employment growth rate (less than two per cent per annum) it could record high female employment elasticity between 1993-97 and 1997-01. Other countries that recorded a 18 sluggish female employment growth rate (irrespective of the magnitude of employment elasticity) between 1993 and 1997 are China, Fiji, Thailand, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Between 1997-2001 while only India and Nepal from South and West Asia registered sluggish female employment growth rate, a considerable number of countries from other sub-regions joined this set: China, Hong Kong, China (SAR), the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Between 2001 and 2005 again several countries continued to experience sluggish female employment growth: China, Republic of Korea, Fiji, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Besides, it may be noted that in many countries the female employment elasticity has been lower than its male counterpart implying that the female employment has been growing at a slower pace than the male employment even when both the growth rates are quite low (e.g., China). All this can be taken to conclude that while globalisation has affected employment adversely in many countries the female workers are possibly the worst sufferers. The growth process and technological progress seem to have become increasingly more capital and skill intensive, implying that employment opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled workers are pitiably meager. Given the relatively low skill base of a large number of women workers they seem to be deprived more than males from accessing the benefits of productive employment opportunities. And this is obviously indicative of sluggish human capital formation among women relative to males, which aggravates gender inequality, thus reinforcing the need for policy interventions to meet women\u2019s strategic needs. 3.3 Unemployment Rate One indicator of deprivation is the unemployment rate. However, the open unemployment rate, i.e., those remaining without work and searching for a job for a long time as a percentage of labour force, is not expected to be very high in the developing countries (for, not too many can afford open unemployment for long). But some of the countries like Indonesia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka reported a very high open unemployment rate (either in double digit or close to that) among the females. The other striking pattern is that some of the countries experienced a decline in the female unemployment rate over time but later in the recent past the unemployment rate again seems to have shot up. An increase in the female unemployment rate would mean shrinkage in the overall employment opportunities because recessionary tendencies are expected to have dampened the labour demand of which women are usually the victims in the first go. As evident from Table 8 there are several countries that recorded a higher female unemployment rate than males. Though a sub-region generalization may not be appropriate, Southeast and partly South Asia are indicative of higher female unemployment rates. Since women have to engage themselves in the labor market while simultaneously pursuing the domestic work, their choice of jobs becomes highly limited. Besides, preoccupation in domestic work results in poor human capital formation not allowing them to enhance their capabilities and accept the available job opportunities. This results in a higher incidence of unemployment rate among the females. The rural-urban differences in the unemployment rates are also quite substantial. Though we do not have this information for very many countries, in general urban unemployment rates are higher than the rural rates because urban females are relatively more educated and skilled than their rural counterparts and they can afford a higher search cost. 19 In reality, it is difficult to compare the unemployment rates across countries due to the differences in the concepts, and therefore, information based on country-specific studies are used extensively. In Bangladesh, the unemployment rates among the population aged 15 and above rose over the period 1990-91 to 1999-2000 in each region and for both the sexes except for a slight decrease in the rate for urban females in 1995-96.

On an average about 3.3 per cent people of aged over 15 in Bangladesh were unemployed in 1999-2000. Taking unpaid family works into account according to the extended definition used by the labour force survey (LFS) it was 2.5 per cent in 1995-96, which increased from 1.5 per cent in1990-91. Moreover, estimates show that there has been a significant rural-urban variation in the unemployment rate over the period with a concentration of unemployment in the urban areas. This is mainly because of the transfer of rural poverty to the urban areas through migration. On the other hand, unemployment among females is still higher than their male counterparts across regions, particularly in the urban areas. However, the incidence of underemployment remains very high as people struggle to survive by engaging themselves in many informal activities, though the underemployment surveys are not always well-captured by conventional employment surveys2. Rahaman (1998) pointed out that the demand for wage employment is not sufficient to absorb the entire supply; employment expansion could progress without causing an upturn in the wage trend. In Bhutan, poverty exists in the rural areas among subsistence farmers relying largely on crops, large families with a higher proportion of children and elderly, households with limited livestock, off-farm income including remittances and limited schooling. In the urban areas the poverty is more prevalent among migrants, households with higher dependency ratio, petty traders and casual labourers who do not have regular wage employment. Acharya (1998) brings out interlinks between the labour market situation in India, as well as Nepal since its economy is integrated with some of the provincial towns of India. A depressed Indian labour market is likely to depress the labour market in Nepal as well and a blooming labour market in India would have a salutary effect on the labour market in Nepal. In India, the open unemployment rates are not high but the relative size of unorganized or informal sector employment in both rural and urban areas is dominant (Mitra 1994). Ghayur (1998) points to the declining ability of the labour market in Pakistan to absorb work force productively. Unemployment rates are high among females in general, children and senior citizens. Following the structural adjustment in Sri Lanka, a distinct bias is evident in the generation of employment outlets in favour of females (Rodrigo 1998). In East Asia, the diffusion of primary education was possibly the single most important factor accounting for the reduction in poverty and income inequality. The East Asian countries in general allocated a much larger proportion of their public investment for agriculture and rural development than most other developing countries at comparable stages of their development. This, together with universal primary education made growth broad- based and labour intensive with skill intensity, resulting in higher growth and improved income distribution (Hashim 1998). Investment in physical and human capital with special emphasis on developing human resources and effective participation in international markets leading to expanding employment at higher productivity contributed to both the reduction in poverty and enhancement of growth. 2 Poverty Profile 2004: Bangladesh. 20 3.4 Employment Structure and Employment Status As the study by ILO (2000) pointed out, the share of women employment in agriculture is high in countries with low per capita income. The percentage of the female work force engaged in agriculture has been larger than its male counterpart in Bangladesh, Cambodia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and for some of the years in Thailand (Table 9). It is possible that in these countries, as males look for better employment opportunities in activities other than agriculture, women engage in agriculture in an attempt to pursue the activity in the family farms. This reason seems to be a strong possibility, particularly in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand where the proportion of female agricultural workers to total female workers has been sizeable Hong Kong, China (SAR), Macau, China (SAR), Maldives and Sri Lanka (two years) are countries where the female work force engaged in manufacturing has been larger than its male counterpart. In Hong Kong, China (SAR) and Macau, China (SAR), this may be explained in terms of rapid indusrialisation, which has generated demand for female labour. On the other hand, in several countries and for a number of years the share of services in the female work force has been larger than that of males (see Table 9 for positive differences between the female and male percentage of workers engaged in services; Figure 3 gives the differences in all three activities for nine countries in 2005).

With low human capital endowment, entry into the services sector is relatively easy compared to manufacturing as far as non-agricultural activities are concerned. Also, many of these countries are experiencing rapid tertiarization and hence, absorption of female workers in services has possibly been more spontaneous. In Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan and the Philippines, where the pace of industrialization even in terms of male work force has been quite sluggish, it is understandable that the percentage of female workers engaged in manufacturing is also low. Though information on India has not been supplied by the KILM data of the ILO we have noted from the NSS data that the discrepancy between the structural change in terms of value added and that in terms of work force is sizeable (Mitra 2008). This is usually explained in terms of technological reasons and factor price distortions leading to sluggish demand for labour in the industrial sector. Manufacturing activity is more skill-intensive compared to agriculture and other tertiary sector activities such as community, social and personal services and retail trade. Women labour, as a result of possessing low human capital, is demanded usually after the available supplies of male labour are exhausted, and this would explain why the percentage of manufacturing in the female employment structure has been perceptibly low. On the whole, limited spread of industry, technological reasons and factor price distortions leading to limited demand for labour in the industrial sector are some of the reasons for sluggish labour absorption in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, many countries are experiencing rapid tertiarization and hence, absorption of female workers in services has possibly been more spontaneous though the question whether this pattern of transition will be able to contribute to growth in a sustainable fashion is left unresolved. Women\u2019s employment in the service sector has been vulnerable to and disadvantaged by the increased competition. With the rapid spread of the IT sector, both male and female job seekers seem to have benefited but most of the benefits have reached only those who are in 21 the higher echelons of the socio-economic ladder with higher levels of human capital endowments. Figure 3: Female-Male Differences in Share of Agriculture, Manufacturing and Services (2005) Note: Bars represent differences between the percentage share of total female workers and total male workers engaged in agriculture, manufacturing and services for the year 2005. Source: Based on ILO\u2019s KILM Dataset. Employment status is given in terms of wage and salaried jobs and self-employment (Table 10). Wage and salaried jobs include not only regular wage employment but also contractual and casual employment. The proportion of wage/salary employment among the male workers is higher than that among the females. Secondly, the proportion of wage/salary employment varies considerably across countries. Similarly, the relative size of self- employment also varies widely corresponding to both male and female workers. Usually, one expects the share of wage/salary employment to increase in the process of development, particularly in an inter-temporal sense. For many countries, inter-temporal data are not available and hence, they could not be examined carefully. However, in the case of Maldives and Pakistan, a downward tendency is indicative. Sri Lanka also registered a slight decline, yet in Singapore where the relative size of wage employment has been on the high side, the decline is not taken seriously. Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam are some of the countries where the relative size of the wage/salaried employment has been quite small. The evidence on India (though not available from the same source) also points to the same direction if only the regular wage/salaried employment is considered, excluding the casual and contractual employment (Mitra 2008). On the whole, the low income countries seem to be experiencing sluggish labour absorption in wage/salaried jobs, which may explain why South Asia is characterized by a relatively small proportion of its work force engaged in this category. In the face of sluggishly growing demand for hired labour, inadequate human capital endowment of female labour compels them to engage themselves as self-employed workers, which further accentuates gender inequality in the labour market. Also, as male workers look for better-paying opportunities in the job market, 22 women workers in pursuance of their practical needs continue to work as home-based workers in order to augment family earnings.

This category possibly includes \u2018employment not adequately defined\u2019. However, in a country like Bangladesh, it is difficult to believe that around 80 per cent of the female employment and 35 per cent of the male employment was not \u2018adequately defined\u2019. Possibly there is a mix-up of the categories. Usually in countries like India, national surveys report three categories of employment: regular wage/salaried employment, self-employment and casual employment. For these countries, if regular wage/salaried employment is compared with wage/salaried employment for countries, which define duality in terms of wage employment and self employment, then naturally this kind of discrepancy is expected to occur. 3.5 Wages An important manifestation of labour market inequality is wage inequality, which then spills over to human capabilities in other areas and impacts on various dimensions of gender inequality. Skill and human capital differences, productivity differences, biases of employers against women workers, weak bargaining power of women workers, constrained choice for jobs in the labour market, and inability to participate in the labour market and its adverse outcomes in terms of income and other kinds of penalties, translate themselves into female- male earnings differentials. Of course, some of the wage differences are independent of the accessibility issue. For example, even when jobs in a specific activity may be available for both sexes, females and males tend to have preferences for certain specific activities and thus the all-activity wage rates of females and males can unfold significant differences. However, due to data limitation, we are not able to capture some of these finer points. ILO\u2019S KILM dataset provides figures for male and female wages in manufacturing and certain other specific activities, which we have analysed below. Based on the figures of UNDP (2007) on estimated earned income of females and males (2005, in US $ adjusted for purchasing power parity), Figure 4 has been presented giving the ratio of female to male income ratio, which is substantially less than 1 in the Asia-Pacific region. 23 Figure 4: Female to Male (F/M) Estimated Earned Income (2005, US$ PPP) Source: Based on figures from UNDP (2007). Based on the limited information on the wages in the manufacturing sector and the commonality of the base year, female to male wage ratio and wage growth for female and male workers have been calculated presuming an exponential function. From Table 11 we may note that the wage ratio has been against the female workers in some of the years in Republic of Korea, Macau, China (SAR), Malaysia and Myanmar. The real wage growth varies widely across countries. Secondly, there is no uniformity in the male-female differences in the wage growth rate. The following are the countries which reported a reasonably high growth rate (at least three per cent) in female wages in manufacturing: Hong Kong, China (SAR) (1985-90), Republic of Korea (1980-85, 1985-90, 1995-2000, 2000- 2005, 2005-06), Malaysia (1990-95), Philippines (2005-06), Singapore (1990-95, 2005-06) and Taiwan, Province of China (1990-95). On the whole, only a limited few seem to have experienced rapid growth in wages in recent years. The female-male wage growth differentials have been substantive. Though there are cases when female wages have grown faster than male wages, there are several cases showing higher growth of wages for male workers than their female counterparts in manufacturing. A lower base year wage for female workers is natural to estimate a higher growth rate of female wages. Besides, manufacturing is only one of the components of several activities and therefore other components must be looked at as well. Based on detailed occupational data, the female-to-male nominal wage ratio has been calculated to reflect gender discrimination in the labour market in terms of wage inequality. Table 12(a) lists the activities, countries and years for which female wages in nominal terms have not been lower than male wages, and such cases are only few in number. On the other 24 hand, Table 12(b) which is inclusive of Table 12 (a) represents all possible cases of gender differences in wages across occupations. Figures show that in a large number of countries and for a number of years and occupations, female wages have been lower than male wages.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a6c8a1b-560c-4957-a813-aba3bb3fd482": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a6c8a1b-560c-4957-a813-aba3bb3fd482", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "338a274d5a554049ded5a70b933adb61140dab038faf3931f27e71b1c12cad70"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcfcdef5-a53a-4173-a156-0fd82d113ef8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "761d7c1574f74cf564fc9c4864318ac0a98194c6e6559daac49959b24a37051b"}}, "hash": "3f8af944513e910b744b5b881021d924ba1b8d5d4328e3c72845a17f10473e40", "text": "And these inequalities are not only confined to informal sector activities such as field crop farm worker and refuse collector but also many other non-traditional activities such as computer programmer, accountant and primary school teachers.

In the initial stages of industrialization in the first-tier East Asian newly industrialized economies rapid growth in female employment took place around the garment and the electronic sector. However, as manufacturing production has matured and diversified in the region, women\u2019s share of manufacturing employment has declined with the deceleration of industry and manufacturing export growth. In Taiwan, Province of China, South Korea, Hong Kong, China (SAR) and Singapore possibly because of gender ideologies and cultural prejudices the gender gap in wages as well as the degree of gendered occupation segregation remained substantially large (Sundaram, 2009). On the whole, women employment in developing countries and also in many of the Asia-Pacific countries, where economic growth has already taken place, is characterized by low pay, no job security, long work hours and inadequate medical care (Aganon 2000). In subcontracting activities they have no negotiating power. They have no job security, no social security benefits, and receive pay less than the minimum wage. The lack of capital, lack of technology, low levels of productivity, excessive competition, harassment from police authorities, lack of help and child care facilities, lack of basic services and at times domestic violence are some of the predominant characteristics of women working as self-employed workers (Aganon 2000). 3.6 Informal Sector The composition of rural unorganized sector activities shows that a large majority falls into the agricultural sector. Yet in some of the regions, the demand-induced component of the rural non-farm sector has gained momentum, in several regions it is a manifestation of the supply-push phenomenon. The urban informal sector comprises both manufacturing and tertiary activities though the latter would constitute about 70 per cent of the total informal sector activities conducted in urban areas (Mitra 2001). Earnings in the informal sector are meager, partly because supplies of labour exceed demand and partly because products manufactured in the informal sector are of poor quality and have a limited market. Some of the activities are purely of a residual type and self-employment is characterized by low productivity. Poor human capital endowment of the workers is an important reason of low productivity employment in the informal sector, be that in own-account enterprises and/or in casual jobs. It may be desirable to provide estimates of the informal sector share across countries. The definition and estimate of the informal sector varies from country to country. Hence, note that the figures are not comparable across countries, while estimates for some countries are unavailable. Notwithstanding the limitations of data and information on the informal sector, there is a sizeable percentage of workers engaged in the informal sector (Table 13). The incidence of informal sector employment among female workers, particularly in the rural 25 areas, is higher than that among male workers. In the urban areas, both males and females show almost equal incidence of informal sector employment. Yet, this information is available only for a few countries. On the other hand, several studies have confirmed that certain segments of the informal sector, particularly the home-based activities are largely dominated by the women workers even in urban areas (ILO 2000). In fact, as men explore possibilities in wage labour, women work as home-based workers and as domestic maids in search of a livelihood. Other studies have also noted that the majority of South Asia\u2019s labour force is engaged in the informal sector, working as casual labourers and self-employed workers. The share of informal sector employment in India exceeds 90 per cent; in Sri Lanka it is estimated to account for about two-thirds of employment and in other South Asian countries it is large as well (World Bank 2004). Other than informal sector employment, what has become increasingly evident is informal employment. The latter includes not only informal sector employment but also casual and contractual employment in the formal sector. In the era of globalization, several countries have pursued labour market reforms directly or indirectly and that has raised the incidence of informal employment in the formal sector substantially. In Bangladesh, women in 1980s and 1990s are faced with both new employment opportunities and vulnerability. Traditional gender-based restrictions on women\u2019s employment are being challenged and expansion in opportunities, particularly in the ready-made garments industry, has taken place (Salway, Jesmin and Rahman 2005). As Salway, Jesmin and Rahman (2003) highlight, intense informalisation is accompanied by high levels of morbidity, a large reserve labour supply and low job security.

The pattern of industrialization in Taiwan, Province of China, brought about a large and heterogeneous informal sector in which married women constitutes a significant part. In small family enterprises wives contribute their labour as unpaid workers (Lu 2001). Though industrialization has led to an increase in the women work participation rate women\u2019s economic status relative to men has not changed significantly. In most of the countries a sexual division of labour reinforced by poverty exists within the informal sector. Home working has increased because the pressure on women to contribute to family incomes without neglecting their domestic responsibilities has increased (Bullock 1994 and ILO 1998). Home-workers in Asia who are mostly women produce garments, fashion accessories, toys and handicrafts for domestic and export markets. As self- employed or sub-contracted workers they are exploited and impoverished and vulnerable to the uncertainties of subcontracting work and live in cramped quarters, with detrimental effects on their own and children\u2019s health (Joshi 1996). At this point we may turn to some of the intricate issues relating to the informal sector employment, particularly for women. Mitra (2005), for example, hypothesized that the nature of networks that the women workers use to access jobs, and the unavailability of diverse activities in every part of the city coupled with the women workers\u2019 constrained choice of occupation earn them lower levels of income compared to male workers. The poor human capital endowment of the female workers compel them to use such informal networks in accessing sources of livelihood which in turn begets poor human capital/skill formation thus perpetuating their misery and reducing the possibility of upward income mobility. 26 Women workers\u2019 access to the urban labour market is greatly influenced by the contacts they develop through co-villagers, neighbours /co-residents of the same cluster, friends and members of the same caste group. Next to that in terms of statistical significance is \u2018networks through relatives\u2019. Through these informal channels, operating mostly on the lines of ethnicity, information on jobs they acquire and get absorbed in activities largely within the informal sector. Secondly, findings tend to support the concentration of different activities in different areas within the city suggesting that the city structure is highly heterogeneous in terms of availability of jobs. In other words, an entrant into the job market would like to get absorbed in a particular activity simply because of its availability in the area in which she resides. Informal contacts through co-villagers, friends and relatives help them take up only a limited variety of jobs available in the vicinity, which in turn generates a low level of earnings. Alternately, they could have earned more if their choice of occupation would have been unconstrained, and contacts and mobility have been wider, exposing them to a variety of jobs. And these constrained choices of occupation have their origin in poor human capital endowment and unequal say in the decision-making process within the household. Inadequate scope to enhance productivity of the informal sector women workers reduces the possibility of meeting women\u2019s strategic needs and empowering them to voice their say. On the whole, male workers seem to have access to both informal and formal contacts, the latter remaining statistically insignificant in the occupation choice function of the women workers. Secondly, the significance of the zone specific dummies appears to be infrequent in a number of occupation groups for male workers. All this tends to suggest that male workers\u2019 contacts as well as mobility are wider compared to women workers as a result of which they manage to broaden their occupation options, which in turn result in somewhat higher incomes. Thus, incomes differences translate themselves into human capital differences and with limited capabilities women continue to remain in the lower echelons and with limited say in the decision-making process. 4. ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LABOUR MARKET INEQUALITY AND INEQUALITY IN OTHER AREAS In this section we focus on the association between gender inequality in the labour market and gender inequality in other aspects of life. However, as mentioned earlier, gender differences in the labour market are not necessarily reflections of gender inequality. Women at times prefer to stay at home when children are young, and with a rise in the income of the spouse, women decide to withdraw from the labour market as they prefer to look into other aspects of their family\u2019s well-being (Dasgupta and Goldar 2006). Hence, the association between labour market disparities and inequalities in other areas need to be interpreted carefully. Besides, the causality issue is another slippery area.

In fact, improvement in education and health accessibility of women leads to higher participation in the labour market, and with better human capital formation GDP is expected to rise substantially (United Nations 2007). However, this paper argues that job market participation and accessibility to remunerative and productive work allow women to spend on their health by relaxing family budget constrains, which generally affect women adversely in terms of intra- household inequality of resources. Similarly, with job market participation, awareness increases and this enhances political participation as well. In this analysis, job market 27 participation is considered for women aged 15 and above and educational inequality is seen at the primary and secondary levels. If job market equality contributes to educational equality, we are then examining if mothers\u2019 involvement in the job market actually leads to improvements in the girl children\u2019s education. Similarly, women\u2019s accessibility to income can be seen as a strong motivating factor for them to exert their say in deciding the family size. Thus, fertility behaviour and other demographic improvements may follow as a consequence of income-accessibility and reduction in income inequality. The regression of the female-to-male work participation rate (2006) on GDP per capita (2005, in terms of US dollar adjusted for purchasing power parity) yields highly insignificant results, suggesting that in the process of growth, labour market equality does not take place automatically.3 However, the effect of labour market equality on other variables shows interesting results. Critics may argue that the female work participation rate is too wide a concept and it may not necessarily mean any rise in the accessibility of income, particularly if participation rises in response to involvement in own-account enterprises. Therefore, by taking women wage employment in the non-agricultural sector as a percentage of total employment in the non-agricultural sector, we show its positive association with female to male work participation rate, confirming that labour market equality does have a positive association with women\u2019s accessibility to income (Table 14). This is further confirmed by the ratio of female-male estimated income, which is positively and significantly related to the female-to-male work participation rate. Further, maternal mortality tends to decline with a rise in the female-to-male work participation rate. Total fertility rate also shows a similar response. An improvement in the gender ratio at primary level of education and in the female-to-male life expectancy rate seem to be emanating from labour market equality, confirming that women\u2019s accessibility to income not only allows them to spend on their own well-being but also on their girl children. In linking human capital formation to gender inequality in the labour market, one must recognize the problem of the causality issue as mentioned earlier. What we perceive at a particular point of time is only a cross-sectional profile of a long vicious circle, in which different dimensions mutually reinforce each other. Therefore, factor analysis has been pursued to bring out the inter-connections among demographic, economic, political health, education and labour market specific variables without going into the causality issue (Table 15). Results from factor 1 tend to indicate that women wage employment in the non- agricultural sector as a percentage of total employment in the non-agricultural sector is positively associated with the ratio of female life expectancy to male life expectancy and negatively associated with the infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate and total fertility rate. The ratio of girls to boys in primary education and the percentage of women parliamentarians in the total are also positively associated with the women wage employment in the non-agricultural sector as a percentage of total non-agricultural employment. From factor 2 it is again evident that the ratio of female work participation to male work participation, women\u2019s wage employment in total non-agricultural employment and the female-to-male estimated income are positively correlated. On the other hand, the maternal mortality rate shows a negative relationship with these variables while the ratio of girls to boys in primary education shows a positive association, though mild, with labour market equality. In factor 3, women\u2019s wage employment in the non-agricultural sector and the gender ratio in primary and secondary education show a positive association while maternal 3 Female to Male Work Participation Rate = 0.67 + 1.40e-06 GDP per capita (13.64) (0.35) Figures in parentheses are t-ratios.

Several country-specific studies have also corroborated these results. The Philippines is the top country in Asia-Pacific for achieving gender balance and sixth in the world, revealing the fact that gender responsive legislation and affirmative action have improved women\u2019s employment conditions, income opportunities and access to micro-credit and employment assistance, which along with programmes promoting leadership and other gender responsive programmes, have encouraged women to enter politics with enhanced participation in decision-making (World Economic Forum 2006 and United Nations 2007). Another example is Hong Kong, China (SAR), where many families maintained a patriarchal form of resource mobilization in which the husband\u2019s job preferences and consumption patterns dominated (Leung 2002). A more egalitarian pattern emerged when the wife earned an income. However, women mostly worked in the service sector, which offered unstable and short-term job offers. And the egalitarian relationship would often disintegrate when the wife\u2019s employment was terminated. All this again brings out close inter- connections between economic inequality and inequality in other spheres. A large number of studies in sociology and labour economics documented that declines in fertility are accompanied by industrialization and this means that fewer and fewer of a woman\u2019s adult years are spent in intensive childrearing activity and this consequently frees up more of a woman\u2019s time for wage labour outside the home (Brinton 2001). This process of causality also suggests that as women tend to participate in the labour market, there are further declines in fertility. Studies also point out how gender differences in terms of earnings can further reinforce the gendered division of labour under patriarchal norms, thus binding women to activities like childrearing if the general standards of childrearing are high and if female earnings are substantially lower than their male counterparts (Yu 2001). Also, longer duration of work before marriage and absorption in full-time jobs, which tend to imply reduced gender inequality in the labour market, are associated with a higher likelihood of continuing work after marriage in Taiwan, Province of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, suggesting that labour market equality has an important role in motivating women to remain in the labour market who otherwise fall prey to the phenomenon of \u201cdiscouraged dropouts\u201d (Lee and Hirata 2001). Basu\u2019s (1991) study of married women in the overseas Chinese family enterprise in Calcutta points to the possibility of the rise in women\u2019s informal power through their involvement in the family business. Work is a resource for women\u2019s informal power under the prescribed traditional Chinese culture: women are often in an indispensable position in the family business, which increases their bargaining power (Lu 2001). Mehrotra and Parish (2001) noted that young unmarried women working in the labour market in Taiwan, Province of China as paid employees do enjoy greater say over how their incomes are used. Even if much of their incomes go to the parents and other siblings, daughters reap many long term advantages. The next question is whether the improvement in gender inequality in the labour market leads to higher economic growth. After controlling for total fertility rate, urbanization level and the ratio of female-to-male estimated income, a rise in the ratio of female-to-male work participation rate is seen to raise economic growth (Table 16). On the other hand, for a given ratio of female-to-male work participation rate, an increase in the female-to-male estimated income lowers GDP per capita, implying that gender inequality in income terms are substantive. In relating gender inequality in education to economic growth, Barro and Lee (1994) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) find a negative relationship between female 29 primary and secondary years of schooling and economic growth. However, Dollar and Gatti (1999) noted that an increase in female secondary education leads to an increase in output in developed countries. Hill and King (1995) and Knowles, Lorgelly and Owen (2002) also found that female education has a significant positive effect on growth. In our data set, the ratio of girls-to-boys at the primary level of education shows a positive correlation of 0.35 with GDP per capita in Asia-Pacific countries. All this can be taken to conclude that gender equality in the labour market has positive spill-over effects in other areas and gender equality and improvement in women\u2019s status contribute to overall growth by enhancing the pace and quantum of human capital formation. 5. POLICY ISSUES Ever since the women\u2019s movement started in the 18th/19th century, the debate on what is appropriate for women \u2013 protection or equality \u2013 has continued across the globe. In developing countries, inequalities and lack of protection lead to several undesirable outcomes, which are more serious than", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e9c9920-50ae-4455-ab4e-877b57b2ca7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e9c9920-50ae-4455-ab4e-877b57b2ca7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7291e618c238389efb906d619052bf75d653327c064144f353ff1f0f526cc11c"}}, "hash": "7291e618c238389efb906d619052bf75d653327c064144f353ff1f0f526cc11c", "text": "those in the developed world. As an analogy, extreme forms of gender inequality in a poor household can be worse for the women members than their counterparts in a non-poor household. Hence, gender issues require policy directions of a special kind in the developing world. Mere protective measures may not be adequate to improve the lot of women and on the other hand, mere anti-inequality measures cannot make women better off. Policy should be directed to research on whether women are gaining control or are subjected to growing forms of control. Women's work conditions need to be monitored and evaluated in terms of equity with men in wages and level of skill. Legal changes are ineffective if the administrative mechanisms for implementation are missing. Monitoring of formal employment is necessary along with monitoring of women's access to credit, skill development, subsidies, or protection in work relationships. Under regimes of deregulation, the question is what role government will play in organizing women's unions, cooperatives, or self-help groups for vulnerable groups such as elderly women, young single migrants, international female migrants, or female heads of household. Structural adjustment practices must not sacrifice women's well-being for cost-cutting measures. Skill training and retraining for women will be the future need for overcoming inequalities. Policies must aim to support women in all of their interrelated roles in private human reproduction and public economic production. In an attempt to solve the fiscal crises and indebtedness in the later part of the 1970s, international political economy began a transformation from one based on Keynesian economic principles of full-employment, large public sectors and government deficit financing, to one led by the neo-liberal philosophy of balanced budgets, tight monetary policy and the concentration of the public sector wage bill. Subsequently, global restructuring took place in the 1980s, and the transition from state to market in the 1990s. Feminisation of poverty and the ever-growing proportion of the female population working as cheap labour, growing unemployment, a decline in the social power of labour and an increase in temporary, part-time, casual and home-based work are some of the outcomes of these changes. While women increasingly participated in irregular forms of employment, they continued to be responsible for domestic work (Moghadam 2005). In the recent context of economic reforms, several studies have argued in favour of labour market deregulations. In other words, without labour market deregulations, several 30 other macro and trade reforms are expected to be ineffective in generating employment (Hasan and Mitra 2003). However, the other pattern that can be discerned in the context of globalization is rising wage inequality, particularly along the lines of skill and education. For example, in the Indian context, employment has been growing at a reasonable pace for educated and skilled workers, whereas for those in the low income households, productive employment generation has been quite sluggish (Mitra 2008). Besides, the wage premium for skilled workers is on the rise. Since women in general are less skilled and less educated, globalization is expected to have not only aggravated the wage inequality across gender but also reduced the pay for women workers. As per UNIFEM-sponsored research, women\u2019s employment in the service sector is likely to be vulnerable to and disadvantaged by increased competition (Greve 2000). Export processing zones had great potential to enhance women employment. However, as products move up the technological and skill ladders, the gender composition of the work force may change to the detriment of women workers (Greve 2000). With the intensification of international competition, changes in the organization of work place greater responsibility on workers for productivity, quality and innovation, shifting the emphasis from the absolute cost of labour to the capabilities and potential of labour, which may affect adversely women\u2019s employment (van Heerden 1999). Greve (2000) has discussed this issue in detail. Three problems associated with female employment in the export processing zones relate to the changing gender composition of the work force with changing products and technological advances; movement of investment away from mature zones as wages and working conditions improve and the growth of global production networks that enable companies to source goods and services all over the world and to reconfigure production chains quickly and easily (van Heerden 1999). In Mauritius, the Philippines and Taiwan, Province of China, zones have already been affected by declines in FDI inflows and employment declines though the second generation zones have arisen in China, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. In the Indian context, it has been observed that imported technology has an adverse impact on the labour-to-value-added ratio, implying that imported technology is more capital-intensive in nature", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "002e7bb1-02c3-433b-b00b-0bb4e10dc9df": {"__data__": {"id_": "002e7bb1-02c3-433b-b00b-0bb4e10dc9df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b14f803411f5cda742e87c14f2dca1bc2e094ee7f1f5da7aae7478a78a07cc3e"}}, "hash": "b14f803411f5cda742e87c14f2dca1bc2e094ee7f1f5da7aae7478a78a07cc3e", "text": "(Kato and Mitra 2008). It is feared that the displacement of labour is possibly executed through retrenchment of female labour in the industrial sector. Though sub-contracting has gone up in the recent past and might have raised female employment in sectors such as the garment industry, there is no strong evidence in favour of wage-increases (Murayama 2005). The other important dimension of major economic changes relates to the IT sector. The integration of activities and economies across the globe has taken place in a big way with advancements in the IT sector; technological advancement has opened up unprecedented possibilities particularly in the manufacturing and services sectors. Dynamic and competitive business across national boundaries is possible with decreasing cost and increasing speed of communication, which the IT sector has delivered very promptly. In the manufacturing sector, the impact of technology on women employment has brought out mixed results. With the introduction of digital automation and robotics, women employment in the textile industry has been affected adversely in Argentina and Brazil (Mitter 1993). The increase in the level of automation is expected to have raised male employment at the expense of women employment as women do not have the adequate skills and training to operate delicate technology. On the other hand, where technology has regenerated enterprise or industry either directly or through outsourcing, women have gained in terms of employment (Greve 2000). However, all this would depend on the possibility of imparting skill and training to the women workers as per the new requirements of the occupational changes. Similarly in 31 relation to the services sector, telework offshore data processing and office administrative services comprise the relocation of clerical and data entry jobs to countries whose comparative advantage lies in a low-wage, well-educated work force \u2013 some of the beneficiaries are the Caribbean, India, mainland China, Singapore and the Philippines (Greve 2000). On the whole, the employment scenario in the context of globalisation and technological advancement seem to be in favour of those who are endowed with skills and higher education. The informal sector workers are least expected to experience an improvement in terms of wages and/or work conditions. Since women workers are relatively less skilled and less educated, income inequality is expected to have worsened along the lines of gender. The rapid spread of the IT sector has indeed generated employment opportunities in the services sector and both male and female job seekers seem to have benefited in the process. However, most of the benefits have reached only those who are in the higher echelons of the socio-economic ladder. Much of the passion has been shown in deregulating the labour market. However, what is more important is the provision of a social safety net and health and educational benefits to the informal sector workers who actually explain much of the poverty in developing countries. Within the informal sector, women are particularly more vulnerable than their male counterparts as their accessibility to resources is meager and their bargaining power in the labour market is poor. Hence, the policy focus cannot afford to ignore the gender dimension.

Explicit policy interventions are required to curb inequality in the labour market and make growth more equitable and pro-women. 2.

Labour intensive technology in compliance with the available skills of women should be adopted in various components of the high productivity sector including large-scale manufacturing. 32 4. Skill formation and entrepreneurial training facilities must be provided to women workers including those outside the labour market. This can enhance the labour market participation rate among women, and with enhanced capacities they will be able to access productive jobs. 5. A health related support system for women has to be developed more efficiently. 6. Employer bias against women workers must be eliminated through legal measures so that with equal levels of skill and education women workers can derive the same benefits as their male counterparts. 7. Several supportive measures to encourage girl children to enroll in schools and for their continuation of studies must be initiated on a large scale. 8. Working women, particularly in the informal sector, should be able to receive benefits that are usually available only to formal sector workers. For example, maternity leave and other health-related support can secure them against pay loss. 9. Availability of maternity benefits etc. which are accessible mainly by the regular women workers excluding a large proportion of women workers engaged in the informal sector are also not adequate to reduce the division of labour at home. What is, therefore, more important is initiation of policies which can sensitise the individuals and ensure involvement of males in child care. To begin with, the collection of data on constraints at the home front which impinge on gender inequalities in the labour market, is indeed essential. 10. Our findings on women\u2019s employment in the informal sector have important policy implications. It would be useful and cost-effective to evolve supportive measures rather than pursuing direct interventions, and in doing so the beneficiaries need to be involved in a big way. Urban specific employment programmes with minimum wage legislation must be implemented, which would also raise ongoing wages for women workers in activities that they have already been pursuing. Information on job prospects in different parts of the city can be consolidated and communicated for job seekers, and this can be expedited through NGOs. Institutions for skill formation are indeed important for enabling women to experience upward income mobility. Their entrepreneurial interest can be cultivated in terms of such efforts. Additionally, the public transport network should consider the travel requirements, timing, destinations and origins of these workers from low-income households. 11. Expansion of the rural non-farm sector and the involvement of women workers in this sector are indeed crucial for improvement in labour market equality. A shift in self-employment to wage-employment is endemic to enhanced access for higher income opportunities. 12. Steps must be taken to counter discrimination against women in recruitment, wages or promotions. Legislations and political commitment are necessary to ensure the rights of women to access education and health on equal terms with males. At times, women chose to divert greater attention to the family and children but income penalties and adversities associated with interruptions in career can be reduced through favourable policy initiatives including gender specific leave. 13. Since liberalization policies seem to have adverse impact on women\u2019s employment special efforts need to be made to engender macroeconomic policies. 33 6. CONCLUSION Economic development gauged in terms of per capita income and the Human Development index does not necessarily mean that the gender gap disappears with greater development. In fact an inverted U-shaped relationship tends to exist between development and the gender gap, urging the need to pursue conscious efforts for promoting gender equality. This study examines in detail various aspects of labour market inequality and argues for protection to women workers who are vulnerably placed in the labour market. An important dimension of the analysis is that labour market inequality aggravates inequalities in other spheres of life including the ability to participate in the decision-making process. In particular, it results in poor human capital formation, which not only reduces the capabilities of women workers and restricts their upward mobility but also tends to show deleterious effects in inter-generational sense. The existing situation tends to suggest that women\u2019s labor market participation is an outcome of their practical needs in search of a livelihood but hardly their strategic needs are met as gross inequalities often characterise their socio-economic and political life. In examining various aspects of labour market inequality, the study looks into labour market participation, work force participation, employment growth in relation to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "614c6da5-e680-4f50-8201-0bfca102e054": {"__data__": {"id_": "614c6da5-e680-4f50-8201-0bfca102e054", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc779921d968c69414caa24246d1d51ef0ed39d1389f400bff82b86ffb223fe2"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb03f410-6a6b-4104-8205-5aadbeaf6e97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/07", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0582652b7bdd0c3123e662cc00fb7395612e88a73f9088a26e017e4c85d384bb"}}, "hash": "f21e2211c2f580fb500a7e3cc51859effc1c8ac8e558c9be1aeeb6ad9dae6099", "text": "value added growth, unemployment rate, employment structure, wage levels and wage growth and informal sector employment of women vis-\u00e0-vis men. There is indeed propelling evidence in favour of existing inequalities. Particularly in relation to the informal sector, which accounts for a sizeable percentage of workers in the developing countries, and more so in the case of women, it is observed that with limited human capital endowment women often have to combine domestic work with earning opportunities outside the home, which results in sub- optimal outcomes by reducing their accessibility to full-time and productive work opportunities. Other than being part-timers, they often face constraints such as the inability to travel long distances for work. Furthermore, the nature of the job market channels that they access to draw information on the labour market lead to a low equilibrium situation by resulting in overcrowding in certain activities. Informal networks that are again highly limited in nature tend to result in information asymmetry leading to segmentation of the labour market, and the network concentration of a particular type gives rise to excess supplies of labour in certain activities and in certain pockets. Thus, the wages for women workers dwindle at a low level and tend to experience sluggish growth over time. Further, the wage inequalities are not only confined to informal sector activities but also many other non- traditional and modern activities. This study noted that labour market inequality spills over to inequality in education, health, political involvement and results in other demographic vulnerabilities. On the other hand, improvement in labour market equality results in reduction in gender inequality in other areas by generating higher levels and better quality of human capital endowment and by enhancing the productive capacity of women. Hence, an important linkage exists between labour market and empowerment in terms of involvement in the decision making process. On the other hand, reduction in gender inequality, particularly in the labour market, results in higher economic growth as women\u2019s contribution to the production process increases with human capital formation. The feminisation of poverty and the ever-growing proportion of the female population working as cheap labour, growing unemployment, decline in the social power of labour and an increase in temporary, part-time, casual and home-based work are some of the outcomes of the changes that are taking place in relation to globalization and economic reforms. While 34 women increasingly participated in irregular forms of employment, they continued to be responsible for domestic work. The other pattern which can be discerned in the context of globalization is rising wage inequality, particularly along the lines of skill and education. As women are generally less skilled and less educated, globalization is expected to have aggravated the wage inequality across gender. The rapid spread of the IT sector has indeed generated employment opportunities in the services sector and both male and female job seekers seem to have benefited in the process. However, most of the benefits have reached only those who are in the higher echelons of the socio-economic ladder. As recommended earlier, a number of policy initiatives for reducing inequality in the labour market can be implemented to generate greater human capital formation, and to empower women\u2019s participation in the decision-making process both at the macro and household levels. 35 REFERENCES Acharya, M.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Objectives and Rationale A person\u2019s livelihood is comprised of \u2018the capabilities, assets (material and social) and activities required for a means of living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks, and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets both now and in the future, while not undermining the natural resource base.\u20191 Rural livelihoods is a key area for understanding how gender operates in limiting or expanding men and women\u2019s access, options and choices regarding the use of resources and their material conditions, and ultimately their ability to voice concerns and influence their positions in life. The focus of this paper reflects the important role played by agriculture and non-farm activities, primarily based in rural areas in the Asia-Pacific region. The World Bank categorizes most of the South and East Asian and Middle Eastern countries as \u2018transforming economies\u2019, where agriculture is not a major source of economic growth (World Bank 2008). However, in most of these countries, poverty remains rural; about 80 per cent of the poor in this region live in rural areas (World Bank 2008). Attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and economic equity in the region require a focus on rural livelihoods. Moreover, the current economic crisis and its gender impact in rural areas highlight the importance of food security, and the gender asymmetries in rural livelihoods, particularly agriculture. According to the World Development Report (2008), the rural poor use the following livelihood strategies: smallholder entrepreneurship, participation in agricultural and non-farm labor market, and migration. Migration from rural to urban areas is increasing in some parts of the Asia-Pacific (which has a gender dimension) and urbanization is taking place at a rapid pace for many of the countries. The livelihood strategies adopted by many in the urban areas are strongly linked to agriculture and non-farm activities in the rural areas. The decisions by the rural poor to adopt a particular livelihood strategy or the impact of strategies used are influenced by the gendered access to resources and gender power relations within the household, community, rural markets and the policy arena. In addition, the nature of patriarchy2 varies widely in this region. Parts of South Asia and the Middle East impose a more restrictive or rigid form of patriarchy, specifically evident in rural areas, influencing the strategic life choices (Kabeer 1994) related to livelihood options for poor women and men. In other parts such as the Southeast and 1 Chambers and Conway (1992). 2 In this paper the term is used to refer to male power, i.e., in decision making and authority in society, that is supported by kinship, marriage and family systems which allow men to control women\u2019s labor, mobility and sexuality in the family and by extension in the public arena, i.e., market, community and the state. 8 the Pacific,3 patriarchal norms take a more loose form (Kabeer 2003), yet they influence options, choices and positions of poor women and men in rural areas (Table 3.1). This implies that in order to understand the gendered nature and form of livelihood strategies, rural livelihood merits a close focus. Though the primary focus of this paper is on women in rural areas in South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific region, it takes into account that women are differentiated by class, caste, ethnicity, race and age. It also acknowledges that poor men in rural areas may face specific disadvantages. In addition, people with minority gender identities may have different access to resources and may face different challenges regarding livelihoods in rural areas. 1.2 Scope The literature review aims to explore the following. First, how do different bodies of literature conceptualize the links between gender equality, sustainable livelihood, and human development? Second, what are the regional level changes and trends in rural livelihoods and their gender impact? Third, how does gender affect women\u2019s access to resources and participation in many areas such as, rural labor, product and finance markets? Fourth, how have women\u2019s rural livelihoods strategies and changes in these strategies, influenced gender division of labor, family structures, and led to the emergence of new norms.4 Identification of the nature, key issues and trends for researching the gender dimensions of livelihood in the Asia-Pacific region requires an analysis of gender asymmetries within the different institutional sites5 (i.e., household, market, community and the state). The nature of gender asymmetries that exist within these sites influences the livelihood strategies of rural women (i.e. by affecting the context of choice, range of choice, and how women\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c9609f6-e4c4-4de8-b685-44e81db0f456": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c9609f6-e4c4-4de8-b685-44e81db0f456", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9a0789d59ccf42f84a9dead88ab117907bb72351bfc336a6e0c6e42ab5b9028"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dc93299-42da-49a1-a8ba-9a44ae690eeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e3fa7f6229e7875a35b9668fd7d19ddca679b4137331af00acea64e710ef1b7"}}, "hash": "3ee20a58019615190b3cf4326cb06232b344970cb16627ee93c068f4d8c4c271", "text": "agency is exercised) and leads to different wellbeing outcomes (Figure 2.1). These sites are interlinked. Gender bias in one site reinforces gender disadvantage in other sites. Similarly, gender transformative changes in one site create transformative opportunities in other sites. The globalization process and liberalization policies may intensify gender asymmetries or help to mitigate gender disadvantages within these sites. A focus on institutions is useful because: a) it illustrates the gendered nature of power and how it operates within and among the different institutional sites (i.e., in terms of access to resources, being able to exercise agency, and the gendered impact); b) it shows how various change agents and interventions (such as civil society actors, state policies,) may alter the gendered nature of power that operate within these sites and have a spill over effect on other sites. For example, gender sensitive land titling policies in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic introduced by the state not only changed poor women\u2019s livelihood options but also the gender power relations within 3 East Asian countries (China, Japan, Taiwan, Province of China, Republic of Korea) are classified by the IDRC as displaying characteristics of a restrictive form of patriarchy similar to that found in the Middle East and South Asia. Therborn (2004) distinguishes between the nature of patriarchies in these regions and separates them. 5 Institutions are a set of formal rules (law or regulations) and informal norms that regulate interactions between people (North 1991). 9 the household and promoted women\u2019s voice in community land management (World Bank et al. 2008). The literature reviewed in this paper can be broadly categorized under three main areas: a) literature on sustainable livelihood (which has three main strands; agriculture, natural resource management and coping strategies);6 b) literature on formal and informal employment and labor markets; c) research on the impact of economic/ trade policies, legal reforms and state support services on the livelihood choices of rural women. The review is guided by the following questions: a) How are gender asymmetries conceptualized and linked to employment /sustainable livelihoods in these researches? b) How has this conceptualization changed over time? c) What are the research and data gaps in each of these categories? 1.3 Constraints The paper is based on secondary documents-- existing academic and policy research. The discussion below highlights the constraints this paper faced in analyzing the gendered dimensions, aspects and impact of rural livelihood. Under-researched Areas, Particularly in Feminist and Gender Research Not all areas and issues that fall under the rubric of gender and rural livelihoods have been extensively researched. For example, feminist analysis of home-based production workers and employment in the informal sector in the Asia Pacific remains comparatively less researched. The studies on informal sector are country-specific or at times do not differentiate between informal employment in rural and urban areas and categorize data based on different types of work (Doane 2007). Research on rural women\u2019s non-farm employment is constrained by the following facts: a) availability and quality of data are limited, b) cross-country comparisons are not possible as different definitions are used, and c) data is collected in an ad hoc manner (Chant and Pedwell 2008). Some issues, such as livelihood strategies adopted by gendered minority communities and their role in agriculture or labor markets are not covered by the various regional or international reports on agriculture, industry or other issues. (Esplen 2007). Existing feminist studies on China have explored the gender impact of Chinese state policies and reforms (Howell 1998; Croll 1983); the impact of state sponsored feminism on women\u2019s political participation (Zhang 1995); and gender impact on internal migration on rural areas (Croll and Huang 1997). These are useful for gathering insights into the gender dimension of changing nature of rural livelihood during economic transition, however, there may be more to learn from about these issues from China. 6 These have sub themes. For example, agriculture covers issues such as agriculture labor market, product market, innovation and technology, state services, impact of liberalization policies, also areas such as aquaculture, livestock etc (World Bank 2008). 10 Specific Challenges that Arise from Feminist Analysis Feminists have long pointed out that \u2018geography of gender\u2019 (Townsend and Momsen 1987) is vital for understanding the regional variations in patriarchies. A \u2018geography of gender\u2019 is a useful tool since it draws attention to kinship, marriage, inheritance systems and how these affect gendered access and gender division of labor in a particular context.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dc93299-42da-49a1-a8ba-9a44ae690eeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dc93299-42da-49a1-a8ba-9a44ae690eeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9a0789d59ccf42f84a9dead88ab117907bb72351bfc336a6e0c6e42ab5b9028"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c9609f6-e4c4-4de8-b685-44e81db0f456", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ee20a58019615190b3cf4326cb06232b344970cb16627ee93c068f4d8c4c271"}}, "hash": "9e3fa7f6229e7875a35b9668fd7d19ddca679b4137331af00acea64e710ef1b7", "text": "Feminist analysis of crop systems, inheritance patterns in a majority of the cases tend to be country/within country region-specific.

In recent years feminists have pointed out realities of poor women that have been researched focusing on women being able to earn and control their income/assets, and women\u2019s individualized welfare (Vera-Sanso 2009). These studies largely take marriage/household/community as institutions/sites where women experience subordination. While these interpretations are correct, analysis of livelihoods requires a focus on interdependencies and alliances that men and women form within marriages and beyond the household, particularly in contexts where state provision and regulation of markets are limited (Vera-Sanso 2009). Understanding livelihood choices of poor women, for whom security and subsistence are accessible through social networks, requires a focus on how women are affected by the structural factors and policies as women, and how they are affected by the opportunities or constraints that are experienced by the other members of the household. Developing Macro-Micro Link Studies on gender and rural livelihood mainly either focus on the macro level policy and institutions or the micro level (household level). In terms of livelihood issues, most studies focus on gender inequalities at the household level. The focus on public policy has been selective, especially, trade and capital flows have not always been subject to gender analysis (Chant and Pedwell 2008;). As a result, it is difficult to grasp and make regional (and sub-regional) changes. Problems of Attribution in Analyzing Policy Impact Analysis of policy impacts at a regional level is difficult to conduct. This is because many social processes influence why changes happen. It is difficult to establish counterfactuals, i.e., what type of changes would have happened if the policies were not implemented (Jackson and Rao 2004). For example, analyzing the impact of liberalization on the Asia-Pacific region is difficult. Many of the social processes were in place even before countries started to liberalize. The time-scale involved and the diversity of the region also create challenges in attributing changes to liberalization. Moreover, whether the changes have intensified because of liberalization is difficult to attribute since this requires clear counterfactuals. Lack of Gender Disaggregated Data Gender disaggregated data may not be available for all categories for each of the sub- regions in the Asia-Pacific. This makes comparison difficult. Women (and gender) feature heavily in certain areas such as micro-finance and there is an official 11 acknowledgement of feminized poverty and feminization of labor. However, gender disaggregated data on land ownership, remittances (it exists for some countries such as the Philippines, see discussion in Jolly and Reeves, 2003), and the impact of trade policies are difficult to find for each of these sub-regions. Moreover, different studies use different definitions, indicators and interpretations that make it difficult to draw conclusions. Methodological Challenges in Conducting Intra-household Analysis While there is increased data on women\u2019s condition, there is still a lack of data required for sophisticated analysis of the changes in gender relations within the household. Gender disaggregated data sets do not have information on the relational aspects of the members of the same household (Jackson and Rao 2004). Without the data on members of the same household and transfers that take place between them in redistributing costs or benefits of the material, social or policy changes, it is hard to analyze and identify the trajectories of change in gender relations (Chant and Pedwell 2008). 2. LINKING GENDER EQUALITY, SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT This section analyzes the literature on sustainable livelihood, employment, gender analysis of development projects and feminist and human development theory. The purpose of this categorization and linking of concepts is to explore: a) how gender inequality affects livelihood options and strategies chosen by women (and men); b) to what extent women (and men) are able to negotiate within the structural constraints. 2.1 Gender in the Existing Sustainable Livelihood Literature The existing literature on sustainable livelihoods (SL) has three main domains: a) agricultural perspective; b) environmental management perspective and c) coping strategies and food security perspective (Masika and Joekes 1996). Each of these domains has focused on gender issues in a specific manner. Very broadly, the literature on agriculture has focused on the role of women in agriculture, the impact of gender division of labor and the consequences of women\u2019s lesser control over assets, resources and income (World Bank et al. 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36e6e266-2f40-475a-ab5a-5f253114451b": {"__data__": {"id_": "36e6e266-2f40-475a-ab5a-5f253114451b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb902cf95f0375c60ffb6bedce1eff27b0c7d83e0effa413c010c7f892bdb3bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2d26809-99ad-45ff-96f0-7d82ac4e6f3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7e3dd1b9004eecf58223f55c1918240ec0f0bb2e6be5eac338e6e7faf54bab6"}}, "hash": "5a50ba6158d8b7c4e12dff50c5a67dba268bdefeae7f21c2b129ea20245b34bc", "text": "2008).

During the present decade, there has been a focus on how social institutions mediate women\u2019s access to and control over natural resources (Agarwal 2002; BRIDGE 2008). The coping strategies literature has mainly focused on the different coping strategies used by men and women during periods of crisis (Davis 1996). In recent years, there has been a shift in focus on linking how coping strategies, particularly migration affects household structure and the nature of the gender division of labor, etc. (Kabeer 2007). The evolution of SL literature into these three specific domains influences how gender analysis is brought into this body of literature. 12 The literature also illustrates that livelihood strategies include employment, but also incorporate informal sector employment, the use of common property resources, social networks, etc. This raises questions about how insights from the literature on gender dimensions of employment (defined as productive activity, including formal sector employment) can be linked with the three different domains of the SL literature. 2.2 Feminist Research on Livelihood Strategies It should be noted that feminist research on gender and rural livelihoods is extensive, however some of the areas are under researched. Feminist research covered here includes both academic policy research on: development process (see Goetz 1997), economic policies (Elson 1995); and social and anthropological research on households (see Kabeer 1994). Gender analysis of different development projects7 and institutions are also reviewed. Issues such as impact of macroeconomic policies and land reform are well-researched for certain regions such as Latin America (Elson 1995) or Africa (Jacobs 1998; Kawamara-Mishambi and Ovonji Odida 2003). Though the land ownership issues are researched for development programs and are area-specific, regional analysis by feminists remain limited in number for the Asia-Pacific (there are exceptions, see Agarwal 1994). Agricultural studies by feminists have highlighted women\u2019s unpaid work, the nature of household structure and labor usage patterns (see Kabeer 1994). Compared with the work on Latin America, there are fewer works on the impact of agricultural value chains and diversification for the Asia-Pacific region. However, there are country specific studies (see Jackson and Rao 2004). In terms of women\u2019s work, the majority of the literature on Asia-Pacific has explored the entry barriers and impact of women\u2019s involvement in export industries (Lim 1990; Kabeer 2000). etc. There is also a plethora of literature on micro-finance and self-help groups and how these affect women\u2019s empowerment (Rose 1992; Goetz and Gupta 1996; Schuler et al. 1996, Kabeer 1999). However, women\u2019s work in home-based production (other than micro-finance projects) is mainly country-specific and under researched compared to these other areas (Doane 2007). Gender issues in community resource management have been researched by feminists mostly from the following two perspectives: a) gender impact of state programs on forest management (Agarwal 2002), particularly on indigenous women or water resources management; b) women\u2019s movement against environmental degradation, for example, the literature on the Chipko movement. Notably, feminist literature takes different institutional sites\u2014household, markets, community, or the state, as their unit of analysis. For analyzing the complexities and synergies between gender inequality and livelihood, the gender asymmetries in access to, control over resources (both material and social) and participation in each of the 7 See Goetz (1997) for cases of institutional/ organizational review, Jackson and Rao (2004) for case studies of development projects in India; World Bank et al.(2008) for analysis of cases of various development projects and programs. 13 different institutional sites needs to be explored. This indicates that one needs to explore the following: a) how the gendered nature of these institutional sites (for example, gender bias within the households; biased community norms etc) creates gendered access to and control over resources (i.e., economic, social, human etc) and limits women\u2019s participation and voice; b) what is the gender differentiated impact on men and women\u2019s wellbeing resulting from gendered access and control over resources and limited participation of women in different institutional sites? and c) how bias in one institutional site reinforces gender bias in another institutional site (for example, gender bias in inheritance influences women\u2019s voice and participation in community power structures).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88852342-411b-46af-99e4-40ba93d3484e": {"__data__": {"id_": "88852342-411b-46af-99e4-40ba93d3484e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7c88d97777940b4c8cfffd192619b36f64896cd43e7c5c0f875497be6e1d8a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffde76d0-ff4c-4f44-995b-cc1b73ca9d56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f621e7ddbfbd5a8133a843c824c1f8a1d54ea96dc18efb7902dd562d42ee1fab"}}, "hash": "bee808f618222ec423f58cfaa02d1964885de10f3515b82b0a67b03ef00e5f51", "text": "2.3 Gendered Institutions and Rural Livelihood Livelihood strategies are influenced by \u2018access to and control over assets, access to markets, information and organization, effective management of vulnerability and the interaction of these policies at the global, national and local levels\u2019 (World Bank et al. 2008).

Some of these are marked by gendered access, control, participation and/or have a gender- differentiated impact. This is a useful framework for incorporating gender. However, this was developed to analyze gender issues in the agriculture sector. This needs to be modified if other relevant bodies of literature such as those on formal sector employment/labor markets need to be incorporated in this discussion. Moreover, while the literature on agriculture is extensive, the mitigating/adaptation/coping strategies that are undertaken by rural women and their impact may not all be covered by focusing only on seasonal agricultural migration. In addition, the impact of these coping strategies on the household structure and women\u2019s/men\u2019s agency at the intra-household level also need to be explored. This implies that analyzing how each institutional site is gender-biased and how this affects women\u2019s livelihood strategies provides a better entry point for understanding the gender dimensions of rural livelihoods. Figure 2.1 illustrates four different institutional sites: household, market, community and the state, and the nature of gender asymmetries at these sites. These asymmetries are based on gendered access, control over resources, gendered state policies and programs, unequal power and participation within the market and community, and the gendered pattern of risks. At the household level, men and women have different access to and control over land, monetary resources, own labor and labor of other household members. All of these influence the choice of work, the nature of engagement at the market and at community levels. Regarding access to markets, men and women have different access to agricultural finance, input and produce markets because of gendered social norms, control over assets, and knowledge about market operations. Their access to and participation in labor markets is also different given the role they play within the household, social norms on mobility, gender segregation of occupation, etc. This also implies the risks and vulnerabilities faced by men and women are also different. At the community level, the roles played by women and men in local community power structures or user rights/control over community resources, is different. Women\u2019s presence in agriculture, or natural resource policy 14 making or local governance structure is low. Moreover, the state policies can be gender-biased in delivering services to women. These indicate women\u2019s voice has less influence. However, poor rural men may have less influence in the political arena. Figure 2.1 Gendered Institutional Sites and Impact on Rural Women\u2019s Livelihood Source: Author. Gender asymmetries in all of these sites, ultimately lead to unequal livelihood options and gender-biased outcomes for men and women, not only in terms of wellbeing, but also unequal power relations and capabilities to voice their concerns. Figure 2.1 illustrates the gendered nature of these sites and their gender impact. In light of the preceding discussion, gender equality in livelihoods literature and feminist analysis is understood as: equality of access to resources, opportunity, engagement in different spheres and equality of outcome for men and women. Many of the gender analysis of development projects focus on structural constraints experienced by women, i.e, biased laws, custom, gender segregated markets, gender division of labor, etc. (Jackson 1997). However, feminist research since the late 1990s have also shifted towards an actor-oriented approach by exploring how women exercise agency and negotiate within these structural constraints (Jackson 1997). Feminist analysis of human development approaches may help in linking this gender analysis of sustainable livelihood to issues around choice and agency. 2.4 Linking Gender Analysis of Rural Livelihood to Human Development The gendered impact of livelihood strategies on human development has been interpreted in feminist literature, particularly those exploring the notion of women\u2019s Market Gender asymmetries in participation and power in land, labour, finance and product market; State Gender asymmetries in polices and programs(extension service, training, social protection); Community Gender asymmetries in participation and power in using and managing natural resources and Household Gender asymmetries in access to and control over land, finance, social and physical assets Gendered asymmetries in choice of livelihood strategies and outcomes 15 empowerment, in the following manner.

This literature mostly focuses on women\u2019s work or productive activity and empowerment. One of the key assumptions in feminist and development literature is that involvement in economic activity (productive activity) leads to women\u2019s empowerment (i.e., women\u2019s ability to exercise agency). However, feminist studies have brought in a nuanced reading of the relationship between women\u2019s empowerment and work/access to resources. They have shown that a positive relationship depends on the nature of the work (Masika and Joekes 1996) and how resource, choice and agency are combined (Kabeer 1999). Many of the feminist and development researchers have explored the impact of work on women\u2019s empowerment at the individual level, through analyzing changes in decision-making at the intra-household level. Agency in these studies is interpreted as the \u2018power to\u2019 dimension of power, such as the ability to do things, follow through with one\u2019s decision (Lukes 1974). However, the impact of women\u2019s work on collective empowerment of women remains under researched. This discussion illustrates that feminists and gender studies in researching livelihoods have explored: a) how individual women exercise agency; b) how agency is qualified and constrained by political, economic and social opportunities; and c) the impact of the gender-biased structure on women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) well-being. These structural and agency-related analyses are closely linked to the idea of human development. 2.5 Key Considerations In light of the discussion on various bodies of literature, this paper will take the following issues into consideration. Inter-sectionality A gender analysis of livelihoods needs to incorporate how gender asymmetry in access to and control over resources, and how participation in and power over resources, information networks, and markets affects men and women. It also needs to explore how this varies among women and men. Links Between the Different Institutional Sites How do gender asymmetries in one institutional site (such as the household) affect gender asymmetries in other institutional sites (market and states)? 16 Contradictory Nature of Changes in Gender Dimension of Rural Livelihood The changes in market demand, technology and environment have created new opportunities for women. In many cases, they have also adversely affected women. These changes in the different sectors can have contradictory effects on women\u2019s empowerment\u2014increasing their agency in one institutional site; while reducing their well-being in another. Moreover, the analysis needs to take into account how women are affected by the structural changes and policies as women, and how these changes may create opportunities for or constrain choices of the other members of their household. Reproductive Work and Double Burden Reproductive work refers to work done by women within the household that reproduces and sustains labor power of the household members. For rural women, this term refers to many different types of activities, such as fuel and water collection, caring for children and elderly, cooking, cleaning, food processing (such as husking), informal entrepreneurial work such as kitchen gardening, poultry raising, etc. (Annex 1). The latter categories indicate that the line between reproductive and productive work (that contributes towards an income) is blurred. All of these reproductive activities influence women\u2019s time and labor power. These indicate that there are trade-offs for the choices women make regarding livelihood strategies, and structural changes may (or may not) lead to changes in gender division of labor. 3. RURAL LIVELIHOOD AND GENDER IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC: THE BROAD STROKES This section discusses the key trends in rural livelihoods in the Asia-Pacific and the gender nature and implication of these trends.

The sub-regions, Middle East and South Asia and East Asia (excluding southern India and Sri Lanka) are classified as regions where a more restrictive form of patriarchy operates compared to Sub Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean regions (Kabeer 1994), whereas Southeast Asia and the Pacific are classified as less rigid or as loose forms of patriarchy (Kabeer, 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad6bca48-e699-4839-8597-6d30290924e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad6bca48-e699-4839-8597-6d30290924e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "24ee76c407a473029c4a21d13514c20e65c41a06aa1b5affbe80dd62b51cb112"}, "2": {"node_id": "9288adc6-c76f-4e05-86be-59a57ec88133", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f02764afd73c71f90a10583210b5c407d3a456701660b8fcff31381ed9565f14"}}, "hash": "24ab3321f4fe35e88a5dc082a7cda29c1da8220ecdde9f1f6242509b764b4ac7", "text": "8 As stated before this paper focuses on South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific region. 8 Rigid forms of patriarchies are patrilineal, patrilocal, with corporate forms of households where men control women\u2019s labor, sexuality, mobility.

Kabeer (2003) points out that women\u2019s participation in the larger/wider economy is influenced by two factors: a) the nature of the household (corporate or loose form); b) the nature of the public\u2013 private divide and restrictions on women\u2019s mobility. The types of households vary depending on land inheritance systems, marriage practices, economic activities and welfare outcomes. Households in the South Asia and East Asia are organised along the corporate line.9 These sub-regions have the following characteristics: patrilineality (descent and property traced through the male line); exogamous patrilocal marriage.10 Given households are organized along the corporate line, the ideology of male provider and female dependent persists in these sub-regions. Household income is pooled and men have control over female labor, sexuality and mobility. The public- private divide is strong. All of these points towards a condition where women have less access and control over family land and other resources. They have less social capital as they would relocate after marriage. Restriction on their mobility and sexuality and social norms of female dependency imply that extra-household relations (access to state services, formal markets, information and community resources) may be of limited nature. The Southeast Asian sub-region (and southern India and Sri Lanka) also have households that are organised along the corporate line. However, these countries also have the some or many of the following characteristics: matrilineal kinship systems, virilocal11 marriages, less restrictions on female mobility, children are equally related to both sides, income is pooled but women maybe largely responsible for managing the household budget. All of these indicate that women\u2019s access to and control over resources within the household, women\u2019s claim over family and common resources, women\u2019s ability to participate in and take decisions at the market, community and state levels vary from the other sub-regions. The nature of patriarchy that affects women\u2019s agency, options and choices is different. Table 3.1 categorizes the sub-regions according to the nature of patriarchy, kinship, inheritance and marriage systems and the resulting gender division of labor and access to both family and extra household resources. This provides a picture of the \u2018initial conditions\u2019 that influence women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to and control over resources and how they respond and negotiate structural changes. 9 The head of the household, usually a man, decides how resources and other members\u2019 particularly women\u2019s labor would be used, income spent, and women\u2019s relations with people outside the household conducted. Degree of corporateness varies depending on the degree of head\u2019s control. In loose forms other members are able to exchange their labor and have some control over particular resources. 10 Marrying outside the village and residing at the groom\u2019s village. 11 This type of marriage practices can happen in patriarchal society also. Couples reside separately. 18 Table 3.1 Classification of Different Sub Regions based on Geography of Gender Region Nature of Patriarchy Kinship and Marriage Systems Inheritance systems and Sex Segregation Gender division of labor, control over resources, livelihood options South Asia (North India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, except for South India and Sri Lanka) Rigid Form Descent and lineage through male line Patrilocal marriage, the woman relocates after marriage and lives with the man\u2019s family The conjugal unit plays a key role Inheritance through male line (however, bilateral inheritance systems also exist, where people inherit from both parents) Sex segregation exists and restrictions over female mobility Men control women\u2019s labor, mobility and sexuality.

Source: Author (Based on information collected from Kabeer 1994; Kabeer 2003; Therborn 2004) How does the sub-regional \u2018geography of gender\u2019 throw light on how women\u2019s empowerment and agency may vary within the household in these different sub-regions? Table 3.2 shows by sub-region the percentage of married women who have no say over matters concerning their own well-being and household expenditures (and by extension empowerment and gender equality at the family level). Table 3.2 Married Women Who have No Say Over Final Decisions Region Own health care Large purchase Visits to Relatives Daily purchase South Asia 54 52 47 46 East Asia and the Pacific* 7 18 9 7 Source: UNIFEM 2008, Note: * the countries include Southeast Asian countries 20 Marriage, in one form or another, remains universal in the Asia-Pacific region (Therborn 2004). The data in Table 3.2 shows that married women\u2019s decision-making power in East Asia (which includes the Southeast Asian countries) is very different from the other two regions. Less than 10 per cent of married women in the East Asian region reported having no decision-making power regarding their own mobility, health care and daily household expenditure. Interestingly, South Asia trails behind across all categories. Almost 50 per cent of married women reported having no decision-making power regarding their mobility, household expenditure or health care issues. This is perhaps a clear reflection of the nature of patriarchy (based on kinship, family and marriage systems) that operates in these sub-regions and influences women\u2019s access to and control over intra and extra household (social networks) resources and agency and ultimately their well-being. It also indicates how the map of Asia-Pacific may be divided into two halves regarding the nature of patriarchy. South Asia has rigid forms of patriarchies and Southeast Asia and the Pacific have a loose form of patriarchy (although there are sub-national and regional differences). These different forms of patriarchies are the \u2018initial conditions\u2019 within which new policies, programs and opportunities function. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s choices and the way they take up opportunities and how they negotiate different constraints are influenced by these \u2018initial conditions\u2019. This does not imply that structural constraints determine decisions and that people do not have agency. Instead, state decision- making bodies must consider these differences, as a program/policy aimed at increasing female mobility in a region where female mobility was never restricted may not have the same empowering impact compared to regions where women\u2019s extra household relations and interactions have been limited. This implies that policies and programs to promote gender equality in terms of rural livelihoods in these sub- regions need to take into account the nature of patriarchy that operates here. 3.2 Comparing Asia-Pacific and Its Sub-Regions The WDR (2008) categorizes most of the countries in, South Asia and East Asia as transforming economies, where agriculture is no longer the major source of economic growth.12 Most of these countries are experiencing a high level of urban-rural income disparity, a rise in non-farm activities, and an increase in internal or international migration. Countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam fall under this category. However, agriculture remains a key source of livelihood for 86 per cent of the rural population in these transforming economies. In addition, sub-national and geographical disparities exist within these transforming economies; for example, the state of Bihar in India remains agriculture-based.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33d1d1bf-45da-4898-96f1-89d8b52a962c": {"__data__": {"id_": "33d1d1bf-45da-4898-96f1-89d8b52a962c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61c330be9ef34141b90fa03829f1fef6eb24fa2d3fc49f2441a58951e02fa19d"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a83525c-27cb-4237-a20c-9829e2cd4fbe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/08", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "269fad3dae50a73d9683cbf26ae441f33bcf09625d5ca606ee3c3c4d653aa468"}}, "hash": "4fc8618cb156d49c8e5705197c944e204e9cd67a689a13a5e5ba887acd1199a6", "text": "There has been a decline in rural poverty in the East Asian and Pacific sub-region, but in South Asia it is quite high (World Bank 2008).

It is also different from the Sub Saharan Africa, where agriculture is the main source for economic growth.

In this context, a development approach that creates multiple pathways out of poverty is required. WDR (2008) argues that a shift towards high-value agriculture, decentralization of non-farm activities to rural areas, and assistance for people to move out of agriculture are useful strategies in these economies. However, for extremely poor rural men and women in these transforming economies, provision of social security and safety nets remain key areas (Agarwal 2009). According to the WDR (2008), rural households\u2019 livelihood strategies fall under the following four categories: a) farming-oriented households; b) labor-oriented households; c) migration-oriented households, and d) diversified households. It should be noted that all household may use these multiple strategies. The categories were developed based on the main source of income for the households. The WDR (2008) points out that although all of these strategies are complementary pathways out of poverty for rural households, for transforming economies key pathways are non- farm activities and remittances. Some of the countries in this region also have a high number of households that do not have a dominant livelihood strategy and are being complemented by other two strategies. About 20 per cent of the rural households in this region fall under this category.13 The higher proportion of this type of household may not necessarily indicate that these households have been successful in diversifying their income and graduating out of poverty, but that they face serious livelihood constraints. How women (and men) are able to gain from these strategies is dependent on whether the labor is used in high-skilled jobs (of which there are few in most of cases) or low- 13 WDR (2008) does not provide sub regional or gender disaggregated data for this category. 22 skilled jobs; and whether they are involved in work abroad that has high or low returns. Whether women (or men) enter high/low- skilled jobs or go abroad to work in high/low-return employment are determined by: a) personal endowment, b) assets the households have, c) social norms that place constraints on individual agency in the market/public arena, and d) how individuals bargain within the household. The effectiveness of policy in expanding rural livelihood options lies in analyzing these different pathways out of poverty and the gender impacts. Table 3.4 illustrates the different pathways out of poverty (successful livelihood strategies). Admittedly, not all market oriented producers or high-skilled labor are successful. Moreover, the current economic crisis has shown that market oriented producers, high-skilled workers (both at home and abroad) are vulnerable to economic shocks.

This indicates for rural poor women in South Asia, agriculture still remains a key source of livelihood. However, female land ownership in particular sub-regions is low; such as in South Asia, where about 3 to 10 per cent of the rural women own the land they cultivate (Kelkar and Nathan 2005). Women tend to work as contributing family workers (UNRISD 2005). This indicates fewer women are concentrated in the sector as market-oriented smallholders. However, women in certain countries, such as Thailand, have benefited from development of agro processing industries. This has made a particular impact in terms of increasing women\u2019s agency at the household level, as well as their engagement in the market. What should be noted is that this is not a general pattern. Regarding women employing labor-oriented strategies, ILO\u2019s (2008) analysis shows that more women are in vulnerable work (own account workers and contributing to 23 family workers)14 compared to men in all the sub-regions of Asia-Pacific (Table 3.5). South Asia has the largest percentage of women working as own account or contributing family workers, about eight out of 10 women workers are included in these categories. Generally, vulnerable forms of employment suggest informal work arrangements that lack social protection and where the pay is too low to generate savings. According to the ILO (2008), although the number of women working in vulnerable employment has dropped for every sub-region since 1997, it has been at a slower pace compared to men\u2019s involvement in vulnerable work. A larger proportion of female vulnerable workers can also be an indicator of the feminization of poverty. This may also indicate that women have more limited employment opportunities compared to men and that female concentration is in low-end and low-skilled jobs, thus preventing them from moving out of poverty. .

In fact, women represent half of the world\u2019s migrants (UNIFEM 2008). According to Jolly and Reeves (2003), female migration in South Asia is largely seasonal and occurs between rural areas. It is mostly the males who partake in rural-urban and international migration (UNRISD 2005). This does not mean that the rate of international migration of females is low. Many women migrate abroad but as wives or family members of male migrant workers (Jolly and Reeves 2003). Migration of the male members of the household creates de facto female- headed households. Depending on the patriarchal context, these households face different types of livelihood constraints in terms of accessing resources and mobility. Moreover, seasonal female migration for agricultural work limits women\u2019s livelihood opportunities to low-skilled/low paid work. While this may allow the family to subsist, it does not allow women to move out of poverty. However, in certain countries such as, Bangladesh and Viet Nam, female labor-dependent export industries have created opportunities for a large number of young women to migrate to urban areas. In some countries of the Asia-Pacific, such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka, women outnumber men in migrating to other countries (UNIFEM 2008). These patterns of migration have had mixed impacts on gender power relations within 14 Own account workers are self-employed workers with no employee working for them.

On the one hand, migration to urban areas or abroad in many cases have increased women\u2019s bargaining power within the household and increased their range of choices. On the other hand, sometimes women have experienced increased conflict at the household level and have experienced exploitative work conditions.

According to World Bank et al. (2008), more women compared to men work in the agricultural sector, though their roles are unrecognized. Many of the women may work as contributing family workers.. There is debate over whether countries such as India, or provinces within India such as Kerala, are experiencing a feminization of agriculture (Jackson and Rao 2004). In order to claim that agriculture is being feminized in the Asia-Pacific, the data must show that: a) there are more women than men in agriculture; and b) the number of women in agriculture is increasing compared to the number of men in agriculture. In East Asia and the Pacific, sub-region, a significant number of women, about 38 per cent, are self employed workers in the agricultural sector. The percentage of women as self-employed or agricultural workers is low in South Asia. However, for almost 65 per cent of women in South Asia, their economic activity is not reported. It is likely that many of them are contributing family workers, who are not paid and work for their families. Moreover, for all sub-regions, more men compared to women work in the non-agricultural sector. For South Asia, this gender gap in men and women\u2019s participation rate in non-farm activities is very high. Table 3.6 shows the percentage of men and women in different rural employment sectors and the types of activities for each of the sub-regions.

Why are there more men in non-agricultural employment? Why are women compared to men slow to move out of the agriculture sector in the Asia-Pacific? Is it because the agricultural sector is undergoing a feminization process or that a feminization of farm management is taking place? Or do women have fewer opportunities in the nonagricultural sector? Not many rural women in the Asia-Pacific (particularly in South Asia) own land (Agarwal 1994); and not many women are owners of agro processing farms producing high value agricultural product (World Bank et al. 2008). Women tend to be contributing family workers or casual agricultural labor. This indicates that women\u2019s presence in agriculture in the Asia-Pacific does not mean a shift towards female ownership of agricultural farms. World Bank et al. (2008) attributes feminization of agriculture to the following factors: a) male migration; b) growth of agricultural sector through expansion into areas such as horticulture, etc.; and c) casualization of agricultural work. Both male migration and casualization of agricultural work e may have mixed and potentially increased the adverse impact on women in the region. In rigid forms of patriarchal systems, such as in South Asia, the absence of male support makes it difficult for women to access agricultural input and produce markets, information and government services. Sometimes this has also led to internal family conflicts. In Pakistan, substantial male migration to West Asia has created opportunity for women to manage agriculture and non-domestic activities. This has led to a conflict between older male relatives and younger wives/daughters-in-law (Lefebvre 2001). The expansion of corporate farming, particularly in Southeast Asia, has led to an increase in females working as seasonal laborers in insecure, high risk, labor intensive and low paid jobs. A gender pay gap exists in these areas, and occupations are gender segregated, while the gender division of labor at home has not changed. The feminization of farm management for all the sub-regions remains negligible (ILO 2008).
